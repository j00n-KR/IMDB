0,Leofwine_draca,Effective spin-off,6,25 October 2020,"HOBBS & SHAW is the first spin-off from the FAST & FURIOUS franchise not to feature Vin Diesel, but it turns out you don't miss him at all. This is because the entire film consists of Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham engaging in verbal sparring and constant insults, some of which are pretty stupid, but many of which are witty. They certain sound good in the mouths of these two enthusiastic actors and they have a real camaraderie missing in many modern buddy-buddy comedies. Aside from these guys, you get a typically bombastic and unrealistic plotline involving Idris Elba's generic supervillain, a lot of globetrotting, and typically CGI enhanced vehicle chases. It's not remotely believable, but that doesn't really matter as this is all about OTT mayhem and humorous lines in between. Plenty of fight scenes add to the fun, although it's a shame about some of the performances, but generally this works.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
1,SnoopyStyle,fine until it's not,6,29 September 2019,"Hattie (Vanessa Kirby) is a part of an MI6 team on a mission to secure a deadly programmable virus. They are attacked by the superpowered villain Brixton (Idris Elba). Sole survivor Hattie manages to escape and takes the virus with her by injecting the capsules into her hand. She is framed for the massacre and the thief of the world ending virus. The CIA recruits two outside operatives to retrieve her and the scientist who designed the virus. It's Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Shaw (Jason Statham), and they don't like each other.I like the first half. It's a fun superhero Avengers movie. The Rock and Statham have charisma to burn. Vanessa Kirby is intriguing and Idris Elba is a great actor. It seems set to be a fun ninety minutes popcorn movie. Somewhere along the line, the movie loses momentum and goes into slow motion action mode for the worst. I know exactly the moment. It's the torture scene. Like Brixton says, these guys are never going to turn. The whole exercise is futile. If the villains kidnapped Hobbs' daughter and figured out that Hattie is Shaw's sister, turning them may get interesting. The writing is never that smart.As for being smart writing, I have an issue with the virus. The movie needs an opening scene where the MI6 team is introduced to virus. The virus needs exposition. Then I couldn't figure out why Hattie wouldn't simply cut off her hand and burn it. It kept nagging me for the rest of the movie. I know it's silly to nitpick this movie but it's annoying when an obvious solution is being ignored. Finally, two hours is way too long. Blowing up the evil base is plenty to close out the movie. It needs to end. This is not worth two hours. This movie is fine until it's not.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
2,Prismark10,Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,6,14 September 2021,"With every movie studio needing a franchise these days.Universal Pictures have expanded the Fast and Furious universe with Hobbs & Shaw.It's a bloated mismatched buddy movie.Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) are reluctantly put together by the CIA. The target is find a rogue agent called Hattie (Vanessa Kirby) who has stolen a virus.It turns out that Hattie is Deckard's sister and she was framed by a cybernetic enhanced baddie called Brixton (Idris Elba.)Brixton was once left for dead by Deckard. Now he is after Hattie. Deckard and Hobbs need to get the virus out of Hattie before it's too late and keep her safe from Brixton.This is James Bond meets Lethal Weapon meets Terminator. There are comic cameos from Kevin Hart and Ryan Reynolds.Hobbs and Shaw who started out as enemies in the Fast & Furious movies are now Frenemies. They bicker, argue and wind each other up.Director David Leitch made his name in action films and here provides a lot of stupidly preposterous action sequences. Some go on for too long and get even more absurd. One example is all the vehicles all locking on to each other to try and bring down Brixton's helicopter.The CGI is obvious in places but there is a lot of kinetic energy that pads out the flimsy story. Undemanding fun that goes on for too long.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
3,nogodnomasters,Move like Mick Jagger,10,3 August 2019,"Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) is forced to team up with Shaw (Jason Statham) to save the world for the fifth time. Hobb's sister (Vanessa Kirby) is MI6 and suspected of murder and stealing a deadly programmable virus. They must find her and go after the real bad guys which include Brixton (Idris Elba) who is now a cyborg, i.e. a ""Black Superman.""The film had its usual comedic banter. The helicopter scene was beyond Mythbusters. An enjoyable film with appearances by Helen Mirren, Kevin Hart, Ryan Reynolds, and Eddie Marsa. Hints at a sequel.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
4,kosmasp,What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?,8,21 October 2019,"That is a bit what the two stars are supposed to be. Though don't ask me who is who - if you insist I'd say Statham is the unstoppable force and Dwayne the immovable object. Which would make sense, since he is the Rock ... Ok kidding aside now, we know this unlikely team made waves in the last Fast and Furious movie andwas the best thing about it. At least the funniest thing about it.So if you liked that and you came for more of the same, you will be treated that way. And you should not expect anything other than just silly action and all that accompanies that. Idris Elba has quite the appearance early on, but cannot add to that after that. He is just a stepping stone - I'm being a bit unfair. He has quite a few moments. Still overall you might be a bit disappointed in his character - but an obvious continuation of Hobbs and Shaw might shed some light on that (who am I kidding it made enough money for them to continue with this)",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
5,classicsoncall,"""Well, who needs a drink?""",7,20 February 2020,"I never got myself motivated enough to catch a 'Fast and Furious' flick, but this film might put me in that direction. I like The Rock and Jason Statham, and even though they play off each other as adversaries in this story, they have an engaging chemistry that makes them likeable enough, especially with the wise guy banter between them. The story itself is one of those 'stop the villain before he destroys the world' capers, but it's made fun and entertaining with the non-stop action, crazy stunts and the super egos of both protagonists. I'm of a mind to consider a couple of the vehicle stunts in this picture as about the best I've ever seen, particularly the one in which Deckard Shaw (Statham) barely clears his car beneath a trailer with the villain Brixton (Idris Elba) following close behind on motorcycle. Not an inch of room to spare on that one. Then there's that impossibly mind blowing escapade with the four trucks chained to the helicopter careening along the edge of a cliff to set up the movie's finale. Impressive too are the performances of Vanessa Kirby as Shaw's sister Hattie, Ryan Reynolds, and a hilarious Kevin Hart as air marshal Dinkley. Don't put too much stock in the credibility of the story, that's not what you sign up for with a film like this. Just settle back and enjoy the ride.Say, wait a minute - Locke and Loeb?",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
6,Tweekums,'The Rock' and 'The Stath' make this a must see for action fans,9,4 July 2021,"This spin off from the main 'Fast & Furious' series sees characters Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw forced to work together when a deadly programmable virus is stolen in London. The virus has been acquired by Hattie Shaw, Deckard's sister, who injected it into herself to prevent cyber enhanced terrorist Brixton Lore getting his hands on it. The authorities believe she is the terrorist. If she is to be saved, and a deadly plague prevented Hobbs and Shaw will have to put their differences aside, find Hattie and extract the virus before it activates in her body. This will see then travelling from London to Russia to Ukraine and finally to Hobbs's home in Samoa; all the time Lore and his associates are close behind.I had a feeling this might be something special for action fans... having Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham makes a must see. They have a great chemistry as their characters insult each other and generally bicker and fight. Of course they also deliver in the numerous action sequences. Also impressing are Idris Elba, as Lore, and Vanessa Kirby, as Hattie... both hold their own in their action scenes. The action is nicely varied with fights, shoot-outs, vehicular chases and explosions. In the gaps in the action there are plenty of laughs to be had. If there is a weak point I thought things slowed down a little too much when they got to Samoa and we get slightly mawkish dialogue about the importance of family; this is a fairly minor quibble though. Overall I'd say this is a really good addition to the over the top action genre... definitely one to watch.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
7,BA_Harrison,What's next? Spaceships? A dragon?,5,18 August 2019,"Hobbs and Shaw (Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham) reluctantly join forces to try and find Shaw's sister Hattie (Vanessa Kirby), who is carrying a deadly virus in her bloodstream that will become active in 72 hours. Also trying to track down Hattie is technologically enhanced villain Brixton (Idris Elba), who intends to use the virus to cleanse the Earth of the weak.With every subsequent Fast & Furious movie, the franchise has steered further and further away from its street racing roots, becoming more and more like any other mega-budget action series: full of incredible stunts, massive explosions and hard-hitting fights. Spin-off Hobbs & Shaw sees the F&F universe enter science fiction and fantasy territory: sci-fi because of the futuristic technology involved (which includes a transformer style motorbike ridden by its cyborg villain), and fantasy because of the impossible nature of the stunts which defy all the laws of physics. Oh, and a Samoan mechanic has the know-how to fix a high-tech computerised gizmo, the likes of which he would never have seen before. Magic has got to be involved somewhere!The crazy action includes the following: a high speed chase through the streets of London during which both a car and the super-bike slide under not one but two moving trucks; an armoured buggy doing a 360 degree roll through the air, landing on the roof of a building; and an extremely silly finalé in which several vehicles are daisy-chained together to prevent a helicopter from escaping. It's cheesy over-the-top blockbuster nonsense designed to be as outrageously daft as possible, and might be reasonably fun, if it wasn't for the endless, supposedly comedic banter between its two stars, which results in a bloated runtime of well over two hours -- far too long for a film of this type.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
8,paul_haakonsen,"The best movie in the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise...",7,20 September 2019,"Initially I had some reluctance about sitting down to watch this 2019 addition to the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise. I mean, fast cars and ludicrous over-the-top racing is just not exactly my cup of tea. But still, the movie had Jason Statham, Dwayne Johnson and Idris Elba on the cast list, so of course I had to sit down and watch it.Turns out that as soon as they took out Vin Diesel from the equation, the movie was a whole other experience. This 2019 movie was actually the best movie in the entire franchise thus far.There is an abundance of action in the movie, to the point where it is outweighing the fast and shiny cars. And that was a definite plus in my book. I watch the movies for the action, not the vehicles. And as for the storyline, well this is a ""Fast & Furious"" movie, so plot, script and storyline is not going to be any work of Shakespearian caliber.The movie runs at just over two hours, which was a little bit on the heavy side, because it felt like you were sitting through a four hour movie. Don't get me wrong, because the movie is good and entertaining, but two hours of non-stop action and fighting gets a bit chewy to get through towards the end.The dialogue in the movie, while not being particularly groundbreaking, was actually a fun enough injection of nitro for the audience. I am sure that the banter and headbutting between Statham and Johnson might not be just everyone's cup of tea; but I sure enjoyed it.Now, the part of the storyline with an organization wanting to make people into cyborgs for a better New World Order seemed a bit far fetched and was actually cheesy. And having Brixton (played by Idris Elba) as an über cyborg was just hilarious in a campy and goofy way. While it wasn't realistic, it sure made for some good, wholesome action movie entertainment.The visual effects department really was productive and they brought the movie to life in a very pleasing manner. The entire movie was just visually great to sit through.""Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw"" is definitely a movie well worth investing 2 hours in watching. I am rating it seven out of ten stars.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
9,BandSAboutMovies,Great movie!,7,9 August 2020,"We did it! We made it through an entire week of Fast & Furious movies and let me tell you, we saved the best for last. This is a big, dumb, ridicuous and way too overblown action movie and I have to confess, I loved every single minute of it.It was directed by David Leitch, whose first time directing was John Wick. He's since made Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2. Before that, he appeared in some action films of his own, such as Ninja Assassin, The Mechanic remake and as Terry Bogard in the movie version of the video game The King of Fighters.Vanessa Kirby is the person who brings the action together. She plays Shaw's sister Hattie, an MI6 agent who has been infected with a Snowflake virus that a terrorist group known as Eteon wants. They are led by an unseen commander and his henchman Brixton Lore (Idris Elba), a cyborg that has a past history with Deckard (Jason Statham). And Deckard, well, he has to learn to work with Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson).If you look closely enough, Brixton has a Weyland Corporation symbol on his shoulder. So...will there be xenomorphs in the next film?That director was supposed to be played by Keanu Reeves. The voice is supposedly Ryan Reynolds, who also appears in this movie as CIA agent Victor Locke. The name in the credits is Champ Nightingale"", which Reynolds has used in a fake Amazon review for his Aviation American Gin.Beyond meeting more of Shaw's family, Hobbs goes back to his homeland and we discover his brothers Jonah (Cliff Curtis, Once Were Warriors) and Mateo (WWE star Roman Reigns, who Johnson considers a cousin). Jason Mamoa was also supposed to be in this, but Johnson has promised that it will happen in the next movie.Eiza González from Alita: Battle Angel and Baby Driver (as well as Satanico Pandemonium in the TV version of From Dusk to Dawn) is in this, too. She plays Madame M, a former associate of Shaw who helps them break into the terrorist's base.You know, for being in a G.I. Joe film, Johnson made a way better version of it with this movie. He loves this role, as you can tell, and even named his French bulldog - who shows up in he beginning - after his character.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
10,bevo-13678,Ok,10,31 March 2020,Only ok but it makes up for lack of plot by having kevin hart in it,Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
11,CinemaSerf,Hooray for the folically challenged.....,6,10 December 2019,"A good old fashioned end-to-end action movie. The script is irrelevant, it's about loads of pyrotechnics, special effects and not a lot else. Who cares? Idris Elba is clearly in his element as the baddie against the F&F equivalent of dumb and dumber - Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham - who are also having fun and it is contagious. It is way, way, too long, but there is certainly some charisma on the screen and where else will you still see a bow and arrow and an axe in a fight these days?",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
12,zardoz-13,Above-Average Spin-Off Epic,6,6 September 2019,"Villains make a movie memorable. If the villains are smart, you've got ""Die Hard."" If the villains are stupid, you've got a comedy. A stand-alone spinoff of the ""Fast & The Furious"" franchise, ""Hobbs & Shaw"" suffers from mediocre villains with too much money. These villains shoot themselves in the foot repeatedly from fade-in to fadeout. Basically, our heroes worry more about the ticking clock than these anemic adversaries. The sloppy villains spoil half of the fun in this white-knuckled, high-octane, adrenalin-fueled race against time to avert a global apocalypse. Brawny action icons Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and Jason Statham reunite as heroic co-stars in this exciting but implausible science fiction escapade. Johnson and Statham deliver adversarial charisma as they compete with Idris Elba in this overblown, 137-minute, PG-13 rated, demolition derby. Our heroes must thwart an evil United Kingdom corporation named Eteon from recovering its own bio-engineered super virus. Benignly codenamed 'Snowflake, the virus liquidifies your internal organs.
Surprisingly, apart from celebrating family unity, this souped-up apocalyptic outing shares little connection with the Vin Diesel franchise. Although Johnson and Statham reprise their roles from ""The Fate of the Furious"" (2017), you need not have seen ""Fate."" ""Atomic Blonde"" director David Leitch & ""47 Ronin"" writer Chris Morgan, with ""Iron Man 3"" scribe Drew Pearce have rehabilitated Statham's Shaw character. Polishing off his rough, abrasive edges makes Shaw more sympathetic. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson of ""Skyscraper"") and soldier of fortune Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham of ""Crank"") abhor each other. The C.I.A. dragoons them into an uneasy alliance. Meanwhile, Eteon's cybernetic super-soldier, Brixton Lore (Idris Elba of ""Pacific Rim""), tracks down the stolen CT-17 virus. Not only must Brixton contend with Hobbs and Shaw, but also Shaw's sister Hattie (Vanessa Kirby of ""Jupiter Ascending""), an intelligent, resourceful British MI6 field agent. Actually, as the leading lady, Hattie doesn't typify your traditional damsel-in-distress. Providentially, British MI6 had intercepted the Eteon plague before the villains could deploy it. After Brixton single-handedly eliminates her five-man unit, Hattie has no option but to embed the doomsday virus in her bloodstream! No sooner has Hattie stolen the virus than Hobbs' nabs her. While our quarrelsome trio struggle to evade Brixton, Hattie develops a fondness for Hobbs, much to Shaw's chagrin.""Hobbs & Shaw"" crosses genres from gravity-defying car stunts into sci-fi absurdity. Director David Leitch and his writers trot out many familiar tropes from earlier doomsday sagas, such as ""The Satan Bug"" (1965), ""The Cassandra Crossing"" (1976), and ""Shaker Run"" (1985). Even if these clichés lack appeal to you, Johnson and Statham have a field day amusing us with their endless verbal repartee. A wrestling match in every respect, ""Hobbs & Shaw"" has our hot-tempered heroes egging each other on with hilarious insults. Some will discover sooner than others that ""Hobbs & Shaw"" amounts to little more than a game of one-upmanship, with our heroes spending more time fighting against each other than their collective foes. Like any good wrestling match, ""Hobbs & Shaw"" builds to a crescendo, with a Samoan faceoff where our heroes regroup for the big finale. Estranged from his family for many years because of a criminal patriarch, Hobbs approaches his Samoan clan with contrition so he can enlist their aid. Armed with nothing more than a flip-flop, the grand Hobbs matriarch Sefina (Lori Pelenise Tuisano) rushes to Luke's defense when her huge family refuses to help him. Later, she is ecstatic when Hobbs introduces her to Sam (newcomer Eliana Sua), her nine-year old granddaughter.The chief flaw in ""Hobbs & Shaw"" is its error prone antagonists. The formidable and affluent Eteon Corporation with its huge army is reminiscent of billionaire owner Carlton Drake's corporation in ""Venom"" (2018). Like the Drake corporation, Eteon espouses a similar agenda: humanity must undergo augmentation. Although the man behind Eteon sounds every bit as ominous as Darth Vader, Leitch and his writers never reveal the dastard in the flesh, and this undercuts his omniscience. Instead, Brixton serves as Eteon's point man, and he commands legions of disposable black-clad henchmen. Brixton careens around on a bizarre motorcycle which resembles a Decepticon from a ""Transformers"" movie because it can alter itself physically. Sheathed in a bulletproof body suit, Brixton boasts electronically enhanced eyesight so he can duck each blow before Hobbs and Shaw can land them. A glimpse of his cybernetics when he submits to a painful upgrade is intriguing. Literally, the technicians have to split open Brixton's back to tinker his metallic spine. Egotistically, Brixton hails himself 'the future of mankind. After building up Brixton as an indestructible, Eteon treats him as expendable. Why wasn't Brix guarding the plague device in the first place?As in ""Deadpool,"" ""John Wick,"" and ""Atomic Blond,"" Leitch indulges his wizardry as a grand master of chaotic pyrotechnics. He stages dozens of wildly improbable stunts. One of the first has Brix miraculously weaving his shape-shifting smart-cycle beneath the churning wheels of two eighteen wheelers as they crisscross in front of him at a London intersection. Later, Brix crashes through a London double-decker bus and creates two gigantic holes in the vehicle. Naturally, Brix suffers nary a scratch, and no passengers were injured. Brix may remind you of the bungling Wily E. Coyote in the Roadrunner cartoons as he survives one calamity after another. Leitch saves the best stunt for the finale when Brix's helicopter winds up towing a string of cars along a winding cliffside road. Idris Elba makes a memorable villain. Motormouth Kevin Hart springs up in a cameo as a nosy sky marshal who wants a piece of the action. Luke's former partner Locke (Ryan Reynolds of ""Deadpool"") annoys him before and after the mission with his goofy antics. The scene following the end credits is sidesplitting stuff, especially Locke's B-positive gag. Happily, the incompetent villains in ""Hobbs & Shaw"" aren't big enough to overshadow Leitch's audacious stunts and the wattage of the Rock, Statham, and Idris Elba.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
13,view_and_review,SOBS,2,5 August 2019,"I knew that there was a good chance I wasn't going to like this movie. I didn't even watch the last 45 Fast and Furiouses because I'm not a fan of the franchise but, I saw Idris Elba and thought, ""maybe it'll be worth it this time."" And when I say worth it I don't mean an Academy Award winning movie, I simply mean I'll be adequately entertained.No. it wasn't worth it.There were plenty of explosions, fights, bullets, and death defying stunts--I take that back--physics defying stunts. And there were plenty of jump cuts to make the most impossible maneuvers seem possible. I only like that stuff with conditions.The most important condition is that it has to be within the realm of possibility or the movie has to be sci-fi/fantasy. The absurd stunts done by Idris Elba's character made sense. He was a technologically enhance human being. He was superhuman for all intents and purposes. The rest of the characters on the other hand--meaning Hobbs, Shaw, and Hattie (Veronica Kirby)--there was no reasonable explanation of how or why they could do the things they did.This movie is pure mind-numbing entertainment. This movie is more for the adrenalin junkie. There's non-stop action, a lot of muscles, a lot of machines, and even some cute girls. The few times the movie does pause for some character development or exposition it was so clumsy I thought that they better get back to the action because I can see the audience coming down from their high.Not to fear though because Hobbs and Shaw were there to give the audience another shot of drool-inducing action in the form of Harry Potter level magic stunts. You know when the heroes say that it's impossible to do something that they'll do it. It's standard protocol but they have to say that to prep the audience to be amazed. If the heroes said that the task at hand would be very difficult, well then, anyone can accomplish that. But impossible! Only them, the heroes, after they've convinced you they will die trying.It wasn't all bad though. Cameos by Ryan Reynolds and Kevin Hart added some real entertainment. So, even though it wasn't all bad it was mostly bad. The whole movie was SOBS (Standard Operating B.S.). There's no real fear the heroes would fail unless you've never seen a F&F movie before. Come on, they have to put out another 20 of these.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
14,neil-476,Great fun,9,14 August 2019,"A clandestine organisation is thwarted in its attempt to obtain a genetically programmable virus when a female MI6 operative escapes with it, at considerable risk to herself. Cybernetically enhanced superpsycho team leader Brixton slaughters her team, framing her for their murder. CIA muscleman Hoobs and renegade Brit operative Shaw are recruited by their respective sides and teamed to recover the virus despite their mutual antagonism.The chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham led to this movie, which looks like being the first episode in a franchise within a franchise. It has little to do with F&F other than that the two characters first met there, and the family theme is maintained. Instead, the two protagonists/mutual antagonists go off on a spy-type caper sent in London and Samoa, with a number of chases and set pieces (at least one of which is as implausible as anything in the F&F movies), lots of fights, and a suitably unbeatable baddie in Idris Elba's Brixton (I do wish he would stop saying ""wiv"" instead of ""with"", though).The best thing about this is, indeed, the chemistry between the two leads. The antagonism mixed with grudging respect and growing affection is very believable and the script, while not Shakespeare, is very enjoyable, with some funny zingers in it.Vanessa Kirby as the MI6 girl is likeable and combines vulnerability and bad-assedness well. Helen Mirren returns, and there are a couple more unbilled and uncredited cameos which are more than amusing.This is the sort of film which gives ""Popcorn movie"" a good name.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
15,morrison-dylan-fan,Shaw and Hobbs.,10,2 August 2019,"From The Rock Bottom done in Furious 7's opening,I've been hoping to see The Rock & The Stath team-up alone. Going to the IMAX at Manchester Printworks, (second biggest screen in Europe)I got set for Hobbs and Shaw's fast and furious team-up.View on the film:First in the franchise since Fast & Furious 2 ( 2003!) to not be solely written by Chris Morgan, co-writer Drew Pearce joins returning Morgan,and brings a new Sci-Fi element which neatly fits in, thanks to Brixton's superpowers (and bike) heightening the glorious frantic Action, spinning chase sequences where Brixton gets knocked down,but gets up again to drive through buses and under trucks. Packing Hobbs and Shaw with (intentionally) funny buddy cop-style snappy dialogue, the writers continue the F&F theme of ""family"" by going into their family history, leading to a sweet bonding of the duo,when Hobbs returns home.Bringing the neon lights which made their Atomic Blonde (2017-also reviewed) shine, director David Leitch reunites with cinematographer Jonathan Sela and brings a terrific gritty clarity to the hand to hand combat scenes, as Leitch holds the wide-shot to allow each fighting move to be cleanly seen,and then goes for the close-up when the knock-out punch is unleashed. Changing gears to drive the set-pieces home, Leitch fully embraces the utterly bonkers, from sky dives with no parachutes and a epic Hobbs's family V Brixton's henchmen, to a military chopper being pulled down with one chain.The newest members of the ""family"" Idris Elba (The Elba!) and Vanessa Kirby (The Kirby!) (along with fun cameos) give wonderful turns,with Elba giving Brixton a menacing snarl,and Kirby bringing a urgency to Hattie,which keeps the mission on edge. Building on their past chemistry, The Stath & The Rock give splendid performances as Hobbs and Shaw, thanks to The Rock's sarcastic put-downs and furious body slams, being a perfect match for The Stath's British slang gags and brutal take-downs, driving Hobbs and Shaw to a new mission.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
16,FlashCallahan,A champagne problem.....,8,20 August 2019,"This film is a divider, you're either going to love it, or you are just going to dismiss the fact that this film exists.Ever since the dawning of the F and F franchise, each film has become more ridiculous as the budget and the stars have got bigger. The first film was about stealing DVD players, and now we have a bad guy who is enhanced by technology, a kind of Robocop/Terminator with a little G.I Joe thrown in for good measure, and it just never lets up until the final one liner.Ever since Hobbs and Shaw first faced off, they have swapped smack talk and body blows as they've tried to take each other down.When cyber-genetically enhanced anarchist Brixton gains control of an insidious bio-threat that could alter humanity forever - and bests a brilliant and fearless rogue MI6 agent, who just happens to be Shaw's sister - these two enemies must partner up to bring down their seemingly invincible foe.If you were a fan of the buddy-cop sub genre that was rife in the eighties and nineties, then this has nostalgia written all over it. It resembles 1989's Tango and Cash more than any other film, as that film was purely tongue in cheek, never took itself seriously, and the stars were happy to send themselves up to get a laugh and to enhance the nonsensical narrative.Statham and Johnson are clearly having lots of fun making this, and the first and final act are clearly the best parts of the film. When the pair are doing their separate things, it falters in the second act, which is a shame, because Elba's 'bad guy' is a true cinematic villain, full of speeches, protuberance, and envy, all the makings of a brilliant antagonist.Add a couple of wonderful cameos, and Hobbs and Shaw is a fun action film that throws everything at the screen, hoping that something will stick, and most of it does.It's a shame that most of the tentpole set pieces were offloaded on the spolierific trailers, but that really doesn't matter, as the final confrontation is pretty visceral and inventive, and one wishes fro once that it maybe would have been enhanced by the medium of 3D.The film references The Rock, Escape from New York, G.I. Joe, The Terminator, and even Transformers in places, but it delivers exactly what you'd expect, a testosterone fuelled adventure that demands you take it with a big pinch of salt and just sit back and enjoy the ride.Lots of fun, and instantly forgettable.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
17,gradyharp,An escape from reality - or not...,7,26 May 2020,"Strange time for this Fast & Furious presentation, an action comedy with the 'enemy' being a virus meant to eradicate the world to prepare for evolution!!!! The theme may initially offend some viewers, but forget about the current pandemic for a couple of hours and ride this fast escape into wild entertainment.There is not a whole lot of plot - just a 'bad guy' (Idris Elba) touting a virus meant to alter the populace of the globe to prepare for further manifestations of his 're-invented' mechanical and indestructible self. The 'good guys' of the title are lawman Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and outcast Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) along with Shaw's duplicitous sister Hattie (Vanessa Kirby) and jailed mother Queenie (Helen Mirren) - and Hobb's daughter Sam (Eliana Sua). Along the way we meet mad scientist Professor Andreiko (Eddie Marsan), Eteon Director (Ryan Reynolds - at his best with quips and tongue in cheek dialogue), Air Marshall Dinkley (Kevin Hart) and a mass of Hobb's Samoan family.It's all a matter of fighting and explosions and derring-do, much of which seems in place to honor CGI artists, but it works - because it is at once silly, entertaining and - at this moment in time with COVID-19, poignant.

18,trashgang,nothing to do with F&F,7,1 October 2019,"So with the F&F in th etitle I was expecting something completely different. Okay, we all know that there are troubles between the actors of the F&F franchise but why o why do they have to use F&F in the title?Is it because they are using the names like in F&F? Whatever, it took me a while to get over it because no fast cars or whatsoever. What you get is in your face action. Top notch special effects and a not so believable story. Acting is what you can expect for such a macho flicks. Still after a while I was into it and liked it but naturally it's one of those flicks that once seen you will forget immediately. Pure action, not the Mission Impossible style or Bond style.Still I have some mixed feelings about it. And for the WWE geeks, Roman Reigns is in it too

19,siderite,The bastard child of F&F and The Expendables,7,25 October 2019,"You get the charismatic meat heads, you get the hot lady, you have the geeky scientist and the evil villain that fights against humanity. It's a team up thing, and it occasionally has cars, and there are a lot of punches and things hitting faces and some scenes with Deadpool in them and many red shirt StarTrek guys. It's fun, even when you know it's completely stupid, that physics doesn't work like that, that when you identify with the strong champions of humanity who protect the weak, the makers of the film identify you with the weak, and they are right. Mass media doesn't work like that, weapons don't work like that. Hell, women don't work like that. Viruses don't work like that.Bottom line: occasionally funny, lots of testosterone, no sense whatsoever, two hours long.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
20,thesar-2,Fast & Furious Firsts,8,15 January 2020,"This first Fast & Furious spin-off is the first Fast & Furious I loved, the first I'd consider watching a second time and first I want to buy.I had an absolute blast watching this action comedy. Now, it's not perfect, had way too many ""NO"" moments (more later) and it's absolutely not a Mission: Impossible/John Wick contender, but it is the very best Fast & Furious film out there. By a landslide.In a movie that knows what it is from the get-go, we're set on a mission from two fighting muscle men who must put aside their differences to save one of the action star's sister from a deadly virus meant to wipe out the ""weak"" members of society and ""restore order"" amongst humanity.I love the Rock. I love Jason Statham. And I love Idris Elba...in other movies (here, I just hated him as the bad guy.) But, I mostly loved Vanessa Kirby. She was the real star of this feature, despite the title ""heroes.""While she was fairly good in Mission: Impossible - Fallout, she was absolutely fantastic here and stole every scene. Funny. In a series that got me hooked again thanks to the always wonderful Charlize Theron, it took a little-known actress to get me re-energized in the franchise. I can't wait to see more of her.This movie had incredible action, so much comedy and a tad bit heart, I was onboard from minute one and I never let go. As stated, I do wish to buy and see this again after finally getting Fandango to work so I could rent it tonight.Now, for fans of the series this spawned from, you will have PLENTY moments of ""NO, NO, NO!"" in other words, crazy action/stunts that would never, ever happen in real life. I did see most of those and as much as I was having fun for 95% of the film, I kept saying: ""NO, NO, NO!"" throughout.Didn't stop me from enjoying the fun. I would HIGHLY recommend this movie and mercifully: You do NOT have to see ANY of the other mostly mediocre Fast & Furious films to enjoy this gem. Well done writers for that.***Final thoughts: Since I have NOT seen a single Fast & Furious movie twice, but I have seen them all, this list is gonna be from memory.

21,FeastMode,i don't understand the love,2,12 August 2019,"I am frustrated. Partly with how bad this movie turned out to be. But mostly with the reception. 7.0 IMDB, 89% RT audience rating. All of the following reviewers gave positive reviews: jeremy jahns, schmoes, austin burke, sean chandler, john campea. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. This movie was bad on so many levels. And for all of these reviewers to say, oh well you know what your getting into, this is the way this franchise is... are you serious? There is a limit. There is an extent to the disbelief we can suspend.Listen, i am normally the one who tells my friends, ""you are taking the movie too seriously. It may not be a 'good movie' but it's extremely entertaining, awesome and bad-ass."" i have said this multiple times about most of the fast & furious movies specifically. I am totally fine with not taking a movie seriously and enjoying it for what it is. And for reference, here are my fast & furious ratings.(1) original 8/10...
(2) 2 fast 7/10...
(3) tokyo drift 3/10...
(4) fast & furious 7/10...
(5) fast 5 - 8/10...
(6) fast & furious 6 - 8/10...
(7) furious 7 - 4/10...
(8) fate 8/10...i love this franchise. I'm okay with a little over the top. But people, that doesn't mean anything goes. That doesn't mean you can turn this into a cartoon. I always say the best action movies toe the line between improbable and impossible. To quote joey from friends, ""you're so far past the line that you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!"" lmao.For all these reviewers to basically forgive the vast amount of sheer stupidity in this movie is a slap in the face to the rest of this franchise. I can't believe not a single one of them called it out for what it is, a stain on this franchise.Are we reverting to 90s action movie absurdity? PLEASE DON'T. Almost every 90s action movie is straight trash. It was almost like it wanted to be one of those, throw realism out the window and let's go insane movies, like Shoot Em Up (which i love). But this cinematic universe has already been set up. None of the previous movies fit in that ""insane"" category.This is similar to what happened to me with furious 7. I was really disappointed while everyone else loved it. But it's SIGNIFICANTLY better than this movie. And while i thought it crossed the believability threshold, this movie nuked the threshold. For the first time in the franchise, a movie can and should be labelled in the sci-fi or superhero genre.To the movie itself. I enjoyed the four leads very much. Continued chemistry between hobbs and shaw. Idris elba is always awesome. And vanessa kirby severely outperformed the material given to her. The cameos were great. There were lots of funny parts. But there were also lots of failed attempts at humor.This movie is FILLED with dumbness. I can make fun of so many things specifically, but this would turn into a full blown essay. Other than the action being absurd and cartoonish, most of it wasn't even good. There aren't any memorable action scenes. Most of it was hard to follow. Choppy with lots of quick cuts. The story was nothing. The editing was questionable. And something i never normally noticed, but the scene transitions just felt off. This is not a well-put-together movie.Example of why this movie is poorly made. I am always able to have a general feel of where i am in a movie, ie. Middle act, climax, conclusion, etc. I went into this movie knowing the runtime. And yet during a major action sequence in the middle of the movie, i was almost certain it was the climax, the movie was almost over, and the calmer scene following is the wrap-up scene. I was shocked when i realized the wrap-up scene turned out to be the beginning of the third act. The movie was nowhere near finished (45 minutes remaining). I don't know what they did wrong, but they did something wrong. I really can't believe that happened. Then we get a really long character building scene out of the blue. Followed by more absurdityi hated the entire third act. They tried to force-feed us some heart after 2 heartless acts. I was cringing or shaking my head throughout. The best part is when, in the middle of a life-threatening, nay, world-threatening situation, hobbs decides to put a shirt on.EDIT: i'm a sucker for watching series i love in order. Before F9 i watched the entire franchise including the ones i didn't like. I bumped tokyo drift from 2 stars to 3 and furious 7 from 3 stars to 4. With both i felt like they were slightly less bad than i remembered.I got to hobbs and shaw. Man i really hate this movie a lot. I knew it was bad but i feel like i was being too nice the first time. There are still a few things i like (mentioned above), but this movie is so awful. I dropped it from a 3 to a 2. Yes, that means i think it's worse than tokyo drift.Everything looks and feels fake. Most of the action is crap. Why are we watching superheroes? Why does a really great car mechanic know how to fix state-of-the-art never-before-seen biological equipment? This movie angers me. I really hope F9 follows the world created before this garbage. (2 viewings, 6/23/2021)",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
22,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Jumps the shark but sticks the landing.,6,5 August 2019,"'Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw (2019)' is not just an isolated spin-off but an attempt to set up an entire side-car series to the ever-escalating, far-from-its-street-racing-roots 'Fast & Furious' franchise. By drifting, essentially, as far as possible from the core tenants of that franchise while still staying on the same, increasingly-broad track, this action-thriller manages to feel somewhat unique despite being broadly generic. We've seen it all before but there's just something strangely captivating about it this time. It's probably the chemistry between its two eponymous leads, the strength of which in previous movies is what prompted the piece to get green-lit in the first place. 'The Rock' and 'The Stath' are both as knowingly ostentatious and oddly compelling as they've ever been, saddled with a story that doesn't quite know what to do with them - other than have them measure 'assets', that is. Their biting banter is initially rather enjoyable but its consistency ultimately causes it to wear rather thin. Still, as leads go, you could do much worse. They hold their own in the action scenes (which are often too shaky for their own good) and they chew the scenery for all it's worth, appearing to have an absolute blast while they do so. It helps that they're surrounded by some other A-class actors, including Idris Elba and Vanessa Kirby, who all know exactly what kind of film they're trying to make. It's silly, slightly pulpy and actually quite fun. It does have a number of plot issues, including a strained pacing and slightly excessive length, that cause a retrospective dampening, though. The characters don't really change until they suddenly do, there's a forced 'man v machines' message awkwardly stuffed into - or, I suppose, articulated in - the third act and, in general, the actual mechanics of the narrative don't always work as smoothly as you'd like. Plus, all of the denouement is done during the end-credits, which makes the story's technically satisfying end seem like an unfulfilling whimper. Despite its issues, however, the picture is undeniably enjoyable. It's better in the moment than in retrospect and, obviously, it isn't a masterpiece, but it's much better than you'd probably expect. 6/10",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
23,bowmanblue,So much macho fun,8,25 January 2021,"I was never much of a fan of the 'Fast and Furious' franchise (apologies!) - somehow they all just merged into one, long overblown car chase. However, luckily I've always been a fan of both Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and Jason Statham, so I was more than happy to give the 'spin-off' film a go. I heard the film-makers point out that this will have a 'different feel' compared to the usual racing-orientated movies that have gone before and - luckily for me - they were right.What you have here is an action movie that feels like it would be more at home in the eighties or nineties when action films were completely overblown and deliberately over-the-top. Post 2000 the genre decided to take a more 'serious' approach and go for 'realism.' That's okay - the last twenty years or so have also produced decent (serious) action flicks, but if - like me - you grew up on muscle men killing hundreds of foot soldiers, armed with only their biceps and a witty quip, then I think you'll like this.It's silly and it never tries to be anything other than good fun. The Rock and The Stath have perfect comic timing and the banter between them is a joy to behold. Idris Elba is given the duties of being the villain and does brilliantly with the - slightly corny - dialogue he's been given and proves he can be up there with the best of the Bond villains from yesteryear. Plus there are also some very famous faces among the cast list who you might not expect to see pop up here and there - I won't spoil it.Of course there's plenty of ridiculous stunts and action. Plus people can take seemingly infinite amounts of punishment and barely get a bruise. You need to totally suspend your disbelief if you want to enjoy this for everything that it deserves to be. I had great fun with it, but - in my opinion - the only thing that really stopped it being an absolute classic was its length. It's well over two hours and at one point about three quarters of the way through the film (when they arrive on Samoa) there is about twenty minutes or so that really seems to drag. Maybe it's been because what's come before was so fast-paced, but it really could have been left on the cutting room floor.I'm glad they still make cheesy action movies like this today. It's part (old) Bond, part Fast and Furious and part Expendables. All in all, it's just a great film to put your mind of hold and just say, ""Yeah, whatever,"" to with a smile as one person drives a motorcycle up a wall... or something. Bring on Hobbs and Shaw's next madcap outing.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
24,ThomasDrufke,From Stealing VCR's to Fighting Supervillains,8,15 August 2019,"I love being surprised when I go to see a movie, but I also don't mind getting exactly what I expected when I bought my ticket. With Hobbs and Shaw, I don't think anyone would be shocked to hear that the movie is essentially non-stop action with a ridiculous plot and many, many, many cheesy (but quite funny) one-liners. Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw return from previous Fast and Furious movies in which they have consistently hated each other, to fight a common foe. This foe being the one and only Idris Elba, playing Brixton. I had a blast watching the 3 of these A-list action stars exchange blows, even if they are all pretty much superheroes at this point, and the consequences are slim to none. If your a fan of the F&F films at all, I would bet you'll have a good time with this one. Also, Vanessa Kirby is an absolute star in the making. And those cameos? Incredible.Isn't it hard to believe this series has successfully gone from stealing VCR's to fighting supervillains?8.1/10",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
25,MLDinTN,a let down for the franchise,5,22 March 2020,"I feel like this movie is a let down for the Fast and Furious franchise. The story is so basic. Keep bad guys from getting a pathogen that liquifies your insides. The biggest problem is all the jokes between Hobbs and Shaw fall flat. It's just not funny. And of course all the stunts are just crazy and not realistic. What about the truck, helicopter tug of war at the end. Just ridiculous and then none of the main characters die when the copter crashes. Best part is when the bad guy is chasing them on a motorcycle. Lots of crazy things with sliding under trucks, crazy jumps.FINAL VERDICT: Skip it, you won't miss a thing.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
26,ericstevenson,I could enjoy this,8,7 August 2019,"This movie features Hobbs and Shaw teaming up (hence the title) to stop a virus from infecting the world. A spy named Hattie has literally injected it into herself so an evil organization named Etreon tracks her down to get it. I like how straightforward the story is. Then again, I still couldn't remember most of the characters' names. Guess whose names I could remember? I am very impressed at how movie spinoffs have come so far.I admit I didn't care for the romance between Hobbs and Hattie. This agent named Brexton who is some kind of cyborg. I admit that it does seem like they're running out of ideas and are just trying to cash in on the superhero craze that's been going on lately. Still, we really do get great pacing and very creative fight scenes, especially the end. Sure, they're not as good action characters as the Avengers, but they still have enough quirks to be well developed characters. Dwayne Johnson/The Rock simply HAS to be the most prolific actor who was also a professional wrestler. ***",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

1. The McLaren 720S (I guess they had three to work with & were not allowed to put the smallest of a scratch on two of them).
2. The CGI: e.g. the morphing cycles; the customary vehicle slides under semi's & building jumps - never gets old.
3. In credits & post credits additional scenes on DVD.Oddities:
1. The McLaren 720S gets hit by everything under the Sun & when the action is over it looks like it was still in the showroom - not even dust, let alone damage.
2. The MI6 (or whatever) female leader looked makeup cosmetics perfect for her clandestine mission.
3. Many more disabled than killed goes against the norm for this genre.Dislikes:
1. Guys selling their bods w/super tight 'n' small t's.

31,tabuno,A Less Than Stellar Action Thriller,7,7 August 2019,"This action thriller starring two of the bona fide action stars, Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham starts out smart and deliciously edgy. Yet it eventually descends into a predictable, repetitive, mindless endeavor of special effects and R-rated Disney adventure rides on the big screen. Yes, the scriptwriters attempted the emotional, relational connections to try to give the movie more substance, but in the end, Hobbs & Shaw became boring in places and stale in some of its more and more staged productions. This Predator (1987) meets a less intelligent version of The Hitman's Bodyguard (2017) which had Ryan Reynold's snappy performance underused in this Fast & Furious spin-off. While the stunts were amazing, they have come of the point of being overly staged, trying to outdo all the past action movies. The scriptwriters have also pressed the envelope of logical, reasonable believability with holes developing in the plot development, such how the female lead can so easily and conveniently escape in the opening scene. A decent, but not totally convincing nor engrossing action movie.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
32,The-Sarkologist,More Fast & Furious Maddness,4,5 August 2019,"Honestly, I am inclined to suggest that this film was pretty bad, but then again I guess the whole idea is to basically have another excuse for lots of explosions, lots of machine gun battles, and of course more Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham. The other thing is that it is a Fast & Furious movie, so honestly, we really can't expect all that much from it, even if Idris Elba's introduction consisted of the line 'Hi, I'm the bad guy' - surely they could have had better script writers than that, but once again, it is a Fast & Furious movie.I'm not entirely sure why they decided to have a spin off, though it could have had something to do with a rumoured fall about between a couple of the main actors. The other thing is that there are so many names in the main franchise now that it it literally getting ridiculous - honestly, it really feels like everybody is basically stepping on everybody elses' toes. So, what better way to deal with it by simply pulling a couple of the big name stars, and throwing them into a movie of their own - particularly since that they aren't necessarily from the originals.Mind you, the Fast and Furious franchise has changed ridculously since the first couple of films, but then again, that is probably a good thing. Going from an under cover cop trying to bust a gang in cars hijacking trucks to being chased across an iceshelf by a submarine certainly shows how the film has evolved, and that is probably a good thing.So, what can you expect from this? Well, you can pretty much expect to get from this film what you basically got from the others - or at least the ones at the later stage of the franchise. Yeah, more science fiction elements, and an awful lot of action. The other thing is we also get a bit more of an option to look into the back stories of both Hobbs & Shaw. The interesting though though is that I do find it quite amusing that they'll have one character as a bad guy, and then he'll return in the next lot as the good guy. Mind you, there has been suggestions, in the film at least, that there will be a sequal.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

36,cruise01,An awesome spin off in the Fast franchise that delivers one wild action packed ride.,10,3 August 2019,"Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw (5 out of 5 stars).Hobbs and Shaw is an awesome spin off to the Fast and Furious franchise. Focusing on the two fun characters Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Shaw (Jason Statham) in an all testosterone action packed movie that defines a big and loud blockbuster summer movie. Also a movie that does not take itself seriously. Like you can tell with the recent Fast movies were the action is through the roof insane and a lot of fun.The plot puts Hobbs and Shaw back together on a mission to find Shaw's estranged sister Hattie (Vanessa Kirby) who stole a virus from a cyber genetic rogue soldier Brixton (Idris Elba). After they rescued Hattie, they are on the run away from this super soldier who will stop at nothing to get that virus. The plot does get a little over the top with the concept idea of a genetic enhanced villain. Who is nearly bulletproof, can operate any computerized device through his head, and unstoppable. The concept can be a little sci-fi with the ideas. But it sure as well is a lot of fun. The opening scene that begins with action with Hattie stealing the virus and escaping from Brixton. Really sets the film at a fast pace and adrenaline pumping for the next two hours of the movie.The action sequences are over the top insane, exciting, and epic. All you can ask for in a mindless summer blockbuster film. Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham fighting against a villain that might as well be in a terminator movie. Thrilling car chases in London and Brixton in his modified motorcycle. Another epic showdown in a plant which has the trio heroes escaping from the explosion. And an epic chase and fight sequence in Samoa with the characters forming a train with trucks to bring down a helicopter.The cast is great. Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are a lot of fun. It was never a dull moment with the characters. They bicker throughout on who is the toughest and ugliest. The story always stays true and focus to the core of the characters with a theme about brotherhood and family. Vanessa Kirby is also one of the bada** characters in there as well. She steals the show and gets involved in the action as well. Idris Elba is great as the unstoppable villain. There are more fun surprises throughout the movie with a couple of cameos from other famous actors which I think is best to watch for yourself. Cause it was a lot of fun seeing these actors show in a small cameo roles. Which is funny as they appeared throughout. Also, stay in the mid credits with a scene that is awesome and funny.Director David Leitch delivered an action packed, loud, and fun blockbuster film. He can handle delivering big action set pieces and make an exciting movie. It has plenty of action, some drama focusing on the theme of family, a bit of a sci-fi concept, and fun humor throughout. This spin off delivers with the Fast franchise and I really hope to see more sequels with Hobbs and Shaw. Which can have its own franchise with these characters saving the world and delivering all out action. Can be its own Mission Impossible or James Bond series.
Overall, Hobbs and Shaw is awesome and one of the best action films. I loved every minute of it. The humor, the cast, a fast paced action packed direction, and is a great fun addition to the franchise.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
37,leonblackwood,Awful humour and the action was way over the top! 3/10,3,18 February 2020,"Review:
I really didn't find watching 2 grown men bickering, whilst trying to save the world from a virus, entertaining. On top of that, the script was awful and the action was WAY too over the top. The acting was also a big let-down, and it seemed like Jason Statham didn't know if he was English or American half of the time. The music throughout the film made it feel cheap, and the so-called wit in the script was terrible. I liked the scenes in Samoa until the ridiculous car chase took place, and the whole ""Robotic"" Idris Elba (Brixton) concept, was just too weird. With such a massive budget, and a great cast, including the cameo's, I personally think that they made a right mess of this film, even though it made a decent profit at the box office. I don't know if the director was trying to make the most unrealistic film ever made, or if he was just being flash by coming up with the most outrageous stunts, but I really was disappointed with the outcome. I enjoyed the banter between Hobbs and Shaw in the previous Fast & Furious movies, but I just wanted them to shut-up in this film. Ryan Reynolds was a good touch, and Kevin Hart made me laugh, but I can't see myself watching it again in a hurry. On the plus side, I did like Brixton's motorbike, and Hattie (Vanessa Kirby), who was Statham's sister, put in a decent performance, but it was Helen Mirren (Queenie) who really stood out from the rest. I know that there is going to be a lot of people who disagree with this review, but I just find it hard to say anything positive about this film. I usually enjoy Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham movies, basically because they are what they say on the tin, but this film was a total waste of time and money in my eyes. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by David Leitch, who also brought you John Wick, Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2, which wasn't as good as the first movie. This is yet another movie that makes me wonder if they actually watch these films all the way through before releasing it. I just hope that the next movie in the Fast & Furious franchise is taken more seriously, without all of the silly humour, and some decent action.Budget: $200million

38,TheMovieDiorama,Hobbs & Shaw attempt to drive down the spin-off route but rarely becoming fast nor furious.,4,8 August 2019,"Hobnobs & Shoreditch. Hobo & Shawarma. How About Stop Milking A Franchise & Sir, I'm Milking This Cow Til It's Completely Drained. Whatever the heck this spin-off wants to be called (the several title iterations are ludicrous in itself), it's exhausting the furious fuel that has made the 'Fast' franchise the rejuvenated family-orientated soap opera that it is today. Obnoxiously loud bombastic action set pieces embedded in a derived plot that beeps out generic honks every chance it gets. Not exactly the result Mr. Juggernaut Johnson had in mind, let's be honest. Returning characters Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw must put aside their animosity and work together in order to prevent a terrorist organisation from releasing a deadly virus.Sounds generic, right? That's because it damn well is. So much focus was put into managing the levels of testosterone, the chemistry of its leads and the unbelievability of the stunts, that seemingly an engaging plot was bottom of Leitch's agenda. Very reminiscent to the disappointing 'Deadpool 2', evidently. However, this feature is less ""Doom & Gloom"" and more ""Meh & Snowflake-y"".The charisma brimming from the mountainous Johnson, suave Statham and absolute beautiful Kirby (who is substantially the best character, performer and badass of the three) grants the film some cohesion. The banter, dumbed-down quips and dynamics between them all, assisted in alleviating any fundamental downtime. After all, it's over two hours long. Yet despite Morgan's earnest attempt in progressing these flourishing characters, it doesn't quite work. The core of Hobbs & Shaw, is not necessarily family (although the forced Samoan third act would argue otherwise), but teamwork. Why is it then, that these two behemoths rarely exhume any natural progression of their characters, completely missing the point of working as a team? At no point within the first two hours, do these two unlikely allies work as a team. It's only until the climactic stormy encounter with the ""bad guy"" that they actually think to themselves ""wait a minute, if we work together we might actually save the world!"". Hobbs does his own thing, Shaw expressively combats everyone (thanks to Statham's commitment to the choreography) and the plot amalgamated the two disguising it as teamwork. More artificial that Brixton's enhancements.Speaking of, Elba graced us with his presence as the antagonist. Now, in terms of 'Fast' villains, he is definitely one of the more memorable. Mostly due to a credible actor being involved, but whatever. A formidable, omnipotent, self-righteous terrorist with more cybernetic enhancements than Johnson's ability to keep hold of a military chopper with a chain (more on that in a moment). Unfortunately though, as expected, Brixton is one-dimensional and is nothing more than a ridiculously overpowered machine whose weakness is teamwork? Jeez. More cameos than a talk show, particularly a CIA agent and an Air Marshal who quite possibly are the two most annoying actors working today.However, let's talk about the real reason why you would ever want to put yourself through this spin-off. The action. Let's see here...ah yes! A bulletproof villain with a malleable motorcycle that fully transforms Elba into a CGI mess? Sure, why not. Hobbs pummelling down from a skyscraper (heh heh), hooking onto an enemy, landing and crushing a vehicle yet walking away without a scratch? I mean, I guess I'll go with it. Shaw driving through an exploding inferno, landing on top of a moving vehicle and then narrowly avoiding a falling chimney? Probably more realistic than the previous scene. Hobbs and his family of Moana, I mean, Samoans attaching a line of cars together to prevent a helicopter from taking off, as he then holds the chopper in place by holding onto a chain with nothing but his bulging muscles? Whoa, time out. No way. There has to be some leniency on the action, particularly when the film knows its dumb fun, but some realism is required to actually make these situations engaging. There's none of that. Just obnoxiously loud, horrifically edited and woefully lit set pieces that try to outdo each other. Oh, and the film ends. Like that. No family barbecue whilst Wiz Khalifa starts playing. No monologue about family. It just ends. Who was the Eteon Director? Guess we'll find out during the inevitable sequel. Lucky us.For everything Hobbs & Shaw executed correctly, it is then plagued by mediocre filmmaking content that pollutes the majority of modern blockbusters. Polygonal CGI monstrosities shrouded in noticeable green screen backdrops with direction that focuses on bombastic style over cohesive substance. Not the worst of the franchise, but forgettable in every sense.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
39,Ed-Shullivan,Non stop macho banter and CGI action that gets really boring FAST & I'M FURIOUS,3,20 April 2020,"Not for me folks. I am done with any further sequels of the Fast and Furious film franchise. Universal Pictures probably utilizes a formulaic REQUIRED CRITERIA check box system that goes something like this:1. Big draw actor - CHECK
2. Include British actors - CHECK
3. Include lots of (boring) high definition CGI action sequences - CHECK
4. Include broad and (misleading) expensive advertising campaign - CHECK
5. Include great story line, plot, and great ending - MISSED THIS ONEOh well, I guess Universal Pictures figures including 4 out of 5 of the REQUIRED CRITERIA is good enough and who cares if the film bombs as long as people pay to watch it.Disappointing? - CHECKI give it a 3 out of 10 rating",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
40,pmtelefon,Loud and boring,4,8 February 2020,"""Hobbs & Shaw"" is the first movie that I watched from The Fast & Furious franchise. It is also going to be the last. ""Hobbs & Shaw"" is filled with uninteresting characters and ridiculous action. I didn't care about one thing that was going on. This movie actually manages to take three very appealing actors (Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham and Idris Elba) and make them boring. This movie is also way too long. ""Hobbs & Shaw"" added up to a wasted night.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
41,SAMTHEBESTEST,A NON STOP BLOCKBUSTER ACTION MANIA !,7,3 August 2019,"HOBBS & SHAW REVIEW :-
Fast & Furious series has gathered some attention in this decade with upgradation in Action, stunts and Characters. An obvious question was, will a spin off film Hobbs & Shaw live upto the raised bar of the series? If i had to answer before then i might have had doubts but now as i have finished watching the Film i can say, this one surpassed all the expectations by far. Hobbs & Shaw just doesn't live upto the franchise but also raises the bar despite being a Spin off film with less characters. It's truly a Blockbuster Action Mania for all Fast & Furious fans across the globe.Hobbs & Shaw has 4 Main Characters of Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs, Jason Statham as Shaw, Venessa Kirby as Hattie Shaw and the Villain Idris Elba as Lore. The film revolves around a Virus which can harm the entire population of the world and as expected our heroes Hobbs & Shaw comes together to save the world. The charisma of these characters takes charge from the start and never ends till we leave the auditorium. Idris as Villain Lore is Powerful which i felt was one of the major USP in the film. Screenplay is tight, engaging for 120 minutes and never makes you feel bore for a moment. The same is supported by Mind-blowing Action sequences, Car Blasts, Explosion, Breathtaking Stunts and Spectacular VFX. These all factors has made Hobbs & Shaw a Brilliant Visual Phenomena that deserves to be experienced in 3D.What i like the most about the film is, It does not have any repeatative theme or sequences which we saw in all films of Furious franchise earlier. It has it's new gorgeous set of Action, Characters, Entertainment, face offs and believe me the New Car Stunts are totally eye pleasing. Director David Leitch has done an excellent job by taking only few characters for the Spin Off yet delivering an Amazing Theatrical experience. If you feel bore of regular Furious films after long period then i must say this New Franchise seems more interesting and definitely has more scope in future. Overall, Hobbs & Shaw is a Non Stop Blockbuster Action Mania and you can't really afford to miss it. Go and Scream out loudly for the New Superhit Pair ""Hobbs & Shaw"".RATING- 7/10*",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
42,matthewssilverhammer,I Actually Miss Vin Diesel...,4,9 August 2019,"The Fast franchise has dropped every pretense of self-seriousness and reality (I realize that's a stretch, but they never dealt with man-machine hybrids before) to bring us Hobbs & Shaw. Following the likes of Marvel, they're clearly trying to expand their universe, and wallets, by largely shedding their trademark automobile action to give us an entry only interested in quipping and looking cool, but failing on both. Where John Wick actually does awesome things, these guys just stand around, unconvincingly bragging about being awesome. It's an ego-driven star vehicle is as unoriginal as it is sweaty.
The story is simple and bad: two previous Fast villains team-up to save the world. Even the characters within the movie know this is old-hat, so that's not really the problem. The fault lies in its two main interests: action and comedy. The set-pieces are the worst kind of modern laziness, leaning on the crutches of green screen, CGI and rapid editing instead of more impressive and effective practical work. On the comedic side, there's an endless amount of bickering and lame one-liners that are more annoying than funny. For all the charisma of the Rock and the action-star strengths of Statham, cracking-wise isn't their forte.
Not that the movie is bereft of all quality. There's a solid hallway fight that balances humor and action decently, and the final battle is audaciously insane fun. A couple of solid comedic cameos come in and handle the tone with aplomb, and Kirby steals the movie whenever she's given the chance. Unfortunately, obnoxious filmmaking and a bad script make this mostly a noisy onslaught of uninteresting clichés with only moments of inspired fun.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
43,southdavid,Samoan Drop,6,12 August 2019,"The decision to reinvigorate the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise, that seemed destined to be suffering from diminishing returns around the ""Tokyo Drift"" instalment paid huge dividends as the series went from strength to strength. Here arrives the first spin off from the series.Luke Hobbs (The Rock) is charged by the CIA to track down a rogue British agent, who seemingly killed her team and stole a deadly virus. He reluctantly teams with his old adversary Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is also called in because the rogue agent, played by Vanessa Kirby, happens to be his sister. Their reluctant teaming soon come up against the real villain Brixton, (Idris Elba), a mechanically augmented zealot for a technology cult.So... it goes without saying that the films pretty stupid. At heart, all of the films in this franchise are. It's a stunt show - that revolves around driving vehicles fast whilst people shoot at them. But you can be stupid and entertaining, and ""Hobbs And Shaw"" just about lands in that target zone. I felt in terms of action set pieces it was a little below what we've seen in the last couple of ""F&F"" movies - let alone something like the last ""Mission Impossible"" movie (to which the finale of the film felt like it should be compared too).Chemistry wise it's a little below par too. The abusive banter between the two leads doesn't really fly like you'd hope. Johnson is better at it that Statham, or at the very least his lines are better written. Both have better interactions with Vanessa Kirby's character (though it's patently laughable to try and convince the audience that she and Statham are anything like the same age). Kirby's accent is a bit wayward though, certainly in the early scenes.Ultimately I thought that it was an OK way to spend a couple of hours, and I'm sure that elements of the plot are gearing us up for the sequel, which I'll probably go and see - but if you're in any way hesitant about seeing it, it's far from essential and essential-ious.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
44,imseeg,CGI bad guy who cant loose any fight is so TERRIBLY BORING to watch...,5,3 September 2021,"I am an adult. Not a teenage kid addicted to popcorn. I tried, I really tried to like this movie, but I guess you have to be a braindead teenager to like this sort of stuff.The bad: the contineous CGI action, where the bad guy always wins, because he has super powers. Doesnt anyone else think this is so incredibly boring? The nonstop speed of the scenes is numbing my brain that I honestly could not watch it any longer than 30 minutes. Even with a few beers my brain couldnt handle this much nonsense.Not any good? The actors are good, some (only some) of the jokes are good as well, but the non stop speed of all the scenes even kills some of the few good jokes. Jokes need TIMING. Jokes need a pause, so you can laugh. But no, this movie is purely tailored to red bull drinking, popcorn eating teenagers, with the attention span of lightning.Such a shame, that so much money was poured into this movie. Such a shame of the wonderful actors. But I guess (some) teenagers love this stuff, because they are braindead. Long live the braindead!",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
45,Vartiainen,These are getting sillier and sillier,6,1 August 2021,"Hobbs & Shaw takes a step away from the elaborate car stunts the franchise was originally known for - though there's still plenty - and one towards the science fiction spy stuff it is becoming more and more known for.Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Shaw (Jason Statham), two of the franchise's most beloved side characters, are forced to team up together. Of course these characters have never gotten along in the main films, so hilarity ensues. But, needs must when the devil drives and Idris Elba make for a diabolical opponent.I like the film. It is still that good, fulfilling popcorn entertainment that F&F films have always been. It has plenty of good action, great locations, good music and two very charismatic leads.That being said, this was the first F&F film where I actively thought, while watching, that it was becoming a bit silly. Like, so over the top that you no longer stay with it. Not by much, and it was only towards the end, but it did happen. Which cost it a point or two.Still, if you've liked all the other films in the franchise, you'll gonna like this one just fine. Perhaps not quite as much, but you'll still enjoy it.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
46,subxerogravity,It's good...but...would have totally preferred Fast & Furious 9,8,2 August 2019,"This movie had everything. The Rock, Jason Stratham, Idris Alba and a few awesomely done cameos. Action packed, funny as hell. Hobbs and Shaw is a dynamic duo, and I love the sci-Fi based super villain.
Yet, it's not as good as I would have expected. A movie with Johnson and Stratham. I was expecting less talking from them and more action. I love the action it did had but It's ironically going slower than the films it's based on.
Vanessa Kirby as Shaw's little sister definitely made the movie more fresh and exciting.
Overall it was not put together well and it does show, and while I did enjoy the effort, if I had to pick between this and Furious 9 I wished they would have done Furious 9 cause despite the powerful muscles this turned out to be lesser than I was expecting.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
47,DarkVulcan29,Johnson and Statham,8,8 August 2019,"I think you could go into this film not seeing the last two Fast and the furious films, which it featured Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, cause this spinoff stands on it's own. Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson) and Shaw(Jason Statham) are forced to team up for an assignment, against there better judgement, will they put there difference aside?
Johnson and Statham have a funny unlikely duo like we used to see in action films from the 80's, 48hrs(1982), Lethal Weapon(1986), and Tango and Cash(1989) to name a few. Vanessa Kirby really shines in her own way, and never gets overshadowed by Johnson and Statham. But Idris Elba chews up the film when ever he's on camera, such a good villain, has a menacing presence, but he's so enjoyable watchable to point where you end up rooting for him instead. It's an entertaining action film, never tries to be anything more.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
48,freemantle_uk,Enjoyable silly,7,2 July 2021,"The Fast and the Furious started off being a fairly grounded crime film about street racers stealing DVD players and by Hobbs & Shaw it has evolved into a film about superspies having to fight a cyborg and a techno death cult. And I love H&S because it is so ridiculous. H&S was what you got if you asked a 10-year-old on a sugar high to write a Bond film, and combine it with a buddy cop formula. This film took two of most charismatic stars from the F&F series and gave them a fun action film. David Leitch knows how to make some awesome action sequences. H&S is just wonderfully bonkers.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
49,stevendbeard,Summer Action Movie,8,3 August 2019,"I saw ""Fast & Furious Presents:Hobbs & Shaw"", starring Dwayne Johnson-Skyscraper, Tooth Fairy; Jason Statham-The Meg, Ghosts of Mars; Vanessa Kirby-Mission:Impossible_Fallout, Jupiter Ascending and Idris Elba-The Thor & Avengers movies, The Losers.
This is the first spin off of the Fast & Furious movies-hence the long title. They want to make sure that you know it's connection. It has the basic elements that you have come to love about the franchise, such as lots of car & motorcycle chase action. There are lots of physical and gun fights too, as can be expected with Dwayne and Jason starring. Dwayne/Hobbs and Jason/Shaw are enlisted by the C.I.A. to help track down a deadly virus that threatens the whole world. At first they do not want to work together but things change their minds and they are soon working like they have been partners for years. Jason's sister, Vanessa, is in the mix-she got her hands on the virus before bad guy Idris could-which didn't help his temperament at all. Oh yeah, Idris has been super enhanced to be super fast and super strong. There are a few cameos-one from the franchise and two that are not. As the end credits start, there is a scene with Dwayne and one of the cameos and at the very end-after the credits-there is another one with Dwayne and Jason so don't leave too early. Now, I will admit that there are a couple of scenes that stretch credibility a bit but this is not a documentary. It's a summer action movie. So sit back and enjoy it.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence, language and some suggestive material-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

The storyline follows a super soldier that Detective Hobbs is trying to bring down. The super soldier has plans to rule mankind. Hobbs will need to work with good friend and international mercenary Dekard Shaw to bring him down. This movie is directed by David Leitch (Deadpool 2) and stars Dwayne Johnson (Rundown), Jason Statham (Snatch), Idris Elba (The Dark Tower) and Vanessa Kirby (The Crown). The storyline for this was as ridiculous as all the other Fast and Furious movies. I did like the chemistry between Statham and Johnson and some of their lines were funny.

52,alindsay-al,An Good Self Aware Film,7,13 August 2019,"This film is a spin-off of the Fast and Furious franchise with a couple of the primary characters, I enjoy the franchise but I have never been a huge fan and this is another enjoyable but not remarkable action film. The premise of the film sees Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw having to team up to save Shaw's sister and stop an organisation from destroying the planet's population. Dwayne Johnson has played Luke Hobbs since Fast and Furious 5 and he does a good job in the role, he has so much charisma in the role and you can't take your eyes off of him in this case. However, I felt like in this particular film he plays it as the persona as 'The Rock', it doesn't really feel like a the character of Hobbs but the persona of The Rock on screen. Jason Statham has played Deckard Shaw since the post-credit scene of Fast and Furious 6 and I really think he fits well in this franchise. He has a lot of personality and the two leads chemistry really works well in this film. Vanessa Kirby plays Shaw's sister in the film and she does a good job in the film, she is a worthy ally to the leads and I liked her character in the film. Idris Elba plays the villain in the film and he does a great job in knowing what film he is in, he understands he is in a silly film and does a great job in being a fun, over the top villain. The rest of the supporting cast are decent in their roles, especially Cliff Curtis who does the best he can with limited screen time. The story is absurd, it is over the top ridiculous but with some actual dramatic storytelling at certain points in the film. However, this film's story goes on for an act too long, also there are a few too many different plot arcs in the film that aren't particularly interesting, also the film ends pretty abruptly which doesn't help. The script has some okay drama in it and some decent humour in it, I just felt like this film went over the top with the humour and it pretty much felt like a comedy which i didn't particularly like. The style has some physics defying action in it, but it is very entertaining and fun to watch. However, as mentioned earlier the pacing of the film was a bit all over the place and I feel like the film hit its peak too early and never really fully recovered. Overall this is a good action film that is worth a watch whether you like this franchise or not.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

58,kirbylee70-599-526179,FRANCHISE OFFSHOOT OFFERS THRILLS,9,17 December 2019,"The FAST AND FURIOUS films have taken theaters by storm over the past two decades. That's right, the movie series has been around almost 20 years now, starting with the first film back in 2001. With eight films already released and more on the way it's become one of the biggest blockbuster series around. It's also upped the ante with more outrageous and unbelievable stunts in each picture. Now an offshoot of the series has been released and makes its way to disc this week. Enter FAST AND FURIOUS PRESENTS: HOBBS & SHAW.Dwayne Johnson was introduced in the fifth film as Luke Hobbs, a DSS agent trying to track down Vin Diesel and his crew. He eventually teamed with the group over time. Jason Statham appeared first in the seventh film as bad guy Deckard Shaw, an ex-MI6 agent out to avenge his brother's death. He too eventually changed his attitude and began working with the team and with Hobbs though the pair blended like water and oil. That doesn't stop much in this film.The film opens in London where Hattie Shaw (Vanessa Kirby), the younger sister of Deckard, and a team of MI6 agents recover a vial containing a deadly virus. Before they can make off with the vial they're attacked by Brixton Lore (Idris Elba), a cyber enhanced agent for a secret organization called Eteon. Hattie injects the virus into herself and avoids capture. But Eteon paints a different picture, blaming her for the deaths of her fellow agents and now both MI6 and the CIA are trying to capture her.Hobbs is with his daughter eating breakfast when he's approached by CIA agent Locke (Ryan Reynolds) and told this is an end of the world scenario and he's needed to track down Hattie. Deckard is contacted by an old MI6 agent who tells him the same thing, adding that his sister is who needs to be found. The two run into one another when they both find Hattie and take her to the CIA's office in London. While arguing about not working together the office is attacked and Brixton take Hattie with both Hobbs and Shaw in pursuit.From here the pair that becomes a trio end up moving across the globe in an attempt to remove the virus from Hattie and get it back to their superiors. All the way they are thwarted in those attempts by Brixton who seems superhuman. His eyes can calculate the direction of a punch, his strength is enhanced, his armor is bulletproof and his motorcycle has a sort of mental connection to his cybernetics. In addition to that he has a grudge against Shaw. It seems Shaw shot him three times and left him for dead in the past.All of what I've told you so far happens in the first 40 minutes of the film, a film that runs over 2 hours. Yes there is a ton of action to behold here in this film. And rather than play out like a FAST AND FURIOUS movie this one seems more inclined to seem like a Bond flick. They've decided to go all in with the extreme stunts and unrealistic moments to the point it seems nothing like the first film in the franchise. So does that make it a good or a bad movie?I'd heard that the film was terrible from a friend after the first half. I was expecting that to be the case. But I did three things before watching it. I had my bowl of popcorn and root beer ready beside me. I turned off the lights to enjoy the film. And I checked my sense of belief at the door before pushing play on the remote. This was a movie made for fun, a ride through a haunted house that bounced you around and never once expected you to believe that anything was real or even remotely possible. I mean unless you honestly think Dwayne Johnson can stop a helicopter from flying away with his bare hands.The movie was nothing but fun. And it wasn't just the action level on display, definitely reaching an eleven, but the back and forth banter between Hobbs and Shaw throughout the film. You know that on the surface they can't stand one another and are completely different. Hobbs is more in your face and smash things in his way while Shaw offers more finesse and style with his fluid martial arts maneuvers. But through it all you also know there is a genuine respect between the characters and that their differences complement one another.I've enjoyed all the movies in the series and that includes this one in the spinoff. Odds are good that a sequel is in order since there are three post credit scenes that lead up to it. If they choose not to cut costs and make it like this one that could result in another fun movie. All we can do is wait and see. We can also enjoy this one in the meantime.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

So we have Idris Elba as the baddie out to secure a deadly virus which will turn any human's innards to jelly but his plans are thwarted when Shaw's sister, played by Vanessa Kirby (Mission Impossible: Fallout), absconds w/the item which she injects into her body. Shaw & Hobbs, both already unlikely partners from their previous F & F appearances, have to join forces to save the girl, the virus & stop the self proclaimed Black Superman. Even having Chris Morgan (the scriptwriter of the majority of the series) on board doesn't make things entertaining but rather infuriating at every turn as we interject a high dose of sci-fi gobbledygook which would've worked if we were telling a story which inhabited the world presented but as it is, all the loud noises, flat messages about 'family' & the Rock's workout regiment soon starts to grate rather than appreciate.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

62,aidanratesmovies,"Bloated, but ultimately enjoyable action spinoff",7,7 December 2019,"Hobbs and Shaw is every bit the bloated explosion filled action blockbuster you expect it to be, but even though it can seem shallow at times with its repetitive nature, Hobbs and Shaw has plenty of humor and heart in the end to weigh it down. The Rock and Jason Statham shine with their chemistry on screen, and though the dialogue can seem very on the nose between the characters, the two can share some rather humorous moments. With some minor characters aside, most actors handle the convoluted script rather well. The script itself varies from fun and clever, to stupid and overdone, but in the end there is more positives to count when it comes to this seemingly unnecessary spinoff. The direction makes it worth the rumble, and the film at its core proves to be an enjoyable, although messy, ride with plenty to satisfy.

63,questl-18592,Big. Loud. Dumb.,5,22 August 2019,"Just to preface, I went in to see Hobbs & Shaw without seeing a whole lot from the previous films, so I went in with minimal backstory or knowledge of the universe. That said, the film lived right on down to my expectations in most cases. It was so loud, so chaotic, so much winking at the audience and following the action movie tropes reminiscent of the glory days of Stallone and Schwarzenegger, with a nitrous boost. There are so many eye-rolling, ""that makes no sense"" and ""cool, they're dead now right?"" that snapped me out of the immersion of the movie.It wasn't all bad though. It is very slick, very stylish and polished, with the exception of a few bad CGI moments. Vanessa Kirby as the female lead was wonderful, impactful, competent and surprisingly not as damsel-y as I would have expected from a movie like this. The other leads, Johnson and Statham, are wonderful as well, seemingly having great fun with it and it shows.In the end, there's a lot left to be desired in the realm of plot and story but there are enough laughs, flash and charm from the cast to balance it out as a popcorn action movie that doesn't leave you overly satisfied but makes for an interesting way to spend a couple hours and for a big action spectacle like this it was fun enough seeing it on the big screen but I wouldn't say anyone should feel a rush to go see it unless you're already in love with this universe.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Vanessa Kirby also gives an incredible performance and Idris Elba is great as the villain. David Leitch's direction and the action sequences are both great. The cameos are unexpected and fantastic.

Many installments later, the serious sort of left its dark heist roots and hit the highway to the ridiculous imagination of pushing cars and crew to the max. Despite losing a valuable cast members and several other characters, the series emerges once more from the garage with a new paint job though it's core is very much the same.

Some Story Gaps
The ruining by the trailersSUMMARY:If you have been a follower to the series, you've learned the formula by now and it is one that despite how tired it may be, still seems to work. Hobbes and Shaw is an entertaining ride that runs on adrenaline and comedy as the main fuel. The comedy is in many forms, though primarily in the banter between the star characters, but also has some surprises in the form of cameos and unexpected side roads that are well timed. It delivers an atmosphere of fun, which in turn leads to a great pace to keep you engaged in the film and to the adventure at hand. The actors who bring this to life all work super well, the chemistry between Statham and Johnson is awesome as the rivalry and alpha male syndrome of two extreme males is super believable and exploited well. Meanwhile, Elba as the supervillain is fantastically balanced, despite being in this series, as he is both lethal and wild at the same time. Vanessa Kirby as well is a welcome addition, as she brings one-part female inspiring character and one-part romantic interest. She's a great anchor point for the story and an engaging character overall that seems to balance the macho meatheads of the other two. In terms of story, Hobbes and Shaw shows promise for picking up the pieces of the last installments while opening up some new rivals for the speedsters to follow, with little to no layers beyond what is presented and plenty of preachy morals that the series has thrived on over the last five movies. Finally the action. Hobbes and Shaw has pumped high-octane fuel into the engines and ramped it up to a new level as technology meets good old-fashioned fists. From nearly start to finish, the movie does not let up on the exciting moments and despite how cheesy it can be, it fits the action junkie want so beautifully.Yet, the movie (like most of the latter installments) finds issues with balance and uniqueness that once was present in the film. The jokes, as entertaining as they are, go a little too far, the banter in particular bloating the run time at points where we could have moved on to something better. In addition, the movies continue to push the boundaries of reality with the ridiculous aspects, relying on suspension of belief and focus on adrenaline doing everything superhuman to accept these feats. Surprisingly toned down from other movies, Hobbes and Shaw is still not for those who can't stomach the cheesiness of this franchise. Sadly, the effort and interest in these action sequences is not being used in their storytelling originality. Hobbes and Shaw is still a predictable tale with things laid out for you at the start of the movie with dramatic dialogue that is obvious foreshadowing. In addition, some details given suggest some story gaps and perhaps a little more attention to detail to help. Yet, much of the movie is ruined by the trailers, which have given away much of the action sequences you are probably going to see. Sure, the full spectacle is still awesome, but be warned you've seen much of the stuff already laid out.Outside of a few other minor dislikes, like a few characters built up in trailers, but then laid to the side for future movies, Hobbes and Shaw turned out to be better than I anticipated. It's still a cheesy special effects ride that continues to rope money in, but it works quite well to bring the entertaining action spectacle to open August up. I really enjoyed the familiar aspects of comedy, pacing, and acting, though I still think they have not obtained the balance or adventure that Fast Five was. So in terms of a theater visit, for those who are fans of the series you should hit this up ASAP to get your fill of action and machoness. Yet, those who do not enjoy the spectacles of CGI and stunts, should skip this one and hit one of the five movies coming next week.My scores are:Action/Adventure: 8.0

At first I thought this was Fast & Furious 9, but learnt later on that it was a spin-off to the series & not a direct sequel.The first trailer I seen back April/May this year had me curious! The chemistry between the duo of Hobbs & Shaw is epic as! So funny & entertaining! From last seeing them in 2015's Furious 7, the duo finally get a film made & it's perfect!The film was epic from start to finish! The action was non-stop, the visuals were insane & the eye candy for us guys was in full force! Vanessa Kirby & Eiza Gonzalez though...!The story in the film is pretty straight forward & I like that given this film is 2 hours & 5 minutes long. The story is about a cyborg like villain whose threatening the planet with a deadly virus.The only down sides are the dragging of the film near the final act, the slight little hints of female empowerment but only slight. The film could've had more fight scenes in it.Roll on Hobbs & Shaw 2!Overall a solid 9/10!",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

(PG-13)Dispensable spinoff to the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise finds bantering rivals Luke Hobbs (Johnson) and Deckard Shaw (Statham) forced to team up to stop a terrorist with cybernetic implants (Elba) from getting his hands on a deadly virus that's been self-injected into Shaw's sister (Kirby)--apparently, she's seen ""Mission: Impossible II."" Delivers pretty much what's expected, a little more emphasis on humor than over-the-top action this time, which serves it well since the stars are charismatic, self-deprecating, and they trade quips as bluntly as they do blows (unbilled ""guest stars"" Reynolds and Hart contribute a few laughs as well). The CGI-enhanced action is preposterous as usual, but aside from a few cartoonishly insane moments, it's all a bit on the routine side, padding out an already bloated runtime...but, hey, stay tuned for four mid/post-credits scenes! Elba is criminally wasted playing an uninteresting villain (his enhancements and natural presence are all he's got); although she appears on the poster, González is only onscreen for a few minutes.

77,arungeorge13,"Your bloated, fairly-engaging, typical Dwayne Johnson flick! [+53%]",5,1 November 2019,"Let's look at the bright side here. When you ready yourself to watch a movie starring Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, you know you're not in to witness spectacular performances in their conventional sense. When you know it's an F&F movie, you conveniently leave your brains back home and sit back for some nonsensical save-the-world plot, exaggerated action set-pieces, cringy lines about 'family', and some good ol' butt-kickin'. Do you get the things mentioned? Yes, you do. Thumbs up!Johnson and Statham keep bouncing one-liners off each other in every scene that they're in, to the point of it getting tiresome for everyone but the duo. Vanessa Kirby is in the movie in a pretty badly written role - she knows it too, and for a good part, she's just having fun alongside the alpha males. The action sequences, as you'd come to expect in an F&F movie these days, are atrocious to the core. Idris Elba is clearly the most charismatic among the three main dudes, and it helps that he's an almost invincible baddie (the 'black Superman' reference is hilarious).The cameos, oh, the cameos. While it was refreshing to see Ryan Reynolds be Ryan Reynolds in a film (or a franchise) that doesn't take itself too seriously (and contains plenty of self-deprecating humour), Kevin Hart's cameo stuck out like a sore thumb, pointless and unfunny. Leitch is the man behind John Wick (only part one, with Chad Stahelski), Deadpool 2 (that's just bad writing! *wink*) and Atomic Blonde, and it's easy to see why he was hired to direct a high-voltage actioner. He's set to become the guy that studios with big money are going to approach to direct franchise sequels that are heavy on action.When you get to the 80-minute mark in the film, you almost feel like the showdown is about to come to a close with no real reason to stretch it further. Honestly, the one-line plot had been extended beyond all imagination by then. But wait, the scene shifts to scintillating Samoa soon after. This is where the character of Luke Hobbs finally gets a (bit of a) backstory. While this act is where viewers are subjected to a ridiculously OTT climax set-piece, it also lets you take a peek at Roman Reigns delivering a Samoan drop, the Spear, and doing the 'Ooo aaa'! However, Cliff Curtis does most of the 'talk-talk' here.The mid-credits and post-credits hint towards a sequel, and looks like we'll be getting it considering this flick turned out to be a box-office winner overall. We've also got F&F 9 coming out next year, with John Cena joining the 'family'. Let's see how that goes. More brainless action films? Uh, yes okay!",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

I believe he may very well be the greatest action star of today, and I am always on the lookout for his films. This one, however, disappoints.Hobbs and Shaw tries to be cool. It tries to be grounded. It tries to relate to you. But it just doesn't.The Fast and Furious movies were about cool dudes riding fast cars, and usually showcases their rebellious, street racing lives. This movie shows the other side of that drama, from the police perspective.If you are into cop action movies, then go for it.

82,Troy_Campbell,"The rare spinoff that matches, and arguably betters the original series.",8,4 August 2019,"Taking two of the coolest SOBs from the F&F franchise - Dwayne Johnson as mega-cop Hobbs and Jason Statham as suave spy Shaw - and teaming them up for their own arse-whooping, wise-cracking, world-saving adventure is a winning formula all on its own. Having stunt-coordinator turned director David Leitch behind the camera is just being greedy. Leitch proved with his utterly brilliant Atomic Blonde that he was no ordinary filmmaker, seeking inventive ways to shoot his brutal and balletic action. He puts that flair and imagination to good use with a bigger budget, concocting ultra-stylised and eminently entertaining set-pieces that build on the characters' personalities, whether focusing on The Rock's bull-in-a-china-shop approach or The Stath's slick and swift method. As has become the trademark of the series, physics and logic are wantonly thrown out of the window in favour of creativity and one-upmanship, and here it allows the part-human, part-machine baddies to pull off some killer moves. Of course it helps that the villain Brixton - a self-proclaimed Black Superman - is played by Idris Elba, possibly one of the only actors around who can, and does, out-swagger our charismatic heroes. Rounding out the quartet of main stars, Vanessa Kirby more than holds her own as framed MI6 agent Hattie. She is tough, smart, sexy and requires exactly zero men to save her; the next in an increasingly long line of Leitch's kickass heroines. Throw in an unsurprisingly boss soundtrack, a couple of unexpected (and awesome) cameos, some downright hilarious moments and a raft of confidently magnetic performances and you have one of the year's most unashamedly fun blockbusters. It won't convert those who find this franchise too outlandish for their taste, but Hobbs and Shaw is that rare beast: a spinoff that matches, and Fast Five excluded, betters the original series.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Climax action sequence of Helicopter with car and tractors is brilliantly created. It is worth to watch. Jason Statham is as he was always. Dwayne Johnson is also rocking Hobbs. Surprise is Vanessa Kirby she looks beautiful with stunning performance of dangerous kick ass sister of Shaw. Whereas Idris Elba played machine ghost perfectly.

89,one9eighty,Going by the name of Michael,7,28 September 2020,"Not normally a film I would regularly consider watching, I gave this Fast & Furious spin-off movie a chance. It is directed by David Leitch, who has worked on a vast amount of films in lots of various guises, but up to 2019 only has 7 credits as a director - thankfully for me though, amongst those films are at least a handful I absolutely love, such as ""John Wick"" (2014) which he co-directed, ""Atomic Blonde"" (2017) and ""Deadpool 2"" (2018). With that in mind I was curious how this film would be delivered and if I would enjoy it.In a Nutshell:
A virus is soon to be released on the world by a genetically altered terrorist. Two conflicting specialists must form an unlikely alliance if they intend to stop the terrorist and save the world.More details:
DSS agent Luke Hobbs is recruited by the CIA to stop the Snowflake virus which has apparently been stolen by Hattie Shaw, a rogue MI6 agent. Meanwhile Deckard Shaw is also recruited by the CIA to do the same thing. Both men have a past and both men would rather not work together, but they both also know how dangerous the virus could be in the wrong hands - and as it happens, those hands happen to be Shaw's sister. Although it seems she has stolen the virus and is on the run, in reality she is protecting the world from a terrorist who wants the virus in order to use it against the world. Brixton Lore is working for Eteon, who have given him cybernetic enhancements to make him a formidable force. Individually Hobbs and Shaw do not stand a chance, but together, with each other and their family and friends, they might just stand a chance to save the world.Stuff:
With a budget of $200 million this was always going to be an over-the-top blockbuster action film and it certainly was grossing over $760 million globally. With a runtime of 137 minutes there is a lot of 'bang for your buck' as it is action and mayhem galore. If you enjoy fast cars, fights, action, loud music and some tongue-in-cheek humour, then this film is definitely one for you. The cast are all top class and do a really good job. The plot isn't anything dramatically new and has been done hundreds of times before in other movies, but that doesn't matter when the action is slick, and the aesthetics are cool. There is a lot of CGI and visual effects in the film, which accounts for a lot of the budget, but they generally work. At times they look a little unrealistic - but then I put that down to the film type, and the (""Fast and the Furious"") franchise this movie comes from - they are all generally a little unrealistic and gravity defying. Visual effects come courtesy of DNEG, Cantina Creative, The Third Floor, RISE FX, and Framestore. Music in the film was composed by Tyler Bates who has worked with director David Leitch before - this is the 4th collaboration. Bates has an impressive CV of work when it comes to creating film soundtracks, he has worked on some of my favourites (""The Devil's Rejects"" (2005), ""Watchmen"" (2009), ""Sucker Punch"" (2011), and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014) to name only a few), and the score and soundtrack he adds to this film absolutely works and complements the on-screen antics. Cinematography is by Jonathan Sela who has also worked with Leitch before and makes a lovely vision of parts of the film, particularly the scenes which are created in Hawaii (to represent Samoa). There is a good pace to the film thanks to editing by award winner Christopher Rouse, and the film never seems to drag despite being over 2 hours in duration.Cast:
This film really does have a stellar cast of who's who currently in Hollywood. Just when you aren't expecting it another top celebrity pops up to titillate the audience further. So while the main players in the film are Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Idris Elba and Vanessa Kirby; you can also expect to see Helen Mirren, Kevin Hart, Ryan Reynolds, Rob Delaney, and Joe Anoa'I (WWE wrestler Roman Reigns).Johnson is great and while he portrays a hard-knocks lawman, he's never too far away from being emotionally in-touch with himself for the sake of his family and his daughter. Likewise, Statham, while he appears as grouchy and stand-offish, the development of his character shows justification for why he's like that. Both Statham and Johnson's characters present them the way that they have been presented in other films so if you have seen them before you won't be too surprised at all and you can instantly pick up with them without the need to understand them too much. Vanessa Kirby is great as Hattie; she acts almost as the older and wiser sibling that stands in-between Hobbs and Shaw constantly squabbling. Equally great in the film is Idris Elba who makes a menacing, but still very cool, enhanced super-terrorist. It's great to see Elba in big films these days because he manages to command so much attention when he's on-screen, and in this film it's no different. Despite the prowess of Johnson and Statham, Elba is never shown up.Wrap up:
I thought that I would dislike this film. I have seen some of the Fast and Furious films and expected this to be similar. On both counts I was wrong. This is a good Hollywood blockbuster that brings plenty of high-octane action and entertainment, while allowing you to leave your brain at the door. Sure, there I things I did not like - some of the CGI for example, particularly Elba's futuristic motorbike, but I was able to forgive it and put that dislike to one side. It is more of an action film than other Fast and Furious films and used vehicles to a lesser degree, but for fans of that franchise you can still find some motor-vehicle fun and carnage. As a Saturday night film with a beer and a pizza you cannot actually go wrong with this film. It's not a masterpiece of cinema, I doubt it will win a bucket load of awards, accolades or cult status - but it a decent film that doesn't take itself too seriously, it has a heart and a conscience, it's littered with famous cameos, it has plenty of modern cultural references and nods, and it thrives on bring over-the-top to life for it's audiences. With it's 12 rating there is some violence and some swearing, but nothing that your average 12 year old has seen in countless other films, so feel free to watch this with teenagers as well as more mature kids in the 40's and 50's :D",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
90,educallejero,Pure entertainment and nothing more,7,23 April 2020,"The action is spectacular and the chases even better. Besides that, Statham and Johnson banter was overall good (a bit excessive) and they play their ""action hero"" characters in their sleep at this point. Vanessa Kirby makes a trio of heroes and Idris Elba is the villain. Both are good in these easy parts to play for people with their charm and beauty.Having said that, every second that isn't dedicated to those things is basically filler crap needed to make this a coherent (let's just say that) story and not action sequences without context.But I was entertained, which makes this a good popcorn basic movie for me (normally a 6), only getting extra points for the amazing visual spectacle, that still aren't enough to transform it in a very good movie (8). So, 7.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
91,rockman182,Hobbs & Shaw (2019),6,3 August 2019,"If in the year 2001, you told me that the Fast and The Furious would one day create a very successful franchise spawning nearly ten films, I would not have believed you. Fast forward almost twenty years and that is exactly the case. Furthermore, the main series gets a spinoff with two side characters. Apart from having one of the most awful titles to a film this year, I had no real interest for this. Expected a cheesy and improbable action film that is meant to be a popcorn fling. It does all of that but its nothing very spectacular.The unlikely of duos pair up when a rogue agent starts terrorizing the whole place. The thing about this foe is that he is equipped with cyber-genetic technology which makes him damn near invisible because with his suit he is basically bulletproof, super strong, and can anticipate attacks in the blink of an eye. Hobbs and Shaw also team up with Shaw's sister (played by Vanessa Kirby) as they set their differences aside to take on a common and powerful enemy.The Rock and Jason Statham are two of the biggest action stars going today no doubt. Their performances and chemistry is good for the most part. I think a lot of times the jokes fell flat and their bickering back and forth could have used more effective writing. There is action all over the place, which seeps into a very weak plot. Its ridiculous at times, you well and truly have to turn your brain completely off to be able to see this as a mindless action film.It is just that and there's nothing wrong with that. I just felt like it was overlong and dragged at points. A film like this can be shorter by a half an hour and be just as effective. But hey, there are some nice cameos and the leads go for it in this ridiculous but mostly self aware film. I just hope this isn't setting up to be a side series of its own. I think this is certainly the weakest thing from David Leitch but I suppose it gets its purpose done.6.5/10",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
92,jon.h.ochiai,"Dwayne and Jason are the Upside of ""Hobbs and Shaw""",8,16 August 2019,"Director David Leitch's ""Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw"" stars Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) as Agent Luke Hobbs and Jason Statham as 'reformed' bad guy Deckard Shaw from the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise. Hence, the expansive convoluted title. ""Hobbs and Shaw"" is a lot of fun, and miraculously stupid.In Writers Chris Morgan and Drew Pearce's nearly incomprehensible story: MI-6 Operative Hattie Shaw, played by Vanessa Kirby, retrieves the deadly CT-17 virus on her mission. Powerful cyborg Brixton, played by Idris Elba, thwarts the operation seeking to obtain the virus, too. To keep the virus from Brixton, Hattie injects the CT-17 capsule into herself. Yeah, really.Brixton, who rides this high-tech motorcycle, is super strong, bullet proof, and skilled in martial arts. Eteon Corporation created Brixton, who shares a past with Shaw. Basically, he's invincible. Yet somehow, Hattie uses her smarts to leverage her escape.Eteon's cloaked Leader wants to create a new world order, by first erasing the 'weaker' elements of the human race.Now it's up to Hobbs and Shaw to work together to retrieve the virus, before it goes active, and again save the world. As Dwayne's Hobbs reminds Jason's Shaw, ""... which for the record, will be my fourth time.""Turns out: Hattie (Vanessa) is Shaw's little sister. Consequently, Hobbs finds the smart, beautiful, strong, kick ass Hattie attractive. According to Shaw, Hobbs ain't getting with his little Sis. No way. Chris and Drew's obvious narrative tension is hilarious.The sheer upside of ""Hobbs and Shaw"" is its amazing cast. I love The Rock: He's awesome. Dude is handsome, ripped, funny, and raises an eye brow better than Mr. Spock. Well, almost. Jason Statham is a Baaaaad Man. In one scene Jason fights 4 dudes in close quarters. He gets hit from different angles, yet he's just thrashing the hell out of those guys with punches, kicks and joint locks. Vanessa Kirby, who also starred in ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"", is the total bad ass as Hattie. She displays solid martial arts skills. Ironically, that propels the narrative when her Hattie battles Hobbs. Hobs distinguishes that she fought to escape, not to kill. Vanessa also has an ironic sense of humor. Idris Elba commands absolute cool as villainous, mostly machine Brixton. As he says, ""I'm Black Superman"".Director David Leitch also directed ""John Wick"" (uncredited co-director), ""Atomic Blonde"", and ""Deadpool 2"". His art is electrifying cinematic action. In ""Hobbs and Shaw"" he gets to work with Jason Statham, who I think is an elite martial artist, and the absolute best in the movie game today. Their collaboration is often breathtaking.Dwayne and Jason have palpable natural screen chemistry. No small feat given their individual undeniable charisma. Their trash talk is hysterical. Hobbs says of Shaw's voice: It's like dragging his privates ""over shattered glass..."" Well, Hobbs actually used another word for privates, among other things. Just saying.The miraculously stupid occurs near the end, with the fight with Samoan tribal weapons, and the tow truck and helicopter. WTF? It's in the movie trailer, too.That being all said, ""Hobbs and Shaw"" is very cool. The poignant recurring theme of the ""Fast & Furious"" movies is family. We always love, protect, and forgive our own.So basically, see ""Hobbs and Shaw"". The Rock and Jason Statham are movie star swag. It's set up for ""Hobbs and Shaw 2"". And I would see that one, too. Just saying.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
93,phanthinga,A nice late summer blockbuster,8,5 August 2019,To the people who drop the Furious franchise after Fast 7 for the death of Paul Walker and dislike Furious 8 for how easy Dom accept Shaw into his family do not watch Hobbs & Shaw because you guys will definitely hate it for various reasons but as a person who thoroughly enjoyed the franchise from start to finish despite the recycled movie plot about family and how every main character is basically a superhero now Hobbs & Shaw is a dumb fun action movie to pass time until we get Fast 9 and a sequel. The Rock and Jason Statham are fantastic at their character as usual and thanks to director David Leitch who again direct the hell out of Deadpool 2 this movie got some very interesting cameo that definitely caught me by surprise,Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
94,RforFilm,Hobbs & Shaw needed to trim it's overlong story to be the unapologetic over-the-top movie it wants to be,5,7 August 2019,"Glossy cinematography, beautiful cars and gorgeous woman? That can only mean we have another Fast and the Furious movie out...sort of. In fact, this is the first time Universal Pictures is trying with a spin off of the billion-dollar franchise. While the series isn't my favorite, there have been some movies I've enjoyed and will even admit has it's place within action history. It's one of the few that's gone on for nine movies, does try to make it bigger each time, and even did a turnarounds for the fifth movie (which happens to be my favorite) that reverse course for the series.Rather then focusing on Vin Diesel or his other racer friends, the new spin off puts the focus on Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham. Despite that both have different fighting styles, they have a lot of similarities. Their big action stars, have unique personas that the camera loves and can even deliver lines that are both funny and badass. They've also become big parts of The Fast and the Furious series, given how the last one teamed them up. It was a highlight and people clearly wanted more. They got their wish in Hobbs and Shaw.A group of MI6 agents in London are transporting a virus only to be intercepted by a seemingly powerful Brixton Lore (played by Idris Elba). Though he takes most of them out, he fails to secure the virus as agent Hattie Shaw (played by Vanessa Kirby) inject the virus called ""Snowflake"" into herself and escapes. The CIA ends up calling upon both Luke Hobbs (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Deckard Shaw (played by Jason Statham) without telling each other about the other to retrieve Hattie. Luke manages to find her first with Deckard showing up later to confront his sister.They take her in for questioning and try to get the virus out of her, but Brixton and his group attack CIA headquarters and capture her. Luke and Deckard continue to bicker and banter each other as they find out from a scientist that the Hattie either needs to have the virus extracted or she needs to be killed in order to prevent an outbreak. Not wanting to kill her sister, both guys locate Brixton's group in the Ukraine and fight their way out. They get Hattie as well, but the virus is still in her and their running out of time before Brixton finds them again.In the further years that Fast and the Furious has gone, the movies have gotten more unapologetically over-the-top with it's action, stunts, and use of location. Hobbs & Shaw tries to embrace and have fun with it's settings and characters. Does it work? Almost. The good news is that Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham still make for a fun pair as they continuously make fun of each other as they try to outdo each other. Their funny and get their chances to showcase their fighting styles. The best way to describe it is Dwayne Johnson is the Stallone and Jason Statham is the Bruce Lee.The bad news is that even with it's two actors and impressive action scenes, it feels a lot slower then it should be. A lot of it is on the running time, which is well over two hours. The movie it wants to be is Commando, which is another over-the-top Schwarzenegger movie. But while that one was a fun rush, too much time is taken for exposition on the virus, the group Idris Elba is in, and extended families of Shaw and Hobbs that needed a serious trimming.I'll give this five McLaren 720Ss out of ten. I don't have much else to say other then it does feel like a part of the Fast and the Furious series, but it would have been better if it didn't focus on it's story too much. The action has it's moments, but I don't know it that makes it enough to recommend as a theatrical movie. It'll do better as a streaming movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon when there's nothing else on. Perhaps the series should shift into higher gear to win back it's fans.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

96,bankofmarquis,Delivers EXACTLY what you expect - and that's a good thing.,8,6 August 2019,"If you are heading into the multi-plex to check out FAST AND FURIOUS PRESENTS: HOBBS & SHAW, the 9th(!) entry in the Fast and Furious Universe, you pretty much know (and expect) what you are about to watch.And HOBBS & SHAW does not disappoint - delivering over-the-top action with unsinkable heroes and unblinking villains battling each other with explosions galore and disposable henchmen being...well...disposed of left and right.Reprising their roles as ""Lawman"" Luke Hobbs and ""Outcast"" Deckard Shaw (F&F terms for them) are the charismatic Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and the smoldering Jason Statham. Their two characters can't stand each other, so - naturally - they are forced to work in concert with each other to stop Super-Villain Brixton (Edris Elba). Can these 2 ""frenemies"" learn to put aside their differences and work together to stop a Villain that they cannot stop by themselves?What do you think?But...it's the journey...not the destination that's the fun of this film and this film is fun, fun, fun, indeed. Both Johnson and Statham know EXACTLY what type of film they are in - and know what their core audience is coming to this film to see - and they deliver in spades. They are perfect for these characters and are perfectly paired together. While the script, at times, seemed forced, these 2 action SuperStars make even the clunkiest of dialogue work and they are ""game"" for whatever is thrown at them.Elba joins in strongly as the villain and newcomer (at least to this franchise) Vanessa Kirby (the White Widow in MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: FALLOUT) just as strongly counterbalances all 3 of them as the ""McGuffin"" of this film - the thing that the good guys and the bad guys are fighting each other for. Dame Helen Mirren is back as the criminal mother of Statham's character and she understands what type of film she's in as well. So does Eddie Marsan, who looks like he is having an absolute ball as a scientist brought into the fray.There are also 2 ""secret cameos"" in this film that are fun - and I perked up in my seat when both of these cameos injected energy into this testosterone-infused flick.Former Stuntman and Director David Leitch (DEADPOOL 2, ATOMIC BLONDE) throws a ton of action, car chases, guns, fights and explosions at the audience - all to good effect. His answer to bad acting and huge, implausible plot holes? Blow things up! And that works very, very well for this film. Leitch delivers exactly what is expected here - and that's just fine for me.I was extremely entertained by this movie. I was in the mood for it - and it delivered exactly what I was looking for. Kind of like eating a good burger.Letter Grade: A- (though, don't expect to break into ""discussion groups"" afterward)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

The run time is far too long, the entire Samoa sequence could have been removed and the plot wouldn't have suffered one bit.
The inconsistencies in Brixton's abilities are annoying and exist only to allow our heroes a chance to mount an attempt at fighting back against someone who has owned them in every other scrap.
The ""Brixton can see your punches coming"" sequences were repetitive and lost their charm after a while.
On the whole this film is a hell of a lot of fun and should be seen in the cinema but leave your brain in the foyer next to the pick n mix stand because you won't be needing it!",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
101,MihaiSorinToma,An awesome spin-off,9,18 August 2019,"It's a movie which frankly took me by surprise. I was expecting it to be good but not as good as it turned out to be. It's full of action and adrenaline, it generate plenty of suspense and to make it even better, it's pretty funny as well. The main characters/actors duo is very well thought and implemented, making it a pleasure to watch them into action. The plot is quite good, with little complaints as far as I'm concerned, making it all pretty credible or at least easy to swallow. I enjoyed the other actors as well, the cast as a whole being an achievement by itself.It found it pretty hard to find faults when it comes to this movie as I'm a fan of its type. I love intense action, I love great acting and especially great characters as this one has, I enjoy a well-defined, credible and wonderfully played antagonist and I mostly love over-powered tech or characters. Thus, this movie delivers everything I want from its type. To point out something which some might find not so pleasant, it tends to exaggerate quite a lot when it comes to stunts, fighting or tech. I am aware of it but I enjoy it as it is, but others might not. The story although good could have been a bit less predictable but it's also not as bad as it sounds and you might not even acknowledge this issue.As a whole, it's a very good action movie which deserves plenty of attention from action lovers. It's good to very good in all departments and it definitely provided some quality time for me in the cinema. It gets a clear recommendation from my side.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
102,markthomassintek,Annoying hanger between the 2,6,4 August 2019,"REVIEW FAST & FURIOUS - HOBBS AND SHOWOk Mark be nice, because if I'm not I may get a visit from these 2.Firstly this shouldn't be under the banner of Fast and Furious, the franchise followed a group of car thieves with driving skills who were recruited to help the authorities solve crimes.The latest offering under the francise name has nothing to do with it.This film is more like Terminator meets Lethal Weapon but where Lethal Weapon had the comedy and straight guy this film with the 2 actors trying to out do each other which just became annoying.Action a plenty and the stunts are as to be expected awesome but the acting leaves a lot to be desired especially from Statham.Idris Elba just takes the screen when he's a bad guy and in this he is the ultimate bad guy!Honesty, worth going to see just for the stunts but cover your ears whenever The Rock and Jason Statham get into their hanger because it's annoying beyond belief.Story is silly with no clear explanation as to why the organisation want to upgrade the human race but I suppose these things aren't important when your saving the world for the 4th time.Acting terrible, story terrible, stunts awesome and of course left open for the sequel.Rating 6 out of 10",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
103,abisio,A 10 for action but underused great actors.,8,1 August 2019,"Nobody expect anything but action on the Fast & Furious spin-off particularly when two hard asses characters got in front of the story; however I was expected a lot of humor and great chemistry between Johnson and Statham; two actors with chemistry to spare. And hard to believe is where the movie fails to deliver.
The insults exchange between both characters is most of the time not very funny and becomes tiresome after a while. It seems David Leitch intended to keep them as enemies; never as friends.
On top of that, the movie lose steam with unnecessary explanations out of nowhere (perhaps original stories left in the editing room) and some unfunny lengthy jokes (like the Kevin Hart cameo) . Those scenes somewhat delay the action but not much because 70% of the jokes are really funny; specially the Ryan Reynolds cameo which let's hope is part of next installment.In terms of action; both stars and Idris Elba (a little underused here ) perfectly deliver. Some scenes like the fighting hanging from the building or the car chases are beyond spectacular and most of them quite funny too.In brief; compared with FF franchise is tries and almost succeed to keep action and humor on the same high level. It is as spectacular as any other series chapter and will not dissappoint.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
104,bob-the-movie-man,"""Remember who we are. The Shaw family. We never, never, never give up.""",6,15 September 2019,"It's utter nonsense of course, like most of the ""Fast and Furious"" films, but I have to admit it's done with some tongue in cheek style.A vicious cyber-soldier, Brixton (Idris Elba) tries to steal a deadly virus but is thwarted by brave MI6 agent Hattie (Vanessa Kirby). To help recover the virus, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) is recruited in London by CIA agent Loeb (Rob Delaney, the ""non-super"" hero Peter in ""Deadpool 2""). In an interesting piece of related casting, the Eteon Director (Champ Nightengale - LoL, a cameo for someone far more famous) recruits Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) in LA as a part of the team.Both agents know they are heading for trouble... but do they really appreciate how much the pair hate each other's guts?The trail leads from London to the Ukraine to (a very picturesque) Samoa in a race against time to both defeat the undefeatable Brixton and save Hattie: now a ticking time bomb of global destruction. And Hattie has relations!As a ""Fast and Furious"" film there are of course some truly absurd car stunts involved and - unlike the Mission Impossible films - you are never quite sure what is ""real"" and what is CGI generated. Which is a shame.For me, the gold standard for chases remains Tom Cruise's chase through Paris in ""Mission Impossible: Fallout"". Here, the car chase through London - whilst impressive - never quite reaches the seat clenching tension of MI6.And a final stunt with a helicopter is - I'm sorry - just plain ridiculous. If a chopper can partially lift 5 x load then why can't it completely lift 1 x load. Give me a break!To round things off, there is one of the most unbelievable ""100% survival of a car crashing off a cliff"" scenes in movie history!The acting is largely from the Arnie Swartzenegger school, with Johnson and Statham giving it the old shtick. Dwayne Johnson may be one of Hollywood's most bankable stars (the boy has done REAL good for himself), but he can't do serious acting. His ""pathos"" scenes with his daughter (a vibrant Eliana Sua) are excruciating.Dropping in as class acts are Helen Mirren as the elder Shaw and the excellent Vanessa Kirby as Hattie. Kirby gets a lot more to get her teeth into than in the last Mission Impossible movie, and is really very good. Mirren is rather too posh to be the incarcerated East End con, but is a fun turn nevertheless.Also excellent, as always, is Eddie Marsan as the key scientist. Marsan really turns in a splendid performance in every film he's in. He's top of ""Division 2"" in my books. Never the star, but always starring.Mexican actress Eiza González (from ""Baby Driver"") also crops up as an unfeasibly good-looking Russian femme fatale.Writers Chris Morgan and Drew Pearce do a good job at keeping the script light and fluffy. The animosity between Hobbs and Shaw is played to 110%, and for me the interplay frankly became a bit tiresome. But it's a fun-enough film to entertain, although it's bladder-testing running time of 2 hours 17 minutes is at least 30 minutes too long. There is a natural Ukraine-based finale, but it's not taken, and the film goes on... and on... and on.... and on. Enough already.I've said many times before that comedies shouldn't last more than 90 minutes, and although an ""action film"" this is fundamentally a comedy and the rule should apply. It would have been a much better film if it was compacted.I did criticize ""Fast and Furious 8"" for scenes that brazenly objectified women. And there was a moment - just one, fortunately - with a gyrating bikini-clad beauty - where I thought ""uh, oh"" - this franchise has not moved with the times.But actually, this was the only scene where I thought that. Cinema has moved along massively in the last two years, driven by the ""Times Up"" movement. Here the women are all given pretty leading ""kick-ass"" roles, and they generally show the muscle-bound morons up, often saving their arses.Final Thoughts: It's summer popcorn nonsense, but its well done popcorn nonsense. Probably not a film high on my list of films I want to see again, but as an entertainment vehicle it was not too shabby.(For the full graphical review, please check out ""One Mann's Movies"" on Facebook and the web. )",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

I kind of liked it.,8,24 September 2019,"Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbes & Shaw is the first film I've ever watched Fast and Furious film series which means I haven't watched any of Fast and Furious film series before. The only one thing I know is that Fast and Furious films are action films. So, I don't know what the previous Fast and Furious films looked like and thus, I can't compare this to the other ones. Hence, this review is based on what I saw in this film. No comparison.The film is basically great and stunning. And there are some jokes hidden beneath it. Some scenes are so funny, so, I laughed. So, I'd say it's kind of fun watching this.As it is a kind of action film, so, there are a lot of actions too. But those actions are basically simple. If it's cooler and more complex than this, I'd say it's perfect.About actors and actresses, some are famous, and some are not. But their performances are very fine, so that it turned out to be a great film. And also special effects used are also good. Although it's not better than special effects used in Sci-Fi films, but it's still doing fine for an action film.As for conclusion, even though I haven't seen any of Fast and Furious films except this one, when I saw this one on a website, I was interesting to see it to know how Fast and Furious films look like. But I found that it's not that bad and somehow, I've enjoyed a lot. So, I'd say it's a great film and entertaining.

108,kjproulx,"Everything You Expect, and Even Dumber",7,3 August 2019,"Being a pretty big fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, I found myself worried when they announced that they would be spinning of certain characters and straying away from the core premise that built this series from the ground up. With that said, that announcement came even before the seventh or eighth instalments of the Fast & Furious franchise, so it felt inevitable at some point. Well, it has now hit theatres and the ridiculous characteristics of both characters have ben dialed up to a million. Is this really a Fast & Furious movie? Not really, but that doesn't mean it's not a good, dumb, fun romp worth enjoying.Following Luke Hobbs (Dwyane Johnson) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) as they are recruited to hunt down a virus known as the ""Snowflake"" (yes, that's the plot), which has now been injected into Hattie (Vanessa Kirby), making her a catalyst, ridiculousness ensues. Being pursued by Brixton, a genetically enhanced super-soldier, Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw is all but subtle. This film simply chooses dumb plotlines and sticks to them throughout the entire duration. Being a fan of stupid elements if they're knowingly tonque and cheek, this film as a very enjoyable to me.Where this film will lose certain viewers is in the fact that it's not really grounded in reality anymore, and that's still saying the previous two films were. This time, people fall from skyscrapers with no parachute, with only the concrete to break their fall, and walk it off. That's about the tamest example I can come up with that was presented in this movie. The action is dumb, the dialogue is cheesy, yet great, and if you're going to see this film other than wanting to see the chemistry between Dwyane Johnson and Jason Statham, then you may not enjoy yourself.I would say this film's biggest flaw is the fact that it just wants to continue delivering the goods. It does feel about 30 minutes too long, but the final act of the film is absolutely the best part, so I can forgive it for slightly overstaying its welcome. The overall pacing even felt a little off to me as well, but as I said, the characters, diaogue, and action set pieces all held this movie together nicely. There were many instances where I was just watching a dumb action movie and needed to turn my brain off, and that felt like enough.In the end, die hard fans of this franchise will definitely be mixed on this film, but I also believe that newcomers will get a bigger kick out of it. This is a film that's definitely not catering to the hardcore fans, but action junkies alone. From stupid to dumb, bombastic to insane, Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw is everything you expect it to be, but probably even more so. I had a blast watching this film, but I will never tell someone that it's great. It's a solid action flick for what it is.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
109,kuarinofu,Fast & Furious Presents: Transformers 27,4,29 September 2019,"I've seen all F&F movies except for the third one, I think. The time when those were just movies about street racing and cars modding is long gone. At some point, these were dumbed down to brainless crazy action rollercoaster rides. And this worked just fine, they generated good profits, were easy to watch and people enjoyed watching impossible stunts while eating popcorn.This one, however, just barely did cross that almost ground-level line after which I can't watch this anymore. It's just mass production by now, make as many of these as possible, market to the widest audience possible, collect profits.I'm not saying that the first movies of the series were too intelligent, but in this one, they're not even trying. The plot is as generic as possible and it could've been completely cut out of the film making it just an over the top impossible action clip show. The dialogues are either exposition dumbs and ""clever"" foreshadowing or Statham and Johnson bickering. It seems like the actors had a good time though, good for them. There are no characters, it's literally Johnson and Statham with some stereotypical traits added to them.The main pillar of these movies - the action, felt over the top and mediocre at the same time. The overabundance of CGI just makes these over the top stuns pointless. I mean, I love good action and great stunts, even if they are over the top, but they have to look and feel real (like in MI:Fallout or Mad Max Fury Road for a better example, even though MMFR had real stunts mixed with CGI). Here our main heroes are invulnerable and even the antagonist is a terminator. It's just so uninteresting.There is nothing to get you invested in anything. At this point in time, these movies have turned completely Transformers.

Sometimes you just wanna kick back, have some laughs and watch dudes get punched in the face. They can't all be Oscar winners. this movie was really bad, it was immensely boring, the rock didn't even seem like the same character from fast and furious, wheres the beard, wheres his hard attitude? this movie has 0 relation to fast and furious, just a couple names, that's it, its complete trash, are we gonna ignore the fact that the dialogue could have been written by a 9 year old and the fighting choreography was basic compared to the prison fight from fast 8. Idk i don't wanna be a hater but cmon this was so childish its sad. This movie is just so boring and so disappointing! ""Pure trash!""... Without any doubt was a total waste of time and money! ""Ridiculous!"" Not even having the presence of Jason Statham, Helen Mirren, Ryan Reynolds and all the possible and imaginable special effects was not enough to save this damn movie!

Moody Brit Deckard Shaw and well-mannered Yank Luke Hobbs are forced together to take on Idris Elba's Brixton Lorr, a cybernetic bad ass with designs on world domination.Shaw's sister Hattie, a MI6 special ops agent, is along for the thrill ride as the gear-grinding franchise takes off around the globe in a hyperbolic hydraulics ingenious fights and stunning bike car chases with unique and new evolutionary gravity defying ways to a spectacular scene running on the outside of a building with jumps and running jokes between the the two whole their as breathtaking stunts are promised an action-packed extravaganza filled with all out brawls and car chases. Spectacular scenery along the way for the final third its a whole new old school games. After watching the movie, I was suprised by how absolutely entertaining it is. Idris Elba, the villain is basically The Winter Soldier(though he calls himself Black Superman) and is formidable both as a screen presence and a threat to The Rock and Statham's Hobbs and Shaw. The Rock and Statham were excellent and able to do what they did best: kick the living s*** out of people while wisecracking with a straight face.
It's all about snowflakes that will cause an apocalypse so Shaws sister kicks some ass and adds kick ass action in style to be While running down the side of a building catching up with enhanced bad guys It also helps that they are actually talented actors and make some emotional scenes believable. The car chases are spectacular and is every bit as exhilarating Every sort of model of vehicle seems to get involved at some point, from motor bikes to jeeps to trucks to helicopters. Just one thing was missing: Diesel there is two fun cameos
as The Fast and Furious franchise and even rival The Bourne series. The action choreography enables all the actors to embrace their strengths. Dwayne Johnson gets to really use his muscles while Statham uses his quick fists and kicks. Elba, nearly steals the show himself, gets to believably kick both The Rock and Jason Statham's ass. The plot is good but having Shaw rescuing his sister provides some character motivation but luckily, the movie focuses less on family drama and more on both of as the chases in dune buggies through chernobel hq explosion galore fist fights that breathtakingly good stunts that simply defy doing
The film couldn't just be ""Hobbs & Shaw"" - ignoring the franchise that spawned it - but nor is it allowed to be ""Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw,"" a more traditional sequel construction. The strange compromise, in which ""Fast & Furious"" presents ""Hobbs & Shaw"" is symbolic of the Frankenstein nature of this action film. And yet, the Jason Statham-Dwayne Johnson film is still the most entertaining the franchise has been in years.
. The movie's final hour even takes the action to the island of Samoa it goes old school for our protagonist as they go back to nature and us the land spectaculary, so that Johnson can both openly embrace his heritage as part of the final battle's
there's still plenty of them, but the final hour on Samoa emphasizes more old school (and creative) fight choreography.

They banter and bicker their way through the excusably ridiculous plot.The villain (Elba) is a mechanically modified superhuman, he's looking to take control of a super virus and ultimately wipe out humanity.The plot is totally impossible especially the fight scenes, chase scenes, gun battles and the exaggerated helicopter ending, which is ridiculous and absolutely incredible.I really liked the humour, lead actor's individual charisma and their chemistry.

114,msbreviews,Rating: C,5,5 August 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Here's the thing about the Fast & Furious franchise: it can be dumb fun. Every movie has the right to be entertaining even if it completely disregards physics and logic... As long as it establishes its tone from the start. You can't make an action film where the main characters survive basically everything they shouldn't and take everything seriously. It's not that you can't have that mix of tones (Furious 7 did it brilliantly), but that's reserved for some of the best movies of the year since it's not easy (at all) to balance so many different things. Hobbs & Shaw sets its tone in the first 10 minutes, and everyone knows what they're getting themselves into. However, it didn't quite work for me this time...The Fast & Furious saga is an undeniable success, even more in my country where it constantly breaks box-office records. It possesses everything a popcorn blockbuster should have: tons of action (car chases, explosions, fights, shootouts), easy-to-follow plot, and simple character development. There's no problem in leaving your brain at the entrance of the theater for a couple of hours and just have fun. Of course, Hobbs & Shaw is ridiculous. It's completely absurd, it has no sense of logic, and it's unbelievable how many physics-defying sequences occur. But that's exactly what they establish in those first few minutes, so people just need to sit comfortably and eat that whole bag of popcorn while watching the most ludicrous action on-screen.So, if the tone is well-balanced, why didn't I enjoy it as much as the rest? People seem to be having tremendous fun (even critics who usually demolish this type of films are liking it), so I guess I'm in the minority here, but I just found the action pretty underwhelming, and the comedy was way off for me. Granted, there are huge set pieces, and there are a couple of great action scenes, especially a motorbike-car chase between Brixton, Hobbs, and Shaw. True, there are a couple of laughs that I couldn't contain due to how amazing Statham and Johnson's chemistry is. Nevertheless, overall, I just don't think it's enough.First of all, my main issue with the story: Brixton. Idris Elba is incredible as always, and I really want him to be the next James Bond. However, his character is so poorly written and so horribly explored that I wonder why they made him an enhanced machine with superpowers. Literally, there's no difference between him and the other two main characters, which ultimately destroys the ""superhero"" vibe Elba should have. That's the problem with having such an absurd movie: if your ""heroes"" are undefeatable due to their enormous plot armor, how is your ""superpowered villain"" different than them? If an explosion goes off with the three of them close, why do Hobbs and Shaw survive in the same way Brixton does? How does a punch from a ""black Superman"" has the same impact as a punch from the other two?Then, the comedy. It's not like I disliked Statham and Johnson bantering for five straight minutes in three different scenes. It's just too long, and not all of the jokes land. The film itself is way too long, just over two hours. If I didn't know about the whole Samoa sequence from occasionally seeing it on a TV spot, I would have believed the movie was about to end when it started its third act. It feels like it's going to end, but then there's a whole other massive action set piece to show off. For the first time in a long, long time, I almost fell asleep during the transition from the second-to-last to the last action moment. The action is also very disappointing having in mind David Leitch is directing. Too many quick cuts, and way too choppy.Finally, there's an attempt at the start of a romance that I won't spoil, but ... It's not like it's forced because it actually isn't. It follows a logical path, characters don't say stupid stuff to each other, and it was surprisingly being a good way of stopping to breathe and relax away from all the action. However, as the film reaches its conclusion, they ditch it altogether and never address it anymore. There's even a line similar to ""I'll let you have a kiss tomorrow if we're still alive"", but they never go there again. It's like it never happened... Why? The only thing that was truly being logical and emotionally compelling is completely ignored by the end. That's disappointing.I don't want to be too harsh on the movie because I do understand how entertaining and fun it might be. I'm sure audiences will love it, and fans of the franchise will love it even more. The chemistry of the cast is palpable, and everyone is terrific. Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are awesome as the action superstars, and they're definitely the main source of entertainment. Vanessa Kirby is also pretty great, and I have to commend the film for keeping two spectacular cameos under wraps. You won't believe who's in this movie as well. There are still a couple of cool action sequences, and I did laugh more than a couple of times, so I guess it isn't as bad as this review might transmit.I know I'm in the minority, so I recommend all of you to go watch it and judge it for yourselves. If you enjoy absurdity, ridiculousness, and over-the-top action, as well as cheesy comedy, Hobbs & Shaw might be perfect for you. It didn't really work for me, though. The comedy was not as good as I expected, the action is not that captivating, and Brixton is such a horribly written and unexplored character, that I kept feeling frustrated every time an action sequence ended. Go for the huge set pieces and the dumb fun, stay for the amazing cast's chemistry.

But for more 'analytical' audience out there ; this one ought to be a letdown. It was stupid and so illogical in places that you just get super annoyed. Look I love Action Movies and I exactly know what to expect from them but I have seen better ones. Uncountable Continuity errors alongside some unclear explanations ; it bothered me a lot. But at the same time on the entertainment aspect this was a Pure Class. The action, CGI everything was class apart. Rock and Statham's Chemistry on screen was lit and gradually hold the enitre plot and kept me engaged with their witty humours and insults. Two Surprise Cameos were amazing and they added so much into a story that wasn't too great on the first place. Idris Elba as the main antagonist worked pretty damn well! He was totally convincing in his role. Vanessa Kirby as Hattie, a tad disappointment for me. I think she wasn't a great choice ; honestly saying.
The writing department was a huge let down as well as the Sound Score! Cause In my humble opinion, this film considering the Visual effects it showcased; deserved a better soundtrack to go alongside.In the end it's an Entertainer that knew what it was supposed to do and for his self awareness it never pretended to be something else or tried to! So Action Junkies go and see this one but for those who wants something more from a Film, you can still enjoy it but Don't expect much.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
117,0w0,"Fast & Furious with no cars? Oh, and it's also unrealistic as hell",5,6 October 2019,"6 guys with guns aimed at 1 guy who's standing 2 meters away, and the 1 guy disarms ALL of them without them getting a single shot off? And in another scene, The Rock destroys 6 men in unarmed combat, but later he gets beaten by a single 50kg woman... THEN 2 guys with fully automatic weapons shoot at Hobbs & Shaw while they're in the open from about 10 meters away, yet not a single bullet hits them... And a flamethrower's flame, knocks a guy back over 5meters; how the hell does that work? I've stood next to some massive fires in my time, and have never gone flying back 5meters... And in one scene, a military helicopter is hooked to a off-road vehicle, yet it can't pick it up, but the lift capacity of even light helicopters is usually around 3000pounds, so a military one like that with much higher rotor RPM and horsepower could easily lift that vehicle from the ground, never mind rip The Rock's arm off (you know what scene I'm talking about). The lack of realism is just really a huge immersion-breaker for me, and if I'm not immersed, then I'm not entertained.They also dropped Justin Lin as director? Why?! He has made 4 very good F&F movies before, so why would you put an unknown director like David Leitch on this movie? That's a recipe for disaster, plain and simple...

118,mfellipecampos,Movie seen on August 9th,6,18 November 2019,"Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, aka Hobbs & Shaw, is a 2019 US action movie directed by David. Leitch is written by Chris Morgan as a spin-off of The Fast and the Furious franchise featuring two characters, Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw, in the lead roles. Produced by Seven Bucks Productions and Chris Morgan Productions and distributed Universal Pictures, it stars Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Vanessa Kirby and Idris Elba.The Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw preview premiered July 13, 2019 at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood. It was released in Brazil and Portugal on August 1, 2019. It premiered in the United States on August 2, 2019 in the conventional formats, Dolby Cinema and IMAX. It has so far raised more than $ 198 million worldwide.With eight films in its bag - and one more on its way, set for 2020 - the Fast & Furious franchise is more than established in the popular imagination. The mix of a charismatic cast with absurd and mind-boggling action sequences has become the tonic for some films already, permeated by a mocking and self-indulgent humor, typical of those who do not take themselves at all seriously. In its first spin-off, Hobbs & Shaw invests heavily in this path over another basic feature of the series: car handles.In a way, it is understandable. Without Dom Toretto and his minions, the essence of automobiles is largely gone by the very nature of its current protagonists. The focus here is much more on the differences between Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw, once again personified by Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, underscored not only by the numerous verbal confrontations between them - including good teasing typical of 5th graders, with much more testosterone - but also visually. In this sense, the beginning is emblematic: from the color palette between warm and bluish to London's rainy climate in contrast to the Los Angeles manor, Hobbs and Shaw are like water and oil, they don't match or blend, but they have to work. together for a common good - for different reasons, of course.To this end, Hobbs & Shaw both drank from the source of his chronology, rescuing Helen Mirren's character to insert Shaw's sister into the plot, as well as betting on something unheard of in the franchise so far: flirting with science fiction, embodied here by the villain by Idris Elba, a man altered from technological experiments to promote the evolution of the human species. Yes, that's what you just read: the exaggeration of the action scenes has also reached the narrative. Which is not bad, on the contrary.The great thing about Hobbs & Shaw - and the best films in the franchise, Fast & Furious 6 and 8 - is the awareness of what you want to be. There is not the slightest hint of arrogance here, in the name of a brainless adventure whose sole function is to entertain. Given this, writers Chris Morgan and Drew Pearce get it right by spreading delightfully ridiculous dialogues that so well underscore the lack of seriousness of everything on the scene: from Idris Elba presenting himself as the villain of the movie to The Rock by telling how many times he has saved the world, from the infamous ""I would be afraid if I had a heart"" to the surreal ""I eat candy all the time, for breakfast and lunch"" hit by the rebate ""it's dinner time"" - with a pointed gun, of course.Hobbs & Shaw is like that, and it's no demerit to be overkill and ridiculous when done right. Filled with jokes around the personas of The Rock and Statham, the film still has the beautiful addition of Vanessa Kirby, who not only reaffirms the charisma seen in Mission Impossible - Fallout Effect but demonstrates resourcefulness and competence in action scenes. However, it is in the way the film treats its character that its Achilles heel is also.At one point in the movie, Statham and The Rock argue over a possible partner interest in their sister, then countered with a ""Do you think we're in a 1955 movie?"" The great joke not only refers to the action movies of yesteryear, when women were mere interest of the protagonist alpha male, but also dialogues with the current post-#TeToo times. However, what you see in the final half of Hobbs & Shaw is precisely a diminution of Vanessa Kirby's character in the story, so that she increasingly becomes the (modern) maiden who needs to be saved. That is, the hook in question works immediately but also opens up how little has changed in this movie as well as how women are represented in action movies. Wasted opportunity, unfortunately.There is also another problem in Hobbs & Shaw regarding duration. As entertaining as the duel in the corridors between The Rock and Statham is even fun, the whole stretch in Moscow sounds unnecessary in terms of narrative - even incoherent, within the film's proposal - which causes some tiredness when the final act finally begins. The 136 minutes sound (too) overdone, as well as the three post-credit scenes that add little or amuse, or even Ryan Reynolds' caricatured cameo, once again taking on the persona of Deadpool's self-deprecating debauchery. It works on her first appearance, but the continual repetition of such a proposal wears her out.With echoes of the Fast & Furious franchise, especially regarding the proposal to include the protagonists' families in the narrative - explicit reference to Dom Toretto's endlessly repeated mantra - Hobbs & Shaw is a fun movie that can find an identity by merging exaggerated action and a strong mocking tone, with a hint of science fiction interspersed with much rivalry. As entertainment works well, so much because of the charisma and willingness to mock yourself from your protagonists. Merits also to director David Leitch, not only for the visual contrasts arising from his main characters, but for humorous details such as the unmistakable Transformers' typical sound of Idris Elba's changes to the bike, and especially the good action scenes, driven by agile camera movement. The crazy sequence of the helicopter chase in the final act is his prime example, but it is also worth mentioning the clash between The Rock and Kirby and the no less insane skydiving of a building to capture enemies.I liked this review of AdoroCinema",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

The action sequences are a blast to watch. It's one of two things that carry this film. As Leitch is a man who has worked on various action flicks, the fight choreography is also handled really well.The other aspect which carries the film is Hobbs and Shaw themselves. Both, Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, are hilarious! Their chemistry works extremely well due to their constant banter. A lot of the jokes and insults hit the mark which brought a lot of laughs within me. Idris Elba was also entertaining as this superhuman-like bad guy but there wasn't much done with him hence he feels underdeveloped.The main issue I have with this film and the more recent Fast & Furious films is the wafer-thin plot. Apart from the action and witty humour, the storyline barely exists. As this is the case, the film just uses a repetitive cycle of action and characters talking. There isn't much build up as a result of the weak plot.Despite its major flaw, Hobbs and Shaw still is an enjoyable summer experience. Whilst the action scenes are very over the top, unrealistic and insane to the point where such things won't ever happen, the majority of the audience won't care about this.

133,PyroSikTh,Great Banter. Lacklustre Action.,6,6 August 2019,"The one thing that did sell me on Hobbs and Shaw was...well...Hobbs and Shaw. They've consistently been the best characters since they were introduced, and their interactions in Fate were the best thing about the whole movie. If a spin-off without the main cast could work, it would be this one. And yet at the same time, without the main cast, and without such a big focus on cars, it barely felt like a Fast and Furious movie at all. And that was okay. It was easy to slip into the mindset that this was just an action vehicle for Johnson and Statham to share together, to bat off against one another without interruption, and it did make for some fun interactions between them. But then again, with that mindset in place, the constant references to previous Fast and Furious movies created a bit of a schizophrenic chimera, simultaneously trying to distance itself while also stay connected.As far as story go, Hobbs and Shaw definitely takes the Fate approach. The story doesn't matter. Very little care is taken to remain consistent with the rest of the franchise, and entire blocks of backstory are completely rewritten to suit its own needs, like rewriting Hobbs from a Southern American to a Samoan to match Johnson's ethnicity, or making Shaw an ex-MI6 agent instead of the ex-special forces he was established as in 7. The introduction of Idris Elba as a superhuman cyborg also feels like more of a step over the line as far as groundedness goes. I mean this was a franchise about street racing in LA, and now we literally have the ""black superman"". Centering the main conflict on Shaw and his family, but without even referencing Owen really felt like a backhanded slap to the face as well. Where is Owen? Why was he not clued in on this rescue mission for little sister Hattie? Obviously it would've detracted from the Hobbs and Shaw tagteam, but I spent the entire movie wondering if I had forgotten some crucial detail about Owen.The story was a blowout. Hattie injects herself with a deadly virus to keep it out of terrorist hands (hello M:I2) and Hobbs and Shaw are reluctantly stuck together to retrieve her and the virus, and fight off those who are after her. Amusingly despite being framed as a terrorist herself, her own government doesn't seem to care because it's only Eteon who are after her. Ah well. Anyway, with the clock ticking until she goes supernova and inadvertently wipes out the planet, they travel all over the world to track down those who can extract the virus from her, including taking 18 hour flights from Russia to Samoa to see Hobbs' disgruntled brother, because he's a really good mechanic, when there's only 24 hours left on her clock. Whatever, check your brain at the door. The story makes no sense.But the action's got to be good right? Eh, I actually thought the action was the weakest part of the whole movie. Yeah, an action movie with lacklustre action, not a good sign. David Leitch has proven himself as a very capable action director. John Wick, Atomic Blonde, and even Deadpool 2 were full of simply fantastic action sequences, probably some of the best of the decade. But Hobbs and Shaw looks like every other mediocre action movie. The stunts are all about being as brutal as possible, there's no snazz, style, or entertainment here, and there's no grittiness either where the heroes suffer innumerably and get back up still fighting against the odds. It's just Johnson and Statham punching guys in the face or kicking them in the balls, while a camera zooms in up close and shakes about to make it look more interesting. The only exception to this being the double team against Brixton at the very end, when they realise they need to work together.As far as the more extravagant action scenes go, they're too extravagant for their own good. The chase through London was cool, mainly because Brixton's transforming, self-driving motorbike was the coolest thing in the whole movie. The best thing about the chase in Russia was the massive truck just charging through everything like a bulldozer, but other than that it was uninspired and filled with CGI to make impossible maneuvers possible. The final chase stringing five trucks together to weigh down a helicopter looks cool, but again leans too heavily on the CGI to achieve it, turns Hobbs into Captain America, and ultimately doesn't resolve the concept at all and just breaks the truck-train apart before chucking everyone off a cliff. It felt like a smaller scale version of the submarine from Fate.But okay, for how much I've ripped this movie up, my rating doesn't really fit. I admit despite all this it is an entertaining movie. You're unlikely to fall asleep. The most valid criticism I can offer is how insanely long the movie is (clocking in at over two hours), but honestly I didn't even notice it. It never drags, the pacing never dips, and the slower/quieter moments are kept afloat by comedy and banter between the characters. Johnson and Statham share some great dialogue scenes together, despite how overdone the use of their balls was as insults. For me though, the highlights of the film all involved the cameos. I won't spoil who appears but both Hobbs and Shaw are individually recruited by David Leitch favourites, while a scene of banter on a plane is interrupted by a frequent co-star of Johnsons. Self-indulgent? Maybe, but great nonetheless. And this is without mentioning the references to other movies (Italian Job is now part of the Fast and Furious franchise), or Johnson constantly dropping wrestling memes.Hobbs and Shaw is the epitome of leaving your brain at the door. If you don't think too much, there's a lot here to enjoy, but as soon as you start to dissect it (like I have had to for this review) it all falls apart. If you skip it, you're honestly not missing much. It's not even contender for best movie of the franchise. But it is fun, and does have its moments (like the splitscreen introduction of the two main characters as they largely do the same as each other in different settings). I give Hobbs and Shaw an above average 6/10.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

135,dfle3,"Hobbs and Shaw. A big, stupid, Hollywood action film...done right. 87.5%",9,1 August 2019,"I've got another confession to make: As with ""Spider-Man: Far from home"", this is my first foray into this franchise. There was a trailer for this film before the Spider-Man feature and it looked absolutely exhilarating. Having won a few free tickets recently, I could afford to take a chance on this unknown quantity.The plot is very easy follow: an attempt by British Secret Intelligence Service agents at MI6 to seize from the wrong hands a weaponised virus which poses an Avengers' level threat to humanity goes awry. In order to save the world, Luke Hobbs, a Federal Agent with the DSS (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Deckard Shaw, a former British Special Forces assassin-turned-mercenary (played by Jason Statham. Thankyou to Wikipedia for those bios!) are forced by circumstance to work together, despite their mutual loathing due to...stuff that happened in earlier films which I know nothing about (fortunately, unlike the last two Avengers films - especially ""Infinity war"" - I didn't really feel lost without that background knowledge). The little I'd seen of The Fast And The Furious franchise (probably in film review TV shows) made it seem like the villains were muscle car hoods or something insignificant like that. However, Hobbs informs me in this film that this this is the ""fourth time"" that he has been forced to save the world...but I'm not sure if that means that there have been four films where we see him do that.Storywise, the action plays like a James Bond film (e.g. Moonraker) or a Metal Gear Solid game...some insane action (actually, it's non-stop action, pretty much, but not in a boring way!). In other words, it's all very high-tech...futuristic, you could say. Hobbs and Shaw are like gods battling mere mortals...or The Avengers battling people who aren't very nice. They need a supervillain to make their victories more meritorious, and they get that in this film. H&S have a supervillain not a million miles from Thanos in the last two Avengers films. That is to say, the supervillain does have a philosophical narrative to justify posing an Avengers' level threat to humanity.Not having seen the previous films in this universe, it does seem to me that we learn new things about Hobbs and Shaw, mainly about their personal history and family life before they became superheroes (in a manner of speaking). It did seem to me that a close family member of Hobbs sounded Indian, which I thought was weird, but I dunno. If the previous films haven't dealt with Hobbs' and Shaw's backstory, this could be interesting to yous.Generally the humour worked well for me in this film, especially the scenes with Lock (played by Ryan Reynolds, who I now realise played ""Deadpool"" in the film of that name and hence is why he seemed familiar to me. Maybe Lock's humour (?) is a variation on Deadpool's? There's a Deadpool style intertextual reference in a scene with Shaw's car collection. I've reviewed both ""Deadpool"" films here) and Luke. Lock was generating all the laughs for me. However, it was hard to form a definitive view about him. Was Lock being intentionally funny (which I thought that he was) or was he mentally defective? Hard to tell! I also did form a hypothesis about him, relating to an aspect of the story...which I'm not sure is half-confirmed by the bonus scenes during the closing credits. In the parlance of Australian cricketers, there is a lot of ""sledging"" between Hobbs and Shaw, which didn't always make me laugh, so I did find the Lock style 'banter' (?) more humorous.Since I've already mentioned ""The Avengers: Endgame"", I have to say that I found H&S more entertaining and funnier. The action wasn't as an intense experience as it was for the trailer, but at no stage did I get bored with the non-stop action, as I do with many films, including those in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I have one criticism to make of this film: sometimes I'd be unable to understand what Shaw was saying, due to his accent. That's a pity, as I'm sure that I would have missed some jokes and sledges which Shaw was delivering. There is an artificial voice in this film which I had even more trouble understanding what it was saying.Not really a criticism, but it has to be noted that this film requires that you take it with a tablespoon of salt, as far as common sense or logic goes. When Hobbs returns home, it's hugely convenient that someone there has the skill to do a particular task, which you would assume would be too high-tech for them. One scene during the closing credits is also particularly juvenile, as in you wouldn't really expect professional world-savers to act like that. Let's not even mention how Hobbs gets out of detention at an airport! One of my all-time favourite James Bond films is ""Die another day"". It's one of the all-time great 'popcorn' movies in my view. It's also very silly at times, from memory. Random people on the internet knock it for this and for it not being very believable. It turns out that many things that they loathed in this film (like the invisible car) are actually (now) possible (in a manner of speaking). The high-tech aspects to H&S strike me as being something which might just be a few years around the corner, too. Speaking of James Bond...I wonder if Idris Elba's role can be considered an audition to be the next actor to play that character.I think that I am likely to forget this movie and these characters very soon now. There's a good chance that I'll remember really liking this film. The advantage of having forgettable and disposable characters like these is that you will enjoy the film just as much the next time and laugh at all the same things that you laughed at the first time around. The H&S spin-off of The Fast And The Furious franchise is something that I would definitely be onboard for, as far as seeing sequels to it goes.Miscellaneous:How realistic was the HALO jump scene?",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
136,funtasticfour,"So over the top ridiculous, but also a lot of fun!",7,10 August 2019,"I love the fast and furious series, though the last few have gotten very unrealistic, and I guess it's hard to go back once they've started. Now they constantly have to outdo the last movie in terms of goofy impossibilities. A lot of that is right in the trailer, like running straight down a building or the Rock just free falling to catch up. Thankfully there are enough well done fight scenes, and some comedy to make it a fun experience so that I don't get a complete headache from rolling my eyes around their sockets. The two surprise cameos were very welcome and fun, but the breakout star here was absolutely Vanessa Kirby who is not only beautiful but has the best action scenes, and in a movie that's all about the testosterone, that's a job well done!",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
137,Offworld_Colony,"Relentlessly funny, self-aware and thrilling...",6,6 February 2020,"...It's a cheeky, knowing, stake-less Mission Impossible with the irony and parody that the Fast and Furious mainline franchise never had. It's got some electric photography and some pleasurably zippy editing and an actually satisfying score and soundtrack. It's got the A-team crew behind it unlike the constantly lacklustre and low-brow, self-serious Fast and Furiouseseseses. I enjoyed it more than Leitch's Deadpool sequel, more than Atomic Blonde. I thought it had excellent action and I was totally on board with this almost Mel Brooks or Zucker/Abrahams take on hyper-masculine, ultra-slick, gonzo, airhead summer blockbuster franchise films. It was modern and had the feel of something from the 90's in a genuinely welcome way.
I could not believe I enjoyed this cyberpunk techno-action comedy flick so much. Oh yeah, that's why. Yes, it gets a bit F&F in the third act, but Vanessa Kirby's spirit and chops lingers in the memory enough to save it. I also gave it the same rating as Knives Out, what the hell is going on!",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

They know their audience, know what their about, and lean into it with no shame or remorse.Any fans of the Fast & Furious films will find a lot to enjoy here. The characters of Hobbs and Shaw are dialled up to 11, throwing one liners and punches with no holds barred. Let's be honest, neither the Rock nor Jason Statham are particularly great actors, but stick them in an action blockbuster and they shine. Their characters are fun, not to be taken seriously and are great to watch for two hours. The cast was augmented with Idris Elba, who, despite not being at his best, was fun to watch. The other main addition was Vanessa Kirby who was great in her role, playing a pretty interesting character. To top it all off there were some fantastic cameos who I won't name, as if you don't know who they are the surprise will be very fun.The plot was actually pretty decent. It had a good underlying premise, some good pacing and not as bad writing as I'd feared going in (although still very ludicrous in parts). Its entirely ridiculous, but who cares! Its fun and will keep you entertained. The action is also spot on. The Rock and Jason Statham trying to knock the stuffing out of Idris Elba... what's not to love?If you're looking for a great popcorn movie to relax and unwind to, then stick on Hobbs and Shaw for an adrenaline filled, flawed but entertaining experience.Oh an if you haven't seen any of the previous instalments don't let that stop you. The Rock is a maverick US agent, Jason Statham a rogue former British agent... they hate each other but ultimately are very similar.

139,nikola17,very great chemsty a great fast and fuious spin off that will blow you away,10,6 August 2019,"I was thinking of this is a great better spin off then to Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift spin off, because i thought this had a lot of great unrealistic action and crazy action scenes that you have never seen in any another fast and furious films this is crazy mindset as well, chemsty between Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson in a spin off of those 2 guys rather then seeing them in another fast and furious and ending the franchise to quickly. This movie is really self aware. It knows exactly what it is. And that is a good thing., but nothing problematic. It does have some awesome action, but what sells it even more is the chemistry between Johnson and Statham. I actually expected on Spin off fast and furious Hobbs and Shaw film and point and their back and forth dialogue was absolutely hilarious, or quarreling between them to be as entertaining as it was. But it was a lot of fun that won't keep you behind bored, and got quite a few big laughs like the jokes was funny moments were from the others at the press screening a lot of Levity in it, but it doesn't go to stupid direction where they try to do jokes but they failed it like any another marvel does but this doesn't like same director who did john wick, Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2 the director David Leitch now directing this movie is well done David Leitch's direction and the action sequences are both great. i loved it soo much he has put this movie in right direction. nothing like silly marvel film jokes push it too far over the hedge like it's over top well this movie has nothing like that, this has right jokes and made this movie funnier in right way, Some of the more over the top action scenes were great and fun and entering that what keeps you watching and keeps you hell of ride at edge of your seat Great CGI effects, great new action choreographyme at all. Excellent acting performance by Jason Statham a.k.a Shaw and Hobbs Dwayne Johnson the acting and script are fantastic are perfect and have incredible chemistry, making it consistently very funny throughout start to middle to end of film.story doesn't really conitue after fate of furious it has a lot of mention from another characters from another F&F films, but it does mention character like Mr Nobody Kurt Russell character and Helen Mirren who is not much in movie like prevous fate and furious but at least she gets more screening time then in previous film but she is in it their and their that's pretty much it, story is not a stand alone spin off it has to related to previous fast and furious and for story to fast 9 and 10. The cameos are unexpected it's just random just out nowhere you see a lot of famous actors playing cameos they weren't shown in trailer because they don't wanna spoil movie at all, but the trailers of this movie spoiled everything and toke everything away from this movie this is why i don't watch movie trailers nowadays because it takes away everything from movie.
story follows Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Shaw (Jason Statham) who were team before in fate and furious, are just enjoying life all that as normally but then you have new character Hattie Shaw (Vanessa Kirby) known for Mission impossible fallout who is a sister to Deckard Shaw who is their to get virus after all new villain witch i think he did a great job Brixton Black Superman"" and his interactions with the other three leads was gold (Idris Elba) who comes out of nowhere and Hattie is the one who inject who injects Snowflake into herself as a dormant carrier some type of virus in her that she stole stole Snowflake that forces her to run on so Brixtion is now hunting for her, then suddenly that's when CIA calls Hobbs and Shaw are both informed of the missing virus and are assigned to work together reluctantly to track it down
you have a funny scene together at room when they talk the crap each another i thought the writing and jokes that makes sense makes film perfect just perfect nothing stupid or going over top jokes just jokes about taking crap each another entire scene and film has great chemistry together in it. it's sad that Eiza González one of my favorite females of all time known for from dusk till dawn TV series, Baby driver, Alita Battle Angel she is not much in movie sadly but at least i liked her role in this more then in baby driver, so many crazy action scenes of them 2 Dwayne and Jason kicking ass in crazy wild action ride in unrealistic way, it had a lot of fight scenes of Jason statham All in all this is a solid action movie, with a good deal of comedy. I'll watch it again at some time, only then will I truly know how good it was it's really worth of your time for this movie it's worth it for your money to go and see that movie you will thank me later your missing out don't wait for anything just go and see this flick. this is something different for Fast and furious fans something different is sometimes better like this for explame this had a lot things in it, great cast, so much crazy action scenes, so much crazy stunts and unrealistic staff we never seen in another action films. I have seen all the fast and furious movies and although i am biggest fan of it i recokin you should give this a shot because your missing out so badly, so many locations where they filmed the film. The action scenes, continuing in the tradition of the Fast & Furious films to keep upping the stakes were sometime over-the-top, but they were so much fun to watch. The tech was also a bit too sci-fi to be believable, but actually worked quite well in the film because Britxton character is like sort a SC-FI costume half human, half machine sort of thing, incredible performance Jason Statham, Dwayne Johnson, Vanessa Kirby, Idris Elba great performance that worked the film well, and yes i understand this spin off went to fast and furious turning into mission impossible style. 10.10 go and see it The movie took $7.24m across its first weekend in the Australian box office, showing across 296 screens.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

I was kind of expecting (although I tried not to) the action movie of the year, if not decade. Was it? Uh-well.This movie is really self aware. It knows exactly what it is. And that is a good thing. It is slightly cheesy at times, but nothing problematic.
It does have some awesome action, but what sells it even more is the chemistry between The Rock and Statham. I actually didn't expect the banter, or quarreling between them to be as entertaining as it was. But it was, and got quite a few laughs from the others at the press screening.Some of the action is over the top, but some of it is more grounded. One of the bigger action scenes has some shaky cam.. why Leitch, WHY? Well, because it is suppose to come off as more hectic, I guess. I can almost accept that.For the most part the action is pretty clean, though. There is quite a bit of fighting, and it's pretty enjoyable. Not really anything mind blowing, but decent.Some of the more over the top action scenes has some CGI.. Slightly sloppy in a place or two. Also I'm not a big fan of the technology we see with one of the characters, this isn't the future. With that said though, technology is moving very fast these days, so I'll let it go.Idris Elba is good, and holy crap is he one handsome SOB!
Vanessa Kirby has some action scenes as well, btw.I almost haven't seen any trailers, so I don't know if it's in there, but there were a couple of cameos almost, from famous actors, and that was a pleasant surprise for me.All in all this is a solid action movie, with a good deal of comedy.

145,Magow-Intermean,Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw Review,9,11 August 2019,"Former antagonists Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) reluctantly team up to face the cyber-genetically enhanced villain Brixton Lore (Idris Elba) as he attempts to retrieve a bioweapon from Shaw's sister, Hattie (Vanessa Kirby). Ever since the ludicrous, immensely entertaining Fast Five, each new Fast & Furious instalment has been an exercise in preposterous escalation - from skydiving cars in Furious 7, to The Rock launching a torpedo with his bare hands in The Fate Of The Furious, and everything in-between. Far from the simpler times of the series being a Point Break homage about beautiful street racers boosting DVD players, each increasingly Fast & Furious movie amps up the absurd, testosterone-tinged action as it casts aside those boring laws of physics. Hobbs & Shaw falls at the point in the series' trajectory towards 'Fast & Furious...In Space' (as screenwriter Chris Morgan has suggested), where two special agents face off against a cult that believes that humanity's future lies in cyber-augmentation. It's a different flavour of Fast & Furious movie; while there's still plenty of vehicular carnage, the film focuses in on spycraft, fist fights and wacky buddy comedy. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and Jason Statham work wonders, but Vanessa Kirby steals the show with wry wit and casual lethality. As the film's attention mostly falls on this lead trio, Idris Elba relishes the squeezed time he has on screen, bringing entertaining swagger to an otherwise one-note character. David Leitch's direction brings familiar shades of John Wick and Atomic Blonde to the action. Intricately choreographed fights are splashed with neon, innocuous objects become deadly weapons (at one point, Statham wields a toaster), and Leitch gives each fight flair and clarity, playing to the different physicality of each performer. The camera quickly moves along with Statham's nimble, precise movements, slows down to clearly show Kirby's brutal dexterity and grace, and stays at a distance for Johnson's sequences to capture the actor's sheer intimidating size and strength. When it comes to the cars, Hobbs & Shaw is just as creative as its franchise forebears, one standout sequence involving a daisy chain of cars helping Hobbs lasso a helicopter. In keeping with Fast & Furious tradition, this action is balanced with earnest, genuinely sweet talk about the importance of family. This time, however, it's about connecting with one's roots and maintaining that contact, rather than finding family in those who come into your orbit. The strongest of these moments come from Hobbs' interaction with his Samoan relatives (Johnson himself being Samoan). This journey home brings both further warmth to a character known mostly for absurd displays of strength and even sillier one-liners, as well as a fun twist to a third-act showdown. Guns are traded for traditional war weapons, the usual pre-battle smack talk replaced with the Siva Tau (the Samoan Haka), a delightful and unique sight in a Hollywood action franchise. Hobbs & Shaw lies on shakier ground when it comes to its comedy, with a broader, more self-aware tone than the franchise's usual straight-faced sincerity. The vulgar insults come thick and fast (especially during some bizarre cameos), but don't always land. Still, Statham and Johnson hold even the faltering moments up through sheer charm, their chemistry never better than when the film lets them lean into the slapstick of two macho doofuses having to work together.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
146,Mike_Devine,Johnson and Statham make mediocre look good,6,14 March 2020,"The legacy that the 'Fast & Furious' franchise has left on our moviegoing public is hard to measure, but 2019's offshoot 'Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw' exemplifies how the 'Fusious' canon can live on even without all of the familiar faces we've come to know.Of course, the popularity of 'Hobbs & Shaw' is thanks to the popularity of its stars - Dwayne Johnson and Jason Stathm. These box office bad boys have contributed greatly to the franchise over the years, and the foil they represent to each other leads to unlikely chemistry. Johnson and Statham are joined by Idris Elba as the renegade bad guy Brixton and a familiar face to Netflix viewers in Vanessa Kirby as the badass Hattie.The film on its own is mediocre, thanks to an overdone plot and ""continent to continent"" scenery change, but the dialogue and quick-witted banter between the two protagonists is what makes it enjoyable.Sure, it's not going to ever be considered an amazing film, but 'Hobbs & Shaw' is a fun, action-packed ride that has a lot to offer in entertainment value.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

My jury was still firmly out until I watched this as I feared the sudden jump to sci-fi and actually embracing its ridiculousness would be a little B movie like and have no quality, however I was happy to be proven wrong. Statham and Johnson have undeniable chemistry which really carried the film with the almost buddy cop dynamic being rather entertaining to see and very charming providing some solid comedic moments. The science fiction aspects were surprisingly minor and oddly enough for such an outlandish premise and franchise as a whole were very believable which is testament to the quality of the film. It's also worth noting there's a certain brand of humour in this which I found suits my taste well, a host of deadpool approved meta humour occurs, with reference to the old man and the sea which was used to tease DP 2, Reynolds makes an appearance which was very welcoming and he's even joined by Rob Delaney hinting at another spin off in Locke and Loeb which after this, I'd be really interested in seeing. There's other surface jokes too like Statham referencing an 'Italian job' and a number of other celebrity cameos at various stages. Ending off with a prolonged 2 v 1 fight sequence it was a fitting way to wrap up Elba's involvement and felt satisfying and just. In all a pleasant surprise that was welcoming to see",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Director David Leitch (Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde) is certainly making a name for himself in bombastically crazy action and this one definately doesn't shy away from that. It's guaranteed fun from beginning to end thanks to some brilliant action set pieces and a great double act in the Rock and the Stath constantly ripping each other apart. It's so funny particularly when they first discover they have to work together; the frustration they both feel is hilariously done in some randomly comic insults they conjure up for each other! There's also good supporting roles from Elba as a genuinely threatening villain and Vanessa Kirby as Hattie who is a very cool character. Wonderful cameos from Helen Mirren and Eddie Marsan spice up the entertainment value as well as two uncredited cameos which are really well done!

152,shawneofthedead,"A muddled mess that will sorely test your patience and tolerance for poorly-written, testosterone-fuelled shenanigans.",3,1 August 2019,"THE LOW-DOWN: Sometimes, you build a cinematic universe by design (hopefully). Other times, you build it almost by accident. When The Fast And The Furious was released way back in 2001, no one could have foreseen it spawning a box-office-busting franchise that has since raked in more than $5 billion over eight films. Deciding to create this spin-off focusing on two of the franchise's newest and most charismatic additions - the titular Hobbs and Shaw - must have been a no-brainer. Unfortunately, this film feels like a literal no-brainer too, its weak, cluttered script mostly failing to support its inexplicably talented cast.THE STORY: If you've never watched a single Fast & Furious film (like this reviewer), you won't be too lost. It's fairly easy to pick up the threads of the spiky rivalry between American federal agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and British assassin-with-a-past Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). Their mutual loathing takes a back-seat when both men end up on the same mission: chasing down a potentially world-destroying super-virus embedded in Deckard's sister, MI6 agent Hattie Shaw (Vanessa Kirby). Hot on their heels is the cybernetically enhanced Brixton Lore (Idris Elba), who's hellbent on securing the super-virus for his sinister employers.THE GOOD: When deployed effectively, Johnson and Statham are marvels of charisma and comic timing - well able to steal scenes, if not entire films, with snappy, snarky ease. On occasion, their electric charm and chemistry flare to life during Hobbs & Shaw, but it doesn't happen often enough to save the film from its weak script and haphazard editing. That said, there's some joy to be had in watching Hobbs & Shaw's outrageously good supporting cast, which includes top-notch character actors like Helen Mirren and Eddie Marsan. Elba, for his part, acquits himself fairly well as a rampaging cyborg with a broken soul hidden somewhere beneath his menace and machinery.THE NOT-SO-GOOD: Unfortunately, the film never really lives up to the potential of its cast. The screenplay by Chris Morgan and Drew Pearce is frustratingly flabby. It's the kind of script in which a strong female character is only as strong as the film needs her to be - Kirby tries her best, but is given next to nothing to flesh out the role of Hattie. Hobbs & Shaw also fails to help its titular double act move from the sidelines into the spotlight. Their incredibly juvenile playground bickering and bantering becomes wearisome after a while, making it harder to buy into the film's attempts to delve into their histories and families. In grand Fast & Furious tradition, the action sequences are big and bonkers, bouncing from London to Moscow and even Samoa - but, shorn of effective character development, they also feel empty and soulless, strung together to pad out a running time that's already far too long.LOCK IT DOWN: If you're familiar with Leitch's recent filmography, you won't be surprised by an extended cameo in Hobbs & Shaw that proves to be one of the film's highlights. It's the kind of blithely cheeky stuff that Leitch has proven he can pull off well - he juggled heart and humour to great effect in Deadpool 2. But Hobbs & Shaw never quite knows what it wants to be - silly or earnest, dumb or dark - and winds up being neither and nothing.RECOMMENDED? Only if you're a Fast & Furious devotee, or a diehard fan of Johnson and/or Statham. Otherwise, Hobbs & Shaw is a muddled mess that will sorely test your patience and tolerance for poorly-written, testosterone-fuelled shenanigans.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
153,DeBBss,At Least It's Self-Aware,5,30 May 2020,"Hobbs & Shaw is an action-packed Fast & Furious spin-off that succeeds in action, but fails at everything else. I know that Hobbs & Shaw is supposed to be a dumb action movie that breaks all the laws of physics, but it really lacks in all the different categories of film making.It's a Fast & Furious spin-off, so of coarse the plot is going to be about saving the world. You really can't try and be original with such a plot, so why not go big or go home, and that's what Hobbs & Shaw does. There are action scenes that disregard physics and the limit of the human body, but at least it's entertaining. Hobbs & Shaw's action scenes are really creative and insane, so I have to give respect to the writers and stunt co-ordinators for thinking up all the these scenes and executing them. So, although Hobbs & Shaw is extremely predictable and has a lazy plot, it's entertaining enough to completely forget about the screenplay.The duo between Hobbs and Shaw is entertaining to watch, but there are so many jokes that don't land. When the duo both insult each other, there's obvious intended jokes, but a lot of them aren't all that funny. The villain, Brixton, played by Idris Elba is an extremely poorly written antagonist. There's nothing special about this villain and his motives are generic. There's no exposition about Brixton, so we know nothing about him or who he is, except that he's a cyborg.Hobbs & Shaw is a lazy and predictable movie that adds nothing to the action genre. Maybe I'm being hard, because I know that this movie is supposed to dumb and entertaining. I just really hated how lazy the antagonist and plot is. Hobbs & Shaw is a 5 for me, but it does have the entertainment factor, so at least it's watchable.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

NOw we get spinoffs with the already too famous and rich Rock and Transporter actors, as if they needed more cash. The movie is straight out of sci fi, but on the lowest end of the spectrum. Like how harry potter is on the low end of the spectrum ( just about) for fantasy and magic.
The Hobbs & Shaw films was fairly entertaining at times, but more with the banter than with the pulled punches and try hard ""action"" throughout the rest of the film. ANd that a cybernetically enhanced tough guy, played by IDris Elba, cant even pull off anything really impressive, made me shake my head too often during the film.

director:David Leitch
starring: Dwayne Johnson,Jason Statham,Vanessa Kirby,Idris Elba,Helen Mirren,Eiza Gonzalez,Eliana Sua etcoverall rating 73/100Hobbs and shaw is a spin off on the fast and furious franchise this time focusing on Luke Hobbs ( Dwayne Johnson) and Deckerd Shaw ( Jason Statham) and is based on a possible genocide caused by a deadly virus with genetically enhanced villain ( Idris Elba) tries to retrieve the virus for bad its down to Hobbs and shaw to put aside there differences and work together. Hobbs and shaw was incredibly entertaining and one of the funniest films i have seen this year and most certainly held together by the comedic chemistry of the leading actors. Lets go into more detail about this.Lets start of with the films incredible action. This film did an excellent job at keeping you on the edge of your seat and consistently entertained throughout the whole film. All the amazing set pieces really did create interesting scenarios for the action to take place. And of course they used highly unusual things such as toasters and pans when fighting which just made the film that bit more entertaining to watch.Next the action was helped by the amazing aesthetics and scenery throughout hobbs and shaw. The set locations were truly incredible during the film. Whether it was the massive factory,the streets of london or the beautiful island of somoa the film looked beautiful and made the action more creative. I also loved the colour palette of the film. In a lot of the rooms within houses there was bold striking colours like blues and purples that was aesthetically pleasing to the eye and just offered something different.Next the film had a good idea for the villain. Despite being considered superhuman which yes seems ridiculous for a fast and furious kind of movie but Idris Elbas passion and charisma really made his kind of character work. He had many cheesy but still great one liners that really made him stand out during the film. And his technology based motorcycle was also a great addition to the movie as well so his character and his personality worked. However i do have to say that Idris Elba as the villain was unfortunately very one dimensional. His character had no form of depth to him whatsoever and there was no character development for him either so you could not really connect to him as a person during the film it was all very simply lade out to the audience. What his powers were and his aim and that was it. It just felt very simple and lazily put together i prefer more complex villains. And i thought how he was defeated at the end was underwhelming.Next the film was absolutely hilarious,in fact one of the funniest films of the year. There was so many funny and likeable characters. There was two reasons why the film was so funny. First of all the amazing cameos. Having Ryan Reynolds and Kevin Hart in the film was a genuinely nice surprise. And they both did amazing with what little screen time they had. They are both so accomplished as comedians know so they are funny in whatever role they are in and this was no different. Ryan reynolds banter with dwayne johnson was great. And Kevin Hart being a crew member on the plane worked perfectly for him both actors were hilarious. But what really made this film funny and kept the whole film together in my opinion is Dwayne Johnson and Jason Stathams excellent comedic chemistry. Wow these two worked brilliantly together. There constant bickering and insults towards each other really made the film work and was hilarious to watch. They played both of these characters so well and i am glad they got a film to showcase this.However i do have to add that the script was incredibly cheesy. Whether it was Idris Elba boasting about being black superman or Dwayne Johnson being his regular cheesy self. The script was slightly to cringe inducing in places and got my eyes rolling on a few occasions it worked in some places but not in others.Next the film was incredibly over the top which for the most part worked in its favour. The fast and furious films especially the newer ones have been know to be absolutely ridiculous with its action sequences and people surviving things that they would not be able to do in real life and Hobbs and shaw was no different. Whether if it was the use of weapons or cars somehow landing perfectly on ramps and destroying things with ease you certainly had to take the film with a pinch of salt and not take it to seriously which i think thats what the director was going for. However i do have to say the film did go slightly to far with the ridiculousness of some of its action sequences. There was just to many scenes especially in somoa where the characters would of been dead. It was either jumping of mountains and being fine or managing to keep a helicopter near you on a chain without it flying away. It became unnecessarily funny in places and lost its credibility slightly.I also loved that the film kept the theme of family very much still in the focus of Hobbs and shaw. This has become such a important thing in the fast and furious franchise that i am glad that they still kept it for this spinoff. It makes you connect to the film more as you relate to the characters as being like you with doing anything for there family.
now for my final positive and negative. Firstly Vanessa Kirby was a real standout in the film and delivered a excellent acting performance. She was an absolute badass in the film which was nice to see as she could of easily been overshadowed by the two lead male roles. But Kirby really held her own in this film and felt as important and delivered in the action sequences as much as Jason and Dwayne. I hope this gives her a lot more work as she deserves it. However finally i have to say the film had no depth to its characters or plot. It all felt just like i said with the villain of the film very simple. It was all what you see is what you get and nothing else. All the characters were one dimensional and had one clear motive and no development was made to there personalities or character. The plot was simple there was no real plot twists or anything that took you by surprise. I was expecting this going into the theatre but it would of been nice if the film changed my mind.Overall Hobbs and shaw delivers another action packed instalment in the fast and furious franchise. and its held together by its humour,acting performances and comedic chemistry between the leads. But unfortunately comes across more of a great piece of entertainment rather then a well put together film like the previous instalments in the franchise who unfortunately were better then this.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

162,thebricks,Meh in just about every way,5,2 August 2019,"The Rock is just way too self-aware. He's heading to B-movie land fast but I guess he's made enough money to live comfortably before he gets there. He does the same thing in every movie, showing off his muscles, working out, flashing trademark facial expressions, bringing up his Samoan background and heritage, it's just obnoxious.Most people under 20 would probably not believe how this franchise started out. How did it get from an FBI agent investigating a car tuner to becoming a spy franchise? It's not even a good one because it just rips off better movies. I was making a list during the film, it was embarrassing.Jason Statham turns in his reliable phoned in performance, no more and no less. The man takes zero risks! Vanessa Kirby for some reason decided to go from a fantastic role in a great spy franchise in Mission Impossible to slumming in this low-grade trash heap. This is really the best she could do? Why not call Marvel and ask them for a job? Anything but this! Idris Elba has really disappointed me, from settling for a minor supporting cast role in the Thor movies to phoning it in in every movie he's in. The last time this man has been forced to actually act was The Wire. His acting abilities went down with Stringer Bell in that Baltimore condo. It's sad.I have no idea how critics gave this great reviews. It's just bad and uninspired. A new low for the Fast and Furious franchise. Worse yet, they don't ever want to stop making these movies.

First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Fast and Furious: Hobbs and Shaw. Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) form a dysfunctional partnership to save the world. What's not to like? Eye candy for the girls (and no doubt some of the boys) action for the boys (and the girls), a frankly ridiculous plot, nothing really new.....our heroes on a tight time schedule to save the world ...... but the whole thing works. Admit it, we love car chases, explosions, good guys, bad guys, the whole caboodle, it began with cowboys and Indians, took us into space fighting aliens and as long as there are writers to reinvent the whole time , our film industries around the world will continue to flourish and draw the audiences to the cinemas. This film was very watchable, and although directed by David Leitch the producers numbered one Statham and one Johnson. Idris Elba made an outstanding bad guy (I personally think he'd made a great Bond). Did the Fast and Furious title make me watch it.....probably, but it was a film on its own, not as compelling as the rest of the genre but a good watch nonetheless.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Stathom knows real tough guys ""act nice"", but Johnson is still ""acting tough"" the whole way through which comes across fake... as do all the other supposed tough characters.At one point in the movie there is a samoan war dance. This is one of the greatest things for realism you can add to a movie, but here they used the first and last three seconds, and softened the impact of the end. In the fight scene afterwards, it is acted with realism, but they used shakey cam and cliche panic music over the top (typically used to cover bad acting), so you couldn't see the good acting...",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

167,joeyford-55342,Fun popcorn flick that dismisses basic physics for stunts but gets some laughs,8,8 August 2019,"We liked it! It is what you expect ... fun but impossible stuff. Shown in the previews: motorcycles don't climb walls, a 5 ton chain of cars can't pull a helicopter with two wheels on the ground, a man can't hold a helicopter in place with his biceps, a motorcycle can't come apart to slide under a truck then come back together on the other side to ride away. Those type of stunts just get a good laugh from the audience. All in the previews , all ridiculous. But the comic value outweighed the stupidity. The comic banter between Hobbs and Shaw and the sister was great. The cameos were outstanding. It was a fun date night. There was some unnecessary language, out of place and silly. Just because you are allowed 3 ""F-words"" and keep you PG13 rating, doesn't mean you have to use them all in a ""family friendly movie.""",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Not a great fan of Fast and Furious, as I found it lacks substance and is bubble gum action.This one is great fun throughout, even though it's essentially cartoon James Bond. Very funny consistently and very good action sequences. They do encroach on Superman abilities many times, but I could forgive. A good job by director Leitch, although not as good as his Deadpool 2.Statham was good, not great. I read that he didn't think he was funny before the Melissa McCarthy movie. He was funny in that but rang flat in this several times. He is a good fighter, so that helps.Vanessa Kirby did her job well and was an ass-kicker early on. I didn't even notice initially that Shaw and his ""sister"" are actually 21 years apart.Elba was very good as the bad guy, although he really wasn't given much to work with.Vanessa Kirby sold her fighting skills very well but lacked a bit of grit that she needed.

170,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,So far Best action movie of the year 2019,10,27 August 2019,"Spin-off of The Fast and the Furious franchise really surprised me with John Wick Chapter 3 is one of my favorite movies of this year 2019. Hobbs & Shaw is a good action movie better than nowdays movies. Fast & Furious movies are better. Hobbs & Shaw and The Fate of the Furious gets so much hate and criticism this year. I don't get the hate for this franchise. Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham did a good job reprising their characters from Furious 7 and The Fate of the Furious. David Leitch did directed the film well it was a fast paced action film I enjoy it. With my closest friend I went to see it in the movie teather this Saturday this movie and I had a fun and blast watching it.It is entertaining fast paced fun action film and it is about a programmable supervirus named 'Snowflake' MI6 agents try to to retrieve from a terrorist group but the operation goes horrible awry when a terrorist team called Eteon attacks them. A freelancer Brixton Lore, an Eteon operative with cybernetic implants that allow him to perform superhuman feats, arrives and kills all the agents except Hattie Shaw (Vanessa Kirby). The girl implants the virus on her self and she become a rogue agent on the run and evreryone is after her. Eteon frames her for the murder of the agents that she didn't do it. CIA black site hiers Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) to retrive the virus and catch the rogue agent. It turns out Hattie is Deckard's sister and Hobbs has to protect Hattie with Deckard at all cost against a terrorists after the virus and find a machine that will get out the virus out of the girl.Since Dwayne Johnson become hated from Vin Diesel and Tyrese Gibson cause he dosen't get along with these 2 actors he was fierd, but he got his own movie Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw instead. I absolutelly love this movie. Dwayne Johnson is excellent and a real bad-ass as Luke Hobbs I love his character so much. Jason Statham is still a British bad-ass as Deckard Shaw I love his character. Hobbs and shaw are bad-asses they kick a lot of asses both of them. Vanessa Kirby as Hattie Shaw MI6 Agent is a sexy, beautiful pretty girl a hot babe in this movie. I love her in here so much. Idris Elba as Brixton Lore is a bad-ass villian who he is a cyber-genetically enhanced terrorist awesome. We have Deadpool in this movie Ryan Reynoldshimself in here I wish he would have more to do. Hellen Miran also appears she is great. Roman Reigns WWE superstar also has a lot do in this movie.The action scenes are well practical done, they are little CGI but it dosen't bother me. Great high chases. Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw are in my top 6 Fast & Furious movies. The Fate of the Furious gets a lot of hate in my opinion I enjoy and like both of the films. I did ranked Fast & Furious from best to worst in April on my other channel I alreayd review, them but I will start re watching the films soon and I will review them also on this channel.

If to this we add the fact that Ryan Reynolds and Kevin Hart have the best dialogues, we begin to realize that the film's great weakness is trying to make a spectacular action movie but that it fails in several points and that is why it has no choice but to look. To make laugh. As an action film, it gives us a lot of investment and few alternatives to identify with the characters; it's full of clichés and there's hardly any room not to yawn. It is long, tedious at times and if it weren't for the jokes it would be insufferable. Thank God they didn't make a sequel.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
172,WalkdenEntertainment,"Fast Action, Some Laughs and Lots of Whopping",7,14 January 2020,"Introducing the 9th instalment in the Fast & Furious franchise, only this time fans are given a spin-off movie featuring Luke Hobbs (Dawyne Johnson) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). The two are forced to work together after they become aware of a virus which could wipe out all humanity. The deadly virus is currently stored inside the body of Shaw's sister, an MI6 agent. She and the virus require protection from an enhanced villain (or as he calls himself, a black Superman) played by Idris Elba.After the success of seeing the two leading characters interact with each in ""Fate of the Furious"", I was generally pleased to hear the two would return with their very own film. As you would expect being a part of the world of Fast & Furious, the film is loaded with insane (and rather far fetched) action sequences. But the key for this film simply is the chemistry of Hobbs & Shaw, who are constantly ""roasting"" one another because they hate the idea of working with each other.The film also tries to bring more depth to both leads but it all relates to talking about their family and relationships. While this idea sounds good, it all comes off very cheesy and the film becomes predictable, leaving you knowing what's going to happen before the credits come on the screen.Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) appears to be more over confident about himself than what I remember. There are countless times where I rolled my eyes because Hobbs has to say a ""one liner"" to everyone before he swings a hard punch at a bad guy.I also have an issue with film's last 20-30mins which feels unnecessary and forced. Based on other reviews, I'm glad I'm not alone here. It also makes the journey prior to this last act somewhat pointless in regards to plot.Overall, the film generally delivers what I expected- random one liners with nonstop brainless action. The film sets up another a future spin off and leaves some questions unanswered. The film also delivers an extra 30mins which felt out of place and somewhat forced. If it's popcorn you wish to eat and brainless giggles you want, here is it. As a 9th instalment, it's really a side step from the series but I can't deny there's still lots of enjoyment to be had.6.6/10

First of all, it's the chemistry between the Rock and Jason ""Sexy"" Statham. They're so fu*king good together. Their absolutely hilarious and magnetic to watch, and they kick ass to satisfyingly together. I hope there is a sequel to this movie just so I can see them on screen together again. Secondly, this film features some of the craziest, most entertaining action so far this year. You'll see things that are basically from a video game, but it's done so well that you won't be able to help yourself from climaxing multiple times from the seismic amount of energy that's being shown on screen. I'm not even joking. The action is ridiculous, and knows it's ridiculous, which makes it all the more fun to watch. You'll see flat out insane stunts that no doubt came from the minds of mental patients that the producers must have consulted on what they'd like to see in this movie. From transformable motorcycles, to a bunch of shirtless men with spears fighting against a fully armed militia, you'll see everything you expected, and then some.Also, Vanessa Kirby is probably the most attractive actress I've ever seen. Thank God that she has a giant amount of screentime in this movie because every time she was on screen I found myself getting aroused, if you catch my drift. Listen Vanessa, if you ever want to grab drinks I promise you that I'll pay. But besides her looks, she is genuinely good with this movie. She knows that she's starring in a ludicrous film, and she plays her character accordingly badass. Her fight scenes were cool to watch, and when she kisses a certain character in this movie I found myself crying from jealously.Look, there ain't much to criticize about this movie. Is it perfect? No, of course not. The only perfect movie is ""Backdoor Sluts 9."" This is a fast and furious movie, you get what you pay for. And what you're paying for is a fun, ridiculous, badass time at the movie theatre. Trust me, you'll have a good time.8/10",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

First, watch it without having F&F back ground and you might like it. It's awfully, a never ending movie, its has ends, but than that is not the end, there is another and even that not is, it just goes on and on and on.
Weak directions on many part, it takes seconds from Dawn, to broad day light, to cloud covers over Krypton inspired mountains to again bright sunny day on a island. The makers have no idea guess what so ever, what time they shot the last scene.
Than the producers realized that perhaps Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham jokes aren't funny so they bring in the only Action actor with some comic timings and that is Ryan Reynolds who is being credit at the bottom of the list. But adding more to the boring lines they bring in Kevin Hart, who presence in the movie was really not at all needed and nothing adds up to the movie>

186,FallenEye,Balls Jokes & Woman Featuring Deadpool.,6,4 August 2019,"Repetitive repartee, cartoonish action and flat comedy for the most part. Hobbs and Shaw lacks the heart and soul of the Fast and Furious franchise, while being useless and aimless in the process. Yes, we all know that the F&F franchise is outlandish, but, it always had some sort of substance holding it together and making it a solid product. This movie, has no substance. It's a wreck, that is almost fun, until it's not.This movie is not Fast, because it feels too long, nor is it Furious because, it's not even an action movie; it's a comedy. The idea of this spin off was a good one, but now that it has materialized, it's proving that sometimes too much of a good thing, is just not great at all.And, what the hell was Deadpool doing in this movie??? Ryan was being 100% Deadpool. Whatever character he was supposed to be playing, he wasn't, and I guess we have David Leitch to thank for that. Like seriously, it was dead on Deadpool, and it wasn't funny, or at least, as funny as it was meant or could've or should've been, which is unfortunate, since again, this was a comedy picture.Hobbs & Shaw truly is pointless, and the weakest in the F&F franchise. It's not a bad movie, but it's not a good one either. The best part of this movie was Idris Elba, and not by much. Hobbs wasn't Hobbs anymore and Shaw is better as a villain. Since this is the result we got, the this should never have been made. A meh, 6/10.But, with issues like Hobbs sliding down steel cables with his bare flesh and not burning and tearing through his skin in a flick with a story weaker than a wet tissue to counteract the disbelief, I can understand if anyone rated this movie even lower.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Hobbs and Shaw was, entertaining, it brings us the over the top action, all the talk about family and a pretty good performance by Venessa Kirby. But the highlight of the movie was the constant one liners between Hobbs and Shaw, by far the most entertaining part of the movie.This is a franchise that has been played to death at this point but at least for now they are still finding ways to make interesting over the top action while racking in plenty of money; so, I guess there's no stopping this fast and furious train now.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
188,asifahsankhan,This is a cheerful addition to the F&F family and a must see for the fans!,8,1 August 2019,"Plotwise, Hobbs and Shaw doesn't give anything we haven't seen before and isn't trying to pretend otherwise. The film makes it obvious that the pair are going to bicker and then make up, and it makes that aspect feel half-assed. Even a pair that is supposed to hate each other should have chemistry, but Johnson and Statham mostly phone in their animosity, save for a few good scenes. Their ostensibly humorous bickering mostly consists of taunts about ugly faces or grating voices that lack any real wit (maybe in the inevitable sequel the pair can go undercover on RuPaul's Drag Race where they learn how to give a proper read). Once the two start to work in tandem they develop chemistry, but that doesn't happen until we're in the final act.What it consistently delivers, however, is tons of action that will stimulate your adrenal gland, if not your cerebrum. Leitch (who directed the first John Wick, as well as Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2) knows how to keep the set pieces from becoming too one-note by alternating between car chases, gunplay, and old-fashioned fist fighting. He also knows that the action is the most important part of the movie, making sure that we don't go more than 20 minutes without some sort of violence happening on screen. This keeps the 136-minute runtime feeling brisk, and is a welcome break from the comedic relief.While the action is fantastic, there are some aspects of it that stretch belief. Some of them are hand-waived away by Brixton's cybernetic enhancements (He starts out a chase scene by carrying Hattie/Kirby while running vertically down the side of a skyscraper and ends it by managing to slide under two moving trucks without a scratch), but the ones portrayed by non-enhanced human became almost parodic, culminating in a scene where Hobbs manages to hang onto a chain that is attached to an ascending helicopter without any being lifted up. This ridiculous stunt made even the most enthusiastic audience members groan in protest.Hobbs and Shaw attempts to transcend its meatball plot by leaning into its thematic elements, to mixed results. The story is set in motion by a mysterious group that wants to advance the human race with technological advancements. As such, the plot does venture into a Diet Coke version of the transhumanist debate, with it (predictably) landing on the side of ""stay human"" crowd. However, it doesn't really focus on what constitutes humanity or the ethics of changing the human body with technology and instead focuses on the unethical way they want to achieve their goals. In the end, the transhumanist theme feels like a way for the filmmakers to inject aspects of the megapopular superhero genre into a franchise that was about as far removed from the superhero genre as an action film can get.This is a cheerful addition to the F&F family and a must see for the fans!",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Shaw's sister Hattie (Vanessa Kirby) injects herself with the virus so it doesn't go into bad guys hands. This causes Brixton to capture Hattie so he can extract the virus from her so the larger army can be formed.There are 2-things that go on for too long: 1) The fight scenes, of course and 2) the insults that Hobbs and Shaw inflict on each other and none are clever or funny. To be fair, you will see many CGI stunts that you have never seen before, that is if you decide to watch this. Oh, and yes the movie is too long too. And oh, yes, there are many chase scenes that also go on for too long, but here you will see some fantastic CGI. Lucky you.Notables: Helen Mirren as Queenie, Shaw's mother who is in prison; Eddie Marsan as professor Andreiko who invented the virus; Cliff Curtis as Johah, Hobbs' brother; Ryan Renolds as CIA Agent Locke who tries to get Hobbs and Shaw to work together; Keven Hart as Air Marshal Dinkley.Too many action scenes, but keep in mind this is related to the Fast And Furious thing.This is watchable, but not all that entertaining.

Fairly mindless action with just enough story to keep the drool off your chin. Where this film differs from most other action films is in its balance between character charismatics and action.

A way too long samoa tribute that clearly Johnson has wanted to wedge into any movie he could; that felt slapped on the movie that felt off from the rest of the movie. I would have rathered him do a movie that was natural to using Samoa as a setting. Yet, Samoa was the only real part that seemed to be the ""fast and furious "" scenes hinting to the namesake. And so many scripted scenes to appease the Rocks Ego. His nonchalantand charm was replaced with blatant superego. And sad to see Stratham as a sidekick which the show seemed to advertise as equal footing. Despite that. Stratham was by far the better part of the movie.

193,monkeysgalore,Touched By God,10,5 March 2020,"Yes, that's right. This movie is that awesome. Over-the-top, cartoonish, and awesome. This movie is just pure insanity. It is easily the Commando (1985) of 2019.Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham became the best things about the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise as soon as they were introduced, you can't deny that. Both were immensely more charismatic than Vin Diesel or Paul Walker, as entertaining as those two may be. It's obviously true, as the pair now have their own spinoff movie. This was a great move. Both characters have been well developed and handled up to this point, and have no business letting the F&F characters upstage them.Remember when the F&F films started to take themselves less seriously and slowly became more fun and successful? This occurred around Fast Five (2011), and by Fast & Furious 7 (2015), it was even more apparent that they could laugh at themselves, with The Rock playing himself as usual. Well this film steps it up. It pokes fun at itself much more than the F&F films, and at times, is almost a comedy. It's basically a live-action cartoon, and it's a joy to watch. The film pretty much coasts on Johnson and Statham's chemistry, to its credit, and the result is a lot of fun. This film has some of the funniest and snappiest dialogue that I've seen in any recent films. ""Hobbs & Shaw"" borders on self-parody throughout its runtime, and it's quite entertaining.The action is loud and explosive. There are three crazy chases, and too many fight scenes to list. All of the action scenes are fun and entertaining, and never get tired or dull. Much of the action does rely on special effects and CGI at times, but it doesn't look cheap or detract from the fun. The helicopter/truck chase near the end was very creative and highly implausible, but that's the F&F franchise as a whole. The final fight was brutal and awesome, and it was obviously inspired by Lethal Weapon 4 (1998). Actually, so was a lot of this movie. Anyway, it's very action-packed, definitely deserving of the F&F title, and maybe even one of the most action-filled action movies out there.This movie definitely represents a potential turning point for the F&F franchise. It could keep on its normal path and still probably be successful, but it also could do more experimentation as it did here. This movie is loads of fun and definitely worth your time, especially if you're a Rock/Statham fan.Also, to the people whining that this isn't a true F&F film, what do you think ""Fast & Furious Presents"" means? It's not supposed to be just another F&F movie. Just in the same vein.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

202,RhapsodyReviews,"Fun, But Unnecessary.",6,10 November 2019,"Review:
'Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw' is an action film directed by David Leitch.
Call me old fashioned, but I liked it when the 'Fast & Furious' franchise was about racing cars with some family drama mixed in. Now we have a bad guy that is basically the anti-Robocop who literally states to the audience that he is a 'bad guy'. I didn't by any means hate this movie, but I'm not going to blow smoke up its ass like a lot of movie reviewers have been because it has the brand that is loved.
The film revolves around US Diplomatic Security Service Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and lawless outcast Shaw (Jason Statham) who don't enjoy each others company after they swapped smacks and bad words. But when cyber-genetically enhanced anarchist Brixton's (Idris Elba) ruthless actions threaten the future of humanity, both join forces to defeat him.
The acting in the movie is great. We have all bought into the characters of Hobbs and Shaw in previous installments of the franchise and they are brought to life again perfectly. Idris Elba is a good addition to the cast, but I didn't like his character he portrayed one bit, no fault of his own. I had no idea who
Vanessa Kirby was going into this movie, and she blew me away as Shaw's younger sister.
This movie is balls to the wall entertainment in a nutshell. It has a good action story while still keeping the family element of the franchise. Where it falls short is the main villain doesn't make any sense to be in a world like this, and it turned the franchise from a unrealistic racing/heist film series to a fantasy world. Also, I watched the movie twice and there is no reason to have Dwayne Johnson in this movie aside from the final 20 minutes of the film. I feel like he was in it because the studio knows he sells tickets. That's just my two cents on that matter.
Overall, being as entertaining as it is, the movie has its faults. If you can take it out of the world of the 'Fast and Furious' than it is a good stand-alone action film. Just doesn't make any sense having the brand.

203,gilleliath,double (bald) header,8,23 February 2020,"Far less po-faced than the main F&F series, as long as this concentrates on head-butting between the Stath, the Rock and the Idris Elba, it's really entertaining. Frankenstein-meets-Wolfman type things rarely add up to the sum of their parts, but here the actors seem to enjoy sending up their personas for laughs; and their schtick doesn't undermine the action which is top-notch. Vanessa Kirby, as a relative unknown, manages to keep her end up with the boys (oo-er) very well, is a believable action hero in her own right, and avoids being a mere annoyance as such roles often are. Unfortunately the over-long finale is more typical of F&F, CGI car chases and a bit of sanctimonious wafflel.I hope they don't feel the need to turn this into yet another long-running franchise - it works largely because of its novelty value - but as a stand-alone film it's good value: a mindless action film for people who don't usually like mindless action films.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

I didn't think the previews of this was anything great but I love The Rock, Jason Statham, and Idris Elba. The story is a little out there for even this series.Apparently Idris Elba is a superhuman bad guy (or Black Superman) and Shaw's sister becomes powerful just like him and carries this virus that can destroy the world. Hobbs and Shaw go after her, and so does black Superman.As usual, The Rock and Jason Statham has excellent chemistry and there are some funny scenes. Idris Elba just seemed to be there, and sometimes feels shoehorned into the script to remind audiences he's in this movie. There's a lot of good action scenes and there are a couple of cameos in the film I wasn't expecting.At the end of the day, it feels like a typical Hollywood summer film. It probably won't leave much of an impression on you and you might forget you ever saw this.

207,arabnikita,How dumb can action get before it becomes uwatchable?,4,1 August 2019,"There are well done action movies where action is slightly unrealistic but I give them the benefit of the doubt for the sake of the plot. Then there are Fast and Furious movies where both plot and action defy the laws of nature but at least it looks good. Now, there is Hobbs and Shaw where the word common sense does not apply and things just happen for the sake of happening to the point where I felt my brain melting from the plot, dialogue and action.The ride starts off nicely with cool character introductions, solid fight sequences and snappy one liners that made the movie look promising. Unfortunately, the fuel ran out pretty quickly and they decided to fill up the tank with a mixture of Redbull and expired milk. As it progressed, the crazy sequences kept on piling on top of each other in an attempt to create some excitement not knowing that the audience has already left the car and is watching it drive off the cliff.What carries the film is the chemistry between Rock and Statham combined with hit and miss humor plus some surprising appearances; oh, and very cool motorcycle. Hobbs and Shaw is a nice movie to watch with your friends and make fun off if you are a fan of the franchise. It felt 3 hours long from how much it tried to be about saving the world and nonsensical ideas instead of just being a proper action movie.

208,achyutaghosh,Hobbs and Shaw- Mindless fun.,8,4 August 2019,"What started off 18 years ago with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker starring in an illegal street racing and car hijacking movie has grown over the years. The Fast and Furious cast has become bigger and bigger- Dwayne Johnson, Tyrese Gibson, Gal Gadot, Michelle Rodriguez, Ludacris, Sung Kang, and Jason Statham all joining in at various points. The plots have become more and more ludicrous and the action has gone global too. All these guys would not even fit in the same frame, and the producers wanted to prepare for life after Fast & Furious too, so at some point a spin-off was necessary. Ergo- Hobbs and Shaw, which tries to build on the budding bromance between hulking federal agent played by Dwayne Johnson and the smooth mercenary played by Jason Statham. Was it fun- yes it was!It is a Fast and Furious presentation after all, so as far as the plot is concerned, all that really matters are the 3 F's - family, fast cars/bikes and of course, fate of the world. But to start with, a lot of time is devoted to setting up the characters, who actually are not too different as far as end outcomes are concerned.Luke Hobbs: ""I'm what you call an ice-cold can of whoop-ass""Deckard Shaw: ""I'm what you might call a champagne popper""There is a virus than can destroy half the world population. There is a secret terrorist organization Eteon which is hellbent on acquiring the virus. Shaw's sister Hattie, an MI6 agent injects the virus into her and escapes Eteon's agents. Hobbs and Shaw get together to save Hattie and the world, with a little help from all the Samoans Hollywood could put together.Director David Leitch is a former stuntman who has impressed in John Wick and Atomic Blonde, and with the firepower at his disposal he needed a worthy villain. Idris Alba gives us one.Luke Hobbs: ""He really is Black Superman""Probably not Superman, but as cyber-genetic enhanced Brixton Lore, Elba is definitely close to Captain America. And he relishes the role- strutting around and beating the living daylights out of the dynamic duo.Hobbs and Shaw scores zero in originality- plot points are lifted from every action movie in the last decade- there is a Dark Knight inspired high rise building entry, there is a Winter Soldier inspired helicopter pull scene, there is a MI Fallout like bike chase sequence, a corridor fight like Old Boy, Russian factory scene from any Bond movie, with a script full of high school insults like in Mean Girls, and as far as saving the world is concerned, it is 4th time already for Johnson within the Fast and Furious franchise itself.Speaking of whom, this may be Hobbs and Shaw, but it is an out and out Hobbs movie where Johnson gets the widest canvas ever- action, emotion, even a bit of romance. Statham is serviceable, but his accent is a pain, and he simply cannot better his comedic turn in Spy. Vanessa Kirby as Hattie though is a scene stealer, as is the tug of war between the Hobbs family cars and that errant helicopter. The end credits tease the future directions for this spin-off series, and the cameos itself point to the exciting probable expanded star cast.Zero brain. Zero depth. Caricatures all the way.

Yet failed so much in other aspects that I can't give it more than 4 stars and I am sad that people who are giving it 10 are the same people who give some amazing similar action movies 3-4/10 because ""there was little story""...1.

So I don't demand a Shakespeare's story, when I buy the ticket. But I also know that I will not be disappointed - because of the predecessors I know what to deal with. Even though there is no Shakespeare-like story, the characters are known well and build a bridge to the plot. And then the action rises. Some little comedic fun inbetween livens it up and so it's a nice cocktail for action fans. In a wanted way.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

214,skullhead739,Very cheesy but exciting,7,3 June 2020,"Acting:
Wow the cast in this is just full of A listers, theres too many for me to list. Everyone did great in their roles especially dwayne and Jason. My only gripe is that some scenes had kind of cringy/really cheesy lines and acting but other than that it was good. The inclusion of Kevin hart and ryan Reynolds was a great off pace bit of comedy, I loved it. I do think having cliff curtis as dwayne Johnson's brother was a extremely crappy choice though. The man isnt samoan, did a terrible accent and looks nothing like dwayne. Why not use Dwaynes cousin who is his stuntman or even his real older brother!. Terrible choice.Cinematography/special affects:
Crazy good special affects and camera work as always. I have no complaints on shots or stunts. Every fight scene is believable and the slow mo punch scenes add to the realism. I love how if there is lots of goons they dont fight one at a time like many other movies. Instead all of them rush either Jason or dwayne and they even get hit occasionally, well done.Story:
The most cheesy,cliche and over done story of the whole f&f franchise. However I dont mind cheesy stories so I wasnt affected too much. Now even for me who likes a bit of cheese in films found this a bit too much at times. Other than that all the protagonists have a feud going on and as a result makes for really interesting and suspenseful character dynamics. The story is suspenseful and filled with action. But not too much where it becomes boring. The additive of samoa was great. The addition of sci fi elements are a bit far fetched and the tattoo scene is completely wrong. Tattoo machines have a pedal to activate them. Dwayne activated it by almost pushing a button on the side which was weird. Overall the story could have been much better.Summary:
Not the best f&f film and could have had a much better story. Although I would recommend this as the cast, stunts and charisma make for a enjoyable expierence. If you dont mind a bit of cheesiness I think it's worth a watch.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

I can't find any emotional investment in them, especially when they blatantly feel like money grabs which most of them do. This film is no exception.

This isn't a superhero movie or even a sci fi and is not in the same genre; people must learn what that is, instead it's more like a special effects packed action fuelled fast paced blockbuster with brilliant technology, style, money and humour. You can expect the level of nonsense nowadays more so because most of the fast and furious entries lately have been too over the top they were from the start. Now, you've the very best in action stars Jason Statham who at only five foot nine took the usual hammering in terms of a roasting from the Americans. Plus you've Dwayne who looked amazing in this until the later stages when he appeared to have lost his entire pump with the amount of work he had put in. The two characters got at one another in the same way Kevin hart does which was fun at first then became tiring. The film was at its best when it was more serious. Future tip dial down the undue excess, dial down the immature phrases and dial down the special effects and you've instead of showing off all the money most of the cities you filmed in just do not have, actually use what was best in the film, old school and charisma. Special mention for the females in this movie, the extras including the army of bad guys were very poor in this almost made this comic book like, but the female lead did her part even if she was just a spare part towards the end. Statham was bound to produce coming from some silly films such as spy and the Meg, whereas Dwayne had to pump up to de-emphasise his ageing stubble, the two looked remarkable they got on well. Jason is better when he's no nonsense serious and so is the rock with that added humour and banter.

My friends and a few people in the crowd were shocked at what Hobbs does with Hattie in that scene.° There was A good Joke between Hobbs and Shaw, some other Funny Jokes from 2 other people.Things that did not work:° Hobbs and Shaws' Chemistry from Fast 8 is no where to be found in this movie. It is completely different.° Most of The Jokes from Hobbs and Shaw were very childish and not funny° The movie is way too long, the Samoan part should of been cut out.° The Story is just too basic° The Samoan part was an utter shambles, it was a complete Joke. It felt very out of place.° Most of the unrealistic action set pieces were dull due to the film already setting the mood of it having no wit and being dull.

227,Svenstadt,Good if you turn on subtitles to hear what the hell they're saying.,4,7 November 2019,"I found some of the dialogue, in particular Jason Statham's, to be hard to hear, as he was going full Cockney on us. This movie is a mixed bag of the good and the bad. The beginning was terrible, of course. Some parts of it move so fast that you have to pause and rewind. The worse parts are the weak plot elements and the improbable scenarios, which border on science fiction at times. The plot involves Hobbs's sister, who has a virus in her blood, that must be removed before she dies. This is the stupidest part (maybe 2nd stupidest part) of the entire movie. The main characters resort to going to some po-dunk hilllbilly shack in Samoa where Hobbs's estranged family is from! This is, again, some cultural appropriation on the part of Dwayne Johnson, who in real life is part Samoan! He does his stupid ritual stuff like in the last one! But his family is a team of mechanics / criminals, and who else to repair the dialysis machine than them! Who better to repair a high-tech medical device than a bunch of wage workers, eh?!!! The fight scenes were another let-down. This looked like it was choreographed in a nursing home! I was not impressed at all! Particularly Jason Statham's fight scenes! They were not memorable fights at all. The good part of this was that some of the cars featured were really good. Again, there is nothing about this that particularly stood out. Idris Elba approached being an interesting character, but was not given enough screen time. I felt that his villain really gave a little depth, and he was the clear presence on the screen, even though he was not given much development. The last quarter of the film, on the Samoa island, was just a bunch of sentimental and outlandish crap, but it had one good chase scene with the cars at the end. They did not go far enough with the feud between Hobbs and Shaw. I preferred the last one: The Fate of the Furious. That was a far better installment.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Capitalizing on the F&F name and beloved action actors Statham and The Rock misleads you to expect a fun ride but, this film is childish with no substance. The action scenes were ridiculous. The writing was annoyingly forced with nauseating comedic quips and testosterone-filled banter. Then they throw in gimmicks and cameos to try to sell the poorly written script. Most of the cameo performances were lame and out of place. As far as the acting: Statham & The Rock were their typical selves, Idris Elba was OK but Vanessa Kirby is the saving grace as the kick-butt female lead, and I loved the cheeky cameo by Helen Mirren. I'll admit there are a few fun moments but this movie is more for drunk frat boys and barely worth the time, In My Humble Opinion!

232,rcolgan,I look forward to 2 Hobbs 2 Shawious,6,4 August 2019,"Hobbs & Shaw had some of the most notoriously troublesome pre-production drama in recent years. The film began largely due to an on-set dispute which arose between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson during filming The Fate of the Furious, with Diesel and Johnson refusing to film scenes together, Diesel using his position as producer to cancel some of Johnson's scenes and Johnson creating a long post on Instagram detailing his frictions with his co-stars on set. With this tension making production difficult and Johnson's chemistry with Statham being a notable highlight during filming, studio execs just decided to go ahead and separate them by giving Johnson his own spin off. It's like when two children are bickering over the same toy so their parents just decide to buy a new toy and let them play separately.Though with each new F&F film, it's strange to think back to 18 years ago when this franchise was just a loose retelling of Point Break following an investigation into some street racers. Now these movies have gotten so big that they're dealing with a virus which threatens the lives of millions and a genetically enhanced supervillain leading an army of terrorists trying to release the virus on to the world. With Shaw's sister in possession of the virus and on the run from the terrorists, Hobbs and Shaw team up to save the world with their seemingly superhuman abilities and constant banter.It's a ridiculous plot, filled with ridiculous action and ridiculous dialogue. But fortunately the cast knows how ridiculous everything is and are able to thrive in it. Johnson and Statham's chemistry is definitely the main glue which holds the film together and most of the films best moments is just the pair trading insults. They're both able to let their personalities shine through their performances and deliver on the over the top action sequences which play to their strengths, with Statham precisely striking enemies down whilst Johnson smashes through bad guys like a raging Hulk. They're also both willing to share the screen without hogging the spotlight leading to a fun team dynamic.Vanessa Kirby is also a great addition, with the film never reverting to her being a damsel in distress and letting her hold her own with the rest of the team. Plus Idris Elba seems to be having the time of his life playing a villain so over the top that he literally introduces himself at the start of the film as being the bad guy.Beyond the characters, this film has everything that fans have enjoyed about the recent Fast & Furious films. Funny action one-liners like Elba calling himself ""black superman"" or Johnson saying he's about to open ""an ice cold can of whoop ass"". Action sequences which sees characters perform superhuman feats like Johnson go full Captain America and holding back a helicopter with his bare hands. And the mixture of sprawling settings across the globe and high tech gadgets that give the impression F&F is trying to become an adrenaline filled version of Jame Bond.But the film still has the same drawbacks of the other F&F films too. Whilst Johnson and Statham are great at sharing the screen, they also have contracts that have been drafted so that they can never be the definitive loser of a fight. This causes a lot of the action to be too one sided with sequences lose any potential tension. I wouldn't be too surprised to learn that the main reason they made Elba a superhuman was just so they would have someone they could both fight against without harming their onscreen reputations.Also as entertaining as these fight sequences can get, they do often go on too long which makes the film feel bloated. Plus whilst there are a few cool long take sequences from Statham who has been performing great action choreography since his days in the Transporter series, a lot of sequences here suffer from the same problem of a lot of modern action movies with the action being obscured by too many fast cuts and too few wide shots.Though when it comes down to it, Hobbs and Shaw is in many ways the ideal spin off. It has everything which people enjoy about the F&F franchise, whilst still being independent by setting up it's own story separate to the main franchise. And with several surprise cameos clearly setting up a new crew for future films, it's likely we actually will get 2 Hobbs 2 Shawious sometime soon.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

All the movie is build on this comical question: they hate each other but at the same time have to work together to safe a new character that's the Shaw's sister and Hobbs new love. The rest is nothing new for what an action mainstream movie can propose: muscles, steroids, explosions.The fact that Fast and furious saga needs to produce a spin-off on these two characters proves that the fan love them and it's the clue that this series has nothing to do with cars, anymore. With the introduction of Dwayne Johnson, Paul Walker's death and in conclusion the appearance of Jason Statham, since the fourth chapter Fast and furious became just an action movie series, like other billions, surely with a big production that makes the movie at least not poor for what regards effects, but with a predictable plot and stereotypical actions and dialogues.

The only issue I have with his character is I wished they made his character more believable and giving the audience some real concern that he would succeed.The film is a lot of fun and the best way to enjoy the film is to NOT think to hard about the story. Now that might sound a bit harsh and a bit of a negative towards the film, But it's the best way to watch and enjoy the film.With some of the best cameos since Tropical Thunder Hobbs and Shaw delivers with some breathtaking scenes and lots of banter and does a decent job of being a stand alone film thats attached to a popular franchise.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

This movie was hilarious. In the regular Fast and Furious movies Roman usually provides most of the laughs, but in this movie, everyone did. Hobbs and Shaw's little rivalry was hilarious to watch play out. Even Shaw's sister had her funny moments. There were more funny moments with Hobbs' family. Lastly, the addition of Ryan Reynolds and Kevin Hart were amazing. They were hilarious, especially Ryan Reynolds, I started crying I was laughing so hard at some of his scenes. Just like any Fast and Furious movie, the action was pretty great, especially the finals battle in Samoa, that was a cool experience to watch. The final thing I liked about this movie was how we got a deeper look into the families of both Hobbs and Shaw. We already know Owen, but now we got introduced to their sister Hattie, and a little bit into what their lives were as kids. With Hobbs, we got to see his roots, where he grew up, Samoa. We got introduced to Hobbs' brother, Jonah, and his mother along with a bunch of others they all called ""brothers."" I just really liked how we got a look into the lives of these two, especially since we don't really get that in he regular Fast and Furious movies. This movie also left on a huge cliff hanger, I am very intrigued and am looking forward to the sequel.Based on all the people I hear, and all the reviews I have read, I can't believe this only had a 6.4/10 (At time of review). This was a great action comedy and I recommend this to anyone, even if you haven't seen the other movies because this is pretty standalone, it is technically a spin-off.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
239,T-ZER0,Enjoyable only for the insane action,3,1 January 2020,"My family loves this movie. Me, not so much, and I'm going to explain why: Firstly, was a spin-off necessary. I know Dwayne Johnson has this ego that he needs to be in most movies as an action star, but this is ridiculous!Second, the story. If any of you have seen Fate of the Furious, you know that it seemed Hobbs and Shaw had worked out their differences in that movie. Hobbs even yelled ""NO!"" When he thought Deckard was killed. Now they we're supposed to believe they hate each other again? Really? I don't buy it.Third, Idris Elba. I don't hate Elba. But I think this role is not for him. Heck, ever since this movie, my younger brother keeps calling Elba ""Black Superman"". Which gets on my nerves seeing how I love Superman and that line is cringeworthy to the max.Top those reasons off with a crazy predictable love story between Hobbs and Shaw's sister, mediocre performances and you've got a movie only worth watching for action. That's it. Solely for action. No flavor to this cake at all.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
240,mbhgkmsgg,Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,6,1 January 2021,"Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw is the first of, what I'm sure to be many, Fast & Furious spin-offs. It pairs Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw, the comedic duo of the past films, on a mission to save the world from an apocalyptic virus. While it is surprisingly dull considering the pairing of the two main characters, the action is spectacularly over-the-top and entertaining, which ultimately, is enough to save the film.While most of the comments I had heard about Hobbs & Shaw were mediocre at best, I was still excited to see it as a fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, and as a fan of the Hobbs and Shaw pairing. However, the biggest problem, which I would've never predicted, becomes evident quite quickly. While I assumed that the story would be ridiculous, the acting non-existent, and the writing cheesy, I would've never assumed that one of the worst parts about this film would be Hobbs and Shaw together. The pairing of Johnson and Statham, the actors portraying Hobbs & Shaw, respectively, often felt like a breath of fresh air, in the Fast & Furious saga. And I can't help but wonder if it was, indeed, the novelty of it, that kept it so entertaining. The comedy that the duo provides, as well as the constant back-and-forth bickering, was, without a doubt, the selling point here. Unfortunately, for its sake, the dialogue and interaction between Hobbs & Shaw start to feel quite old, quite quickly.The story then, which is spectacularly over-the-top, feels overly complicated for the film that Hobbs & Shaw is. As mentioned, it follows Hobbs & Shaw as they attempt to stop an evil technology worshipping cabal from getting their hands on a world-ending virus. On their journey, they face, what is, as described by the villain himself, a 'Black Superman', and his henchmen. Ultimately, as is often the case with these films, the good guys come out on top, at least for the time being.
Now, while this story doesn't sound particularly complicated being described as I did, it does, however, feel unnecessarily complicated for what Hobbs & Shaw set out to achieve. The main focus, and pretty much the only focus, is on the good guys kicking the bad guys' asses. That part is done very well and provides most of the entertainment. As such, I'm a little baffled by the need for such a convoluted story. I'm not saying that there is anything wrong with the story itself, not that I'm saying that it's exactly a masterpiece either, but it just didn't feel right in this particular film. This franchise, as became evident particularly with the eighth film, is headed for a surprisingly futuristic direction, which is further supported by the direction of Hobbs & Shaw. This is, by far, the most sci-fi-esque of the series and feels, at times, a little too over-the-top.The saving grace, however, is the always entertaining action. While it is quite monotonous and stops offering anything new after the first hour or so, it's hard not to have a blast watching Johnson and Statham do their worst. And although their pairing turned out to be rather disappointing comedically, action-wise, it works marvellously. While I might've not enjoyed the superhero-like villain, thanks to his otherworldly strengths, he ends up being quite the challenge for Hobbs & Shaw, and certainly provides interesting and quite imaginative fight scenes. There are, of course, plenty of impossibilities here. For example, should normal humans survive a 100-meter drop inside a car onto rocks? Definitely not, but that's the kind of thing that makes these films fun. While the later additions into the franchise have been quite daring with the situations that the characters end up in, and ultimately survive, Hobbs & Shaw is, by far, the most daring. The non-spin-off Fast & Furious films have tried to keep some sense of truthfulness in them, but this one throws it all out the window. This story in and of itself is so far out there that the expectations for things to come are set out early, and Hobbs & Shaw doesn't disappoint with what it throws at you.Ultimately, this film, like others in the franchise, is mindless fun. Its sole purpose is to entertain while moving the overarching story ever-so-slowly forward. While Hobbs & Shaw is a spin-off from the main story, it often still relies on the things that we have learned from the story it spun-off of. The pairing, which is meant to be a funny one, often fails at that. However, with epic turn-your-brain-off action, it manages to be the entertaining and enjoyable action-flick it set out to be.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Every joke, every line of dialogue, every scene and every element is reminiscent of a kid's idea of a fantasy action movie. They put literally everything they saw in other movies and (actually) made it work. They borrowed, or rather stole from a myriad of other action movies, Mission Impossible 2 being the most obvious one. But hey, who cares about originality when you have muscles, guns and fast cars, right?!It's not a smart movie, which is often painfully obvious from the prepubescent writing. The most cerebral part of the movie is the F.W. Nietzsche quote, which I'm sure they put in just to come off as smart. But I can forgive the movie for being pretentious because it's stupid, loud, generic, but ultimately fun and most important of all - watchable. It's made for kids and those who can shut off their brain for 2+ hours. Recommendable - yes. Rewatchable - meeh. Maybe.

244,mitchell5954,Everything You Would Expect From Fast and Furious,8,14 August 2019,"Hobbs and Shaw is the latest in the Fast and Furious line. The Fast and Furious franchise is one that I've become a fan of over the last several years, which is interesting given that I wasn't that impressed with the early movies. The first and third installments I think are alright. 2 Fast 2 Furious I don't care for, and the third film I haven't seen. It was Fast Five, where the series became much more action heavy, that my opinion on the franchise changed. From there each new film tries to one up itself in how crazy they can make the stories and action scenes, and I love them for it. They've become very much like the Transformers movies, except actually enjoyable. Hobbs and Shaw stays the course on that.This film has all that you've come to expect from a current Fast and Furious movie; from the outrageous plot, to the amazing effects and action, to the not deep, but fun and charismatic, characters. Aside from the action, The Rock and Jason Statham are the keys that make this film so fun. Both are cool and charismatic action stars on their own, and they both play off each other great. This is no surprise to me, as their scenes in Fate of the Furious were my favorite of that film. Both the score and especially the soundtrack are well done, like in all of these films.Overall, Hobbs and Shaw is a solid entry in the franchise. If you've been a fan of the last several installments in this wild franchise, especially, Fate of the Furious, then you'll enjoy yourself. It's not great. It's not a masterpiece, but it's not meant to be. It's meant to be good popcorn fun, which it is.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

247,Dello_,I lost 40 points from my IQ,7,12 August 2019,"First of all , ""Hobbs and Shaw"" is a fine movie plenty of action, funny situations and dialogues, a good enough direction, strong performances and acceptable visual effects. Having said all the goods I'll expose the bads. Basically the film is intended to be trash and exaggerated and it is excellent in doing so but on the other hand there's almost no character development nor a compelling story and everything serves to entertain on a raw level. Another aspect I didn't like is that even if I was expecting a lot of action and few dialogues and characters interaction I found the reality more unbalanced, indeed the movie is almost only action. And finally it's tooooo long because as I said there isn't an interesting story and the rest feels repetitive in the long run.
In conclusion ""Hobbs and Shaw"" is a perfect movie if you are searching for a simplistic entertainment where you have to turn off your brain and have a thoughtless time, but it won't be a good experience if the idea is to watch something more emotional and cultural richer.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Then I saw this film and it was fun, the action was good, the comedy was ok and the acting and directing was awesome. Jason Stathem and Dwayne Johnson have an awesome chemistry together and it was worth watching them argue all the time. While the story was weak, it made up cause of the action.

There's nothing out of the ordinary and the plot is the typical paint-by-numbers save the world from the bad guy story. Some of the jokes between Statham and Johnson work better than others. The obvious love interest side plot between Vanessa Kirby and Dwayne Johnson was barely there and could've been left out in my opinion. Other than that this movie was entertaining enough to be enjoyable for fans of the series but it's missing the heart and soul that the originals had.,Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
257,mmuggi,Buddy cop reinterpretation.,3,18 October 2021,"Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw is a reinterpretation of the classic Buddy-Cop genre. The action part is well constructed in the first 20 minutes, but let's just be honest. Decard Shaw should have been dead in his sister's apartment.London also does not get much uglier as it exudes green screen. There are a few different people who are introduced to get the plot pushed forward. People coming out of the blue. It's a problem for the film here, because several things are going on without being justified, and the whole action is far out and unlikely, as the virus in its ampoules should be in Hattie's entire body, and not just in his arm. There's a classic outlandisness about this movie just like in the F&F franchise, but this spinoff has no evidence to return.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
258,GavWaskett,Johnson and Statham seem to be enjoying ad-libbing.,8,14 August 2020,"So, I loved F8 when I saw it for the first time the other week, so I went into this with high expectations. In most respects these expectations were met and exceeded but it is held back from moving from a very good film to a great film.Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are obviously both fantastic action stars and can carry any film they choose in this genre. The actions scenes both or either are in are superbly coordinated and are up there with some of the best action scenes you will see in the cinema this year. Idris Elba is not only an awesome actor in general but proves that he is a right royal bar steward of a baddy. Vanessa Kirby, who has carved out a very nice career as a British TV actress, has just stepped up into full-blown action heroine (hopefully)stardom and on the basis of her action scenes and her interactions with two of the biggest(literally) stars in this genre then she has a very bright future ahead of her.And, even though she is only in it briefly at the start and the end, Helen Mirren is freaking amazing as always.Oh and Ryan Reynolds in a typically Ryan Reynolds role is hysterical.The story even pushes the limits of 'The Fast and the Furious' believability but is the more fun for it, self-driving bikes, secret technology cults, travelling from Russia to Samoa in a blink of an eye when the timer countdown has only a few hours left - all could test the boundaries of the average film watcher, but if you like these characters then you DO NOT CARE about plot holes. It is all about the fights and the witty one-liners. And this film has plenty of both.And, there is my problem, it has too many 'witty one-liners', throughout the first two-thirds of the films, Hobbs and Shaw stop whatever they are doing and spend five minutes insulting each other. Generally, along the lines of Hobbs is big, Shaw is a cockney, Hobbs is a bulldozer, Shaw is sneaky. The first time they do this, it is funny and fitting for their characters who have disliked each other for a few films now, but after the tenth time in one movie, you do wonder if the scriptwriter just left a part of the script blank and wrote 'Mr Johnson, Mr Statham to have a go at each other' and left it at that.The final scenes are simply superb, Cliff Curtis and his 'brothers' are great additions to the cast and the set pieces are visually brilliant.The rumour is that Hobbs and Shaw have finished in 'The Fast and the Furious' films and that this is a new series of films for them to flex their muscles in.(I bet Vin Diesel is very happy to have his franchise back) and they do make a great pairing but they also miss the other F&F characters to bounce off. I missed Letty and Dej and Roman, I definitely missed Roman's character.A muscle bound, karate kicking, wall walloping, spinning your legs around your opponent's head before flipping them over 16/20 for Messer's Hobbs and Shaw. A very good action film but too much jawing slowed the film down, a film which should be a hurricane ride for 100% of the time, had a few rain showers dotted throughout the storm. Shell did not enjoy it as much as me, for her is lacked the impact of the F&F films, a 11.5/20 - she is a harsh critic!",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
259,darkwizard404,Terrible movie,4,6 August 2019,"I don't understand why they make such terrible
movies. This is nowhere close to being as good as the original Fast & Furious films.Cringe jokes, bad acting, terrible plot and awful execution. The actions sequences were laughable and ridiculously over the top. The part where Hobbs & Shaw are jumping down and they are shown to pull out their parachutes just 2 seconds before they land. How is that even possible? Usually people end up breaking their legs if they don't pull out the parachute on time.The fight in the end in Samoa was ridiculous. How did the daylight come so fast while the fight started at night and the virus was still not fully ejected? Did the director think the audience is stupid?This is a terrible movie with countless flaws. The plot was not exciting at all and the movie was boring as a whole. Wouldn't recommend for anyone.

260,shimenpf,What you would expect,6,4 August 2019,"This is a good blockbuster action film tha gives what one would expect: Extraordinary fight sequences, an evil, seemingly invincible bad guy, good comedy, and a popular cast, including a couple unexpected, fun cameos. I personally enjoyed Hobbs & Shaw's relationship, the conflict between them and the evolution of them as partners, and the comical situations that came from it. I found the romantic plot to be a little shallow. In my opinion, Hobbs and Hatt never really developed a chemistry that made their relationship believable. Then again, this is still within what one would expect from these films. I appreciated the small twists along the way, like Hobb's sister's revelation. On the other hand, I felt the third act was too long, probably product of the writers trying to fit in as many action/fight sequences as possible. Either way, the film didn't underperform. It was a fun couple of hours and overall I enjoyed it.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

262,theemuhammede,"Breathtaking action, but stretches far from Fast and Furious",7,2 August 2019,"I kept on thinking to myself, how will this movie tie into the Fast and Furious movie franchise. I thought that it may include at least one of the other main characters that many of us have grown to love since the first movie in 2001 (The Fast and the Furious). But there was very little connection to it other than the two main characters (Hobbs and Shaw) and the strength of family.The movie was full of action from start to finish. There was something different about these action scenes though. It felt too real. It sounded like it hurt. It was a different movie experience for me because it was too real, and I loved every bit of it! I especially enjoyed watching Idris Elba as Brixton Lore (or as he claimed, Black Superman). He really was like Black Superman. He was so precise with each and every blow that my body began to hurt!There was one scene in this movie where I was like ""okay, this needs to stop right now"". Hobbs jumped out of a tall building just sliding down a rope with his bare hands like it was nothing, and then he jumped from man to man during the free fall to then Superman punch Black Superman to the ground. That was a bit much. How could Hobbs survive that?I really enjoyed the Samoa culture that was depicted for the ending of the movie. This was the strongest connection it had to the Fast and Furious movie franchise. It was built on the foundation of family. Family is what kept them all together, and the family kept on growing and became stronger with every challenge it took on. Although it did not include other cast members from previous movies, the Samoa culture exceptionally portrayed family.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

As for the film: it is just pure entertainment! Hobbs and Shaw have to work together to get the pretty sister of Shaw out of trouble and away from black superman Idris Elba, who is amazingly cool in his performance as a villain. The movie has absurd action sequences which would make James Bond change his profession to a mathematician.
The chemistry between Statham and Johnson is electric and funny.
I am not going to say anything about the cameos, they are just hilarious.

The ratio between drama, action and comedy made for a unique Fast And Furious film that could be enjoyed by all over and over again. The chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham was shown once again and it made for a great film. The only thing that was not really enjoyable about this movie was that it did not really match with all the previous Fast and Furious films as there was not much car action in my opinion and I think the storyline could have been improved so that it matches the Fast and Furious story.

When they go at it verbally, it brings that much need comic touch without having a clown character needed like in the F&F *cough* Tyrese *cough*.

This time, Luke Hobbs must team up with an enemy of his from Furious 7 known as Deckard Shaw. Their mission is to protect Shaw's sister from an evil organization lead by a genetically modified human, who is out to obtain a lethal virus.I'll be honest, I liked the Fast and Furious movies a lot more when I was a teenager, but now that I've gained more knowledge about films and watched a lot more in recent years, I've begun to disregard the franchise as brainless and cheesy. In a way, this movie continues this trend of these movies being brainless and cheesy. It's over-the-top, silly and succeeds as being an action movie that shouldn't be taken too seriously as an action movie, If you're into that, you'll like Hobbs and Shaw, as it provides the fast-paced action that the previous F&F movies provide. Don't expect this movie to be substantial in any way. I could rag on this movie for this, but it's harmless and a lot of people do like it for this, so more power to them.With that being said, this film does provide some good qualities. I genuinely enjoyed the chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham here. It's especially interesting considering that the latter was the villain in Furious 7, and they played around with their interactions by acknowledging this. The overall production is great, from the effects to the production design, they continue to do a great job with the production values. Finally, I can't talk about this movie without mentioning the final showdown. In it, Hobbs' family used physical strength to attempt to overpower the evil organization. I found this to be a genuinely entertaining way to finish off the movie.I feel as though Fast and Furious fans will be satisfied with this movie. As for me, while I'd prefer more in this movie, it did a fine job with the material they were given.6/10",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
269,Martinito_08183,A pointless addition to the Fast and the Furious franchise.,3,11 August 2019,"Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw is what you were expecting it to be: a dumb action movie that has become so unrealistic with each new installment in the franchise, so you're either with it or your not at this point and the movie also feeling unnecessary, so that they can stretch this franchise to last longer, because Universal don't want to end it or they'll get beaten by the competition. The only tactic that they have: take two of the supporting characters that don't have nothing interesting in them or aren't amazingly written and make a movie for them.The spin-off could have worked if the predecessors were good, but since they are not, then what's the point? The answer is obvious: money. The biggest positives that i can give are Jason Statham, but i don't count his character in the positive aspects (while Dwayne Johnson plays the exact same role in every movie that he's in) and the sound, but everything else ranges from OK or very bad.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

You should know that the core element of the ""speed and passion"" series is drag racing. Even for foreign stories such as ""Tokyo Drift"", there are a lot of racing scenes. However, in this film, although there are big scenes such as flying cars pulling planes, it is only a simple pile of scenes, and there is no soul of ""speed"". As for passion, the two bald tough men who should not have talked much cruel talk are like an old lady quarrelling and bickering, and the quarrel is nonsense without nutrition and laughter. It's good to use these in the dead man. It's noisy and redundant to use them in this ""passion film"" that should be hot-blooded. So either don't sell dog meat with sheep's head, or come up with something that really conforms to the spirit of the series, rather than smashing the signboard.

It definitely follows the recent suite of Fast and Furious movies with respect to extra extra action and gadgets, but somehow manages to pull it off in style. There is too much technology, so much anti gravity and also action scenes and some exotic locations to satisfy any adrenaline junkies. The best part about Hobbs and Shaw is, all this manages to entertain you without tiring the viewer too much.Dwayne and Statham pull off some exciting chemistry between the two. Statham has definitely evolved as an actor and has a brilliant comic timing. Vanessa Kirby is super cool in her role.

281,criscal,"Totally unrealistic, totally fun",8,14 April 2021,"Of course the ending is very predictable, once the premise of a race against time is set. I liked Vanessa Kirby as Hattie a lot. I didn't know her to be an actress great for action movies. The movie lives from two guys that profess all the time to not being able to work together, but will for the sake of the movie. Most of the creativity went into the lines that both punch in. Anyway, don't think too hard, just have fun.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
282,aji4u4ever,In and out Entertainer,9,1 August 2019,"Well Don't think much
Hobbs and Shaw is an in and out entertainer with lots of punches (action and comedy), gun combats, car chases and lots of laughs. Blended with several movies like Moana, the Italian job and of course fast andy furious, FFHS is a macho movie. Dwayne Johnson & Jason Statham puts a real show where they were too good in fights and jokes. And Here comes a powerful super villain played by Idris Elba. Gorgeous Vaness Kirby mesmerized as Hattie.
David Leitch who is famous for Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2 did a wonderful job as director and he made this movie a fast paced action entertainer.
The background score was apt and songs produced more impact whole throughout.This one will be listed as one of my favorite F&F movie even though am not a fan F&F series.Solid 9 on 10",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
283,hiraishinnojutsu,"Well quiet predictable, but still enjoyable",7,1 August 2019,"""Not so great, not so bad"" is the sentence I use to describe ""Hobbs and Shaw"". Since the day the Fast and the Furious franchise turned into an action-packed movie, I wouldn't be surprised if their spin off would turn out to be something far away from racing theme and more of a punch, kick, and a Bad-Boys-esque blockbuster. The ending is, well, (a little bit) disappointingly predictable. The action is a little bit ridiculously over the top (though I hate some parts where they use what is seemingly unfinished, or maybe just bad, CGI), can't wait to have the same level of ass-kicking sequence in Fast and the Furious 9 and 10 on the theaters (or even more). For those of you who already accepted the fact that Fast and the Furious is racing no more, well the movie is for you, enjoy......",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
284,SinhaSomesh,THRILLING!,6,4 August 2019,"#FinalVerdict:This spin-off has enough humour, surprise cameos, jaw-dropping/logic-defying car chases & expeditiously choreographed, action sequences along with a wondrous finale.Pros: Technically, the film is perfectly mounted with finesse. Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are absolutely charismatic, seem to be walking through their roles with their appreciably strong on-screen chemistry. Idris Elba is despicable to the core. Fiendish! Vanessa Kirby is exceptionally astounding and she even gave Dwayne Johnson run for his money in one of the lavishly shot action sequences. Helen Mirren and Eiza Gonzalez are impressive in their respective cameos. Eddie Marsan as Andreiko is offhand.After John Wick, Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2, stunt coordinator-turned-director David M Leitch again proves adept in shooting close-quarters combat. Fantastic direction! Don't miss the post-credit scene.Cons: It's big and dumb at the same time. Sadly, the story is the weakest link. The family angle is underdeveloped, making the sub-plots appear half-baked with no real emotional stakes. Also the runtime of two hours and sixteen minutes act as deterrent.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

286,martinsplads,A enormous failure,1,7 August 2019,"I can fairly say that Hobbs and Shaw is the worst movie I have ever seen in the cinema. This absolutely unfunny and boring mess that has zero potential to be anything but a movie that shouldn't exit at all. This is an absolutely nightmarish film to sit through and its literally psychologically torture to get through. Is this cinema today? Movies are being made without passion and somehow they still are hitting the box office every damn year, it's truly awful.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
287,ablack90,Super funny movie,8,11 November 2019,"I laughed out loud throughout this entire film. Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs and Jason Statham as Shaw have excellent chemistry. Their smack talk was hilarious and I'm sure these actors bust a gut laughing during many takes. Loads of very well choreographed action, excellent chase scenes, and plenty character makes this a very fun film to watch. In this film they're up against a superhuman villain.
Idris Elba makes a good villain. It takes a great actor to play a villain that you also feel sorry for. Vanessa Kirby is a believable and fun actress. I hope there's a sequel because I'm hooked.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
288,abovethelaw-95473,Garbage!!,1,13 May 2021,"It is obvious that the director drank way too much Fanta(sy), because every scene was over the top and very unrealistic.

289,shadowfax73,Too over the top,7,19 December 2020,"The idea of pairing Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham in their own movie was magic. Both can play intense characters but with a comedic side that that is the foundation of the film. Dawyne is playing Dwayne and Jason is playing Jason. That's we we pay to see, them playing themselves because they are so entertaining. Shaw's sister turns up early on as a police or military special ops type and goes through a bunch of baddies like she's Supergirl. At that point I groaned, not another totally OTT kick-a$$ female. Turns out she has the same dry sense of humor as her brother and she quickly becomes part of the team, and fits in just great.I loved the film. Johnson, Statham and Vanessa Kirby make a great team and the action was very good. I didn't say fantastic because it isn't. There are way too many totally unbelievable set pieces from OTT car chases to a string of trucks hooked together trying to stop a helicopter fleeing with Kirby's character. There's just too much. Would have been so much better if they had lost most of the bangs and crashes and focused more on the three main characters plus Idris Elba who makes a great villain.I'd love to see a scaled back Hobbs & Shaw where the action compliments the characters rather than dominates them.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

But.....this movie like the recent fast and furious movies, over the top unrealistic action scenes. And the fact that the two leads have it in their contract they can't ever lose a fight, totally takes away from the badass-ness of it. They gotta get their ass's beat at least once, so you root for them to win next time. The bad guy was awesome, kind of a sci-fi futuristic super soldier. Though....when did fast and the furious go from racing and trying to take down a bad guy to....saving the world from a super soldier....can you really call it fast and the furious anymore?",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
292,spikeypoet,This is a dumb movie,5,30 September 2019,"John Campea said it best, ""this is a dumb movie."" The movie was corny as hell, but I had some fun watching it. The whole end scene in Samoa was so stupid. Kids will love this movie, but any grown up, with an ounce of sense, will take this movie for what it is -- just a movie. My main problem with the movie is I don't know who the target audience is. It's not like The Avengers movies, where they're for everyone. It would have been brilliant if they removed the kid element and targeted a grown up audience, but making this for kids was it's downfall, in my opinion; it's too simplified and DUMB. Dwayne Johnson CANNOT do romance hahaha he's like a giant clumsy robot. That part made me cringe hahaha!!!
Black Superman, Idris Elba was incredible. There is nothing that that man cannot do.
Not a terrible movie, but definitely not a good one, either.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

294,english_artist,What happened to fast & furious ?,4,6 October 2019,I am not sure why this has 'fast & furious' in its name. Yes its certainly fast and furious but it has absolutely nothing to do with the fast and furious world. In fact this has nothing to do with any real world other than maybe marvel.We all know movies like this are silly and not meant to be real. But there still should be some parts that suspend belief and you think.... Hmmm.. maybe. But this is so far removed from any reality its unreal.Don't get me wrong its got lots of action and stuff but its just to stupid and silly and the fights are way over the top with no one seeming to get any serious injury. Like the girl beating up a man with a chair smashing it into his throat (which would have killed him) and he still carries on. Lets hope no kids or anyone else things that would be a good idea in a fight.Fast & the furious started as such a good franchise with gripping plot and superb car chases that you could believe and now they are all superhuman super heroes..... what a shame.Paul Walker will be turning in his grave,Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
295,t-09253,The best of the F&F saga,6,3 August 2019,"Not a fan of the franchise, but I enjoyed this movie (despite its many flaws). The comedy between Statham and The Rock works great.

Elba) is the best villain of the saga, but I feel the writer didn't develop the character as well as the should have.Anyway, enjoyed it for what it is.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

And I guess Kevin Hart just slipped in there.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
298,Athanatos173,At Least Have Some Self Respect,5,19 September 2019,"I can understand action movies. I enjoy action movies. This is not an action movie, it is one impossible stunt after another. Just reveal that they all have superpowers and be done with it already.Just let the franchise die, they keep trying to top the ridiculousness of the previews movies and succeed every time, making the Transformers franchise look more believable than this mess.As I initially stated, I enjoy action movies, but not when the movie is just one ridiculously impossible stunt after the other.I will not go into the ""acting"", as anyone who watches this type of movie is obviously not expecting anything of worth, which the movie delivers.Give this a miss, unless you have the enviable ability to completely turn your brain off.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
299,rachelgallit,Exceeds Expectations,8,22 August 2019,"This movie exceeded my expectations for a Fast and Furious franchise movie, given that my expectations were so desolately low to begin with. That being said, the movie is utterly ridiculous in all the right ways: car chases, motorcycle crashes, explosions, and chaotic fist fights. This film is a whirlwind of spy drama and good old fashioned male machismo. Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Shaw (Jason Statham) must team up to prevent a deadly virus from being released first into Shaws sisters body, and then the world. They are pitted again Eveon, a sinister tech company, and Eveon's champion, Brixton (self dubbed ""Black Superman""). There are several emotional plot lines sprinkled in among the dramatic ones, between Hobbs and his estranged family, Shaw and his estranged sister, and Hobbs and his simply strange friend, Locke (Ryan Reynolds). An overarching message that love and heart can beat out technology time and time again seemed a bit far fetched, but the viewer can roll with the punches. For the target audience, this movie was surely a huge hit. For me, given that I am not a 15-40 year old male, specific beats of familial reconciliation did not land so well, but I can see their intended impact.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
300,Lost_In_Translation_,An awesome big dumb cartoony action movie,6,1 August 2019,"The trailers are completely transparent as to what this movie is going for. It's a big dumb action movie where you can just sit down, not think much and enjoy it for it's over-the-top moments.It's not trying to be Mission Impossible with a solid plot and practical effects, it knows it's a cheesy action movie with a CGI fest of action moments with a really thin plot that is just the catalyst for some entertainingly cartoonish action.Sure if you think about it too much you can pick it apart A LOT, and it's not an empirically good movie. Just go in and have a good time with some fun action and really funny moments.My only main complaint is that it is a bit long for what it is. Something simple and dumb like this should be a tight 90-110 minute movie, but it is 2 hours and 15 mins, only 25 mins shorter than Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. There is an action scene that seemed like it should have been the plot point where the movie ended, but there's another 30 min action scene after that.The two leads are funny and play well off each other. There are some great cameos by people I had no idea who were in it. Also Idris Elba is great as the baddie, but there is a secret organization boss baddie that 100% felt like a G.I. Joe-esque, Saturday Morning cartoon villain and sets up a sequel series which I am totally into. Through the whole movie their identity is secret and we just hear them through a low pitched voice changer, but it totally felt like the beginning of a series with a baddie like Dr. Claw or Cobra Commander, which works with the tone of this movie.If you want to watch a decently made dumb action movie, this is for you. Don't go in expecting some technical/practical masterpiece like MI: Fallout, go in just expecting some really fun entertainment and you'll have a great time! With Fast & Furious starting to suck starting with 7, I'd be totally fine with this continuing on it's own as a series.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

It's total escapism for sure, but that's a part of entertainment that we're missing so much today.

But what star power it was. I do not ever not adore Dwayne Johnson; Jason Statham continues to exude sex appeal with his every utterance; and I'm more in love with Vanessa Kirby than ever before. I hope this movie vaults her into superstardom. She is tough, badass, and (probably) reason enough to see this movie.

308,nealvan557,Awesome! Finally a non homosexual movie in the old school style Butch & Sundance but with computer FX!!,8,1 December 2019,"It was a superhero movie disguised as a F&F spin off. From the point of plain fun, it nailed it. The soundtrack is horrible and really kept ruining my good mood watching this. So happy to see a movie with strong male figures as well as strong female characters. Not too crazy about the blatant promo about how great being Samoan is supposed to be in Samoa. I already knew Dwayne's Dad was 1/2 Samoan. Didn't we have enough Samoan stuff at the end of the one of the F&F movies with him coaching the girls team? Always have been a fan of Statham who can really do most of the moves he's shown doing as a highly skilled martial arts champion. I've enjoyed Dwayne back in the WWF days as The Rock when he brought his brand of comedy to offset the seriousness of Stone Cold Steve. Both truly knew how to excite and audience. I've enjoyed nearly all of Idris Alba's roles. Something about how he is able to make each character he plays seem 'real'. Too bad he was in that travesty called The Dark Tower, but that's another review. Having Ryan Reynolds acting like Deadpool, then having Idris called War Machine as we see his back being closed up. Huh?! Kinda thought War Machine is a Marvel character played by a very different actor in an Iron Man suit? Oh well. If you can put your logic and reality on hold for 2 hours, it's a fun movie that is refreshingly old school entertaining!

309,subwmn,Great movie for a great time,10,21 November 2019,"Very entertaining. I was a little skeptical, but not by way of the actors. It was more of what storyline are they going to do without Diesel and the gang? The wrong actors and wrong storyline can break a show or movie, but it turned out great. My family made it a Redbox night and we found it entertaining. It does not disappoint with the action and bickering made it funny because they are forced to work together.

317,babybuletgani,The titular tough guys are brought together to track down a super-virus,6,14 December 2019,"The titular tough guys are brought together to track down a super-virus, aka 'Snowflake'. It's currently in the possession of Deckard's sister Hattie (Vanessa Kirby), an MI6 agent framed for the slaughter of her team by Brixton Lore (Idris Elba), a self-proclaimed ""bad guy"" with his eyes on the virus. Now the CIA and MI6 are calling in Hobbs and Shaw to find her.
Forced to work together, the mud-slinging begins in earnest (""You sound like a giant tattooed baby,"" growls Shaw, in one of the better put-downs). It's funny, to a point, though the script's obsession with discussing genitalia size gets a little tiresome. ""Over-compensating?"" remarks Hobbs, as he sees Shaw's collection of cars. Talk about meta.
In Lore, they have a worthy foe. He's part of ETEON, a hi-tech criminal empire run by a mysterious disembodied voice. He sports the latest in bulletproof material and has been enhanced with cyber-genetics. ""We're being chased by the Terminator!"" yells Hobbs. It's all a little sci-fi for F&F, though it's arguably no more ridiculous than launching parachutesporting cars from planes (see F&F7).
With series regular Chris Morgan and Iron Man 3 scribe Drew Pearce on writing duties, the story soon goes global, after Hobbs and Shaw discover Hattie's ingested the virus. Only a Russian scientist (Eddie Marsan) seems to know how to extract it, though luckily there's a gizmo to do the extracting in ETEON's Dr. Evil-like lair.
There are lots of references to saving the world - Hobbs estimates this is the fourth time he's heroically performed the task - but as ever with the F&F films, it all comes down to family. Shaw is dealing not only with his baby sis, but also his dear old mum (Helen Mirren) who's also in a spot of bother. A third-act sojourn to Samoa, meanwhile, sees Hobbs reunited with his homeland and the resentful brother Jonah (Cliff Curtis) he left behind.
This being a F&F movie, you'd expect the action to be top-notch. David Leitch, the supreme stuntmanturned-action-director of John Wick, Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2, doesn't let us down. A car/motorbike chase through the streets of London - bread and butter in the F&F world - is exhilarating. Same goes for a sequence in which Hobbs abseils down the side of a tower block, while a Stathamcentric corridor fight is pure Oldboy.
The addition of Elba and the kickass Kirby only adds to the fun, though the film does lose momentum in the final act, with Hobbs' familial squabbles throwing a spanner in the works. A few star cameos, presumably as a set-up for future episodes, also feel unnecessary. But then, in Fast & Furious, is there really such a thing as 'too much'?",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
318,tomtalbotty,Loved this hilarious and heartfelt movie with some familiar faces cameos along the way,10,1 August 2019,"This movie is set after the most recent Fast And Furious Films where it shows two very different characters called Hobbs And Shaw that they are like brothers with a love hate friendship where they rub each other up the wrong way while cracking hilarious jokes about each other. Nevertheless when it gets down to dangerous situations they both go in and work really well together. Hobbs is more family oriented where he is a lot calmer with a steady day to day life with his lovely daughter that is really cute to see his sweet innocent side to him that makes him seem a lot more human. When it comes down to defeating enemies Hobbs tends to chuck extremely heavy objects at them like chairs, nevertheless compared to Shaw is more refined as he defeats enemies using finesse and skill he kind of shows off while getting the job done. Shaw has a less stable life where he prefers to work alone with very little backup and pushing family away along with his friends while making a lot of enemies along the way. I loved the cute heartfelt moments between Hattie And Shaw was so cute as well. If you have a spare two hours and sixteen minutes I highly recommend you watch this hilarious heartfelt film, which you will not be disappointed as you will recognise some familiar funny faces along the way that is great.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

UNBELIEVABLE, really it is. The movie further dropped to six stars, when they had the Chocolate Smurf (aka) Kevin Hart pop up in mid flight, he spoils everything he's been in, this is no exception, he's like a black white man trying to be funny.If this is a spoiler for the movies, yeah Kevin Hart is a spoiler. And what in hell was Ryan Reynolds doing in the movie, he just pops up, wise crack and he's gone again, he earned the movie it's fifth star, down from ten.Last but not least, the movie has no rhyme or reason, what happened, the script writers take a day off? Oh wait, it's Hollywood, they have no script writers, no imagination to speak of, or write about. Thus dragging the rating down to 4 stars.There should be a law against putting children in these kinds of movies, it's pathetic in all the worse ways. Damn, I should be a critic, on second thought , they couldn't pay me enough to watch this trash, and no I didn't pay for this, my Nephew did.

Except that, the story, the characters, the dialogs - all baseless.The title should have been anything but the Fast & Furious.

330,jaapeelman,Unrealistic movie with a funny Johnson,5,7 October 2019,"First of all I really do not understand why this movie is called F & F presents... because this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the previous F&F movies.
Furthermore the story is a lot of unbelievable, unrealistic nonsense with Idris Alba as some kind of terminator working for a secret organisation.
Dwayne Johnson is a always pleasant to watch and he was the only reason that I wanted to see this movie. Ok, Jason Statham is also most of the times nice to watch although he always plays a guy with a grumpy character.
The stunts and special effects are off-course great but 100% unrealistic: take for instance the scene where Dwayne is holding the attack-helicopter by a chain.
In real life his arm would have been ripped-off and I know it's just a movie but come on: its it impossible for Hollywoord to make a movie which is a bit more realistic?
And, as with most Hollywood-movies, with an open end for a part two and probably three, four etc...
This movie is not more than a 5 out of 10 and only because of the special effects and the presence of Dwayne Johnson.
But is it worth your money and time? Your money: definitely not. Any of your time: only if you have really nothing better to do!",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
331,tylerrosin,Lots of fun but beyond ridiculous.,7,10 September 2021,Well this movie is as ridiculous as I thought it was going to be. The plot was a mess and threw so many characters and plot threads into a blender of a film. While the humor between the leads was great and the action was very well done it was all a little to unbelievable. There were solid car chases and it moved at a quick pace but the climax was a little bit bonkers. There was also way to much green screen and cgi to get to heavily invested in what was going on. Still a fun movie but you have to turn off your brain.,Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

334,craigthomas90,"Cliche, cliche, CLICHE!!!",6,9 August 2019,"There is nothing fresh or interesting about this movie. It is as if Michael Bay was consulted and they used all of his ideas to bring this one to life. It's full of over the top (even for the Fast and Furious universe), stunts and explosions. The ending is as underwhelming as the entire journey. The jokes are stale, and the Rock is superhuman. I literally thought I was looking at Captain America with some of the one handed grabs and throws he unleased upon his foes. Shaw has a sister who at times seems like a super soldier, then others a damsel in distress. It's not enjoyable aside from Idris Elba being a beast with some enhancements that aren't fully fleshed out. If the tone was more of a serious one, this odd couple movie could have been something with some serious themes that I found extremely intereting. However, this terrible over the top rendition of Lethal Weapon and or Rush Hour, misses completely.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
335,jadediamond,A ridiculously over the top movie but a fun ride,7,2 August 2019,"If you miss the over the top action movies of the '80s and 90s of macho men with big guns, bigger muscles, bad puns, and explosions, you're going to love this movie. If you can't turn off your brain for two hours and tend to overanalyze the plot, then you're going to hate it. This move defies the laws of gravity. The Rock is literally as hard as a rock, even gravity can't stop him. The plot is a secret illuminati society is trying to take over the world by spreading a virus which will wipe off a large part of the world's population or as Idris' Brixton would say, ""only the weaker ones"" and it's up to Hobbs (The Rock) and Shaw (Statham) to save the world. Vanessa Kirby's Hattie is equally a skilled fighter as the boys and does her best to balance out the bickering of the boys when it starts to become juvenile. So the movie is a fun ride if you want pure popcorn escapism and don't ask yourself certain questions like ""How can The Rock slide down a rope with no gloves and get no skin burns? How can The Rock jump off a rope with no protective gear and land on top of another guy without falling splat on the ground? Doesn't that defy the laws of gravity? Why do the bad guys line up to get attack one by one instead of shooting Hobbs and Shaw from a distance or attacking them both at once? If Brixton is Black Superman, then why is Hobbs and Shaw able to hold their own against him? Are they French Superman and Rock Superman? Are Hobbs and Shaw really human because they never bleed in the movie?That's the only downsize with this movie, because anyone who watches this movie knows it's going to be crazy and action packed. The fact the characters like in most action movies also, come across as invincible, there's never any stakes or real tension because you know nothing is going to happen to them. They never bleed or if they get hit, they bounce it off and get up or joke about it. I think the only somewhat believable action star we have today I could think of is fifty-seven year old Tom Cruise. Once he went from being the super spy in the first three Mission Impossible movies to the death defying stunts and getting his butt kick in the last three MI movies, the movies became better because there was a chance the main character could die. Of course, you want him to survive and win, but it's the tension of the atmosphere built when there's a chance the hero can die or get hurt. One of the best action film character was Harrison Ford because he was a ruggedly handsome guy who came across as normal who got in a fist fight before and maybe lost a couple too. He occasionally got his butt kick and nearly died in death defying stunts leaving the audience tense and finally relieved when he figured out a way to get out of a bad situation.After the backlash of some Bruce Lee's fans and his real life daughter of Bruce Lee's character being portrayed as full of hot air and being tossed in a car in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, fans don't want to see their favorite action stars lose a fight or get their butts' kicked. So the leading stars have the dilemma of having to come across at these larger than life invincible creatures who never loses a fight, but there is no stakes or tension because you know they aren't going to die or lose.So besides no true tension in the film, the movie was very fun and enjoyable. Kirby, The Rock, Elba, Statham, the cameos, and even the pretty young actress who plays Hobbs' daughter, all did an excellent job in this movie. Elba made a pretty good and convincing villain. Even at the end just like in the Wire, he went out like a G. I wouldn't be surprised if his character returns in the sequel since he is part man and part machine and this is a Fast and Furious spinoff so anything is possible in this universe. It's obvious The Rock had a hand in producing this movie and it's one of his better films. I loved how he went back to his Somoan roots and figured out a way to incorporate them into the film. He seems like he's creating opportunities for his fellow WWE family and helping bring them into the film industry. And I love Statham sneaking a cameo of his 2003 movie, the Italian Job in this film which was also a pretty good movie. It's also so obvious that everyone enjoyed making this film and you could see the love in making the film and imagine the actors laughing between takes. I can only imagine how funny the blooper reels for this movie will be once the DVD is released. But overall, a stupid, dumb, and fun movie. And Hobbs and Shaw knows it's stupid, dumb, and fun, and just goes with it. Great movie if you have a need for over the top action and want a two hour break from reality.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Another take on saving the world because the bad guy thinks to murder people is okay as we are now overpopulated with one another.The movie should have been cut from 136 mins to 100 mins. Too many unnecessary dialogues and fillers that jeopardize your mood and excitement.Hobbs & Shaw carries genes from the bad seed of Fast & Furious 8. F&F8 introduces a concept of abandoning physics and logics comprehensively which affects this movie like chewing gum and guess what? It's even more preposterous than ever.Astounding and remarkable non-stop action sequences that you may have never seen before in previous movies. Anyhow, it is the support system of the film after all and the only thing worth mentioning.Cameos that may excite you the millisecond they show up on screen but leaving you disappointed because of the coincidentally-know-someone-and-I-need-your-help-now-or-else-you-will-be-useless-in-this-movie.As the running time moves forward, the action scenes just get more and more dizzier due to the uncontrollably fast pacing.Excellent slo-mo effects that quite blend in with the amazing cinematography and lighting which will leave you gasping for more.Powerful soundtrack and sound effects that create more impactful action scenes.Verdict: A fast-paced action-packed movie that kicks your adrenaline to maximum impact but unfortunately, treats its audience like dumb people.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Way to much futuristic uses near to the point of terminator or even close to x-men.
Hobbs and Shaws characters from the fast and furious movies were just taken away, they both were totally different than they were portrayed in the fast and the furious.
Way to much wise cracks infact nearly every line in the movie was a wise crack towards someone.
Considering they are both portrayed as bad asses they are very comical and laid back to the point you forget one was a bad guy and the other a tough cop.

If you've liked the Fast & furious franchise, especially the last 2 movies, I really think you'll like this! Vanessa Kirby a wonderful addition to the cast but Hobbs & Shaw's banter with each other, when they're not busy fighting (or even sometimes when they are) is incredible. There were plenty of nice references, Shaw talking about a car & mentions 'Italian Job'. Hobbs with the eyebrow & a stack of pancakes! The action sequences in this film, especially the one at the warehouse & the complete final battle were so well done. The fights with Idris Elba were all great, he added a lot to this film. The cameos by Kevin Hart & Ryan Reynolds add another incredible layer to this film. Set up for a sequel if they please. Make sure you stay through the credits!

344,DJKwa,A Two Man Show,6,31 July 2019,"While it might share the Fast & Furious title, Hobbs & Shaw is a two man show that bears little connection to its namesake franchise. For some, that might prove to be the best thing about this spin-off. After all, there have been eight core films in the franchise and a bit of a shake-up wouldn't go amiss. Unfortunately, while Hobbs & Shaw's story might come with a shiny new coat of paint it has the same rusty parts under the hood.Those looking for a film where The Rock and Jason Statham trade insults at each other for two hours plus will find plenty to love in Hobbs & Shaw. The mismatched pair share majority of scenes together and the only thing that matches their fighting skill is their ability to verbally tear into each other. However, the cookie-cutter story about a race against time to stop a deadly virus being unleashed into the world ties together their sharp comedic chemistry in a rather unremarkable package.Still, those who have already made up their mind about watching the film will unlikely be deterred by a lacklustre story. The action is the main attraction and the film mostly delivers in that regard, with only one major drawback.Director David Leitch is a skilled action director but his focus on hand-to-hand combat means that the scale of the action often feels smaller than expected. There's a lack of inventive set pieces and it's only in the last act that the film manages to find its groove with a gloriously over-the-top sequence set in Samoa. Along with some surprisingly fun cameos, and a solid balance between comedy and action, Hobbs & Shaw is certainly a fun time but I wish it had found its anarchic spirit sooner.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Where is the family thing?This is just an over hyped action movie with the name of Fast and Furious.And it was supposed to be funny, right?

346,Floki_Thorfinn,Action-Packed & Entertaining,7,3 August 2019,"The spin-off from the Fast & Furious franchise is just what this kind of monstrous blockbusters promises: a super action loaded production beyond any sense of reality whatsoever, so judge it based on this premise, in the end, it's all just for fun and entertainment for the people who only watch this movies as for the lovers of cinema just like myself that watch equally a good blockbuster at the movie theater, an art film from Hungary, a silly comedy on Netflix, or a classic horror film that I bought on blu-ray.I love Dwayne Johnson's films, and this isn't one of his best works, but still, that man was born to make movies, which makes Hobbs & Shaw very watchable.I wasn't so pleased with Deadpool 2, the so expected sequel that went under the direction of stuntman David Leitch (Specially known for his works as a stunt double and stunt coordinator, a few credits as second unit director, occasionally actor and since 2017, producer and director {has directed three films in a row since then: Atomic Blonde in 2017, Deadpool 2 in 2018 and Fast and Furious: Hobbs and Shaw in 2019, and an uncredited direction in John Wick in 2014}), and I didn't enjoyed a bit that crappy female version of John Wick: Atomic Blonde, but when I knew he was in charge of this movie, I thought he could do better than his previous films, which in my opinion he did, though he still have a long way to go in regards of filmmaking.So, to sum up, if you hate Fast and Furious films and take everything too serious, don't waste your money, because this is just another F&F, just without Vin Diesel in it. If you want to have a good time at the movies and you know well what to expect here, go nuts.P.S.: There are two post-credits scenes in the early credits and one more till ALL the credits finalize.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

This speed and passion I think it is very Good: He knows that this series should be to maintain the hormones of the audience. The entertainment effect of the film is very strong. It can be regarded as a popcorn commercial movie that exceeds expectations. 2. The film has done some people in the case of the overall decline of speed and passion series. Surprise innovation, and because of the contradiction between Johnson and Van Boss, the film continues to emphasize the theme of the series through the speed and passion series in another way. 3. The three-screen structure of the movie is also as handsome as possible, such as the villain Transformers. The motorcycle and the middle of the mouth have been interspersed with Johnson and Jason Statham's mouth guns and the most important thing is the third act of the innovative philosophy of returning to the action film battle. This is also the fight for the go-go and the blood fight A tribute to it 4. Of course, the film also has a lot of hard injuries. It is also very difficult to avoid. For example, eight minutes from night to day and forced to join Mori and Fanny.

I honestly thought my blu-ray player was broken as the movie was clearly over. But then the last hour is like a totally different film tacked on to the end of the first.This film was totally unrealistic to the point of tediousness. I remember reading a review of Mission Impossible and the reviewer saying the reason they are so good is you know every stunt Tom Cruise is actually doing it and risking his life for the film there is no CGI.Hobbs and Shaw is the other end of the spectrum. I did not believe a single stunt was anything other than someone sitting infromt of a PC crafting it like they would when making a stunt in Toy Story. As a result there was no tension or suspense.The fight scenes, totally unrealistic. I was looking forward to this because the fight scenes in Atomic Blonde are incredible and realistic and the hero actually reacts to being hit and takes damage.

It really should have been a stand alone movie separate from F&F.
Bio enhanced humans? What!?
That's when you lost me really - which was very early on. But I watched 'til the end.Now Statham and Johnson did perfectly fine. They played their roles as expected. They do them well. And the action was good. But the directing and story just made it hard to swallow. Maybe if it was just an Action/sci-fi/spy-thriller with different character names I could take it in a lot easier.
It's got as much to do with F&F as putting Roger Moore's James Bond in space and surrounding him with girls in silver space suit style bikinis who work for a villain in his secret space station - and it's the 1970's.... Remember that one!I felt some of the effects looked rushed and not real but for some reason people praised them.And the end stand-off; Why did Hobbs ""have"" to go home to Samoa? He didn't want to but he thought it was the best place for a last stand!? To make the enemy follow them back to his family he hadn't seen in 25 years. That was just decided and moved on very fast.Now the final fight scene started before dawn, so it was dark. Then it became day and sunny very fast. A helicopter falls off a cliff, it was day. But at the bottom of the cliff it became night and it was raining. Looked great and added atmosphere but... what!? How!? It was dawn 5 minutes ago.Anyway. This isn't a review. It's just disappointment at what could easily have been a decent action movie that too easily falls into the B Grade Action movie category due to an unbelievable story.

This is an action movie of the highest quality. Great production values, great international locations, lots of excellent new tech, great cinematography, great stunts, great special effects, excellent chemistry between all the characters, including the bad guys, what's not to like? It is missing the low rider urban homie vibe but that's another movie. If you like action movies don't miss this movie.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

365,michaeljpfitzgerald,This is what people who refuse to watch F&F movies think they would be watching.,1,19 March 2020,"Gosh, what a stinker.This movie has all the ridiculous, devoid of reason action scenes that the latter Fast and the Furious films have, and none of the heart - sadly, not for lack of trying. Attempting to follow the 'Family First' ideal of the core franchise, H+S has no shortage of injected Family Moments, but they never hit - perhaps because the two leads are themselves outside that comfortable F&F family, or because SO much screen time is dedicated to them trying to make fun of one another. And some of the lines in this film are just...extremely lame.It's kind of amazing to think how little is done with Johnson's towering charisma - I am reminded of how SKYSCRAPER was a genuinely horrible movie, but that Johnson was extremely charming in it. Here, he's just...in it? And Statham is always better as the sole focus of a film, so that his wooden, monotone machismo can be properly fantasized into some kind of hard-edged cool. This movie barely lets him fight, or at least, when it does, the shots are so blurry and without sense of location as to steal from Statham his hard won screen credentials as a precision fighter.Other people were in this movie, too, I am sure of it. I just can't imagine you'll remember them, either.A disappointing flick that really made me long for another FAST AND FURIOUS film - something with all the explosions, but a bit more soul.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

The plot is kinda overused, however, the execution and the focus on family ties makes this series heartwarming at some points.The comedy resulting from two loggerheads helped to soften the serious atmosphere from the early scenes which reeks of Terminator.To be honest, the stunts really amazed me, even though some of it is reminiscent of earlier F&F series. What amazed me was that this movie combines F&F with more spy-related themes such as Mission Impossible and 007, yet it is still quite refreshing, and that's saying a lot, given how stunts and plots are largely similar throughout these kinds of films.In conclusion, lots of stunts and great family fun.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
367,imjaredross,Fun & Schlock,6,30 September 2019,"I must say before I start the review even though this is the first spin off from the Fast and Furious franchise I still have never seen any of the movies, but from word of mouth and from friends and critics alike I know how much the series has changed over time and what draws people to these films. So did this film end up working for me? Well, yeah.Hobbs & Shaw is complete schlock and the film is well aware of this. I mean we have a super soldier running around calling himself black Superman so yeah. This is the kind of movie we're getting and knowing that it's best to just roll with it and see where the movie takes you. For the most part I was very entertained from beginning to end.Some may so easily dismiss the film as just pure schlock and have that as a negative, but the film feels so self aware and the film itself is entertaining enough that this doesn't pose itself as a problem for me. In fact I feel if it didn't go this route the film would be far more forgettable.Our two leads played by Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson both do a fine job in the film. They have good chemistry and good banter with each other and it's very entertaining to watch them. The action is also fun, flashy and creative with some incredibly ridiculous moments you can't help but smile at. It's villain is cheesy and over the top and just a lot of fun. That's ultimately what the movie is. It's fun.Is this technically a good movie? Probably not but it has enough fun moments and the schlock factor makes its very entertaining to watch. However, the film does have its problems that make it fall short even for schlock's sake. For one I found the film to me unnecessarily long being over 2 hours. After awhile I felt the film just should have ended. This also makes some of the action scenes blend in with each other making very few of them stand out.Also, as a side note: this movie has perhaps the weirdest casting of a film I've seen this year which made me so confused and wonder who would show up next (Ryan Reynolds, Helen Mirren, Cliff Curtis and Kevin Hart to name a few).The film is a mess, but it's the fun kind of mess. It's ridiculous, but it knows it's ridiculous and it makes me wonder how much you can really condemn a movie for doing exactly what it's trying to do. It's schlock and this is what we're going to get. I guess it just depends on the person and if this type of film is their thing. As for me I really enjoyed my time, but couldn't help but check out a few times due to its mindlessness.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

There are a few laughs to be found as this lazily written story unfolds, mainly from some mainstream references and cameos, however the ""my cocks bigger than your cock"" banter between Hobbs and Shaw soon wears thin and becomes increasingly tiresome.

The street racing days are over and this spinoff has adapted to the ever changing movie trends quite well and is cashing in on them.
It's the fast and furious recipe with over the top story, stunts, cars, villains, superstar cast, allover the world locations, family values, chaos, action, camera and sound design and overall a good production value.
It isn't supposed to be a very serious movie and has quite a lot of comic moment which you may or may like.
Overall I think quite a lot of people will enjoy it, quite a lot not and quite a lot just miss the old times which will never come back.

374,HairyMart1,Not Calvin and Hobbs,6,3 August 2019,"It's a big fun and dumb action movie, but annoyingly not as good as it should be. Statham and Johnson both know how to deliver the dumbest of lines and still make them work. While for the action set pieces there are none better. On top of which they do have a great on screen chemistry, with a great bad guy courtesy of Idris Elba, and to offer some much needed balance to all the male posturing, Vanessa Kirby (last scene as Princes Margaret in The Crown) as the MI6 agent who everyone is hunting. But while the action is inventive, and allows all the main characters their moment, the quips and bits of plot between them do sometime flounder, and the fact that the film runs for two and half hours is noticeably. Which is a really shame as the filmmakers wholeheartedly embrace the over the top ridiculousness of the whole thing and make it their own. More work on the banter and a bit of judicious editing, could have made this into a great action classic, rather than one to catch up with at some point. Some script help from a couple of the surprise cameos will be something to consider for the next one.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
375,SamwiseG,Oh dear ....,3,10 August 2019,"I can sum this up in one word.... AWFUL. Dwayne Johnson was the only saving grace for this movie, as at least with him you know what to expect and he has charisma to carry it off. Jason Statham and Idris Elba however were terrible. Statham seems to feel that he needs to play this cockney barrow boy character, yet the man is from Derbyshire!! His performance is extremely wooden, and is matched by Elba. Idris has been touted for the next James Bond, yet he keeps doing action movies that demonstrate exactly why he would be useless in that role....... first there was Bastille Day and now this. He is great when playing a sultry street wise cop, as with Stringer Bell and Luther, but action ....its not you mate.

Basically, I saw the trailer and gave it a shot.The movie is a buddy movie with two main characters that despise each other.

Let it be known, first, that I'm a fan of the F&F franchise and generally admire all 3 of the main male characters. But, overall, this movie was a big disappointment to me.
Action:: lots of fight scenes (but never between Hobbes and Shaw), vehicle chase scenes, and explosions.Blustering: Hobbes and Shaw spend an inordinate amount of time telling each other how badly they are planning on hurting each other. All talk here - no action.Acting: Only Kevin Hart impressed me. He actually played pretty much the same character he always plays but he stole the show (which wasn't hard to do). Too bad they didn't give him more air time. Ryan Reynolds - eh; not his best work.Final thoughts - a mostly unmemorable movie. I hope there is not a sequel!",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

The movie consists of quite a simple plot line throughout and it works so well! After fast 8 which seemed to lose abit of driving force (no pun intended), this spin off seems to instil some faith in the direction of its fatherhood portfolio. Aside from this, I thought it was made very well, my only criticism is that the ending was quite sporadically complex and it didn't need to be.

Great casting: Vanessa Kirby is a convincing, kick-ass spy with a wink-wink mischievous side, that fits her well as a loyal, partner-in-crime sister to Shaw, and a charming love interest to Hobbs.Guest appearances: no spoilers - let's just say they're delightful *grin*Helen Mirren is always fun to watch - as Shaw's charismatic career criminal mother; do you think the prison can hold her for long?We also get to know Shaw and Hobbs' past and their families. Many supporting characters, including Hobbs' family, had interesting lines that made the movie more enjoyable.The various car chase sequences managed to stay unique and spot-on its theme of celebrating family values. That is, this instalment kept the feel good buddy-family matters tone of the franchise, without making the action scenes look repetitive. That is an impressive feat.One weak link I suppose is Brixton, the villain. As charming and convincing as Idris Elba, the Brixton character did not have much room or lines to make him a memorable villain. The movie, after all, is already clocked at 2 hours 17 mins.Kudos to this franchise.

Johnson's and Statham's recent projects have been great, so my hopes were high. Unfortunately, this film was a big letdown.This movie is nothing like the 'Fast and Furious' franchise. Every character is cliche and every stunt is epic, but still somehow dull. Hobbs and Shaw's rivalry gets tired and is rather puzzling (those two actually have a LOT in common!) and their entire comedy together consists of cartoon style banter. Vanessa Kirby was halfway decent, but you know you're in trouble when Hobbs' mom churns out the best performance.The plot is in waaaaaay over it's head. The sci-fi element of Idris Elba's genetically enhanced villain is too much, not to mention his sadly awful performance of cliche monologuing and evil cackling. His motivation is cheesy and has been very overused in recent film.The action is huge and unrealistic, but it's not well done or fun at all. It's generic, moves too fast, is over quickly, and you've seen it all in the trailer anyway. I was shocked that this franchise failed to bring something new. Even the trip to Samoa (where people love Stallone's 'Cobra'!) managed to get botched.Sadly, 'Hobbs & Shaw' is not up to par, making it more rental worthy than theater.

392,dpg-87522,A buring and silly movie.,3,7 January 2020,"Fast and Furious is a saga that has been acclaimed by people, but I really do not like it, it is a silly saga without meaning, it can be said that it is macho, but I recognize that this is trying to give you the message of the importance of the family; Fast and Furious (2001) is not a bad movie, but it is not good, it is only mediocre, it does not have much to say, it is just one more movie in the Hollywood catalog instead its sequel + Fast + Furious (2003) that yes It is a very bad movie and in my opinion it is the worst of the saga, what happens is that it has a story so bad and poorly written that it becomes difficult to see, then it comes Fast and Furious: Challenge in Tokyo (2006) many They consider this the worst of the saga, but for me it honestly does not seem so bad, but again I can not say that it is good, the problem is that technically it is like the one but in Tokyo and without any of the characters previously presented, Quick and Furious (2009) was that movie that began to give the saga a touch of action, the problem is this has a very poor story that ends up being very bad at the technical level therefore a very bad movie, then surprisingly it takes Fast and furious 5incontrol (2011) and this is the truth if I liked it, since unlike the others this is the most visually entertaining, has the best sequences of action and is the one that ""explores"" the theme of the family, Fast and Furious 6 (2013) is a bad movie falls on the typical simplistic plot and as the others becomes heavy to watch, Fast and Furious 7 (2015) I understand that it is for many the best of the saga, but being honest much of its acclaim is only due to the impact of the death of Paul Walker (who died because it was raised in his head that he was also Fast and Furious) I can say that this is a step above the mediocre and I recognize that it has a good ending, in fact they could have closed and to finish this saga with this movie, but they let success and popularity go to their heads and they brought us Fast and Furious 8 (2017) and this one that is bad is a mediocre action movie mixed with a movie of super heroes, and fine It arrives Fast and Furious Presents: Hobs and Shaw (2019) a story of mediocre superheroes, but with the characters of Fast and Furious, in a nutshell the film is about two people who are going to save the world of black Superman. This time Fast and Furious do not bring us the ninth installment that will be later, this time they bring us a spin-off ""What joy, now Fast and Furious will form their cinematic universe."" The reason I review this movie is just because I couldn't see it when it was in theaters, so technically I barely saw it, so let's start, to start the movie is worse than I imagine, but I think it should start to talk about the good first, I can very well notice that the film gives its touch of importance to the family at the end and that some of the action sequences are something creative to tell the truth, outside of that I have nothing to say a favor of the movie. The plot is lazy repetitive and predictable, a man wants to destroy the world for us to evolve and professional agencies call Hobs and Shaw because there is no one better apparently making the CIA ridiculous, funny the fact that this movie makes the CIA as an Agency full of useless cowardly debut good for nothing, when we are honest in real life several CIA agents could break Dwayne Johnson's face and Jason Statham without any problem, finally he has to stop him and that's it, no He has nothing more to say, speaking of La Roca and Statham their performances are passable but I don't blame them at all, I say it's not like they are very good actors, I think they should use some of their money in taking acting classes instead of waste it on lawyers who defend in case someone hurts their feelings. The rivalry between Hobs and Shaw is so childish, I understand that perhaps the writers were trying to make a rivalry between the two to make the characters more realistic and more interesting, but this fails and instead of seeing two men who do not get along Well, I see two little girls fighting for which one is the prettiest, because that's what they end up achieving, the plot of the movie stops several times because these two ""alpha males"" stop to analyze to see which one is cooler. Even the action is not good, it is slow and silly that ends up boring, example ""A few soldiers are targeting the black Superman and he begins to attack them and instead start shooting all of them fleeing to kill him they see him and decide to shoot when this one already has them almost lying on the ground "", and I think they abused the CGI a lot, you can notice it with the naked eye every time they use it, and more is more of the same, as always classic of these films there are many scenes that they contradict the laws of physics, in other words that are the opposite of real life. The movie apart is something macho, it makes Hobs and Shaw shine and sexualizes something for women, and women here have no time to shine, but hey, everyone loves this movie, men and women. And finally, I just want to mention that the film is very bad at the technical level, it is badly made, it does not have a color palette or anything like that, the soundtrack is not very good, they only play popular songs that they thought were going to sound cool and that's it, but hey it's not like David Leitch is a great director, the only good thing he's done is John Wick. In conclusion, Hobs and Shaw is a 135-minute film, but that feels much longer, terrible on a technical level, visually boring, abuse of CGI, ridiculous action sequences, the comedy he has is silly, his dialogue is silly, his Villain is ridiculous for the simple fact that the bad guy says to himself when, if we compare it with the real evils of real life, he would stay in diapers, and that is why this film deserves no more than a 3/10, one of the worst movies of the year, beware that 9 and 10 are coming.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

395,pinemaples,The Hobbs and the Shaw,8,20 August 2019,"Ever since the Fast and Furious franchise reinvented itself as ""Mission: Impossible with cars"", it has regularly churned our sequel after sequel. There was an announcement a while back that the series would end at the 10th movie, but apparently they weren't counting spinoffs in that number.
The first such movie, Hobbs and Shaw, is directed by David Leitch, who also brought us Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2. As fans of the series can probably guess, it stars now-series regulars Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham as the title characters, a powerlifting cop who performs extracurricular activities, and a fearless villain-turned-antihero. Franchise newcomers include Vanessa Kirby as Hattie, the surprise third member of the buddy-cop duo, and Idris Elba as Brixton, this movie's freak of the week and resident Terminator-style bad guy.
The movie knows exactly what it is and what it's doing, and it knows how to have fun doing it. The story is mostly nonsense and just a great excuse to give us over-the-top action and to make my popcorn taste better. The chemistry between the leads is amazing. You can tell how much Statham and Johnson are enjoying being on set together with the two cracking one-liners at each other throughout the entire movie, and I'd be willing to bet that most of said one-liners are unscripted.
One thing you could hold against the movie, though, is that it tries to do too much. There are probably four or five different motivations the writers gave our protagonists for riding out the plot when one might have sufficed: villain tries to steal world-ending virus. In their defense, the other plotlines give Hobbs and Shaw reason to stick around when really anybody else could have been chosen to do the job. But the issue is also exemplified by the fact that the movie has two separate climaxes (climaces?) and THREE mid/post-credits scenes... not that I minded, because the two latter scenes were hilarious, and the second climax includes some creative stunts I've never seen before, culminating in an awesome final fight. It really didn't know when to end, but if you ask me, it's all just more of a good thing.
Speaking of which, although the movie wraps up pretty well, they leave us with a sequel hook that sets up another spinoff. Is it wrong of me to hope they call it 2 Hobbs 2 Shaw?",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Tons of cool action scenes that made me go wow. If you're a big WWE fan, you'll see The Big Dawg Roman Reigns in the film.As far as the story and plot, maybe a bit convoluted but no one goes to see an action film for the plot. You see an action film for the fights, explosions and car chases. And that is what Hobbs and Shaw delivered. I can't wait for a sequel, I wanted to watch this film again and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. Yeah, that's a winner in my book. Go watch Hobbs and Shaw.

Lots of glaring plot-holes and inconsistencies that leave you shaking your head but why am I so surprised - the knuckle-head line up should've been warning enough. I do like the rock, but he is starting to get seriously boring with his movie choices. Statham cannot act and his fight sequences are as tiresome as the Matrix revolutions got, please stop talking too. The best parts are the cameos from Mirren and Kevin Hart and I thought the bike sequences with Elba were seamless and excellent. Idris was mis-cast (isn't 'Brixton' a bit stereotypical?!), someone younger would have been more menacing. Unfortunately, sequels are planned.

405,westfield-john,Action Bizarre Mediocre,5,27 October 2019,"There is something about this movie which needs a comment.
A comment about the general direction, which the team around Dwayne Johnson is willing to go.
The team is certainly worth a good movie, a very good movie indeed,
but this isn't what Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw is.
The whole concept is more like a worn out shoe,
and all over the story is not up to modern standards,
kids from elementary school might need some co-transcription,
but well, but not all of them. It is just too stale.
Another Hobbs and Shaw tease each other to the limit.
Music ever as heavy and rock-solid spicing up the FX and eye-candy.
The most emotional thing is to watch the Hawaii People living happily in this movie.
We all know that is a tale for most of them still.
So, what would I expect from Dwayne ""THE Rock"" Johnson & Co?
Technically well done and excellent work, yes, of course.
But the screenplay, script, story et cetera all that, should really meet standards.
This movie is action with action with action and cool phrases and action and action.
You get the point, I guess.
This kind of movies won't last very long in the memories of cinematic lovers.

413,benj-20839,"Could have been so different, so much better! Trailer better than the movie.",6,5 August 2019,"So looking forward to this cus i'm a fan of the F&F franchise but the trailer was better than the movie.Since the Fast 5 it's the least favourite. With a decent narrative this could have been a lot better.Was expecting a classier Mission Impossible version of the Fast & Furious for this spin-off but what i got was a trashy xXx version instead.I loved the idea of Hobbs & Shaw but halfway through this movie i started to miss the team and family aspect of the original series.The film felt thrown together, like most have critic'd story wise.The four main players, who all had good screen time, The Rock, Vanessa Kirby and Idris Elba were ok but Statham delivered on the jokes and was the stand out in regards to the action/fighting scenes. If you've watched the movie SPY then you know Statham is very funny and he delivers here too.Its more of a comedy actioner than an action comedy, they really throw out so many jokes that the tone of this is super light and breezy, even more so than the F&F movies before it, even though it has some serious moments with the Idris' bad guy, it just doesn't mesh well. The bad guy and the good guys felt like they were in 2 separate films.
There were about 5 people in the IMAX screen i was in and i didn't hear anyone else laugh. I laughed a few times for what i mentioned above with Stathams dialog.The 2 special guest/cameo's deadened the pace and took you even further out of the story and feel of an action movie, more than you're already feeling from such a lack of narrative and focus, structure wise. They really didn't do anything for the film. The first cameo scene was amusing though.
The action set pieces weren't as gripping and unique, not as creative as in the the other Fast and Furious films, they felt more impressive in trailer form.What i was expecting and would have been better for this spin-off in my opinion was to go with a slightly grittier, darker and more serious tone storywise and in spirit than the original series, especially considering the 2 leads are serious and darker in character than Toretto's team. But still with their sense of humour that they possessed in the original series. Hobbs & Shaw ended up WAAAAY more upbeat, zanny and joke driven, its strange to say but this was so much more unrealistic, unbelievable than the Fast and Furious films before it and that's not a good thing, for me anyway. But it works with the F&F originals.This movie made me want the Toretto team franchise back asap, but with added Statham though.The film was shot in an MTV music video style and tone which we've seen before but really didn't work here, was too glossy and out of sync with the type of characters involved.I've Really enjoyed David Leitch's previous films, Atomic Blonde (8/10) and Deadpool 2 (9/10) and John Wick (10/10), so i was really looking forward to this mainly because of him being attached, his action sequences being very creative and impressive to watch combining cool character development and story but this doesn't feel anything like those films. It wasn't an awful film but i felt disappointed because i had high hopes for this because of what he has done before this and for my love of the F&F franchise and the talent involved in this one, plus those trailers were kick-ass!The franchise did start to decrease in my ratings after F&F 6 with this being the worst.After watching this the Hobbs and Shaw characters feel like they work better in the F&F Toretto series. If they make a Hobbs And Shaw sequel and its way better than this one then that's great.With more of a cohesive narrative this could have been something better, more like a Fast 5 and 6 instead its more like Fast 8 but a little more empty, shallow and cliche.
Its not an awful film but you really need to check your brain in at the door before you watch this.As a comedy The Fast And Furious movies made me laugh out loud more.It doesn't have the same DNA as the Fast And Furious series so it does separate itself from them, good or bad!The end credit scenes felt pointless and forced, just more jokey scenes.6.5/10",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

When started watch this movie for 20 minutes, i ask my wife should we just stop and change another movie? Cos i'm bored and totally not interested at all the directions they are heading, the words that comes out from their mouth makes me sleepy.. And we did change to John Wick 3.. I enjoyed that 100 times better than this for sure.. I watch this movie alone again later on just to proof my judgement is right.. Indeed after 2 hrs of my time wasted, this movie is really bad to the max.. Lucky thing is i watch for free online.. Didn't pay them a single cent..

418,miss_jb,Meh. Bad acting is really distracting.,2,31 July 2019,"I wouldn't expecting this movie would be at least has good plot let alone a masterpiece. But when the movie already lack logic and lack substance, the show will depend so much on actor charm, screen presence and good acting to make the audience believe this unbeliavable situation. The worst think is the only actor who can deliver those quality is the girl named Vanessa. she is a real badass, and wishing she is the one our main focus. The rest is hopeless. The joke is not even delivered perfectly by the actor and it become cringe fest and at times become unintentionally funny. When Ryan Reynolds finally show up at the end of the credit rolling, i wonder why he is not one of the main cast instead, and it will make this movie at least not a bore fest. Sorry.

420,sophaljonesy,Pure action at its best,9,1 August 2019,"When I heard of the Fast and Furious spin-off featuring Dwayne Johnson's Hobbs and Jason Statham's Shaw, I thought it would be interesting but left it at that. Having seen the trailer featuring Idris Elba, I was slightly more interested. I was not pumped but the trailer promised an action-packed extravaganza filled with all out brawls and car chases. After watching the movie, I was suprised by how absolutely entertaining it is. Idris Elba, the villain is basically The Winter Soldier(though he calls himself Black Superman) and is formidable both as a screen presence and a threat to The Rock and Statham's Hobbs and Shaw. The Rock and Statham were excellent and able to do what they did best: kick the living s*** out of people while wisecracking with a straight face. It also helps that they are actually talented actors and make some emotional scenes believable. The car chases are spectacular and is every bit as exhilarating as The Fast and Furious franchise and even rival The Bourne series. The action choreography enables all the actors to embrace their strengths. Dwayne Johnson gets to really use his muscles while Statham uses his quick fists and kicks. Elba, having trained in kickboxing himself, also gets to believably kick both The Rock and Jason Statham's ass. There isn't much of a plot but having Shaw rescuing his sister provides some character motivation but luckily, the movie focuses less on family drama and more on both of them in action. The Samoan battle scene from the trailer is epic, and the ending leaves me fully satisfied. It helps that there are good cameos and post credit scenes that leave you wanting more Hobbs and Shaw but still feeling satisfied with what you have got. And that is how good this movie is as an action film. It is pure testosterone fueled action at its best!",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
421,GDovW,Some scenes too long but ... Fun action movie!!,8,3 October 2019,"3 points.
1. I am surprised by the large gap between scores. It looks like the fans of Fast and Furious were the most disappointed ... but the title of the movie says it: ""F&F *presents* Hobbs and Shaw"" and not ""F&F: Hobbs and Shaw"" ... so of course the style is different !! It is Hobbs and Shaw's styles !!! They are not drivers, they are not over-complicated-often-going-wrong thieves !! ... they are ACTION men !! One is a bulldozer, the other one a lets-get-to-it-then guy !
That is what the movie is giving = you KNOW what you get ! (that is why i like it)
2. It is good that they do say it is an F&F movie ... so you know at some point, it is going to be a mess, too much, out of logic, and getting too long. And because you know it ... you are NOT surprised when at some point - Helicopter Vs. Cars - it is exactly LIKE THAT: too much, out of logic, and too long (that is why i prefer to watch such movies at home => you can fast forward !!! :D )
3. Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham (2 very famous action actors) provide us a movie with funny moments (pick yours), lots of action, a view of Samoa, and very diverse environments to let go of the adrenaline ... and doing so with some actor friends in it! What else do the 1 to 5 stars voters want ???I do not like most of the F&F movies because of the ""too much too stupid"" parts, but i knew what to expect from this one (no Dominic and his team, some car chases, some over the top scenes) and i knew it was going to be too long some times ... that's why i don't go to the cinema to watch such movie - i know i would be disappointed by lonnnngggiiiinnnnngggg scenes and the ""Oh come on!"" moments - and i choose my wide screen computer instead where i can jump up the scenes i don't like ... suddenly the movie gets so much better !!
And really, Hobbs and Shaw did not disappoint !! ... actually hoping to watch another one in the near future ;)",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Like many reviewers say, dont come looking for something else. These guys are actions stars, they do this the best, they are Oscar winners in their own segment in their own right.
Introduction of some comedy, in the bickering between Johnson and Statham is a pretty good addition.
The only negative one could think of would be the length. Could have cut a bit of the banter and wouldnt lose anything in the process. Also Roman could use a little more exposure.

434,BlizzyFoxTF,Great action movie for the most part,5,1 August 2019,"Considering that it was my first time watching a FF film, my expectations were pretty low. I am seldom a fan of popcorn blockbusters like this; cookie cutter products of a formulaic mindset that sets out to do the bare minimum to indulge audiences. At the end, my view didn't change, though I was fairly impressed with this new entry to the generic Hollywood formula.The film, at one point, actually established itself as a great action movie. Despite the platitudinous story, the writing was stellar for its kind. The humor was actually on point and witty for a whole 90 minutes of the runtime, at times referential and at times genuinely hilarious. The cameos were pretty damn good, and the chemistry of the two leads were strong. I was pretty satisfied with the action scenes despite their banal nature, although I would prefer a bit more camera stability and wide angled shots.The biggest problem of the film is its third act. The film dragged when the characters arrived at Samora, and although a little bit of family history regarding the leads is nice, it ultimately felt detrimental to this film. The movie could have skipped that part and ended sooner, and it would make for a better filmgoing experience.All in all, it is an action film that earns a positive rating at the very least despite the obvious flaws. I would recommend it to people who wants a chill day in the cinema, but not for serious film critics.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

436,michaeltong-29180,Over-the-top even for an F&F,5,30 September 2019,"I usually enjoy the wild, gravity defying set-pieces from the Fast and Furious franchise, but this movie showed the limits of upping the ante to extreme degrees with each iteration. The stakes are higher, and the villain is stronger than any in the series, but it was totally unnecessary. If they scaled it back a bit and had more grounded action it could have been much better.Johnson and Statham make a great team. When they're kicking ass and cracking jokes it's a lot of fun, and if the movie had consisted mainly of that it would have been perfect, but instead they loaded the plot with super-viruses, super-humans, and secret organizations. It's becoming as wild as something written by Hideo Kojima.The CGI action and explosions get boring at a certain point. It defeats the purpose of having two of the best action stars when they're on a green-screen reacting to explosions that aren't even there.Even though I enjoyed watching it, I'm giving it a 5/10 because I think its potential was squandered. Rather than having a distinct and unique flavor, it's bland and fails to stand out.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
437,khaabd,Entertainment movie in the first place,7,27 September 2019,"Although the film is derived from Fast & Furious, I consider it better than the series itself, Where Jason and Dwyne created wonderful chemistry between them not in terms of comedy and or the arrogance that took place between them and good action scenes, In addition to all the other roles were also wonderful with Alba and Vanessa, I would also like to pay tribute to director david Leitch who never disappoints in his films

This movie was built to entertain people and it does it masterfully. Vanessa Kirby actually steals the show which I suppose isn't too surprising as she is a brilliant actress whereas Dwayne and Jason just pretty much play their stereotypical selves but they will always be charming whilst they do it. Nice to see Idris play a bad guy as he always has a menacing presence and voice. For the small amount of Ryan Reynolds is on screen, you just can't help but love him, he is one of the funniest people to ever grace the silver screen and he doesn't disappoint here.

449,hakan_respect,Thoughts on f&f Hobbs and Shaw,7,20 August 2019,"First of all I must say that I have seen all the 8 movies in the franchise. From street races to saving the world again and again. Hobbs&Shaw basically is about two big star being forced to work each other because of Shaw's sister. While Shaw back in the business to save his sister, Hobbs tries to save the world. Apart from that two lead characters have little more character development but it could be more character development especially with the bad guy and the side characters. I liked the chemistery between 2 lead characters and I liked cameo of Ryan Reynolds, I can't wait to see him more in the franchise. Also I satisfied some action scenes like hallway fighting scene. On the other hand I have several issues with the movie like ridiculousness of some scenes like Hobbs stopping Chopper with his bare hands and romance between him and shaw's sister.
Briefly, it is a good silly action movie but it shouldn't be considered a f&furious movie. I have got what I expected. If you like action movies or two of movie's lead star you should watch it definitely on IMAX.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
450,garabedbaghsarian,No place for disappointment,9,27 September 2019,"Generally speaking, the movie was excellent in terms of picture, hilarious funny scenes and story idea. Seeing Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Shaw (Jason Statham) teaming up side by side was something I never saw possible, but they were the best combo, especially the funny arguments between them. Kevin Hart's and Ryan Reynolds' appearances gave the movie extra touch in comedy aspect.
However, when you say Fast & Furious, I automatically imagine supercars, incredible races along with the action that solves the case, in which this movie lacked, maybe that's how it was supposed to be.
I highly recommend watching this movie if you want to have something that has mixture of comedy and action at same time.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

456,CriticalRaccoon,A funny buddy action flick that falls short of the Fast franchise standard,5,26 August 2019,"The Fast And The Furious movie series is approaching 20 years old and I'm surprised it took them this long to start milking it dry.Hobbs & Shaw is the first spinoff of the The Fast And The Furious franchise. It uses the Fast series' trademark gigantic action scenes, but changes things up ... um ... sort of ... not really.Director David Leitch seems to have taken what he learned from Deadpool 2 and Ryan Reynolds' style of comedy and tried to meld it with the Fast-formula. It works for a time, but then just gets lost along the way.Hobbs & Shaw is a buddy action film that leans heavily on the chemistry of Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Shaw (Jason Statham) as they attempt to save the world from cyber-enhanced super soldier Brixton Lore (Idris Elba) - who Shaw has ""history"" with - as he tries to acquire a programabble super virus named 'Snowflake' for terrorist group Eteon. You know the drill: kill the weak, reshape the world, etc. Shaw's sister Hattie (Vanessa Kirby) gets involved too by infecting herself with Snowflake to stop Brixton from getting the virus in the opening scene. Oh and Hobbs' previously unmentioned gigantic Samoan family shows up at the end for ... reasons. As a Fast movie, of course it's really all about #family. (I ironically use that #family joke because it's so overused in the Fast series that I laugh at it every time)First off, yes this is plot does oddly sound like Mission: Impossible 2 had a baby with Tango & Cash.Hobbs & Shaw is a Fast movie so you know what that means: explosions, car chases, #family, big action, etc. It delivers on those, but doesn't elevate it beyond what you'd expect beyond more emphasis on fisticuffs. It's a tad too safe. Of course the bad guy is defeated by Hobbs and Shaw working together ... because #family.The thing that sets Hobbs & Shaw apart from the other Fast movies is how comedic it is. Hobbs and Shaw simply don't like each other - in fact several extended jokes are just them telling each other how much they would like to punch the other dude in the face. Hattie also brings a lot of levity with her witty banter - making fun of the two leads as much as possible. The jokes work well when the film remembers to be funny. Unfortunately the laughs all but die out when we get to the final act and it becomes another #family action climax. Seriously, Hobbs & Shaw starts off as a buddy cop comedy but then for some reason abandons it ... well, until the 4 mid-credits scenes.The real standout for Hobbs & Shaw is Vanessa Kirby as Hattie. Yes she's technically way too young to play Jason Statham's 2-years-younger sister, but I'll forgive that as Statham hasn't aged since 1997. She brings some much needed life to Hobbs & Shaw that alleviates the constant dick-measuring that our title characters do. She's basically a more comedic version of Ilsa Faust from Mission: Impossible (ironic since Kirby's character in Fallout wanted Faust dead). I'm glad Vanessa Kirby is getting more exposure because she's the type of actor who can have chemistry with a turnip. I'd totally be down with her being in more of these films.The other big new character here is Idris Elba as the villain/rival Brixton Lore. As much as I love Idris Elba, I just wish his villain was remotely intimidating. Brixton is essentially a dark-Shaw ... wait Shaw was a villain until popularity made him an anti-hero ... um, Brixton is that dragon that forces the heroes to put aside their differences and work together. He works okay, but too often his fight scenes end with the heroes getting away and he pouts back home to his bosses. He's talked up as some sort of unbeatable behemoth, but he comes across as just another tough guy to fight. Oh and he's just a pawn for some other new big-bad-boss out there; so that's two new big bosses in the last two Fast series films?I hesitate to call Hobbs & Shaw boring when it features gigantic explosions and Hobbs literally pulling a helicopter to the ground with his muscular arms ... but it doesn't leave an impression. As a spinoff, you know that they are saving the ""big"" stuff for the main series, and Hobbs & Shaw lacks the series trademark action insanity. Other than Hobbs' muscles there's really no standout scenes like the classic over-the-top stuff we've come to expect from the Fast movies.Oh, and I guess I'll state that I honestly don't feel like this film had to exist at all. The characters start off hating each other, they end off hating each other, and aside from introducing a couple of side characters I don't think fans skipping Hobbs & Shaw will have missed anything once Fast 9 shows up. (The Fast Nine? The Fine And The Furious? 2 Fast 2 Fine?)I can't say that I hated Hobbs & Shaw, but I can't say that I'd really be inclined to recommend it to people outside the Fast fandom either. Hobbs & Shaw gives fans of the Fast series exactly what they would expect out of a film starring two characters measuring their dicks against each other for 2-hours: lots of punching and hostile banter. Hobbs & Shaw is a loud, testosterone-filled series of action scenes with loads of comedy sprinkled throughout, but I just don't think it stands up compared to the mainline Fast movies now. It's a fine way to mindlessly spend 2-hours, but there are far better action films out there.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

We went into the movie looking for Hobbs & Shaw kicking *ss with their great rapport, cracking jokes and insulting each other. They delivered and much more. Idris Elba just exploded off the screen. He literally can act any role/character you give him. He added additional intensity to a movie that was already intense with explosions, action, fighting, and off the wall cliff hangers.

Produced by Jason and Dwayne together brings out the true talents of these great stunt, action, physical style actors and they don't disappoint.1. Great plot.
2. Excellent pace, keeps you into it so much you may forget your popcorn.
2. Great nemesis, although I still think of Heimdall from the Marvel movies and The Dark Tower, He makes a formidable foe.
3. cool gadgets, weapons, cars, driving, stunts, explosions, suspense, humor, ending. It has it all.Of course this is a far fetched unbelievable in actual reality movie, but you don't go to a movie like this to bring it down to reality, you want an escape, and this movie does it well.I do hope they both produce the sequel and keep up the pace.They didn't even need the ""fast and furious"" in the title, but everything in this movie was definitely fast and furious.I'm truly surprised at the bad reviews and I totally agree with so many others, these bad reviewers are paid to be bad reviewers, or they just don't know a great action movie if they were in it themselves, shame on you!Take a bunch of friends, you won't be disappointed.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Whats to be said two rock heads do some obvious stunts with terrible effects and worst of all no racing like the first movies were about and they strayed farther from as the sequels kept coming. Whatever story there was was terrible the dialogue cliche and laughable. Overall a huge waste of time that will add nothing to your life. I just can't believe this many troglodytes would give this a 9 or 10 rating I mean learn the ratings obviously a 10 is for a flawless in other words the best movie you've ever seen and 9 almost perfect which if this movie is the best you've ever seen then you need to see more movies.

The opening scene is very climatic but the pacing slows after that for about an hour.
Some points don't make much sense until the end and sometimes logic isn't applied. For example, someone got stabbed with a brick, in a room full of guns the weapons of choice were a shower and a toaster, and somehow a large truck managed to outrun a large explosion.

469,inc-133-70013,"New level of ""bad""",1,4 June 2021,"Fast & Furious franchise started out as a teenage boy fantasy with sexy girls, petty crime and riced-up cars. Over 9 installments, it has morphed and changed, in both content and target audience, suiting more into a time slot on Cartoon Network rather than silver screen. Somewhat likeable characters and nostalgia is what has kept the franchise together so far, until someone got an idea to make a spin-off. It felt like a broken vase held together by impressive glue, more and more with each sequel.Which is this one, and shows basically what happens if you take away the glue. All you have is shards of glass.For most of the movie, I wasn't really paying attention to the screen, and wondered, instead, how can it be that Hollywood is the only place on the planet where such incompetence is both okay and generously rewarded. Would writers of this flick try their hand at any other profession, say, a dentist or air traffic controller with similar level of incompetence and ignorance, they'd be in handcuffs before their first lunch break. The script and direction of this movie would embarrass even a 9-year old (which clearly seems to be the target audience).Jason Statham plays Jason Statham. A cocky dude that doesn't look like any nationality in the world, but he's saying ""wanker"" and ""bollocks"" every now and then so you'd remember that he's British.Dwayne Johnson plays what seems to be bootleg Hulk Hogan who bought himself into a B-movie with him in the lead, just to make his bucket list or whatever. Except that he seems to take it seriously.Neither of them do anything interesting as action movie heroes. They don't come up with clever plans to overtake enemy, don't display any amazing martial arts or tactical shooting. What they do is moan and whine and insult each other, trying to save entire shipwreck with forced humor.While it doesn't really work - I couldn't imagine anyone laughing in their tears at this, there's some weirdness, as comedy actually lands every now and then, but outside the fourth wall. In one scene, Statham calls The Rock a she-hulk with nothing else but brute force. While it doesn't land as poke at his lawman role in the movie, it does, generally, at him being an actor in a movie to begin with.The action and comedy genre usually have worst movies, because they're somewhat risky genres (horror flick can save itself with just few jump scares and a bit of mystery), and this film seems to take only the worst of both genres.It does ""fan service"" for a good bit (who are those fans?), then it rips off Mission: Impossible 2, then it rips off old 007 movies with entire evil genius lair thingy and when you think they're about done, they do entire fourth act, ripping off The A-Team (series) with complete low-tech-villagers prepare-for-baddies-attack montage. Just in case you thought the movie lacks cringe and is only all about bad CGI and fast cuts of nothing special.If Vanessa Kirby's inhumanly beautiful face wasn't shown every 3 minutes, I don't think had made it to minute 20.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

481,Koma-Mo,Wished it would have gone more of a dumber route.,5,28 August 2019,"With each new entry to the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise, it gets more ridiculous and dumber and somehow it gets a lot of money back from the box office and has now started doing spinoffs in order to expand this franchise. I really expected this film to go even more over the top than how it ended up being and I'm actually a little disappointed because of that.There are parts of the film that did have the expected excessiveness, but the whole basic structure of the movie is exactly like a typical action movie that we have seen from both of these leads. The film is still dumb and tries to add a more science fiction feel to it, but it is not enough to make this adventure with these macho men anymore interesting.This especially goes for the overall directing by David Leitch. His films do tend to have a bit more style added to it, but I really felt that his directing here is simply flat. You do have your typical fighting sequences that you are used to from the two leads here, but you also have the extremely wild chase sequences that were at times good, but with other times, it felt boring due to how stupid it got and by going on way longer than it should have. This is totally different from the other films in the franchise due to the fact that you do not see a lot of car races that you normally see in the franchise. You are instead treated with the big chase scenes that you normally see in a typical action film.As exposed as Dwayne Johnson is, I do like watching him in films and he does have great charisma, along with Jason Statham who I do like to watch more and does some pretty fun action sequences. The dynamic that they have built up in the previous movies is still there and to see these two characters banter back and forth is probably one of the more entertaining parts of the movie. Watching them go into action and just going along with the ride was enjoyable when it came to some of the scenes. Some of the others went on a bit too long and didn't provide the overall excitement that is more present in the previous movies of this franchise.Vanessa Kirby is actually a nice edition to this franchise and not on did I like her character, but she is able to kick some, so watching her stand on her own against the baddies was pretty nice to see. Other than his superhuman abilities, Idris Elba as the main villain wasn't all that interesting, but Elba did the best that he could with what he was provided with. There are some surprising cameos that do pop up in the movie and I thought they were the worst parts of the whole film. It really felt like the film went to an absolute halt, just to have the audience react to see them on the screen. They overstayed their welcome as these cameos made their scenes awkward by making very lame jokes.Fans may get a kick out of it and enjoy this side story involving these characters. As an action film, I have to say that the film doesn't really do anything special to make it stand out and as a film part of the franchise, it wasn't as interesting as the more recent ones, lacking that memorable moment that was present in the predecessor.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

484,kshehzad,Owners of Fast & Furious Franchise Must Take Some Cues from the Makers of Mission: Impossible-Fallout,5,4 August 2019,"When a successful cinematic franchise is milked fully and sucked till bottom content wise then run of the mill spin offs become the only and logical offset of any further creative efforts from the makers of same franchise. Like it or not but aforementioned seems the understandable reason of existence of new Fast & Furious spin off ""Hobbs & Shaw"" which has been directed by David Leitch who is known for the films like ""John Wick"" and ""Dead Pool"". Although John Wick and ""Dead Pool"" were all in all action movies but critics loved them because of their novelty in the treatment of the story line but unfortunately ""Hobbs & Shaw"" severally lacks in it. Though ""Hobbs & Shaw"" is certified Hollywood production but seems like writing team led by Chris Morgan has been taken notes from 90s Bollywood movies starring Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan. It seems writers did not do much brainstorming to create something new but they would have spared some time to watch John Woo's ""Mission: Impossible II"".There is no need for disappointment for the Fast & Furious fans because there are few elements which still make ""Hobbs & Shaw"" a watchable treat. First and foremost the main lead Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Jason Statham who are the main USP of this spin off. Their presence, persona and banter for each other prove how beautifully they have excelled in the field of acting. Albeit they are known for their action skills but with ""Hobbs & Shaw"" they have shown their fans and critics that they are fully capable of taking roles which require zero action. First time fans and critic will give this Fast & Furious spin off a second watch only because of their acting skills but not the action. One can expect outstanding action, jaw dropping stunts ""Hobbs & Shaw"" does not disappoint us apart from less than few scenes which are insanely stupid but does not devalue & derail overall product.Acting talent of an actor like Idris Elba has been completely wasted along with weak script but on the whole ""Hobbs & Shaw"" is good summer treat for the fans of action movies. After watching ""Hobbs & Shaw"" it seems like today's action directors from Hollywood are more focused on showing the miracles of new technologies on silver screen than the interesting content. In my opinion owners of Fast & Furious franchise must take some cues from the makers of last year's ""Mission: Impossible-Fallout"" to learn how to maintain an ideal balance between action and content.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

493,harshbhagat-26001,Fast & Slow.,5,6 August 2019,"Fast and Furious Presents Hobbs and Shaw which is actually a spin off of these huge action packed franchise. This film actually hits all the right notes pre-intermission or as you can say the first hour. Its entertaining to begin with and the best thing about it is its pace not talking about the pace of vehicles but pace of the screenplay. The another great thing is its extremely funny and surprisingly silly. Hobbs and Shaw benefits also from its great leads both Statham and Johnson entertain us with their great chemistry together which in the film is actually a oppose-addiction. Like kids they fight argue and absolutely deny each other and thats what brings the real fun. But i would like to say barring some great chasing scenes there are not much of chases here infact its a illustrious action film. But one that lacks substance, the family agenda feels stretched and climax is superb up but the buildup toward the climax is unconvincing and a bit stretched. Its like watching two films on one ticket. One a great comic action thriller which is pacy and other which is a family agenda film which relies on a mission which builds up to a mindblowing climax. Overall the pace the acting and comedy before interval most of it its fantastic but the stretched post intermission drama and over the top ridicuolusness brings us to a point where we get frustrated and lose a count who is doing to whom and for what sake. The villianeous approach is forgettable and the great chemistry between johnson and statham although overwritten makes this film a pretty average film. On the whole its a one time forgettable watch which could have been so so better if trimmed just 20 minutes because those 20 minutes take away the pace in an otherwise great action movie which ends up being average. I'm going with 2.5/5 for hobbs and Shaw.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

500,chirox,"Dire, unless you've got the mind of a child.",1,23 September 2019,"Possibly the worst film I've seen in the last couple of years. Dialogue was woefully bad, story line was childish at best and even the set-pieces were disappointingly poor.
I feel sorry for Jason Statham, he's being churned out like a stripper at the Ye Old Axe on Hackney Road on a Sunday afternoon. I know he's not a great actor but pick something other than for money ffs bruv. He actually looks like he's had a stroke while he's talking (shouting) during this feature, every line comes out of one side of his mouth, he seems incapable of speaking normally any more, he's become a caricature of himself. The Rock is equally , not a good actor at the best of times but relying on physique and being able to raise a single eyebrow (yeah that old chestnut, again) does not carry an entire movie.
As for Idris Elba, I am bitterly disappointed that he has blown any chance of getting quality roles any more by selecting movies that pay him a big dividend rather than looking at the actual content of the scripts he's sent. His agent and manager should be shot on sight for ruining what could of been a great career making stand-out features, it's sad.

Apart of characters and some dialogues I did not get Two Fast Two Furious vibes at all. Some stunts were ok, the skyscraper one in particular and car chase which followed. Rock looked like Maui and Statham was his normal self. We get to find out more about Rock's character. Obviously when you are cool, divorced ?, father you need to come from tropical paradise and have warrior ancestors. Oh god....please.
The story was absolutely ridiculous. Think Ben 10 kiddish, silly excuse to make the movie kinda story. I fell asleep just near the end and woke up for the boss battle. I did not feel the need to move back to the point before I fell asleep, yup movie was that good.
My wife once again walked out and could not finish the movie. She gave up after 20 minutes but I think that it was entertaining, shallow popcorn movie. I give it 6/10.Ps. please do not call this movie a thriller, it is anything but. Peace out.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

This ISN'T a Fast & Furious movie - it is a spin-off and is actually better than all but the first F&F...It was exactly what it was supposed to be; An over-the-top popcorn action flick and to that end it was excellent. The acting was slightly better than in the ensemble furious movies and was a little more intelligently written. No, it isn't a Shakespearean level piece of literary prose destined to be dissected for generations to come, it's a summer action flick. Idris Elba stole every scene he was in, by design I imagine, and once again proves he can bring a character truly to life in any genre of film. Johnson and Statham are action film icons and did what they usually do, and looked like they were really having fun in the portrayal of their characters - no Bruce Willis style of 'mailing it in' for this movie.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

I feel the movie came up with some crazy CG action scenes and just tried to come up with a story. If you are expecting any plot, interconnected story lines, depth or physics; make a hard pass on the movie. If you can turn off your brain for 2 hours and enjoy over the top impossible action scenes you will get some enjoyment from it. However the lack of consequences and inconsistentencies throughout the movie are jarring. This is a fast food movie. It is chock full of things that are bad, such as cheese (the dumb jokes and plot) and bacon (the over top action and the Rock's muscles)... But occasionally you just have to say f-it and get it.

The banter from them all was brilliant even Elba he was a wonderful as the baddy.

522,naturallyrockin,Over-the-top Unrealistic (and everything else),3,12 August 2019,"I've really enjoyed the F&F franchise, for the most part, so I was excited to see how the story continued. I personally like Duane Johnson a lot, and have fond memories of chatting in baggage claim after a flight, prior to his acting career. But, I was not prepared for this movie. It was graphic overload - in your face. Way overdone foul language and crude verbal jabs (the writers seem far too enamored with male genitalia - once reference in a movie is more than plenty); they plastered it on, so disgusting, and not suitable for a PG-13. I definitely don't want my teenagers seeing this movie, but they'll want to see it because of F&F/Hobbs&Shaw -- so it's maddening that the producer/director/writers know that teenagers are going to want to go, and then they vomit filth all over them in the movie.As far as storyline/plot - it was great -- a perfect advancement for the franchise. Acting and casting was great too. So, what could have been a nice addition to my library will never be on my shelf because of so much graphic content.Lastly, this movie just beat out Skyscraper as the most unrealistic Duane Johnson movie ever. (But I liked Skyscraper because the values in the movie were so good) Was this supposed to be a drama or a farce? It was so unrealistic, that it was ludicrous. It seems Hollywood is so taken with special effects and the ability to make the ""unimaginable possible"" through film technologies, that they just want to show off, instead of providing a real story that could actually happen.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

The action sequences are good as expected and way over the top. Look this is a popcorn movie at the end of the day and for that it meets the demands of such, but the bickering between the main characters was just to over the top. They also introduced characters that really where no addition to the plot. I would definitely say that this movie would have been much better if they had removed at least 10 minutes of the bickering track and additional characters who where of no benefit. All in all if you like F&F it is probably worth a look, but don't expect it to be in the category because it does not match that kind of expectation.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

526,emu81684,Definitely Worth a Watch,8,26 September 2019,"Hobbs and Shaw is filled with utterly ridiculous fight scenes, explosions, and car chases, but it's well worth a watch. The chemistry between the entire cast (and I mean ENTIRE cast, which is rare) is awesome. They flow together like they've always known one another, and it works. The snarky, sarcastic banter between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham has some genuine laugh out loud moments. Vanessa Kirby slides in seamlessly, her fight scenes are great, and she definitely steals the show from time to time. But, hands down, my favorite character was Hobbs' mother. Maybe it's because I've known a few sandal-throwing moms, but she was so great. My only complaint was relegating Idris Elba's character Brixton to little more than a henchman. He was an amazing henchman, sure, but Idris Elba is such a great actor that I think he could have been given a bigger role in the criminal organization they had in this film.All in all, I really enjoyed this movie, and it doesn't feel like a Fast and Furious spinoff, which I appreciate.

Rating: 7/10Review: This movie is pure protein .. i mean.. pure action.
Do not expect a Mission Impossible, James Bond or Bourne Identity type plot / story.
It's a bombastic & visually spectacular action movie. Very well choreographed and has new stunts. (with no logic ) The quality of action is as par with the Marvel movies. Reminded me of the 90s actioners. By the way, this movie has nothing Fast&Furiousish in it. They have just borrowed the 2 character from it. The movie is on its own. More like Bad Boys. (But iss jodi mai koi fattu nahi hai .Both go head to head)
Stars of this movie:
Dwayne Johnson Dsouza (very good)
Jason Statham (charismatic)
Idris Elba (he was very good, got plenty screen time & stunts, also kicked the butts of Jason & Dwayne, but i will remember him for one thing ... this slogan actually suited him .. ""The Man.. The Machine .. Street Hawk"" if you know what i mean. (Nostalgia)

I need not have worried, however, as the movie contained its fair share of epic car chases and vehicles that viewers would happily steal (I call dibs on the motorcycle). The bickering between the main characters was hilarious and not overworked.I would say this film situates well alongside the Fast & Furious franchise with a few splashes of the cyborg sci-fi genre and an occasional Black Panther-esque tone. Viewers also get to see nods to the actors' filmographies, adding another layer to the story. However, while the mix of sci-fi, racing, and familial and cultural messages was overall refreshing and intriguing, I couldn't help but notice that the various elements clashed at times.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

This entire story line felt forced and it showed throughout the entire movie. The movie becomes completely sci fi and it treats the two leads as superheroes. I couldn't finish it in one sitting.This movie was incredibly cheezy and brainless. The story made no sense at all. It's like it was written by a bad script algorithm. I liked the banter between the characters in Fate of the Furious, but the writers tried way too hard this time around. All the decent parts are overshadowed by the ridiculous action.

Why are they still making these films when they don't have any story or plot or just about nothing to show as such. Saving the world!! That was a big joke in the movie. Utterly nonsense.I could not stand to watch this movie for more than one hour. And that too was so uncomfortable. The whole movie was loud for no reason at all. I left the hall after interval and watching me leave another 7-8 people left the theatre.Dissatisfied and disappointed. Very bad.,Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

I've seen better straight-to-dvd, action movies.The movie has its moments like the banter between Hobbs and Shaw, Vanessa Kirby,who plays Shaw's sister, was far better in Mission Impossible: fallout.

And what a ride it was! Great fight scenes and car chases, and the script was very entertaining in the hands of The Rock and Stratham. Watch for Stratham's practical joke at immigration and the scene where the two of them trade insults across a plane aisle. Hilarious!

There was no compromise on that phase of VFX.Things to watch
1.How Hobbs and Shaw refuse to work for each other and when they do I think the bullying has done most of the work of the first half.
2.The action.The movie has quiet surprising action sequels and the way they go OLD SCHOOL was quiet unexpected for me to watch.

The movie relies solely on the chemistry between The Rock and Statham. The jokes are solid, but only 1 or 2 have actually made me laugh out loud. The action was something you would expect from a fast and furious movie. My question to the director and the cameraman is: Why are there so many close-ups of someone's face?

There is nothing to see here for anyone who is not a teenage boy sans another more constructive outlet for their testosterone build-up; or a man of age who has severely stunted maturity (and, likely, intellect).Biological WMD? Check! Government seemingly oblivious to potential extinction level event? Check! Saving the world(™) left up to a muscle head, a hot head, and their broom-brooms and pews-pews? Check! Femme fatal lust interest with familial complications? Check! Boom-crash opera comprised of video game tier CGI action sequences -- tacked together with lulls of perfunctory dialogue? Check! Truncated third act -- because actors and crew had far better things to do (like, for example, counting their grotesquely exorbitant salaries)...? Check, check, check...!""Block bu$ter"" action films really have been wallowing in the nadir of the genre's own excrement for years now. The correlation between the declination in quality of ""leave your brain at the door"" entertainment, cannot be seen as anything but analogical to the diminution of collective societal I.Q.'s. As such, it's hardly surprising FF:H&S is the proverbial faeces trowelled to screen -- I don't even hold that fact against the film. It's just disturbing that these junk food products of the entertainment medium, are sustaining the entire Ponzi scheme that is today's film industry... Which surely must indicated its imminent collapse.
Sidebar: Dwayne Johnson not realising his (possible) potential talent, post-'Get Shorty', is disappointing. He was far more entertaining as professional wrestler. As for Statham... Well, he hasn't done anything of note since Snatch -- no surprises here.

Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart, they told a story. Statham seemed more anon and this film was really a kind of redemption for him but I found myself not caring. This film was have been so much better if the ending was to give him the virus, he injects himself then hurls himself into the fire.There are some genuinely funny lines in this film. There are also touching scenes involving Hobbes's daughter. The backdrops or the sets give a lot of character to the film.

The movie is pretty awesome as an action movie with all the insane and I guess ""unrealistic"" stunts but as a Fast & Furious movie kinda takes it away from what the F&F franchise used to be about with racing and robbery heists and all.As much as I like Dawyne Johnson but there are bits of moments where I find him quite overrated sometimes with so many one liners he delivers ever since the previous Fast & Furious movie but he's still a cool actor. For Jason Statham on the other hand, he's the reason why I watched this movie because of how badass he is, love all his skills and his style. A few of his one liner deliveries do feel uncomfortable sometimes but the others were pretty good. Love Idris Elba as the villain of movie, badass and sick but ridiculous at the same time having him as a superhuman.Overall, because its part of the F&F franchise, it is getting crazy and ridiculous that involves saving the world and such and including crazy things like Idris Elba's character as enhanced superhuman.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

The fight scenes were especially spectacular and the car chases were well made and entertaining. However, the plot was weak and I can only assume that the 'comedy' was aimed at the 12 year olds able to see the film because of the certification. It was so silly it was just embarrassing in places. The whole thing was just too far-fetched and should have been about an hour shorter. Oh, and unless you have seriously bad taste in music or are under 16, you'll cringe at the nauseating soundtrack, which is stuffed with the vapid drone of hip-hop. Overall it's a bit of fun, but I won't bother with any sequel if it appears.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
626,adsitm,Incomprehensible And predictable,2,7 August 2019,"The buddy comedy bromance didn't come together here. They are dull and limp. The romance point is stronger with rock & kirby. It's a visual effects heavy bombastic non-thrill ride. Dialogue when they are trying to break up is so boring I zone out. Deadly virus- yawn all you need to prevent is quarantine or face masks (see contagion).The stakes didn't feel real to me and there has been a tired formula that has developed after 8 previous films. Even the rock's or Elba's magic can't make up for this being some terminator rip off macguffin (the only trick up its sleeve). Why is some stupid ai in charge of him? It can talk cute and have some flashing lights in a wall. Shaw is monotone and shuffled to side, as usual. The only reason anyone did this is probably to get a free trip to Samoa (Hawaii). the family is so crazy and dysfunctional there; who would want their help no matter how desperate you are? They don't seem like they know how to screw in a light bulb between the ten or so in their household. Mom is a total buzkill- how do you fight with a stick and heart vs guns. Old school against #elbanator?! Viewers my advice is to stick to the main film series which is better. Hope the Rock does the 10th in the main series and more.P.s.

It makes sense, Statham and The Rock need a tough adversary so why not make him a robot thingy killer. Have Idris play him. So far so good.Now make Statham and Rock totally unhurtable too. As Daffy Duck would say 'Whoops'. Why do modern action films do this, I haven't seen new Rambo yet but I wouldn't be surprised if that is the same. These 'human' good guys can take a punch and survive explosions as well as any terminator John wick and it's ruined the whole film.There is zero tension here too. Zilch, nothing. Action films slowly build tension until we get to the big finale. Look at the best action movies, Total Recall, Commando, RoboCop, Die Hard, Raid, Lethal Weapon, Predator, Oldboy, Under Siege, Bad Boys etc etc. The tension builds from the back and it gets harder and harder for the heroes until it all explodes at the end. Not in modern action movies. Nowadays action is something that just happens between dialog. Boring.The stunts are crazy and the human heroes can out jump and out drive any super charged android and the plot is ripped from Avengers with the bad guy wanting to wipe out and rebuild mankind. Are these screenwriters trying to tell us something not very subtly.Anyway. Watch this film.

642,justinleblanc59,Hobbs And Shaw Capture Storytelling Again,8,7 August 2019,"This film to be was better than I expected it to be.it's a Fast & Furious movie , so you already know there will be over exagerated action and fight sequences , so this is a given.But the story goes really in depth as well with Dwayne Johnson and Jason Staham having great chemestry on set. Their hatred toward each which became a friendship motion of the film was really well done.Comedy - There is some great laughs , weather it would be Johnson's and Stathams childish bickering or the over exagerated action sequences - which honestly don't overly push the limit like you would expect from a ' expendables' like film of even the ' fast and Furious Franchise' especially in installmenst 6 and 7.But in this film it was just enough exageration to not be annoying.The villan was spot on as well - 'brixton' who is played by Idris Elba, does a fantastic villan, and his determination to want to kill those not worthy of the cause, is seen through out and is a great and believable villan.Rating:The movie gets an 8 because it delivered in storytelling, humour and action sequences, all the main characters were great and believable ( as believable a syou can make them in a fast and furious franchise) and was a breath of fresh air from the long over played characters on the original fast and furious franchise.i went on a tuesday which was half price, but i would definitely pay full price for the film - i legit was entertained.fun fact: I am not a fan of Jason Statham , i generally find him over cocky and annoying ( crank , expendables) but in this film he wasn't bad at all, he really meshed well with Johnson's character along with Vanessa Kirby (Crown, Mission Impossible)",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
643,seawolfvii,Decent entertainment,6,7 September 2019,"There's some names that I really liked in this movie. I think they all had a really pretty good chemistry. Simple plot line. I like the taking it to Samoa (aka Hawaii). And the climax was interesting but slightly expected.What I didn't like was the indestructibility of Idris Elba's character. I get it he's an enhanced human. But a building falls on him, it crushes the back of a size-able rig and he's just standing there like nothing happened. Not even dusty not limping or even gasping for breath. That's ridiculous. And in the opening scene there are six guys fully trained soldiers plus one or two others and he managed to take them all out standing 10 feet away or more and they don't get off a shot that's stupid. I get that you want to establish him as super cool but that's just silly.Vanessa Kirby did a good job although there were a couple points that really boggled my mind. Mainly one near the end where she walks towards the helicopter??!??! And while I like the helicopter chase scene is still his baffling as to why there was no more air support for this most important mission.And when they were in the Eteon HQ and there are only three people (4 with the scientist) and yet a group of 30 to 40 who can't seem to fire in the same direction at them?!??And the chase through the London Street was pretty cool but again there's not a cop to be found. And these Eteon thugs were standing there masks on and uniforms, had automatic machine guns and nobody bothered them. Not a police car, beat cop, a parking enforcement officer, nada! 14,670 people per square mile and nada.I did like their travels and to Samoa (Kaua'i) and I loved all the vehicles in this movie really cool especially a lot of those off-road types.Overall it was entertaining slightly humorous fun. I don't know that I'd watch a sequel in the theater.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Heavily disappointed.,Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
647,joshuagahan,Bad,1,14 August 2019,"This is my first review ever and this movie is the worst or one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I'm not even joking or trying to be dramatic like seriously wtf is this garbage ? The acting is horrible, and the dialogue is just as bad if not worse, the action in this movie isn't anything you haven't seen in any other movie not really unique at all yet it's probably the best aspect about it but at times the action is literally disgraceful like it's so obvious at times when a character is trying fake punches and people are going flying it's funny but I don't think it was intentional ;) The stupid bickering between the two main characters was pointless, and bad, and the cheesy jokes were so annoying. The only time I laughed a little bit was when Kevin Hart was on the plane and that was it, after that I was nearly falling asleep for most of the movie. The story is so predictable a child could do a better job at making the movie and guns that go offline?! Lmao. Why not just use normal guns ? But no ofc the writers are lazy and have to try and figure out some stupid way to make it were the enemy doesn't kill them. This is what we call major plot convenience, and plot armor, this is not good. The clothing designs (or should I say design since they're all basically the same) for the characters is so dull you'd think because it's based in the future they'd try give them more style and have better designs to make it look unique, interesting, etc but again no everyone is just wearing a black top and jeans for the majority of the film, it's like how tf can you be making a film and be so lazy that you can't even make interesting designs everything else is already trash yet you can't do such a simple thing the only time it's different is in the tropical country that I can't even remember the name of it because the movie was so BORING and UNINTERESTING. To no surprise the acting in them tropical scenes were bad too. There is so many slow motion scenes in the end it makes me sick, and it's just lazy and overdone it's doesn't leave me in awe like the incompetent directors or whoever's in charge of slow motion thought it would it's just annoying like everything else in this movie. The action is terrible at times just like to story line with a villain you can't even see because they want to reveal him in a future movie just for the money like Disney with the remakes but not as bad. The only decent acting was from Idris Elba he done what he could with the bad dialogue the writers gave him the rest were laughable.Please do not waste your money on this movie, the only reason I went to see this is because once upon a time in Hollywood was sold out and there was nothing else worth watching and I thought I'd give this a go. Looking back at it now I wish I hadn't, would've walked out of the theater if I wasn't with my family. Overall 1.5/10 so I rounded it up to a 2/10",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

649,laneben,Deserves an 8 but I'm giving it 10 cause 6.9 is not right,10,13 August 2019,"I am a die hard F&F fan. I've watched all of them at least 20 times. Tokyo Drift is my least favorite in the series (I gave it a 7 overall) but this one is close to it, if i could call it a full F&F movie. If this was a mission impossible movie I'd give it a solid 9, but it's not so I'm giving it an 8. I loved The Rock, Statham, and Vanessa Kirby in this movie. The returning characters (Hobbs and Shaw) were just like themselves in the other movies, and it was hilarious watching them together in the beginning. This movie was a Mission Impossible parody for all but about 10 minutes of the movie. But those ten minutes were pretty cool. The scenes I would say were F&F at its core were the following:
1.) The chase scene with Brixton and the trio of protagonists through downtown London. The special effects were very well done but albeit cheesy (but hey it's fast and furious).
2.) Where they hooked their cars together to take down the helicopter. This was more of a F8 of the furious kinda stunt but at its core it made me think of the series this spinoff inspired (especially the opening scene in F4 where they steal the gas by hooking trucks driving in reverse to the tankers) and I smiled the whole way through it.If they were to make a second one of these, I would definitely see it. It was an awesome action movie with very well done stunts. If you're going to this movie thinking you're going to see a F&F 1-7 style movie you'll be sorely disappointed. But if you're going with kind of a F8 of the furious and mission impossible love child mindset you're really gonna like it. All in all I really enjoyed this movie and cannot wait to see what happens next (whatever happens please bring back Kevin Hart. His cameo was hilarious and unexpected).",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

The photos are taken in a good way and the shots from the Hobbs family pages are really pleasing to the eye, the music is modern and quite pleasant and suited to the film.

Where to start. How about the fact that the villain is an un-killable genetically enhanced super-human who can't die. Or, that The Rock brings down a chopper with a chain and just one hand. If I got some of the details wrong that's because somewhere along the way I lost interest and just stopped caring.I understand these movies are over the top but at some point when things get so ridiculous why should I even care what's really going on when I don't believe there's anything seriously at stake. Well... then maybe the comedy will be this movies saving grace. Nope. I chuckled like once or twice but unlike the funny banter between these two stars in The Fate of the Furious here it just feels forced, and the biggest gripe I have is when comedy takes away from the action and that's this movies biggest sin.I walk away from this movie knowing I'd probably take almost any mainline Fast and Furious movie over this spin-off any day of the week, and that's ok. I guess I just hope the next installment in the franchise takes a slight step back from this level of absurdity or else I fear these movies might've lost their luster for me.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

673,starwarspasta,Entertaining but overblown,5,7 November 2019,"It is difficult for an action movie to be too over the top, especially with the likes of the Rock and Jason statham considering that is what you expect from this type of movie and cast. However, this particular film may be a little too overblown. The plot is decent as are the special effects, but the biggest dislike I have with this film is how unrealistic nearly everything in it is. It is made almost more like an avengers movie then a fast and furious movie, with space age technology and motorcycles that are basically transformers. Idris elba's character is essentially the black panther and can move and jump just as he can in an inhuman fashion. There are a few scenes in it where you have to do huge leaps of logic for the film to make sense. In one instance the antagonist hacks every single media source on the planet somehow to make Hobbs and Shaw look like terrorists. Not only would this be impossible but they provide no explanation for how they achieved this. There is a scene toward the end of the movie where it is night time and then it suddenly is day time and back to night time all in the same fight sequence. Although I was pleased with the ending and the Samoa aspect which partially redeemed the film for me.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Somewhere along the lines, I think the writers and the directors forgot that this isn't a superhero movie and we're on planet earth. I wanted to enjoy this film immensely, as I am a fan of the FAF series and a fan of Johnson and Statham, but the writing took a left turn almost immediately out of the gate with reality being forgotten about, and over done cgi that I just couldn't take it's attempt at seriousness and get into the action sequences. The story has problems from the start and the finale scene at the end was so bad, I just wanted this movie to be over with immediately.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

In fact the movie is not at all related to the first 2-3 fast & furious movies. Just 2 actors., Who eventually came to the series, with a completely off the grid story line.

If you want a very deep script, profound story and stuff like that, look elsewhere. I spent a good 2 hours, loved the solid acting, the fact that nobody takes it very seriously and the non-obstrusive humor and refined funny that are present in a good equilibrium all through the movie. Also there's very good action, fights, vehicles, tech and a sensible, conducting plot. As other reviewer said, if you liked Deadpool 2, you'll love this one.

2- Excellent action scenes.
3- Good dialog.
4- Character development.
5- Moderate Story. Considered as a pros for not being a pointless action movie.
6- Some comic dialog are inserted very appropriately.Cons:1- The movie is somehow lengthy.
2- Predictable.
3- Not accurate genre. The genre should also contain ""comedy"" in addition to ""action"" and ""adventure"".In short. Don't expect interesting story with twists and surprising ending. All of these are very classical and expected, but it at least contains a moderate story to be followed. The movie is great at the level of action. There are a lot of action scenes that are interesting and different from each other. This prevents the movie from being boring in spite of being lengthy. I recommend this movie to those who want to see a good action movie. But those who want to see deep story based movie, they probably better look for something else",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
685,malcslusby,"2 movies - one okay; one really, really bad",2,8 November 2019,"Okay - this looked SOOOO good - and on balance it has some fairly decent action scenes- but Hollywood has to recognize that Jason Statham is not in the same league as someone like Iko Uwais or Yayan Ruhian and either start doing the shaky camera thing with his fight scenes - or give him much less martial artsy scenes. He looks like an old man in a bar fight for most of the movie.The Rock is actually really good - but once again - our dialogue is provided by the new millennial and delivered in a script that has clearly gone through ""sensitivity"" editors. The Plot is extremely disjointed - and they really struggle to sew the whole thing together.The WORST thing though - is that about half way through it basically becomes another movie - and that's basically a live version of Moana - and it's depressingly poor. I left the cinema when the Rock started doing his Samoan speech. I assume they all then launch into a Haka or the Siva Tau - didn't stay around long enough to see it.For the most part - the acting is sort of bearable - but labors around an increasingly poor script - the kind where you can tell the writers think they are being really clever - but they lack the social skill or maturity to understand what makes people laugh so you just have these awkward Kevin Hart type moments that just annoy.Idrs Elba saves every scene he is in and if he is NOT earmarked to play the next James Bond then the Broccolis should be utterly ashamed of themselves. He delivers every line perfectly - despite the poor quality of the writers - and makes a solid and thorouhly unlikable bad guy. Although the confusion on his face as an actor when he is in scenes that clearly should be reserved for the cloak and dagger baddie the Director (who if they were smart - they will not have revealed as being Agent Loeb until we get to the inevitable sequel). I missed the end of the film - but I know the bad guy gets defeated and Hobbs and Shaw end up primed for a sequel. Overall - I would give this a huge miss. Idris Elba and his motorcycle actually steal the entire movie.I would definitely recommend waiting until this appears on Netflix if you feel you really MUST watch it.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
686,nathanaelhorn,"Didn't meet expectations, try hard.",1,11 August 2019,"Here's why (without spoilers)
The plot doesn't make sense. Person X does something without any clear motive, while it becomes more and more obvious that this was the dumbest choice of action yet it decided the entire faith of the next 2 hours... Then the solution is going someplace really illogical when recourses 1000 times better are available to fix the problem but for the sake of ""family"" the choice is made to do something illogical which decides the faith of the second part of the movie... Then the acting, it's ok, but the comedic relief was never spot on, it was always a bit off... Just try hard and it felt more like I was looking at a cinematic version of The Rocks Instagram. I mean, I love The Rock, but I came for an over the top crazy movie, instead I got a somewhat crazy movie with failed lines, jokes and abnormal plot continuations.Imagine aquaman, but less Chinese influenced, with jokes that aren't bad but aren't good either and music that's good instead of really weird",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

But the actions scenes, which are the big part of the movie were really bad. Almost in every fight scene,there are weapons but no one knows how to shoot or more importantly when to shoot. It feels more like an japaneese anime where they talk before they get in conflict. I mean, they are fighting over a virus that can kill the whole planet and yet, it feels like they are fighting over a bowl of cereal.

689,dupregalaxy,Characters deliver...but the movie could be much better!,2,8 August 2019,"Fast and the Furious = Witty, action, family, attention catching, non intellectual entertainment. Anyone reviewing and giving this a low rating simply because it's not an epic drama should probably turn away from the series, as the series is not trying to capture that audience.I myself went into this film expecting all the joys, jumps and rides I've come to expect based on the previous films. Whilst this is a ""spin-off"", it came across as a bunch of actors trying to cash in on the franchise. Whilst there is nothing wrong with that, the audience would come to expect corny comedy and action from these characters which the movie does deliver on. However the film itself is simply boring in comparison to anything in the Fast and Furious franchise. The actors have delivered on what is expected of them, however the story itself seemed well beyond far fetched (even for a Fast and Furious movie).It seemed like a cross between a James Bond film, and Superman returns with a touch of sound effects from a Transformers movie.It was nice to see a touch of culture thrown in with Samoa...then this was all destroyed by several ""idiotic"" scenes which followed which could have been done with a little more grace than to make Samoans simply look like brain dead barbarians that know only of family with the odd ""smart"" ball in the bunch.Other than that, my 12 year old loved the movie. I on the other hand was simply disappointed.If there is a sequel to this, I hope the producers engage a third party consultant to assist with what potentially can become a great franchise if done correctly.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

At least when a professional writes the movies he's in... Who the hell let him write ""jokes""? He has never heard ""less is more"" apparently. I was expecting a HUGE movie, action and silly one-liners, just like the FF movies. I did not expect an ode to Dwayne's heritage. He's finally such a big star that he can write stuff in the movies and he went with it... Waaaaaay too far... He and his ""usos"". Did anyone miss the word after being used 22 times within 15 minutes??Oh, and the continuty errors, maaaaaaaan.

I found it disturbing that there wasn't a single horse or horse drawn chariot in this film, not only is that highly disrespectful to the great creatures known as horses but it's also disrespectful to people who don't want to go on huge 60 mph+ deathtraps which often kill cyclists and horse riders! I was shocked at how fast the cars were going as well, I'm surprised the actors didn't get themselves killed with such barbaric, insensible and primitive speeds so the actors were probably suicidal! The speed the cars were going was unnatural and therefore suspicious, I have a feeling the some of the cars featured in this film was no less than the work of the Devil himself! I was annoyed the film didn't feature tea or any British accents, I could barely understand any of the American's accents so that made it difficult to keep track of what was going on in the film.Perhaps my country's Son, the United States; should be colonised by British forces again because it's quite clear that Americans can't make good movies!

Statham, Johnson, Ilba and the rest of the cast all did a pretty good. The action is over the top but entertaining and exiting. The movie was also pretty self aware and wasn't as arrogant as the other F&F movies. And I loved the choice to make a F&F movie with such a bizarre and over the top plot.
At some points the movie got a little to repetitive and cliche for me, and some of the jokes and skits were a little bit weaker than others, but like I said this movie is not the one made to be a masterpiece, or to be analysed for messages or deeper meaning, its just a dumb summer movie but a really good one at that.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

The attempt at story is Hobbs and Shaw are lone wolfs but must reconnect with their families. Of which both are exiled from through circumstances out of their control. Hobbs and Shaw are both bad ass fighters and Intellectuals. The bad guy is super smart, super strong and super not human.
Shaw's sister is introduced and guess what. She's a bad ass... super smart...super strong and an intellectual.
There are pseudo bad guys / girls who help out H&S... guess what.. they're super strong and super smart.
Everyone who is thrust at the viewer is the same. They're are no normal people doing extraordinary things.
If a cliche can be used , exploited, flipped over spanked twice and exploited again it is.
I get cheesy. I get it's intent. I get go big but maybe you could challenge the audience a little.
This will be a great back ground movie. Wait till it hits the shelf or your library. Then while your reading a book put this on.

Mind you, I haven't been a fan of the Fast series in a long time, so I need to catch up! This movie is the 9 ninth installment to the series and the FIRST spin off! Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham reprise their roles as Luke Hobbs (Federal Agent working for DSS) and Deckard Shaw (Former Brit Special Forces Assassin turned Merc). These rivals on opposite sides of the law have been at odds since Fast 7. The rest of cast do nicely as well, especially Idris Elba as Brixton Lore ""Black Superman"" and Vanessa Kirby as Hattie Shaw (Deckard's baby sister).David Leitch, You know him! The brilliant action director who brought us Babayaga aka John Wick and Atomic Blonde not to mention my favorite film from him, Deadpool 2, directs a high octane action fest that caters to everything fans love about the Fast franchise: OVER THE TOP ACTION SEQUENCES, good humor between the two leads, a bad ass villain in Idris Elba). There are a couple of hilarious cameos from two big stars in the film also. Don't worry! I AIN'T GONNA SPOIL IT! This is a popcorn summer block bluster that should serve you well, IF you want some good old Fast Series action! The coolest part of the movie to me was Dwayne's inclusion of his real life Samoan heritage for Hobbs' background. A nice homage to the Samoan culture! Check it Out, people!

And that's what I wanted, and that's essentially what I got, but the end product was a bit of a messy, poorly paced buddy cop movie. The highlight of the movie (other than those few scenes if you've seen it *wink wink) is the chemistry between The Rock and Jason Statham. I thought they knocked it out of the park and, for the most part, the humor between the two worked. Idris Elba killed it as Brixton, and the Eteon idea was cool and interesting I thought. But the way they decided to tell the story took away from the movie big time. Not only did some jokes not land for me, or they tried to hard, but there were scenes just thrown in the middle of other scenes that made absolutely no sense. The action sequences were a tad disappointing and pretty much all out of the trailer. But the chemistry between the two is what saves the movie for me. I was disappointed with the movie, but it definitely could have been worse. I'd also like to take the time to look back on how far this ""Universe"" has come.

722,abdelkhaleqm,The Only Review You'll Need,9,5 August 2019,"Hobbs and Shaw is a movie that delivers. It is not only entertaining action-wise, but is also inundated with the element of humor, and the theme of family, all of which make it one of the best high-budget, mainstream action films of the decade. Watch it solely for the light, impeccable performances of Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham. Not a single scene is boring or even overdone.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Mindless entertainment. I was hoping it would have been like the Fast and the Furious but sadly no. The amount of testosterone was through the roof. It was like an 80's movie made in today's time. I didn't hate it. It just wasn't what I was expecting.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

This one did not fail to deliver that: cheesy lines, unbeatable heroes...This franchise is known for disregarding basic common sense, physics ...
And in one scene, Hobbs grabs a hanging rope and slides down using his bare heands. No friction can wear of the flesh of his hands because he's made of Rock.Conclusion:

Idris Elba was an excellent villain ""Black Superman"".

Not forgetting the actress who play a character that suitable for this movie instead of some damsel in distress type which I think degrading a woman this days.

But this movies fully embraces the ridiculousness and even jacks it up a couple more notches along with making the movie mainly comical.

752,josephbiles,Unwatchable,1,27 March 2020,"I managed just shy of 40 minutes, and it was a struggle to get that far.The fact that it has the name ""Fast and Furious"" in the title baffles me as this is the furthest thing away from Fast and Furious I could think of. It's completely unrealistic, which would be fine if that's how the franchise had begun, but it's come from a film about street racers who rob a few lorries on the motorway, and ended up with a man with a bullet proof suit who can see where people are going to punch & the exact force they're using.Secondly, adding to how unrealistic this is, there's a scene where Hobbs is discussing a mission with a CIA agent (who he instantly reveals is a CIA agent to his child who looks no more than 10) in front of his daughter as if it's nothing. Then he goes on to say how badly he's going to beat the hell out of this person, again, right in front of his impressionable daughter. This is coming from a character who's supposed to be a good guy. I don't even think Torreto would do that, and he's a criminal.The 'humour' is unbearable. Hobbs is the CHEESIEST character. The stuff he comes out with reminds me of being back in primary school. It's embarrassing coming from a grown man. The script as a whole is pretty shocking.All this is from watching less than half of the film - I can only imagine how much worse it gets, so save yourself the time and don't bother watching it.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

766,Adityaaaaa,"It's just trying to deliver a fun time, and for the most part- it does...",6,12 January 2020,"'Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw' was not a film that I had been particularly planning to see. I went in to the cinema with a friend and we were both planning to see something else, but we couldn't for various reasons. So we looked at what other movies there were, Hobbs & Shaw came up, so we just decided to go and see that instead. I knew that this was just going to be a brainless popcorn flick, so I did what the movie expected the audience to do: turn your brain off, go in, take a seat, kick back and just pass the time for a good while. I expected nothing more, but nothing less, either.The movie doesn't really have many artistic intentions, so there isn't really any point talking about them, but I'll start off with the good stuff:Like I said: Hobbs & Shaw is just meant to be a brainless popcorn action flick for fun. And for the most part, it does that. The first hour and a half or so does pretty much just that. It's definitely not as funny as it could have been and the action isn't as exciting as it promises, but it isn't boring, per se. For a showcase of the fun chemistry between the likeable leads Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, the movie thrives for the most part in this first 90 minutes or so. Idris Elba and Vanessa Kirby are also, as usual, great at delivering their characters and the chemistry between these leads are all very polished and never dull to watch. Of course, most of the humour comes from the arguments between Statham and The Rock, and although the actual jokes nor the way in which they're presented is funny, their chemistry manages to deliver, as expected. Their comedic timing and flawless facial expressions are never a bore to watch.However, during this 90-minute mark, or so. The film is pretty much done. A big fight scene happens and it all seems to be about to wrap up. Except it doesn't. The emotional arcs decide to not end, and a twist, if you, will, creates room for a whole new act. An act that was completely unnecessary. It's only real purpose was to solve the emotional complexities of the story, but it could have easily been done in the first two acts, but wasn't, to just add on a new act to make the film feel more 'epic', I guess. And it wasn't even like it was particularly fun to watch. It just goes on and on and on until the point where even the action becomes dull, monotonous and boring, and from a director like David Leitch, who helmed Deadpool 2, I expected much, much, more- at least from the action front. But alas, it doesn't deliver, and is just, quite frankly- boring. For a film that's sole purpose is to entertain, it ends up boring. Had they stopped at those 90 minutes, then I would have called this film 'average' and given it 3-stars, suggesting a watch if you just want to pass the time. But the added on about 40 or so more minutes, and, in the process, destroying its sole purpose. For me, at least. There was also a scene in which the background looked very green screen. I'm not sure if it was, but if it was- then it was very obvious, especially for a high-budget film like this.But it isn't necessarily a terrible film, of course. Just definitely not a good one. There were some funny cameos, one sequence involving running down a skyscraper with camerawork that felt really filled with perspective, which felt like a cool gimmick, and, of course the nice acting and the chemistry between the performers which kept the film falling into the 'terrible' zone.It knows what it is, and knows that it's just trying to deliver a fun time, and for the most part- it does. It just overstays its welcome until it becomes boring.CONCLUSION:
'Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw' is only trying to be a brainless popcorn flick, and even then, it becomes overlong and a tad boring, but the strong chemistry between the likeable leads keep the movie from becoming terrible, even if it is slightly more on the poor side of the spectrum.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

I just couldn't feel engaged by the movie, mostly on account of how ridiculous all of the characters were.I'm normally able to suspend disbelief and enjoy a movie by watching it while trying to see it from the director's point of view.With this one, I just couldn't. No one in the movie did anything a real person would do. Like, lots of movies have a part here or there where you think ""that was dumb, they should've jumped/shot/got away, why did they do that?"" and we're so used to it that we won't let sparing use of it ruin a movie for us.The issue I have with this movie is, the entire movie is just scene after scene of bad guys making super dumb decisions, presumably because it looks cool? ""Hey, a bunch of soldiers just shot first, asked questions later on 20 guys, I guess I'll just stand here and talk to them for 30 seconds, tell them I'm a bad guy, and THAN kill them all.""Hobbs and Shaw aren't any better, really. They are always facing situations in a way NO ONE would ever face such a situation. They show off during intense action scenes, trying to one up each other, but they would've been killed 50 times in 1 minute if the movie had any sense of realism.The plot and script played out like it was written by a fifteen year old boy after he's just binge watched Fast and the Furious movies for ten days straight.All that said, I've disliked a few movies after first watching them, then liked them more the second time I've watched them.We'll see if I can't enjoy it more once it hits YouTube movies or Netflix or whatever.

We all know that The Rock is strong, but to hold a moving heli and pulling it closer to the car, I mean come on...not to mention the gravity, while he was holding a heli on a chain, his feet remained on the truck..space boots?? And omg Ryan Reynolds, he's a great actor, noone says he's not, but in this movie he's just full on stupid...on top of everything the story is just a basic action movie, same acting, same stunts, same everything, so commercialized, and the lame jokes, that are the same in every movie. The only thing I liked about the movie was Vanessa, she's hella fine and I liked the only original thing of the movie, which was the modded cars (futuristic ones + the customs), fingers up for camera team tho.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Etc. All in one with 2 guys who cant act or deliever lines without cliche looks and face snap chat poses. So..... you will say...: :: what its not over yet. .... a few times throughout bthe movie.... really ...still going.... why??? ... but look on the bright side why see all those movies and waste 60 hours when you can see just one going over all the highlight iconic scenes in all of them... the wow scene and save 58 hrs.

787,james-53665,Really good spin off in the franchise!,8,5 August 2019,"Just seen the movie today and I must say, I enjoyed it a lot more than I initially expected! I am going to say that I'm not really a major fan of fast and furious and I have only seen a few of them, when I first saw the trailer, it didn't appeal to me at first but I still thought I would go see it after seeing all the praise it was getting and plus I love Statham and Johnson. I will say I'm glad I went to see it because I really enjoyed the movie.
It is a super action packed adventure mixed with a light hearted comedy tone which makes the movie even more enjoyable, the chemistry between Statham and Johnson is perfect, this creates many funny moments between the two and Idris Elba makes a decent villain, there is plenty of exciting moments although at times it didn't really feel much like a fast and furious movie to me but that's not a bad thing, it all works as a really fun spin off.
I recommend you go watch this movie! You wont be disappointed.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
788,sandsgirn,I like the FF franchise but my god!,2,28 May 2020,The other movies never recreated the amazing movie that was the original fast and the furious but were always fun.

In the end it was boring. Also many mistakes.they were fighting at night and all of a sudden its day. I would watch this one for fun if i had too much free time and didnt know what else to watch but thats it. I read a lot of fake reviews and weng to watch it to the cinema. My gf fall asleep 20 minutes before the end. Its not that bad but its not as good as the previous fast&furious. There is a lot of action but storyline is not that great or original.

808,jesse-jmart,Fast & Furious fans: What you wanted and more!,9,4 August 2019,"Take the unrealistic and incredibly unpredictable nonstop action of the Fast & Furious movies, sprinkle in even more over the top comedy and cameos than previous movies with your usual blatant romance and nos switch scene out of the blue from the series, and you get Hobbs & Shaw.Previous experience with the series is not required for this movie. If you already know Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw like myself, then the introductions this movie does for them is satisfactory icing on the testosterone cake. The movie is filled with nods and Easter eggs to different notable roles of both Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham. Idris Elba is brought in as the movies antagonist and basically introduces the idea of terminators into the Fast universe. Vanessa Kirby is also introduced in the film as Shaw's killer badass sister and makes up the third of our trifecta of protagonists.It's ridiculous, fun, funny and bad ass and has all the things that have become mandatory to Fast & Furious movies, as well as one of the coolest fight scenes you'd expect out of a superhero flick with a touch of the X-Ray slow mo effect in the newer Mortal Kombat games. Don't expect as Oscar winner but expect to be entertained to the fullest.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

I realize the producers were trying to capitalize on the F&F franchise, but it was a poor way to go about it.- - SPOIL ALERT - - -The one thing we never saw in the F7F series was out of this world science fiction, with Hobbs and Shaw, thats exactly what we saw. From viruses that can wipe out humanity, to people who can open up and reveal mechanized bodies. Robotics is no where near that advanced, so we suddenly have a timeline which jumps 100 years into the future technology wise, but stays the same in cars.

They don't even race anymore, instead the Rock holds onto helicopters with a metal chain. I can't believe I'm seeing ratings of 10, the story was so poorly constructed it's embarrassing.

Full of bad cliche text and whatever comes out of actors mouth - you have heard or seen it already in other movies.The ones who give 9-10 stars are probably working on that movie and they are standing at gun point to give these scores.The movie has so much CGI, sci-fi and bad physics that even STAR WARS start too look as a documentary movie based on true story.After 20 min in cinema, I could not wait to get to end and go for a beer to wash of the bad taste of this movie.

The fact that this vomit fest cost a ridiculous 200 million dollars is just insane. WTF?!! I don't know what's more scary, that someone in the business can read the script for this muscle and guns party and go ""Yeah bro, right on man, i'll put in 200 million dollars on this movie, yeah!"".

855,joshualucashall,Made an account just for this review,4,25 May 2020,This movie was honest to god the worst movie I've ever seen. Besides the semi ok fight sequences this was so painful to watch. I don't get how it even got made!? What's the point? Also very cheesy and corny script. Jason Statham really just needs to give up acting. Plays the same guy in every movie and it becomes more washed out every single time. The Rock has that same effect but the Samoan stuff I enjoyed a lot. Overall I give it 4 stars. Don't watch! Skip!!!!,Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

It left it's self wide open for part 2 whenever their egos will allow it , also Idris Elba plays his part well as the machine enhanced bad guy
But as they say when Hobbs and Shae stop their bickering and work as a team he's easily defeated in the end.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

861,Slobberknocker00,An almost unbelievably arduous slog.,1,29 September 2019,"The lack of anything approaching a decent storyline, anti-rapport between Statham and Johnson and a lack of coherent action made this an almost unbelievably arduous slog. The runtime suggests they thought they had some kind of masterpiece of action on their hands but the end result is one of the worst action films it's been my misfortune to see in the cinema. There's also appalling music and dull cgi action scenes, ridiculous location-hopping and a truly awful finale that's completely devoid of any emotion or excitement.I'm a fan of the franchise and of Johnson and Statham but this is an insult to the intelligence of viewers. It's a complete disaster for anyone but the most undemanding action fan.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Simple and stupid plot, no sensible coherence in the ""funny scenes"", the use of Kevin Hart and Ryan Reynolds feels unnecessary and just an excuse for having them in the movie + it doesn't add anything and feels so unfulfilling like the rest of the movie. It's not a Fast and Furious film (which no one of the others films since the third should be called). They are way over the top and has moved so far away from the original as humanly possible.

I am sure glad I waited. It was so boring I was on my phone almost the whole movie. Boring plot and forced jokes. Action was over the top.

Check and check.Strap yourself in, because this movie has crazy-fun, over-the-top action, only matched by the equally ridiculous plot. While it's only there to keep the story rolling, if you were here for amazing screenwriting, you're best off looking elsewhere. Even the choice of location for the final battle (though great), comes out of nowhere.Having said all this, they did choose the two best characters from the franchise and possibly the two most likeable and charismatic actors going around today, to make this work. They have great chemistry and play-off of each other well. The addition of Idris Elba just completes this testosterone-fuelled action ride.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

I never expect much from the plotline of the series, but the cars always made up for this. Except for a few supercars splashed in, this was totally not what one would expect. The last movie which took place substantially in Cuba is 50x's better than this. What a waste of great actors. Put some more cars in this and I would have rated much higher.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

877,Dragosh_Matei,"Had potential, but didn't fully use it",7,28 May 2021,"I will have to preface this by saying that I am not an active fan of the Fast and Furious franchise, I have only seen a couple of them and bits of the rest. However, I was more or less familiar with the overall theme and I truly think that Hobbs & Shaw could've done something new and it did, but not to the full potential.The plot revolved around a deadly virus that could've ended the world and it was up to our heroes that hate each other to stop it and also there is a thing going on between one's sister and the other guy... not the most original plot, honestly. Yes, the enhanced assassins was likely something new for the franchise and yet, it didn't really feel like it belonged. The jokes were also a bit too much for how serious they wanted the plot to be.Despite all of this, the movie did manage to come up with something unique for it's finale and that is the fight put up by Hobbs' family. While they're inclusion seemed a bit out of nowhere (I don't know if they were ever mentioned in a previous movie), the brothers did manage to get along and work together to pull off what I would say is the most aggressive Home Alone type trap.The family theme (to which the franchise is not a stranger of) was well done, seeing the Hobbs family going all out like that for a family member and also Shaw reconciling with his sister were pleasing.I must also mention that, while the final fight itself wasn't out of this world, the teamwork displayed by the titular characters was very well executed.I also really liked the parallel between the two men's daily routines: Hobbs having a warm theme with a relaxed lifestyle, while Shaw had a colder theme with an expensive lifestyle. And one last thing: Ryan Reynolds stole the show almost everytime he was on screen, wish he was there for more.All in all, Hobbs and Shaw is a good action movie with some valuable themes, but sadly one that didn't wander outside the bounds of the franchise as much as it could've. Still, a nice movie.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
878,aarongold13,"Keep your expectations low, and you'll only be a little disappointed",4,2 August 2019,"Fast & Furious' umpteenth outing somehow manages to surpass its predecessors in its capacity for ridiculousness. You know what you're getting yourself into when you indulge in this franchise, but no matter how self-aware they want to become, at some point, you have to acknowledge bad movies for what they. Hobbs & Shaw is not a good movie, but it is just entertaining enough to avoid being terrible.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
879,dgtdannytay,Funny and easy watch,7,25 October 2019,"Really gone off fast and furious but this was a decent in my eyes, thought it was very funny at times provided something different to the series, which made it more enjoyable.

However, at best I laughed 5 times (within the two and a half hour movie!) and found the movie to be never ending. I was going into this movie with an open mind and not a lot of judging, but it's hard to sit back and enjoy a movie that's dull and is longer than it should be. The movie just lacked a lot in the story telling and just bad writing.

882,iamshiva19,This Movie will give you more than what you wanted from it,7,16 August 2019,"The audience of this movie knows what they are gonna get from the movie.
This movie is long and you can feel the runtime. there is an action sequence which ends the second act and at this moment I thought the movie was over, as there was everything in this act that the movie sets up in the story.
and then the 3rd act begins, it feels like an attempt to wrap movie with its theme of family, like in previous fast and furious movies.
this movie is like action sequence, talk about a little bit and then another action sequence and then we talk more and this movie is filled with action sequences with some repetition, the same angle capturing it, the best thing about action sequence is how they use there environment.Now Characters,
Jason Statham and Rock, MAN THEY WORK AMAZINGLY TOGETHER, there are scenes in which they just insult each other and some of them are very funny.
There are some cameo which enhances the movie and Elba is awesome as the villain
This movie will give you more then what you expected from it.Plot-wise this movie feels like M.I.2, there's a virus involved, a carrier mainly the plot is used to connect the action sequences.I would like to watch a movie with these characters with a better plot.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
883,kgoldsmith-90029,Brilliant!,9,3 September 2019,"As someone who has seen every F&F movie 10 times I have to say I LOVED THIS! Statham and Johnson bring a sense of humour that keeps you intrigued. Adding a female lead that women can relate to makes it more intriguing. I did miss the cars though, the world relies on technology too much whereas in F&F it was about working with what you've got and working as a team.But 9/10!

The films is pretty unrealistic, but this makes the action packed movie even more fun to watch. With a storyline and great villain more inline with a 1980s Bond, and technological weapons I am more familiar with seeing in a Marvel movie the film is just action, action and more action with very likeable characters. The storyline is very good for a movie of this type. Idria Elba makes a great villain in the movie and a Dwayne Johnson movie wouldn't be the same without a Kevin Hart cameo appearance. Some great banter between the two lead characters with the classic buddying up movie of hate at first site, slowly evolving to a strong partnership and mutual respect for the newly formed allies.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

The acting is outrageously over the top, but the humour and skill is excellent.I think it would have done even better had it not been released under the Fast & Furious umbrella.

894,fmobieglo,"Great movie, except it's not fast and furious.",7,19 August 2019,"First the down points and that's actually that they ride on the Fast & furious trademark. Apart from side characters Hobbs & Shaw there where no members of the original team in the film. Also the street race aspect and the tuning that made fast & furious great and set it apart from other action movies has been completely lost. Granted that aspect was already going down fast in the latest installments, but losing the OT made this a action movie like any other.That said, it's still a very entertaining movie. Hobbs and Shaw have very great interaction moments and dialogue. Adding Shaw's sister in the mix makes it all the more enjoyable. The movie is packed with action moments that are filmed well. And there is the needed dose of humor added in the mix. As a block buster action movie it's very good. On par with other great action movies. But they should have let Fast & Furious end with Paul and Dom riding different ways into the sunset.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

I mean Brixton Lore. The script doesnt do justice but Elba really tried hard. He deserves more than this...The 3rd act is the unnecessary plot which serves no purpose in the plot except forcing the family theme that this franchise is infamously known for. They should have stick with the spy espionage genre what the movie tried the 2/3 way. The whole 3rd act seem like a whole different movie.,Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
898,YoungboyMarkus,Quality action scenes but a real cringe fest in the end,6,6 August 2019,"I loved the Fast and the Furious franchise. I grew up watching them and always loved the intimate relationships that were formed in each movie. This movie kind of did the same, but at the same time didn't. Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) and Shaw (Jason Statham) formed an odd combination in this film but it still went kind of a ironic way. The first half of the movie was interesting, filled with quality humor and really nice action scenes. Idris Elba's character build was really good and his performance was quite impressive. For example, his motorcycle scenes were nicely done and his scenes where his body is being repaired were extremely convincing.What let me down is the second half, where Hobbs meets up with his family in Samoa. That was a real cringe fest. It was like the movie took a large U-turn in the wrong direction. From action packed to family friendly in a split second.All in all, good action scenes, nice nostalgia but really cringy in the end. 6/10",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

900,laurensvandoninck,Sad attempt for a spin-off,5,8 August 2019,"I love Fast & Furious, occasionally I love to sit back relax and enjoy. F&F is the perfect example for me here, some good action and cars. Now over the years, the ""car"" focus has been scarce (not entirely gone), but the Best example is Fast Five (2011), We have a great action movie over here, with still some focus on what the movie is about, fast cars. Fast Five has some nice car montages in preparation for the actual plot of the movie.With Hobbs & Shaw, we get something entirely different here, and I am completely disappointed with what came out here. The first criticism I have is on its use of humor, over here we have 2 grown men cursing at each other like little kids acting all tough, and somehow have to prove who's got bigger balls. I must admit I laughed from time to time, but in this case, enough was enough and I was getting tired of their childish comments. The second criticism I have is the absurd physics, now this has never been a complaint in previous F&F movies on my part, but this one took it way too far. We have this scene where Hobbs takes a chain that is attached to a helicopter and manages to hold the chain, Universal (and probably part Dwayne's idea) please that's not how that would work. The example I take here to put this into perspective is the scene in Captain America Civil War, where Steve Rogers (aka Captain America) does something similar, he holds on to a railing and pulls the helicopter back in. Now I have no problem with that in this movie, but this is a Super heroes movie, Hobbs on the other hand is a freaking normal human being.
Aslo the entire Black superman stuff felt out of place in this Universe, and somehow feels like Universal want to be like Marvel (But fails hard at this).I think if this movie was set in another cinematic universe I wouldn't mind so much. But this has no place in F&F Universe.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

902,ellisjohnwilliamson,"Fast and Furious, what else?",7,4 August 2019,"I decided to go see Hobbs and Shaw the other night and it was a typical Fast and Furious film. Full of action, car crashes and explosions. With traditional fast films, the ending became ridiculous but it's we've learnt to expect from this franchise, it's what keeps us going back for again.Overall great movie, definitely enjoyable and seeming hilarious! I would definitely recommend.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
903,ojoon,"Too much action, but in a good way",9,4 August 2019,"A franchise driven (no pun intended) by super fast cars, high octane action scenes, characters equipped with well, quips, aphrodisiac supplements, in courtesy of all those half naked females that's present, accompanied by rowdy hip hop soundtracks, and you get the Fast and Furious franchise, a franchise that can be viewed as overlong Pitbull music videos feigned as blockbuster action films.
Do I hate that?, absolutely not!, in my eyes, the franchise just gradually got better as it goes, as it sways away from rigid action sequences and stereotypical ""drag race"" deportments delivered by a bunch of robotic one dimensional characters in its earlier adaptations, to being general action films that could rival with some of the best, thanks to homespun character demeanors, actual plots, and a sense of charisma that manages to give the franchise some form of humility, beneath all the exuberant and over the top inane action sequences, which is, yeah, admittedly hyperbolic, but, can you blame them?, we're here for the thrills and that's what the latter installments has disported themselves with, and with Fast and Furious : Hobbs & Shaw, it's no exception.
The movie delivered what the fans have ordered them to, as the action sequences just incessantly piles up like a gratuitous compilation of the best action scenes of the movie, it just keeps coming in, it never slows down, it just fuels up the adrenaline rush, and even when it was about to simmer down, the action kicks into high gear each time they show up.
Even the scenes where there's no trace of celerity from the high speed chase scenes, juxtaposed with a sense of foreboding thrills that sends chills down the spine, the characters display just enough charisma and snark to keep the audience entertained.
As expected, we get to see the stark contrast between Hobbs and Shaw as they spend the whole movie's interim trying to compete with each other and throw flamboyant insults at each other, ranging from humorously sarcastic to downright mean at times, but it's all portrayed in a light hearted manner that it's hard to contravene, and instead, just root for the both of them simultaneously.
Shaw's sister in the movie, the female presence of bad-assery, Hattie also wastes no time just laying down her immaculate fighting skills, definitely not under your typical damsel in distress archetype, and her foreshadowed, yet undercooked romance with Hobbs adds more giddiness to the movie, thanks to Shaw's sarcastic comments about it in a hilarious airplane banter between them.
The humor in the movie shouldn't be the last to take notice of as some of the additional characters such as Ryan Reynolds' Locke who's friendly infatuation with Hobbs is funny and Kevin Hart's Dinkley who's desperate to complete the triptych set of alpha males in their group, brags about having a secret fortress, but is actually in a bathroom, and Hobbs mom, who threatens everybody with her slipper, yeah, these comic reliefs are welcome additions, indeed.
The villain, in the form of Brixton, while not fully fleshed out, other than a few vague details, is discernibly notorious and intimidating, and his brute and ruthless demeanor helps carry his character arc.
But look, underneath all the action scenes, which is, let's face it, pretty much all of the movie, there's a subtle message about not giving up for family and putting others before your own needs, in this case, Hobbs and Shaw is coerced to build an apprehensive chemistry with each other to save the world, regardless if they like it or not.
And of course, with a ridiculous amount of action, it can get kind of overwhelming, that we're almost jaded to the slow motion sequences and constant blows to the body.
It also can't help but to sell itself as being very hyperbolic and balderdash, these action scenes, they can feel a tad bit cartoonish and devoid of logic at times, (also, nobody's gonna care, but they have a song from both Logic and Token here, call me a proud fanboy), it's what you need in an action flick and although it's gravitas might be swept away by all the outlandishness, it's really a low hanging fruit to criticize about here, Fast and Furious : Hobbs and Shaw is one hell of a buddy comedy sprinkled with action scenes that could cover up the entire Mission Impossible franchise, yeah, this is mind-blowing spectacle, check this out!.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

All the movie has is one after another over the top action scene that looks just so ridiculously fake. The movie has almost nothing to do with the previous Fast&Furious movies and no storyline whatsoever.

A basketball player with a 12.WAR is worth twelve point one additional wins for his team every time he's on the court etc. etc.Hobbs & Shaw is the movie version of the replacement-level player.

The bad guys were worse shots than Stormtroopers.
These weren't even the same characters from their original appearances. And the humour fell flat mostly.
I think this is a result of too many super-hero films and F&F wanted in with a touch of M:I. Was hoping for more from these guys.

931,Sarkamen,A self aware fast and furious,8,31 July 2019,"I got to see an early preview on Tuesday night which was cool. I have seen all the fast and furious movies and although I understand the appeal and like the characters I felt like the movies became increasingly ridiculous with the writing as time progressed.While I think most people can probably agree with me on that point, my bigger issue was the over serious tone in conjunction with the movies. It is as if everyone in them is in denial that the stories were becoming increasingly ridiculous.This movie however takes a different approach. I think Dwayne and Jason get the appeal and ran with it while subtly acknowledging and making light of the over the top nature of the story. This is possibly my favorite entry, even though I do like the first few movies in the series and would like to see if they could apply this tone to the main series if it continues in any way.One final thought, if you like the pg-13 Deadpool 2 ""once upon a Deadpool"", and like fast and furious then you are gonna love this one.

944,stevenmcfaul,"Fast-paced, comedic popcorn blockbuster!",8,7 August 2019,"As a pretty solid fan of the F&F series I was really excited for this as I feel Hobbs and Shaw have been responsible for some of the best moments in the last films in the main series. Statham and Johnson are gold together and able to produce a really natural back and forth relationship which comes across real. The rest of the cast in this movie did an excellent job as well. Idris Elba was great as always and able to portray the over the top baddy pretty well and Vanessa Kirby brought some really good dynamics to balance the relationship between the main antagonists. Also...a few surprise cameos are great and wet the appetite for future installments in what is sure to become a Hobbs and Shaw trilogy.The story in itself is the usual F&F style...big bad, team having to come together and beat them in the end. If you're expecting anything deep or different then you'll be disappointed. These films have made their money on over the top action blockbusters and what you see is what you get. But I liked the modernised story and it was great to see more of the hand to hand fight scenes and combat that David Leitch has done so well in other movies. Of course, the car scenes while minimal were also as fast paced and exciting as usual.The best part of the movie as mentioned is the back and forth between hobbs and shaw...these guys are brilliant and although some may find it childish and too much...it works because they portray their disdain and differences so effectively.This is definitely what I call a summer blockbuster...you can switch off, think very little but enjoy pretty good special effects and the 2 hours 15 mins roll by pretty quick. I really hope this does well enough to continue as a new trilogy.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

I know the action in all the FNF films is improbable, but you won't be able to suspend your disbelief as The Rock holds a helicopter down to stop it from flying away.Also the whole thing feels like an ego massage for the rock, and almost an attempt at creating fake autobiographical roots for him. I mean, you're used to the Rock being a confident guy, but this borders on unhealthy Narcissism. The plot is totally secondary. I wish I had not bothered with this film, although, I did get some really good food going in.

The chemistry between Johnson & Statham was on point and their back and forth dialogue was absolutely hilarious. Throw in Vanessa Kirby and it was a perfect trifecta! Idris Elba was perfect as ""Black Superman"" and his interactions with the other three leads was gold. I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention at least two actor cameos, which were brilliant and unexpected. I won't mention who they are because I think they're uncredited, but one is a CIA agent and the other an air marshal. Both were so funny in their roles and every time they appeared the audience just loved it.The action scenes, continuing in the tradition of the Fast & Furious films to keep upping the stakes were sometime over-the-top, but they were so much fun to watch. The tech was also a bit too sci-fi to be believable, but actually worked quite well in the context of the plot.

966,disciple_of_sauron,Crazy but FUN action blockbuster (with entertaining banter between the titular characters)),8,11 August 2019,"So, I watched this movie last weekend and I thought to offer what I (hope) to be an objective review. First off, I would like to say I had fun watching this movie. At the end of the day, whether others bash it or not, I think the most important thing is if YOU and/or YOUR family had a fun time watching something. That being said, this kind of movie doesn't cater to people with sophisticated expectations or viewers expecting thought provoking dialogue. If you want those things, better look elsewhere because THIS movie is just a light-hearted dumb-fun action comedy with a ton of action set pieces and banter between the titular characters.So, Hobbs & Shaw delivers exactly what you would expect from a blockbuster starring Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham as best ""frenemies"" that need to work together to save both the world and at least one beloved family member. If you'd seen at least one of the trailers, that's exactly what the whole movie is like. In my opinion, though, I think these elements served to elevate the movie instead of drag it down. For the most part, anyway.I won't be giving any spoilers on the story, but as you might guess, its a pretty straightforward save-the-world scenario involving a doomsday virus. There's also a secret organization hell-bent on destroying the ""weak"" elements of humanity via cybernetical upgrades. Its about as nonsensical as you'd expect but it works as vehicle to get the characters from A to B to C via a set of spectacular action set-pieces and plenty of CGI. I thought the CGI was decent throughout if not jawdropping. The stunts and acrobatics are entirely ridiculous and unrealistic but they do look cool, and you probably don't go to such a blockbuster expecting John Wick-levels of combat realism.Now, as far as the cast is concerned, once again you get exactly what you'd expect from ""The Rock"" and Jason Statham. They beat dozens and dozens of bad guys throughout the movie, and when they're not doing that they insult each other in a lot of imaginative ways. They both pretty much play themselves at this point, but for this movie, that works pretty well and many of the jokes are genuinely funny. Not all, though and I'll get to that later.I'd say the standout in this movie is Vanessa Kirby, who, despite looking like a delicate willow between two chunks of granite, can still hold her own and then some. It was honestly refreshing to see a badass female character who doesn't need to keep reminding the other characters how strong, independent and unrequiring of men she is. She SHOWS those aspects instead of shoving SJW preaching down our throats. Big plus from me for that and for the actress herself, who proved to be a capable action heroine despite coming from a drama background (Netflix's ""The Crown"" and theatre).Idris Elba, as well, does a pretty good job as a supersoldier looking like he stepped out of a Deus Ex game. He does give the impression that he had fun with the role as he is relentless in hunting down our heroes. There's a couple of funny cameos from actors you wouldn't expect too. Anyway, for those of you who hate reading but like bulletpoints, I'll sum it all up in pros and cons.PROS:
+ Fun dynamic between Statham and Johnson
+ Vanessa Kirby
+ Non-stop action, with most of the set-pieces being pretty entertaining. At least one quite original, involving a chain of cars.
+ Generally provides a good time without being preachy
+ Family themes of the F&F franchise are still there, except without Vin Diesel reminding you of it every 10 minutes.CONS
+ A few of the jokes and banter between Hobbs and Shaw go too long, becoming a bit cringy.
+ For being a supersoldier, Idris Elba's character could've shown more fancy abilities.
+ The high number of action scenes might be tiresome for some people.In retrospect, I think Hobbs & Shaw is a 7/10 movie exactly for what it is. A mindless action summer blockbuster that you should watch to have a laugh and maybe leave the cinema a bit less worried about real life. I'm only giving it at 8 because I liked Vanessa Kirby in it a great deal, so it gets a ""subjective"" bump. I probably enjoyed this more than Fate of the Furious even, so for whoever cares, it gets a thumbs up from me.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Nothing I haven't seen before and still well behind the action sequences of Mission Impossibles or James Bonds. In fact the moment the Rock jumps out of a building unaided to catch up with some guys abseiling a building, whilst still doing some banter with Shaw....oh dear!! The appearance of futuristic drones to chase down a car at the end, how the hell did we jump forward 50 years?!?!Saying that the relationship between Hobbs and Shaw was entertaining and some genuinely funny moments (Retina scanner moment!!). Two pleasant cameos from Helen Mirren and Kevin Hart.Overall there is much better out there ow and before in their genre, including previous F&F prequels.

The action sequences (too few in my opinion) are good. So in my view it's only the humour and action sequences (especially in end of 30 mins) that sticks you on your seat.

The thing that attracted me in the first place to the Fast and Furious franchise was the concept of family and unity then the adrenaline rush of fights and fast cars, this movie just throws this concept in the trash. Furthermore, I couldn't for the love of god continue after the first half hour of it, it's just an ego-boost for Statham and Johnson, don't get me wrong I LOVE both actors and their movies, but in this movie, the cringe was real and I just couldn't sit for another hour and a half of it.

978,artemkobo,A decent movie up to the middle,3,8 August 2019,"There isn't much you can expect from a movie such as this. Everyone knows the typical, you get the chases, fights, and firefights. Plot wise its a generic big evil trying to end the world, pin two characters who have a disagreement in order to produce the hi jinx. Now while that produces your average action film, the ending is a mess, making it feel as if the movie had not one director but 20 all trying to shove their style into it.Had the movie continued the was it had been going and not have a weird useless continuation from the second act into a third one. The flow of the movie told us that the main villain played by Idris Elba will be killed, and the trio will go to destroy the entire ""shadow"" group from the top. But NO we continue into a 3rd act where all we see are illogical actions just in the name of the plot. Hobbs returning to his home while a good idea on the surface to make the movie feel more like a family one, makes little sense in the issues that they are facing. The end simply feels like a forced respect for the Polynesian culture just in order for fun moments.In the end, the movie requires the viewer to completely detach themselves from reality, and logic. The movie fails us a spin off of the Furious collection of films as it fails to put the importance in family, and focuses on simple and unjustified however visually appealing shots. The movie does a good job in the first and second acts, yet destroys all that work in the third one.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Another reason why I wanted to watch this film is because I'm a fan Dwayne Johnson's work.This film felt disjointed. It was too much! Overboard with the action, overboard with Hobbs and Shaw chastising one another- it almost seamed like they were mocking one another like a couple would before they make out. And I have to say ""less is definitely more""
Too many locations, crappy story line.
Then they bright in Kevin Heart... what was happening?
I wasn't feeling it. Usually I feel pumped and excited and good after watching fast and the furious but this didn't cut it for me. It felt like a confusing blur when I walked out.

I'd point out that there is not much to and fro going on between dwyane and Jason as u would expect...SORRY.
However idris character seems cool...played it pretty well.
As far as action goes....the last 15 mins or so is kinda cool......with the absence of logic that is....but yea the franchise needed to find something to one up the submarine scene!
If you are a roman reigns fan tho....u will be hugely disappointed (no role whatsoever)

Rock and Jason both had an amazing chemistry and the humor in this movie was really funny and entertaining just because of these two throwing insults at each other.
Kirby was also good in this movie , but I did not find Idris character a compelling or strong one because throughout the movie the everytime protagonist manages to sneak out under his nose even though he had superpowers.

1019,simon-nellis,Too realistic and straight laced,6,17 January 2021,"I hoped that I'd spend an hour or so being taken into a fantasy action world of completely unrealistic scenes peppered with cheesy dialogue throughout.
This failed miserably to deliver on that.
All of the action scenes were totally feasible and way too realistic- especially the final helicopter and car chain scene. No one was thinking outside the box here. Come on guys, we pay our money to be taken out of our mundane, drab existences for a short while expecting to be blown away with illogical fight scenes, car chases that endanger oblivious, innocent lives and our heroes emerging from explosions with barely a scratch on them.
What I just sat through was virtually a documentary, with true to life accuracy and too much focus on trying to get every element as realistic as possible.
The Samoan victory scene was in no way overly melodramatic and I was disappointed that the clearly difficult and challenging relationship faced by Hobbs and Shaw was barely touched on. The dynamic of bickering animosity between them is something we've yet to see explored in a movie and this could have had hilarious results. No effort to explore any cliches between the two and not a whiff of a one liner.
What I must applaud is how Statham truly gave the performance of his career- unlike any role he's taken on before and I'm in awe of how he handled the sensitive subject matter. He really showcased the breadth and depth of his talent here. Such a shame to see him let down by his co stars. I hope this doesn't affect the deserved Oscar win. A powerhouse, generation defining performance.

The insults they gave each other was the best parts.I'm not a fan of the F+F franchise and stopped watching after 1 and a half of them. I only went to see this because it was free to me.

The film is a silly ""leave your brain at the door"" action movie. Which I'm sure some can agree is well needed from time to time. The cuts between the protagonists when they were throwing insults/banter was reminiscent of a guy ritchie movie, the over the top action and ridiculous plot had me laughing out loud a number of times (though I suspect not the way the movie intended) that being said it was still fairly enjoyable as with most of the f&f films.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

1067,eugeniotoso,Perhaps the worst one yet?,4,14 August 2019,"'Hobbs and Shaw' just beat 'Tokyo Drift' to the title of the worst 'Fast and Furious' movie to date. Walking into this film with such low expectations, I didn't believe it could possibly disappoint me, but somehow it did; expecting more of the fast-paced, mindless action and funny cast chemistry that made 'Fate of the Furious' so tolerable, I was totally underwhelmed by this mix of dreadful dialogue and badly-choreographed stunts that somehow felt low-budget despite the film's $200 million allowance.Somehow, between 'Fate of the Furious' and 'Hobbs and Shaw', The Rock and Statham's witty, love-hate chemistry has totally evaporated, leaving me cringing at a whole string of jokes that invariably fell flat on their faces. Ryan Reynolds appearance was just about the only funny part of the movie, while Kevin Hart's forced cameo showed up the film for exactly what it is: the Rock's vanity project, a movie about his tequila-drinking, pancake-eating, weight-lifting lifestyle, or, in other words, a cinematic representation of his Instagram page. The Rock seems under the impression that delivering CBeebies-level lines like ""In life, sometimes things happen"" with a smoulder and taking his top off on every possible occasion makes a good film, but it felt cheap and strained, just like his attempt to make this once-great franchise all about himself.I really like both The Rock and Statham, and I'm fond of the franchise as a whole, but this was painful to watch and I'd really quite like my money back.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
1068,jorgedanielpimentel,Mision Impossible?,6,23 April 2020,The movie is rare because fast & furious in the beginning was about a police trying to catch up a street racer and now the only I see in the movie was a superhuman robot fighting with Dwayne Johnson and Jason statham for trying save the world from a virus...this isn't the saga I Know and Love,Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

1076,joe_holl,Ridiculas,4,29 September 2019,I know Fast & Furious ment to be ridiculas but this is something they should have left the brand name out of. It's like a very predictable coming together movie crossed with Iron Man 3. Dont even make much sense to why alot of creditable actors put their pens to contract. It's a rediculas action movie if that's what you want go for it. If you like the franchise maybe ignore this one.,Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

The Rock and Jason Statham still gave me hope that action movies are still around and booming. But after watching this movie I know true action movies well dead and gone.

It's like every awful action movie trope rolled together x2. Even being self-aware (we get it -- they're stuborn, testosterone-oozing bald manbabies) couldn't save it. The CGI and fight scenes were also cheesy and cartoonish. So if you're looking for a good, plot-rich action film, I'd pass on this one; the trailer contained just about every semi-decent scene in the movie, anyway.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
1079,TimmyX1,Not too impressed,5,1 August 2019,"They start the movie with some unique character building, amazing tech, and great fight scenes but why in the 3rd act did they decide to forget about all that and go medieval? Seems they tried harder to find a way to get Dwayne to take his shirt off then deal with a consistent story-line. Hobbs is a complete fool in this one. First he believes that the best course of action is to put his entire family in direct line of fire from a high-tech army. Second, needing to fix the blood-cleaning device, he believes the best person in the world to fix it is a vintage car mechanic! Personally I would have given Tej or Ramsey a call.It's a movie, it's entertainment and I get that, but this is just lazy writing.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

So thats why i'm disepointed and gave it the low score. I found the story lazy, no suprices, boring, no street cars.... and it felt like a mix of Batmans gadgets, terminator and transformers. So no... it's not a f&f movie.
But! As an action movie you get alot. So for that it gets the high score. The speed in the movie, the stunts, all the action and comedy between the actors... it is a fun movie to watch.And watch until the endcredits.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

1090,nodif,Embodiment of modern commercial movies superficiality,1,5 August 2019,"This movie is such a lousy work, it cannot be rated higher than 1 star. There is completely lack of attention to any details, consistency in change of scences, this movie is beyond meaningless, it drives crazy. Everything about it is superficial - famous franchise (only in name), famous actors (plenty of them with cameos), plain positive energy with many very simple jokes (except Ryan Reynolds cameo, god bless the 3 minutes of this excessively long movie), grotesque scenes of trucks dragging helicopter down on a chain line (4 or 5 of them helping each other), Samoa warrior fighting armed bandits with wooden clubs (oh, they somehow swtiched their firearms off), and OF COURSE, movie-long tribute to FRIENDSHIP, FAMILY AND KINDNESS. That all are good values, but you got to DEVELOP SOME GOOD MATERIAL, GOOD PLOT to deliver all that.Dwayne Johnson changed Jumanji into something else, and now he did something much worse to Fast & Furious. I understand he wanted to pay tribute to his Samoa origins, but I think he did them disfavour by doing such lousy work. Samoan motor mechanic fixing the high tech device to extract microbiological virus from the body... Is that a cartoon for kids under 6? If so then leave these kids alone, fairy tales can ignore logic and sense, but they carry their own logic and beauty.I totally understand that the movie doesn't have to be too smart, it has to bring good energy and emotions, but I would definitely argue that this amount of incosistency and craziness is damaging for kids and any adults, by making everybody swallow this nonsense under the sauce of good positive energy and famous movie stars they decrease the demand for quality plot material and even everybody's every day analysis of real life sutations. I apologize, but if you like this movie, then it's only cause you are totally non-critical of your surroundings. I always pay attention to details and this movie was driving me crazy, and Samoa island ending is just delusilonal egoistic whim of the Rock.
I wouldn't call THAT a movie, it's more of 3 hours long video clip of famous movie actors participating in expensive visually enhanced scenes that cannot be really pieced together.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
1091,alexirbr,Old school action movie with hi-tech resources,8,11 August 2019,The fighting scenes are awesome. The characters are cool too.

The plot was just like any other marvel or fast and furious movie, and honestly could have been much, much more original.

1117,deej-20794,So many fake reviews compelled me to write this,3,28 March 2020,"I'm conflicted. As a massive fan of the F&F franchise I feel lobbying against all the fake reviews is against my self interest in case they stop making these movies. On the other hand, if this is how they insult our intelligence, maybe the series needs to die now so we can preserve it's greatness.This has just become a cynical cash cow that truly insults our intelligence. The movie was so poorly scripted, so lazily executed that I thought it would conclude by the first hour then they dragged another hour out of it to extend my misery.Honestly, half the movie was a montage of itself. Pausing to reflect how amazing it was.If they just ran it as a comedy with Kevin Hart and Ryan Reynolds, they would have knocked it out of the park. Their 10min excellent cameos brought this back from the dead.
What a waste of great talent from The rock, Statham and Helen Mirren.Please try harder next time guys.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

1121,arrancleland,Very disappointing.,3,1 August 2019,There were three separate times that I wanted to walk out of this movie. The comedy and childish bickering did not work for me and it made a mockery of what could have been a decent action movie. If you edited out all of the 'jokes' and made it more of a dark action movie it would have worked more. Idris Elba was one of the better characters as he managed to be less involved in the attempts at comedy.Over explaining between the characters was also very clunky and so forced.If the fate of the world (which they keep repeating throughout the movie) relies on their actions then you would expect them to be more serious. It just makes it silly.This movie really makes me appreciate how good the Mission Impossible franchise is.I hope they do not persist with the forced anger between the characters and the bad attempts at comedy in future movies.,Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

1133,umerkhalilk,A Silly And Dumb Action Summer Blockbuster,7,4 August 2019,"This movie is exactly what everyone expected. A silly, ridiculous and over the top summer blockbuster film. It is extremely self aware and it knows exactly what it is going to be.The movie does not take itself seriously and I really appreciate that. The movie comes from the director of movies like John Wick (the first one), Atomic Blonde, V for Vendetta (a movie that I adore) and most recently, Deadpool 2. The Rock, Jason Statham, Idris Alba and Venessa Kirby ( who is the hottest woman I have seen on screen all year) are all amazing.Hands down the best part of this movie is the chemistry between The Rock and Jason Statham (Hobbs and Shaw). Every-time they were talking crap about each other, insulting each other or even looking at each other was entertaining asf. They complement each other stupendously in this movie. Their chemistry is scintillating. Venessa Kirby is a badass character and she added a lot to this film. The action sequences are super unrealistic and over the top but are still exceptionally entertaining. The movie is really funny too. It is a non-stop action movie. They always find an excuse to slide in an action sequence. The movie is entertaining throughout but the run-time is quite long.You learn a lot about The Rock and Statham's characters. Where they come from, their families and more. There are some cameos that are very entertaining and crowd pleasing.The movie is not perfect though, it has some issues. The villain character (played by Idris Alba) is intimidating but the character lacks depth. The runtime may have been too long. There are so many nitpicks in this film that i probably shouldn't get into. The action is great but sometimes it can pull you out of the movie. The plot is not good though. It is a very generic plot involving a virus that we have seen a million times before. The main story was not satisfying for me unfortunately. You have to disregard all disbelief when sitting down to watch this movie.Overall i enjoyed this film and I cannot wait to watch it again even though I do not usually like unrealistic action films.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

1136,paul-29620,Honest review,4,4 August 2019,"I'm a huge film fan and I love the F&F franchise from day one.
Individually the actors are great - but it's just not a great story. Sometimes the banter is annoying and just felt too staged.
I love escapism but this was just dumb. In previous films I could let the stupidity ride because I loved either the cars or the family story or the actors and I didn't really care about the outcome but I just wanted this film to end.
It's probably 45 minutes too long.
I honestly felt that to carry the Fast and Furious name was a bit of an insult it was so loose as to be non existant. It could have been an unrelated film with different character names and still had the same effect.
I felt like the camera work made it feel like a documentary too.
But hey it is what it is. It's mindless escapism I just can't help but feel that the two leads think they are bigger than the name - which is a real shame.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Things like holding the helicopter with his hands, THAT'S too much.Fighting the most advanced army with basic weapons and 5 or more trucks not being able to hold the helicopter but Dwayne Johnson was able to hold the helicopter with his bare hands. Action movie or a comical fairy tale.I honestly now even doubt the credibility of the Director for accepting such a scene in the movie. People in the theater were laughing.I think the movie was just made for the sake of making a movie with no serious or strong plot.Feel sorry for the director and the producer.

I was tired by amount of it in all main F&F franchise movies, I hoped to take a break from this while watching this movie, cause here we don't have to deal with big Toretto's familia, but nope. Here we have Hobbses and Shaws instead. Plus a rather annoying amount of stupid American-style dirty joking, plus another genuine criminal organization caming out of nowhere, plus honestly saying forcibly weakened main villain and his team. I haven't seen more stupid idea than switching off all the bad boys's firearms, including car turrets and helicopter missiles (and don't forget about drones they might use). Nothing else but fricking ha-ha. Very useful for the Hobbses to beat all them down using rage and primitive weapons.

Me and the girlfriend decided to give this one a try and after 10 minutes in we already felt like this was not a movie worth paying for.First of all, there is no chemistry between Dwayne and Statham. It feels very fake and all the ""jokes"", you can see them coming from a mile.
In general the dialogues are hilariously bad. If my cat could write, it would come up with something more original.The CGI isn't all that great either and a bit over the top.I'm not even going to start ranting about the script because there is basicly no decent script. Just the two main.characters trying to be witty while burning eachother and its not witty.It was always about action and team/group dynamics but they completely threw that out the window.Save yourself some money and pass on this.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

1152,tasosc,Overmilking,1,10 November 2019,"This movie was nothing more than a manipulation of the reputations of the actors. Statham and Johnson used for the action while Reynolds and Hart were the comedic additions. There was no effort in the story line and COMPLETE disregard for anything even near believable. There was a point in the movie where the weather went from sunny day to thunderstorms in literally 2 seconds because of a helicopter crash. The F&F franchise had nothing to do with anything. They slapped a McDonald's sticker on a piece of crap and called it a burger. At the very least, show some respect to Paul Walker's legacy. The only thing about the movie I respect is that Johnson was given the opportunity to showcase his heritage a bit. Shame.

1177,Zoltas,Hobbs & Shaw Review,8,26 October 2019,"The name of the film is Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw. The film was directed by David Leitch. It is an action film. It stars Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham. The film was released on 13. Juli 2019.The film is about the agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and the British soldier Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). They don't like each other, but they have to work together, if they want a chance to fight the bad guy Brixton (Idris Elba).I strongly recommend the film, because i like the scenes in the film. The film has very good special effects and a nice dialog; only the background of the greenscreen was a bit boring and not interesting The film is very entertaining and funny. My favourite scenes are the beginning and the last fight. The beginning, because it has a nice contrast with the differences, between the two agents Hobbs and Shaw. The last fight because it has very nice grafics and slow motions scenes. The story was very simple, but they integrated funny scenes and had some great ideas: especially the modern weapons and vehicles. The film has a type of open end, so you have to watch the next film of Fast & Furious.

However, I always loved the sequels because no matter how ridiculous the story may get, the people feel real. Beyond that, even The Rock and Jason Statham had great chemistry in the last couple, so I don't know what happened here, but I just didn't buy a line of it. Felt contrived and lacked the genuineness of the other efforts. Remember them making friends in F8 of the Furious? Okay then why do they meet up here and hate each other all over again? Did anyone else really buy the Samoan story? I like the idea of that but the execution was horrible. It felt contrived just like the rest of it.By this point, with a FF movie starting the Rock and Statham, you know what you're getting into when you walk into the theater, so complaining about ridiculous action sequences and tough guy banter would be silly.

However, that was just not possible. Sadly, I was distracted by bad acting of quite monstrous proportions. I have seen Dwayne and Jason act before, and let's just say that I have seen better performances in school plays. But this was just cringe. Hard to watch. The terrible cheesy dialoge did not help, and also non-sensical plot. So, even though I consider myself quite fond of the action-genre. This was unwatchable and not worth the money or time. Idris was alright, but other than that...

This film doesn't pretend to be anything more than an over the top action flick. It has a plot that makes no sense. The character motivations are dumb, everything takes place in a world with cartoon physics, and all is marinated in testosterone. But it delivers it all with a big smile and so much self awareness, that you immediately forgive everything.
The acting is the kind that we come to appreciate from The Rock and recently also Jason Statham. A refreshing part is from Idris Elba. The man best known from his slightly dark and serious, but also a bit over the top, character of Luther. A man who was wrongly passed as the new James Bond and has now found a new freedom to take one any role he wants in both Hollywood and the UK.I will not spoil anything here, but if you like '80s and '90s action films, please do yourself a favour and go watch this.

1211,noclips,This is what happens when you let a stuntman direct a movie,3,28 September 2019,"It's such a disconnect from the Fast & Furious franchise that we are used to, they should have just left that part off of the title. We have all come to accept some level of cheese going through the F&F series but this one is off the charts. I found myself laughing throughout all of the rising action scenes. Maybe I'm just a huge fan of the early entries in the series and am still upset about the loss of Paul Walker but honestly, it feels like they are just trying way too hard. And with the director being a stuntman, you can definitely tell it's like he is setting up the scenes to check things off of his stuntman checklist.
With all of that out of the way, lets talk about what this series is all about - cars. They have completely lost their way on this aspect because there were only 2 cool rides in the whole film and they were the offroad unnamed thing and the dropped Peterbuilt. Remember the first couple of F&F movies? I can call out all of the cars because that's what this series is about. I remember leaving the theater in a cloud of smoke! Not this one though. It's more of a failed James Bond + Jason Bourne + The Transporter.
I think it's time to stop and let Paul Walker rest in piece and quit trying to make easy dollars off of this franchise. Let's leave it where it can be viewed and respected rather than run it into the ground like this trash flick is trying to do.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

1229,sopranik,Potevamo fermarci prima...,4,9 August 2019,"Siamo alle solite, e sprecare parole per questa recensione per me significa fare un grosso sforzo.
Ormai agosto è arrivato e ciò significa prodotti scadenti al cinema e un ennesimo nuovo capitolo della saga di ""Fast & Furious"", o meglio, questa volta uno spin-off.
Non saprei nemmeno cosa e come cominciare a scrivere: gli standard ormai sono gli stessi di sempre e comportano, accanto ad una buona scelta musicale, forse l'unica cosa passabile dell'intero film, una sceneggiatura misera ed un soggetto che potrebbe, per esser buoni, occupare tre righe di un foglio A4. I personaggi mancano della componente umana e, stereotipati al massimo nel loro ruolo di uomini alpha, perdono quel briciolo di credibilità che li rende reali.
Ben lontane sono le basi che aveva gettato il primo film. Questo ideale è stato tradito già da troppo tempo, così come la volontà di creare un prodotto che possa semplicemente intrattenere. Infatti, oltre ad essere estremamente lungo, ""Hobbs & Shaw"" risulta anche incredibilmente noioso, ripetitivo e privo di una struttura portante che possa definirsi avvincente.
Accanto a brevi momenti di pausa tra una scena d'azione e l'altra, in cui si prova in modo grottesco a dare un briciolo di umanità ai protagonisti, rimangono soltanto gli elementi che ti fanno apprezzare il cinema: la poltrona, il grande schermo e il proiettore.

This was the worst Fast and Furious movie ever. All the hype for nothing. Vin diesel and Tyrese would be laughing at it. Dwayne even had a post on Instagram thanking his fans for making this movie the best in the FnF franchise. How low!!

The action was okay, they used too much CGI and that crappy ""shaky camera"" In the action scenes. This movie would've been rated higher if it WASN'T part of the ""Fast and The Furious"" storyline. It completely ruins it. How do you go from illegal street racing to ""saving the world"". It doesn't make sense to the whole franchise and this movie just disrespects it entirely.

Although I love the Rock and Jason Statham, I didn't spot any chemistry and their constant fighting  got so boring after the first minute I almost wanted to get up and walk out of the cinema. I decided to give it another chance and stayed (worst decision I made). The action was too over the top and the ""superhuman"" plot line doesn't fit in the franchise which, for me, made it very awkward. The movie failed to convey the message of family and friendship and the feeling you're a part of something, that I got in the first few movies of the franchise (except for of course Tokyo drift...).

Anyway in these 30 minutes it goes from night to mid day to again night with a severe lightning storm lasting for the exact moment of the boss fight scene, to then bright sunny mid day and everything is dry????I suppose if you like the F&F franchise this may appeal, but it is the worst film by far of 2019, Ryan Reynolds and Kevin Hart are the only redeeming features but otherwise it's utter smack your head against a wall cringe.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

I'm a sane 19 year old.
I can safely say that this is one of the worst moviea I have ever seen. In thrillers, you have to expect some unrealistic things which is fine in most movies. In this one however, it's all extremely silly. None of the humour lands. There's absolutely nothing going for that movie. The helicopter scene is just the idiotic cherry on top of the awful cake.

Duration: 2 hours fifteen minutes
Yinra: Action. Humor (not comedy) adventure
Cast: No introduction needed
Director: David Leach (Dead Pool 1 & Two - John Wick 1 - Atomic Blonde)
Rating: Story average bit presentationIf you have watched and enjoyed the films mentioned above by director David Leach. So Hobbe & Shaw is then made just for you - a movie that is completely like twelve spice CHAAT MASALA will prove to be the best entertainment for you as it provides a good entertainment time pass movie to watch this movie. Fun can be had on any cinema screen only on the cinema screen. With a small screen and pirated print you can hardly enjoy this movie.Plot / Story:
The movie, based on the story beginning with the movie similar to the Mission Impossible / James Bond movie, will look like a BAHO BALI on arrival at the end, but you don't have to panic, because the movie ends as soon as it becomes as BAHO BALI The hottest action incredible stunts, full of technology, make this movie the worst story of the year, making it the story that is supposed to make a pre-sequel to this story and a post-sequel to the film as well. The way to the next sequel is open by displaying flashback dialogs, flashback scenes, family drama and open-ended. The truth is that while watching this movie, I felt a lot of reflections from Mazhar Klim's Imran series. There are also technically many bugs to be extracted in the story, but Over All is a time-pass money-rich movie that will not bore you.
One of the best entertainment on the weekend that can be enjoyed by the teen age fans is PG Rating 13 Plus. Throughout the film, Hobbs and Shaw's knock-on role played a key role in keeping the film intriguing, but the post-credits scene is a special joke for those who have watched the Game of Thrones series.Spoiler alert.
Plot / StoryThe sister of Shaa Brothers, who works for MISS, is involved in a mission to secure the transfer of a dangerous virus to an attack called a very high-definition cyborg-type villain, a syndicate run by the Black Web. Top Agent injects himself to protect her from the Black Web / Dark Web agents claiming the same girl to be the killer of the entire MI sucks mission team and agencies all over the world chase down the sister of the Shaa Brothers.

1308,skelding-38083,The Rock sells no matter what,4,24 October 2019,"Whilst there's a high amount of action in this film (as you'd expect), the quality is poor and just relies on star power to pull through. As a spin off, you'd expect it to relate to the Fast & Furious franchise on some level but it really doesn't. The storyline is just ridiculous and makes no sense, even trying (poorly) to give Hobbs a love interest that is just cringeworthy all around. They really should have ended the franchise after Paul Walker's death, he wouldn't have wanted this. Dwayne Johnson however, is a master at marketability and can make money out of anything, hence why this film is a success financially.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

1315,joadykstra,Humor and Action merged with Sub-par Acting and Unrefined CGI,5,12 November 2019,"The acting and scripts for The Rock and Jason Statham is exactly what you would expect to see from them. They are both portrayed as alpha-males and cannot concede any dominance to the other.Many of the actors who were hired to fill smaller roles in this film seem like they have never seen any screen time before. Their acting us cringe-worthy and takes away from the scenes in which they are inserted.The plot in the movie is intriguing, but very predictable and sometimes even lack-luster at times. More could have been done in order to make the plot much more dramatic. It just doesn't pull the viewer to the edge of their seat eagerly waiting to see what will happen next.The great downfall of this film is that the majority of it is very unrealistic from explosions, to vehicle pursuits, and hand-to-hand combat. These unrealistic scenes are met with poor CGI. It looks like they handed the film to a bunch of interns who are halfway through school to make the CGI. It is bad.So, unless you would like to watch Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham try to insert their dominance over each other for the entire film, you may just want to pass on this one.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

Anw, this movie is fun and super entertaining to watch, loads of actions, craziness, yes, it is dumb (Hobbs and Shaw being too overpower) but in a fun way that make you excited. Strong family theme, message about the environment, and sprinkle (a bit too much) of comedy.

There where some corny parts of course but I can over look those as it was just a really fun movie. I am actually looking forward to a sequel despite there being so many of these movies already, I really want to know the actor behind the voice at the end and to see which of the pervious movies that this person ends up coming from. This movie wont end up being a classic but I highly recommend watching for a fun afternoon",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
1324,karlvabritt,Umm what?,1,29 August 2019,"The movie was actual trash, CGI looked cheap even cartoonish, the story fking random, too unrealistic scenes, overall just boring. Literally one of the worst movies i have ever seen, I dont understand what movie the other people watched and how on earth they can give this POS anything over a 5 star rating is betond me.
One last time : DONT WATCH IT , waste of money and waste of time, never gonna watch anything fast and furious related again.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

1326,halvtre,Where are the cars?,3,5 August 2019,"It's more in the Die Hard kind of action movie the only different is that die hard is good! I'll miss the old fast and furious movies. It has some wierd action scenes when cars is hanging from a chopper. The cars seem to manage to get more grip when they use NOS as well. Then it suddenly start to rain and thunder when ppl at fighting? And sunshine when they stop? I can go on all day about the bad bits. Waste of money! Where are the charger, RX7 and supra. Car meets and tuning?",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
1327,zaindeveli,This movie is unique,10,16 August 2021,"For the first time I see real super hero woman that still feels like a Real woman.- strength coupled with mildness and vulnerability. Vanessa Kirby did a good job. Her dexterous movements is a sight for sore eyes.The female character was the most memorable part of this picture. Maybe it will set a new era for action movies with a female protagonist and that's why it should be must seeAs the whole the film hold ur attention thanks to David Leitch style - his cuts a rare for action movies too, I liked every sequence and cinematography and the use of Warm/Cool techniques.But the one thing disappointing is that the tension drops in the middle of the film, which feels like the end but you take a look at your watch and realise there is up to 1 hours screen time left.The actors didn't disappoint at all, their personality feels a lot different from FF saga in a good way.I see this movie as fresh, but it's sensually lacks something. May be its a storylineI recommend to watch it at least once.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

1333,tominva,Just a stunt movie,8,3 August 2019,"The movie doesn't have any story bases. Using some bad a** technology and other stunts which makes
some of these things unrealistic. And movie is lagging at some points. And there are so many post scenes which makes it confusing that is this movie finished o or not. There are so many adult scenes(only talking) in which most of scenes are uncomfortable i.e, its vulgar ones.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
1334,devinbozdagci,Unbelievably Bad,1,30 July 2020,"I didn't expect much, but it was a lot worse than I had expected. The story... What story? They didn't even try to explain what the movie was about. All I can remember is a super-evil Terminator-Idris-Elba in the worst role of his life and the best men the CIA has to hunt him are a cop that failed to capture a few muscle car driving bad guys in Fast Five and a former super-villain. Unnecessary to mention that the characters had no depth and no one put any effort in creating them. The acting was garbage. The dialog was stupid. They tried to be funny and failed horribly. The action was average. I can't get over the pure stupidity of this cliche story and the ridiculous dialog.
Without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen many. It's simply pathetic to make a movie this bad with such a high budget. I hope that the writers never touch a movie script again.
If you haven't watched it, don't do so. If you have, I feel your pain.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

1339,hammbone-73088,Waste of time,1,14 November 2019,"I rented this movie for free, and I want my money back. The chemistry between the two leads is non-existent, with every joke falling flat and every line of dialogue being painful to listen too. The action was laughably unbelievable and that's from an action movie standpoint. Sorry Dwayne, you're not strong enough to hold a helicopter. Mcguffins are a'plenty which is par for the course with these movies since the 4th installment, but it doesn't make it any less egregious and mind numbing. The small amount of romantic sub plot was bafflingly underdeveloped if not completely missing, and once again the actors had no chemistry. The overall theme of the movie(if you could call it that) was that technology doesn't trump human spirit and heart. Which I found hilarious considering the way they showed it was with samoans winning a battle against advanced soldiers(after their weapons got turned off) when polynesian culture was almost completely wiped out by cultures with more advanced technology. History disproves your theme, sorry. Overall the movie was a big, expensive, shiny and polished nothing. With nothing of note to remember and nothing worth saying. I wish I could rate it less.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
1340,thomassayles-37321,A welcome change to the series,9,27 August 2019,"Upon this movie been advertised i was a bit unsure as how it would compare to the other 8 films in the series and must say i was surprised by the way in which this film came across.
The chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham was very good and the humorous excahnges between them both made the film for me .
The story had a very family orientated story behind it which continues on with the theme of the fims and the ending sequence was in my eyes an amazing end to a very goof film well woth watching if you are a fan of the fast and furious franchise",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
1341,iron-man-07435,Rock needs to go.,1,8 September 2019,"To much bull* action and one liners. Not a fast and furious movie without the regular cast. Ever since the rock arrived the FF series has been going downhill. He's a good extra buy not a main character just like Hobbs. They postponed the making of the next fast and furious movie to make this bull*. They need to study what made the first series of movies great, the street car culture.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
1342,kds-82082,Awesome!,9,3 August 2019,"Awesome. The Rock and Jason Statham are the best, Vanessa Kirby was great too. Drags a little in the 3rd act so The Rock can stick all his cousins in there but I don't blame the guy for indulging a bit. Crazy that this series started with a couple street racers stealing VCR's now it's about stopping a Cybernetically Enhanced superman working for an evil tech company/AI(?) who want to take over the world.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

1346,tbperrett,A fun action flick,7,14 August 2019,"If you're a fan of the first 4-5 F&F movies, this one has little to nothing to do with them. However, it was still a fun action-packed buddy-cop-esque film. The chemistry between Johnson, Statham, and Elba was incredible. Remove the F&F franchising, it is the start of a great trilogy! Sit through the little bit of forced dialogue and a couple bad actors, and it's a really fun movie! Recommend for anyone who likes action and banter!",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw

So unreal that it was funny.
This movie is a combination of the Black Panther meets James Bond, meets Aeon Flux.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
1355,eanasjarrar,Fun but... Also really really cliche,6,17 September 2019,"Listen, I get that any action movie will have cliches, and that they're called cliches because they work. But in this movie, they did not work for the most part.The four main actors were amazing, but I felt they didn't have much to work with. This movie could have been something amazing, if they had changed a couple of small things; like over explaining, for example. I wish more people would employ ""show, don't tell"" in action movies.I loved the banter, but some of the jokes were just really bad, and maybe not delivered as well as they could've been?? And the comedic timing for a few things was way off. Like, for God's sake, I'm not supposed to be laughing at the final showdown; it's supposed to be suspenseful!Kevin H. And Ryan R. Were a breath of fresh air.",Fast & Furious Presents - Hobbs & Shaw
