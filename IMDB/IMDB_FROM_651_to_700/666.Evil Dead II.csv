0,Leofwine_draca,Firm favourite,10,9 July 2016,"A long and firm favourite film of mine ever since a life-changing viewing at a tender age, EVIL DEAD II remains for me the pinnacle of the comedy/horror hybrid genre. Packed with inventiveness, wit, and energy in every single frame of every single scene, this is movie-making par excellence. The story begins by recapping the original movie (reshot, eliminating all characters aside from Ash and his girlfriend) and then moves into even more thrilling territory as a new story unfolds. Full advantage is taken of the increased budget, so that we get better sets, better costumes, better make-up, and most of all better special effects. The latter really make a difference (on what is still a relatively low budget movie), packing in tons of weird and wonderful demons and monsters including plenty of imaginative stop motion effects which are worked well into the blend.If THE EVIL DEAD was the film that first introduced the skills of director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell, then EVIL DEAD II is the film to show that the original 1982 hit wasn't just a one-off wonder and that instead both star and director had staying power which would outlive the series. Raimi does some fantastic things with cameras and builds on his efforts in the first film, sometimes paying homage to his original shots and often taking the film in directions he was unable to explore the first time around. Fans may wish to note that the emphasis is on comedy over horror this time around and a perfect balance is struck between the two genres – plenty of laugh out loud moments interspersed with genuine terror and creepiness makes for good times a plenty.The film belongs to the athletic Campbell as Ash and he really carries it along on his shoulders alone. Almost half an hour of the movie consists of Bruce acting on his own and when the other characters do eventually arrive, it is a testament to his acting skills that you wish that he'd instead been left on his own for the entire movie. The film is packed with action and incident and tons of imagination. One great, never-before seen moment follows another, highlights including the chainsaw fight in the work shed, the hand possession (still the best ever put on screen thanks to Bruce's dynamic performance) and the entire finale sequence which is simply blissful.The script is witty and concise without putting unnecessary dialogue into the mouths of the characters and things are rounded off by another fantastic Joe De Luca score which really emphasises a number of key moments. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent with especially notable turns from Sarah Berry as the tough heroine, Danny Hicks as a truly loathsome slob, and an unrecognisable Ted Raimi buried inside a rubber suit as possessed hag Henrietta. Blood flows, limbs and heads are lopped off at regular intervals, yet the film remains light-hearted and fun all through this thanks to the party atmosphere prevalent through. Truly a classic landmark piece of film-making, which sadly has not been bettered since. I think it's fair to say that there's no film quite like this to be seen anywhere else, and it remains even now one of my all time favourites that I can watch and enjoy over and over and over again.",Evil Dead II
1,SnoopyStyle,fun B-movie splatter horror,7,28 August 2015,"Ash J. Williams (Bruce Campbell) takes his girlfriend Linda to a secluded cabin in the woods. He find a tape recorder. He plays professor Knowby's recitation of the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (Book of the Dead). Linda is possessed and Ash has to decapitate her. He finds the bridge taken out. Linda's head and body, which he buried, comes back to attack him. Ash has to cut Linda up with a chainsaw. His hand turns bad after Linda's bite. Meanwhile, Knowby's daughter Annie and others try to bring the Necronomicon to the cabin.Sam Raimi has a bit more money and he continues his Evil Dead story. It's as bloody as ever. There is some fun with the blood splattering B-movie. Bring some protection. There are some funny bits especially with the hand. The other actors are limited. It would have been interesting to see an one-man play with Bruce Campbell from start to finish.",Evil Dead II
2,Prismark10,Do not read the book,7,4 May 2018,"I found myself tittering a lot when watching this film which is strange as it is supposed to be gore laden horror film. Sam Raimi along with his leading man, Bruce Campbell deliver a low budget, manic, effects filled horror film with lashings of comedy.Ash (Bruce Campbell) is taking his girlfriend Linda to a secluded where he find a tape recorder and a book. The tape was found by a professor who translates the the book of the dead which unleashes malevolent spirits that possess Linda, leaving Ash to chop her head off. Later on Ash hand starts to attack him as it turns evil due to Linda's bite. Ash has to cut it hand off.Later on the professor's daughters turns up with a few other people but faced being attacked by possessed people and the only way out is to read a passage that drives the evil away.I do not know how Raimi managed to do some of the special effects and gore in such a low budget, there is stop motion animation, a tribute to the manic slapstick comic styles of the Three Stooges and Tex Avery. Campbell's broad acting style certainly gets results here.",Evil Dead II
3,kosmasp,Within the cabin,7,29 August 2013,"While Sam Raimi did base the first Evil Dead movie on his short movie ""Within the woods"" (a short a lot of people would love to see someday, but there are some issues with it, either rights issues or the material is not good enough, I guess), this is a sequel/remake of the first one. It seems like he was ahead of his time.We do get a ""previously on Evil Dead"" segment in the beginning, but it doesn't show the events that unfold as they were portrayed in the previous movie. It's like a short movie that changes the back-story a little bit. It also is a bit funnier than the first movie. Bruce Campbell is more than able to squeeze funny out of some situations. So while it seems like more of the same it is still more than entertaining.",Evil Dead II
4,classicsoncall,"""Who's laughing now?""",3,10 July 2018,"Oh man, why do I even bother? Well, there's an answer to that. I watch junk like this because I've set a personal goal of watching and reviewing every movie that's ever made an IMDb Top 250 list, and this one appears on one going all the way back to 1997. I watched Bruce Campbell's turn in ""Army of Darkness"" not long ago and at some point in this picture it started to look like the same movie again. I don't know much about Campbell so I took a look at his bio here on IMDb and it seems like he has some talent, so I can't figure why he would devote a good part of his career to something like this 'Evil Dead' series. Seems to me he could have been a leading man with the right breaks, but that's based on his looks and not on his talent. You wouldn't know if the guy had any talent by watching this flick. Hey, I know there are fans for stuff like this, and if that's your thing, go for it. If not for earning an IMDb merit badge, I'd never come near something this stupid.",Evil Dead II
5,gavin6942,Possibly the Best in the Genre,9,26 July 2006,"After making the mistake of going to a cabin in the woods in ""Evil Dead"", Ash Williams returns to the same cabin in the woods for ""Evil Dead II"" (although there is dispute whether this should be considered a sequel or a remake). When the evil dead are awakened by the incantations from the Necronomicon, only Ash has the sheer audacity to try and stop them from taking over the world. This film does not have the best special effects ever, relying heavily on stop-motion animation and odd camera angles. The acting is more than a little campy. The plot is thin, particularly since it is a rehash of the first film. The action is a little bit silly. And for a horror film, it has virtually no swearing or nudity and much of the blood is not even red.But still, a great many people consider this the greatest horror film of all time (with all due respect to ""Jaws"") and I consider it easily in the top ten of horror films (Internet Movie Database ranks it 45th). Even Roger Ebert, notorious anti-horror, gives it three out of four stars. And here is why.This film shows what can be achieved with little money and a big imagination. Backwards filming, stop-motion animation, puppetry. Modern directors would rather use computers than rely on trick shots, but this film shows that costumes and Jell-O can go a long way. I am so sick of ""scary movies"" that try to scare me with some futuristic cartoon. Why not give me blood, gore and have fun while doing it? Could any film have been more fun than this? The plot: a man and his girlfriend stay in a cabin and unleash the spirits of evil which can only be stopped with a careful reading of an ancient book. The same exact plot as ""Evil Dead"", this is basically a remake with a bigger budget with an injection of slapstick comedy and the removal of a crucial rape scene. (I understand why the rape scene was removed, but this was the most memorable part of the first film and it is strange they would neuter their bigger film.)Sometimes the camera shots go too far. Sam Raimi likes some strange angles (see ""Intruder"") and he likes to use the zoom button on some weird objects a few too many times (though this gag is taken even further in ""Army of Darkness""). The first twenty minutes has by far the most strange camera shots you will see in almost any film, and more than in the rest of the movie combined. People new to the film might find this overbearing. Heck, even I do not completely get it.What works here is that we have all the Raimi regulars, who offer that perfect chemistry. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, who are rarely far apart, offer some of the finest films in the past few decades. But do not forget co-writer Scott Spiegel, who also wrote ""Intruder"" and is a long-time Raimi associate (and played a great wandering minstrel for ""2001 Maniacs""). Ted Raimi, Sam's brother, is a must for any good Raimi film (although his solo work, like ""Skinner"", is sometimes lacking).And do not ever count out Danny Hicks, the redneck trouble-maker in this film (""Jake""). He has been with them for ""Intruder"", ""Maniac Cop"", ""2001 Maniacs"", ""Darkman"" and the upcoming ""My Name is Bruce"". Hicks is probably the most unsung of the troupe, and hardly deserves that backseat reputation. Hicks met Raimi on this film and has been with him ever since, and I can speak from personal experience when I say he goes out of his way to promote love for the horror genre.When it comes down to brass tacks, this group works because the point here is to have fun... and because that is what horror is to me, fun. Fun with chainsaws. And if horror is fun, this film is one of the best horror films the world has to offer. How that ends up getting a guy the ""Spider-Man"" franchise is beyond me. But as the tagline says: ""Kiss Your Nerves Goodbye"", and also your worries, too, if you need a good laugh.",Evil Dead II
6,lee_eisenberg,Oh that hand!,10,16 August 2005,"Whether ""Evil Dead II"" was a remake or a sequel doesn't matter. What does is that it's an ultra-super-cool movie with every gross crazy thing that you could imagine! The plot (loosely) concerns Ash (Bruce Campbell) going back to the cabin and having to battle the evil spirits once again. But of course, the whole thing is really an excuse for a series of gags involving blood, eyeballs, and finally Ash's hand. In my opinion, the whole hand sequence should be registered as one of the greatest scenes in movie history, right alongside the Yellow Brick Road in ""The Wizard of Oz"" and Slim Pickens riding the bomb in ""Dr. Strangelove"". Only stuffy rich people would be incapable of liking this movie.",Evil Dead II
7,jboothmillard,Evil Dead II,4,17 June 2005,"The first film is considered a funny and over the top gory ""video nasty"", and I remember watching this ""sequel"" once before, a second time was a good idea, from director Sam Raimi (Spider-Man). Basically the film opens just like the first film, only it's just Ashley 'Ash' J. Williams (Bruce Campbell) and girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) going to a cabin in the woods, the tape recorder with the Professor reciting the words from the Book of the Dead is read, along with some flashbacks of Professor Raymond Knowby (John Peaks), and the Evil Dead is unleashed. Linda turns into a zombie like monster intent on torturing and killing Ash, before he decapitates her with a spade, and he buries her body in the soil, and the last bit sees something coming towards him. Imagine now the film is continuing, except the Book of the Dead isn't burned, Ash briefly turns into a monster himself, and is back inside the cabin defending himself from the evil forces. Meanwhile the Professor's daughter Annie (Sarah Berry) and her research partner Ed (Richard Domeier) are returning to the cabin with some copies of the book's pages to get the rest. Ash is slowly going insane with the evil forces trying to get in, take over his body and trying to kill, he even cuts his own right hand off when it becomes possessed, and it crawls away. When Annie and Ed arrive, along with guides Jake (Danny Hicks) and Bobby Joe (Kassie Wesley DePaiva), they soon realise the danger they are in, and just as before, one by one are taken over by the evil forces to become zombie like murderous monsters. After Ash has attached a chainsaw to his severed right arm, Annie and he read the words from the book to get rid of the Evil Dead once and for all. In the end, while Ash's possessed hand stabs Annie to death, a large portal starts sucking all the evil in, but it also takes Ash with it, and he is praised as a hero when he guns down a winged creature in the medieval world he has entered. Also starring Ted Raimi as Possessed Henrietta and Lou Hancock as Henrietta Knowby. I was really disappointed that the story didn't just continue from the previous film, it is just a complete rehash of events, and not even much of a proper sequel. When it does get to the original material it is still both horrible and funny at the same time, so while not all great, a not too bad follow up horror comedy. Okay!",Evil Dead II
8,Woodyanders,The rare sequel that's an improvement on the original,10,30 October 2007,"As much as I love ""The Evil Dead,"" I still must admit that it's a pretty crude and rough around the edges film. Granted, it's the ragged quality of the original which gives the movie its raw power. That said, I just have to say that the sequel qualifies as a genuine improvement; it's a much more assured and polished piece of go-for-broke crazy film-making with better acting, stronger production values, more impressive special effects, and a wickedly hilarious sense of jet black gallows humor. Bruce Campbell encores as Ash, who once again finds himself trapped in a remote woodland cabin that's besieged by ferocious evil demonic forces. Director/co-writer Sam Raimi never lets the whiplash-inducing frantic pace falter for a minute, offering a nonstop roller coaster ride of beautifully bent, batty and berserk cinematic mayhem that gleefully assaults the viewer's senses from start to finish. Peter Deming's fluid, darting, hyperactive cinematography ensures that this picture is a complete dazzling visual treat throughout. Joseph Lo Duca's spooky'n'spirited score likewise hits the spot. Moreover, Raimi really pours on the outrageously excessive graphic gore (blood literally flies everywhere in several scenes). Gruesome gonzo highlights Ash being attacking by a headless body wielding a chainsaw, Ash's possessed hand breaking dishes over his head, and an eyeball flying into a screaming woman's mouth. Campbell delivers a wonderfully amusing and animated performance as the intrepid Ash; he receives excellent support from Sarah Berry as feisty anthropologist Annie Knowby, Dan Hicks as scruffy redneck Jake, Kassie Wesley as sassy hillbilly gal Bobbie Joe, and Ted Raimi as the hideously grotesque possessed Henrietta. Great ending, too. All in all, this baby sizes up as a total groovy blast.",Evil Dead II
9,ccthemovieman-1,Horror Movie Played For Laughs; Extremely Entertaining,8,31 January 2007,"This is one of the few horror movies I truly enjoyed, because the film offers a great combination of horror and comedy. It adds up to a very entertaining 85 minutes.There's a lot to like in this kinda-goofy movie: nice visuals; good humor to counteract the scariness and gore of a horror story; a small amount of ridiculous theology compare to what usually is offered in this genre, and some totally outrageous scenes. They include a woman's head loose and then biting a man's hand with the rest of her body running around with a chainsaw; a hand with a mind of it's own, monster-type grandma and grandpa in the cellar, chase scenes through a forest with trees coming to life and attacking people, on and on....wild, wild stuff.My main complaint is not enough lulls. There is too much action, and it's so intense it's almost too much to watch in one continuous sitting even with its fairly short length. One needs a break once in a while!There is no credibility in here, but that's okay since I think most of this is played for laughs more than horror. Bruce Campell suffers physical damage that would have killed a person many times but within seconds, he's back to normal. Campell, by the way, must have set the all-time record for making rubber-faced wild faces in a movie, more than Jim Carrey. However, this movie certainly isn't one to be scrutinized for realism. You have to look at it, with all the gory scenes and shocking violence as not much more than just tongue-in-cheek satire on horror movies. It's great fun.",Evil Dead II
10,ma-cortes,"Creepy and scary horror feast with plenty of gore , guts and loads of blood",7,8 November 2015,"Amusing and terrifying bloodfeast in which Ash/Bruce Campbell returns for a second round when he takes refuge in an abandoned cabin and taking place subsequent transformation the people into evil demons until only Ashley J. Williams remains to battle the evil . This frightening , strikingly designed horror/comedy movie achieved a lot of success thanks to its unstopped terror and humor , including continuous resemblances to the original version also directed by Sam Raimi . It deals with a 20th century guy , Ash (Bruce Campbell) , none too bright hero , who finds caught between scary monsters located into a ghastly cabin in which unwittingly emerge resurrect demons . As the lone survivor of an onslaught of flesh-possessing spirits holds up in a cabin with a group of strangers while the demons continue their attack . As Ash along with his shotgun , and his chainsaw finds the ¨Book of the Dead¨ and subsequently to confront a nasty witch . Later on , square-jawed Ash must fight an army of ghouls and generally causes all those wreak havoc . An eerie , tongue firmly in cheek sequel of the original festival of gore and gags in which an ancient book of magic , Necronomicon , invokes a crowd of joke-tossing , flesh-snacking skeletons . Exuberately gory and filled of guts flick , and filled with primitive special effects , by using stop-motion technique . This comic book extravaganza is blending from previous version ¨Dead evil¨ with creepy creatures submitted a fantastic possession have transformed into flesh eating . Highly adequate make-up and appropriate special effects with enjoyable monstrous creatures and apparent technological exuberance . It must be stated that this is one of the grossest , disgusting and most brutally unnerving movies in the eighties . A fun retelling providing chills , hilarious situations and grisly horror and isn't apt for squeamish neither feeble stomachs . The producers insisted upon using different colors of blood to avoid an X rating , this proved futile, as the MPAA gave the film an X anyway ; after cuts, they received a more desirable R rating . This independently produced gem features sets and production standards but is skillfully narrated and results to be an exciting horror/comedy film . Sympathetic acting by Bruce Campbell as improbable hero . Although Bruce Campbell was displeased with the studio's delayed release of the film and their re-editing of it , as he stated he wasted a year of his life waiting for the film to get released to cinemas . This one is Bruce Campbell's favorite film of the trilogy ('The Evil Dead', 'Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn', and 'Army of Darkness' in which Ash is hurled back to the 14th-century through the powers of an evil book and attempts to get back to his own time) . There appears cameo by Sam Raimi as the first Medieval knight to raise his sword and give his speech before hailing to Ash and the Zombified Henrietta was actually played by Sam Raimi's little brother , Ted Raimi . Thrilling as well as rousing musical score by Joseph LoDuca . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Peter Deming , though most of the film was shot on a set built inside the gymnasium of the JR Faison Junior High School in Wadesboro, North Carolina . The motion picture was well directed by Sam Raimi , but many scenes were deleted from the movie and according to official reports, all of them and original version of the movie are lost . All 3 films can be seamlessly cut together , including some introductory footage in the follow-ups . The first installment was ¨Evil dead¨(1983) by Sam Raimi with Betsy Baker , Theresa Tilly and Bruce Campbell who finds ¨The Necronomicon¨, dealing with a group of friends are vacationing in Tennessee woods when go into a mountain cabin and they find the book of the dead , then begins a possession demoniac and they undergo an eerie changing at night and going on a murderous rampage . Followed by two sequels with similar actor (Bruce Campbell) , producer (Robert Tapert by Renaissance pictures) , musician (Joseph LoDuca) and compellingly directed by Sam Raimi . Its sequel was this ¨Evil dead 2 , Dead by Dawn¨ (1987) also starred by Sarah Berry , Dan Hicks , Kassie Wesley DePaiva , Ted Raimi , among others . And ¨Army of darkness¨ who finds Ash accidentally transported to 1300 A.D., as he is trapped in the middle ages where attempts to retrieve the Necronomicon so he can return home ; this is a big-budgeter film , while its predecessors were low-budget , it was stunningly directed by Sam Raimi with great originality , though takes parts here and there , too . It's become a cult favorite thanks to its relentless terror , irony , graphic horror but has still tongue-in-cheek . Well worth watching for terror and gore lovers .",Evil Dead II
11,BA_Harrison,A silly splat-stick horror classic—but not the film I wish it was.,7,19 May 2009,"Back in 1987, when I emerged blinking into the daylight having just witnessed the long awaited sequel to Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead, I was too embarrassed to publicly admit the tinge of disappointment that I was feeling. With fans and critics alike hailing the film a masterpiece, I didn't feel comfortable expressing my less than glowing opinions. Now, 22 years later, having just revisited the film, I feel ready to come clean: I don't LOVE Evil Dead II.There. I've said it. I feel better now.It's not that I hate the film either—on many levels it's very entertaining and Raimi's direction is certainly kinetic, ensuring that boredom is never an option—but it just isn't what I expected or wanted from the sequel to one of the greatest horror films of all time.Gone is the all-out visceral horror of the original; Evil Dead II's violence is less graphic and very cartoonish, with extremely watery blood and one deadite even bleeding green. Instead, Raimi gives us slapstick comedy, Three Stooges style, with star Bruce Campbell performing a series of silly comedic set-pieces that require him to smash plates on his head, perform pratfalls, and pick a fight with his own hand. Very amusing, I'm sure... but scary?? No siree!Raimi starts his film begins by virtually retelling the entire first movie in the first ten minutes and then proceeds to throw in a few more characters to kill off: Bobbie Joe and Jake, a couple of expendable hicks, heroine Annie Knowby played by Sarah Berry (who has the most irritating scream in the history of horror), and her pal Ed Getley (Richard Domeier). Meanwhile, Ash (Campbell) gets do his physical comedy thing whilst spouting a few quotable bits of dialogue for the fans to repeat ad nauseum.As the film progresses, there are a few effective jump scares as the dead unexpectedly pop into frame, one particular scene in the fruit cellar manages to raise the tension (at least until the monster appears and the comedy starts again), and a memorable finalé leaves the film on a high note, but in my opinion, Evil Dead II sorely needs more horror and less cheese.I give Evil Dead II 7/10, which isn't that bad I suppose, but I wish it was a 10/10.",Evil Dead II
12,moonspinner55,Back to the cabin in the woods...,3,14 November 2017,"Director Sam Raimi's over-the-top recap of his early low-budget horror flick ""The Evil Dead"" from 1981 is an improvement over its grainy, ghastly predecessor, a demon barf-fest which was made for about $400,000 and sparked a cult-following on home video with slacker teenagers. Raimi's budget on this one was a little over $3,000,000 and it shows. Bruce Campbell reprises his role as Ash, a university student taking his girlfriend to a cabin in the Tennessee mountains while the owners, a professor and his wife, are away. Things are just starting to get cozy when Ash comes across an ancient book in the professor's study, the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis--or, the Book of the Dead--along with the professor's taped thesis on the archaeological find in which he unwisely recites the incantation to resurrect a demonic spirit (it works). Raimi shows off a wickedly imaginative sense of gruesome glee (not apparent in the first film), as well as a film scholar's eye for classic movie references, visual jokes and an audacious talent for breathlessly-paced mayhem. Buckets of red, green and black guck get sprayed all over the screen, with prime recipient Campbell taking the brunt of it (he's a good sport rather than an actor). While Raimi has since proved in his mainstream films that he is more than adept at a solid narrative flow as well as a kinetic visual style and a keen sense of editing that sets the pace for his pictures, these techniques remain out of reach for him here (as well as a talent for handling actors). All types of cinematic tricks are brought out of the toy-box (everything that three million dollars could buy in 1987), but the picture is merely made up of episodes. It's a showoff piece for the filmmaker; he's in the process of developing his craft--and having a grand old time--but the set-ups have no follow-through, and the whole doesn't equal the parts. Followed by ""Army of Darkness"" in 1992. *1/2 from ****",Evil Dead II
13,paul_haakonsen,The element of comedy spiced it up...,8,10 January 2016,"While I never really understood why they decided to slightly change the storyline a bit from part one to the continuation in part two, then it is still an interesting approach. And ""Evil Dead II"" is in fact a rather good movie; a sequel that actually surpassed its predecessor.The added element of comedy might not have been welcomed by all viewers, but I think it was a stroke of genius. It helped redefine the franchise that is ""The Evil Dead"". And the increased budget did of course help too.""Evil Dead II"" is a good combination of horror and comedy, and Bruce Campbell really was allowed to showcase his talents in this movie and made it clear that he is without a doubt the only one capable of being Ash.The effects in ""Evil Dead II"" are upped quite a lot compared to the first movie, and it really did help the movie. So there is a wider audience appeal to the sequel compared to the first movie.Similar to the first movie, the storyline is well-thought through and is coherent. It is easy to follow and you would be way off if you wouldn't enjoy this movie - but that is of course my personal opinion.If you are not familiar with ""Evil Dead II"" then it is about due time that you sit down and watch this great horror comedy.",Evil Dead II
14,Quinoa1984,more entertaining than the first; a great party flick,10,2 July 2004,"Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn, distinguishes itself from the original in that this time the hero Ash (the unmistakable, often hysterically funny hero of the Evil Dead trilogy, Bruce Campbell) isn't the last one on the line in the kind of unique, nearly art-film (not to scare off people, I mean more like WAY low-budget) horror-filled treatise on the teenagers-down-to-one. This time, Ash is like the hero of a Saturday afternoon matinée special or updated drive-in flick that's been allowed by the censors to show whatever's inside the creator(s). Sam Raimi, the mad genius behind this trilogy and films like A Simple Plan, The Gift, and the recent Spiderman 1 & 2, doesn't keep his material high and dry for too long. In fact, not much is too low-brow in the horror book. He pulls almost every trick out of this book, so the speak, to get the audience into a shocked, but (with the proper sense of humor) amused mood at the lengths the 'curse' will take Ash and the other visitors. And from a film-making standpoint (this is aside from the fact that the story's a clever send-off of tongue-in-cheek, ultra-violent Italian horror films), it's all bravura thanks to the great make-up and special effects. Two of the fx crew, Greg Nicotero and Robert Kurtzman, made this as their official, outstanding proving grounds before heading off to start KNB effects, which has worked on array of action and horror films. And always there's a cruel, if totally and timely un-realistic turn waiting for Ash and the others, as Raimi and co-writer Spiegel maintain the zombies and such. The highlights include the little hand that could (provided by Nicotero), a ""mother"" laid to rest in a fruit cellar, and a flock of trees awaiting in the forest outside the cabin (which, for me, was more frightening and disturbing when done in the first film).Aside from the onslaught of ridiculousness, and rebellion against being embraced by any mainstream audience, it's something of an acquired taste. Though it's gained a hefty cult following, and rightfully so, you show this to any random audience of today and the effect may be the same as when it first came out - some will love it, and some may almost puke or walk out. But it's the kind of film, like the first as well as the wonderful Army of Darkness, that displays Raimi's inspired talents with a lens, and it grows on you. Not to mention, it makes a fine old party movie with friends; it's the work of a real comedic talent, not just of a sensational stylist.",Evil Dead II
15,Coventry,Demented fun!,7,29 November 2004,"Not so much of a sequel to Sam Raimi's groundbreaking horror feast the Evil Dead, this is more of a reprise of the same film with more proper equipment, professional pacing and further developed gore. Sole survivor Ash (Bruce Campbell in the role of his life) returns to the cabin in the haunted woods and faces the same demonic forces he dealt with in the first film. The first half is kind of like a one-man horror comedy show that provided Campbell with his constantly growing cult-icon status. Ash chops up his possessed girlfriend, loses essential body parts and nearly goes completely insane up in that shed. The second half introduces new characters or - in other words  fresh new victims to dissect. Sam Raimi updates his initial Evil Dead idea with rushing camera movements, inspired gore and comic book-style action. The pacing is fast and the blood is omnipresent! According to most horror fans, this is the finest installment in Raimi's trilogy (completed in 1993 with 'Army of Darkness') but I still prefer the charming cheapness of the original. Nevertheless, this is one outstanding horror adventure. Campbell's acting skills have remarkably improved and Sam Raimi's directing also is a lot more solid. Great fun, warmly recommended to every horror fan and admirers of twisted black humor.",Evil Dead II
16,michaelRokeefe,No time to yawn...dead by dawn.,7,5 June 2005,"Is it a sequel or a re-make? Director Sam Raimi has his lone survivor from EVIL DEAD(1981)Ash Williams(Bruce Campbell)back in the woods again at battle with demonic spirits. This time Ash himself becomes a part-time zombie. Visitors arrive only to be sustenance for the horrid demons summoned by chants from The Book of the Dead.Campbell is purposely having fun enough to come across campy. The most entertaining part of this film is when Ash is alone and fighting off his possessed hand. Alright, maybe this is deliberate comedy. Some pretty cool special effects...cheap they may be. Blood again splatters, spews and squirts. Hell, horror couldn't be more fun. Notice that many of the props also appeared in EVIL DEAD. Also appearing with the square-jawed Campbell are: Sarah Berry, Kassie DePaiva, Dan Hicks, Denise Bixler and Ted Raimi.",Evil Dead II
17,hitchcockthelegend,The Flaming Groovy!,8,18 October 2015,"Yes indeed, Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell are back to shake some action with this remake of their own The Evil Dead (1981), only this time with more money and more overt humour. A quick prologue sets things up nicely, then BAM! Ash (Campbell) and his squeeze are in the cabin of doom and about to be part of a night of unholy demonic terror.It's a nightmare of the black comedy kind, where Raimi and Campbell invite us to a party and then gleefully pummel us into submission - and we sado-masochistically enjoy it! Ash has grown a pair of cojones and decides to fight back against the demonic forces, cue mucho action with chainsaw and shotgun. There's a quip on the tongue for our hero as well, even as he is battered from pillar to post to make the action work.Raimi isn't interested in extraneous scenes or exposition, he strips it bare as the pic hurtles along, all while he brings his technical skills with camera and sound design to the fore. The humour is often outrageous, dementedly so, while it's nice to find a group of film makers who don't feel the need to now throw blood and guts at the screen every other scene just to make a formulaic impact.Bonkers, chilling and devilishly funny. 8/10",Evil Dead II
18,Hey_Sweden,"""I'll swallow your soul!"" ""Swallow this!""",9,21 October 2012,"Sam Raimi and company meld horror and humour in this one-of-a-kind, lively sequel to the ""original experience in gruelling terror"". They know very well that sometimes when things are simply insane, all you can do is laugh. They begin by recapping the first movie, although have to tell the story differently, not being able to obtain the rights to use archive footage. Then they launch into one of the most uproarious assaults on the senses that genre fans will ever see. Written by Raimi and fellow filmmaker Scott Spiegel, it has a delightfully over the top nature yet stops short of winking at the audience (the actors play everything very straight, as well they should). Basically, this is as fun as the genre can get. When poor, poor Ash (Bruce Campbell, now a co-producer as well) is nearly drowned in blood, or what looks to be ink, or whatever, it's impossible not to chortle. And Raimi continues to pay tribute to slapstick comedy with the films' most memorable sequence, in which Ash is victimized by his own possessed hand. One has to hand it to Campbell; this guy is one hell of a good sport, putting up with a lot as Raimi & co. set up to abuse him as much as possible. He's flying through trees, landing in puddles, being tortured physically and mentally, yet somehow he gets through it all. Here he's also starting to show signs of the character he would become in ""Army of Darkness"". The new cast members acquit themselves well, and some of them get roughed up pretty badly, too: Sarah Berry is Annie, daughter of the professor who started the whole mess in the first place, Dan Hicks is scruffy rube Jake, Kassie Wesley DePaiva his girl Bobby Joe, and Sam's younger brother Ted is a riot as the possessed version of Annie's dear old mom. Indicative of the nature of the film is when an eyeball pops out of a witches' head and flies right into Bobby Joe's mouth, not to mention the moment when objects in the cabin, including a lamp, laugh their asses off. Elements such as grasping trees and the ""Force"" p.o.v. cam return, and the special effects are pretty damn amusing, especially the ""Rotten Apple Head"" we see towards the end of the film. As in the first ""Evil Dead"", we do get some valleys in between the various peaks, but things do build nicely towards an energetic finale. The ending, paving the way for ""Army of Darkness"", is pretty ingenious and features a cameo by none other than Sam himself. That hilarious poster promises a great time for the audience, and delivers on that promise. A comedy-horror classic. Nine out of 10.",Evil Dead II
19,preppy-3,"Violent, gruesome, over the top, a GREAT movie!",10,1 November 1999,"Nonstop fun as a group of people are trapped overnight in a remote cabin and tormented by the evil dead. Not really a sequel to ""The Evil Dead""--more of a remake. Director Sam Raimi expected this to be R rated and figured most people never saw the unrated (meaning it was X) first one. So, he decided to just redo the movie--just quicker, less gorier and with STRONG doses of comedy (the first one was dead serious). He did it, cut some gore but it was STILL unrated. So it was released (with the gore never put back in) and, like the first, didn't do too well. And, like the first, it quickly acquired a following and is now considered a great movie!Basically once the movie gets going it never stops. It's more a comedy than a horror movie--a very SICK comedy! Hands are cut off, eyeballs go flying, BUCKETS of blood are thrown around, knives and axes are used, etc. If you go expecting a horror film, you'll be disappointed. If you approach it as a sick comedy you'll love it! I recommend this highly but only if you have a strong stomach!The sequence with Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his possessed hand is a horrific and comedic highlight. Cool ending too.",Evil Dead II
20,LeonLouisRicci,Arguably Invented The GenreStill The One To Beat,9,8 January 2014,"An Unrestrained Sam Raimi Directs this Sequel as if He has lost His Marbles. This is on purpose of course, because the Self-Reflective and Genre Satire is nothing Less than an Original Take that has become a Staple in the Horror/Comedy. It may have Invented the Genre, at least in its Current Form.Not Scary by any Stretch it is a Live-Action Cartoon with Stooges Slapstick and Tex Avery Inspired Stop-Motion Wackeyness. It is one of those that goes Over the Top in almost every Scene and is Obviously Proud of it, because as this Mayem Progresses it seems to up the Stakes as soon as it lays out the Bet.Fondly Embraced and is a Movie that is Watchable and Enjoyed Today, was a Big Surprise Hit, both Commercially and Critically, because Simply, there was nothing like it Before. It is Relentlessly Creative and Absurd, Funny, and Grotesque. There is so much Energy in this Bizarre Movie that the Fun the Filmmakers had making it is ever Present in Every Scene.",Evil Dead II
21,poolandrews,"Very similar to the original, but still great entertainment.",8,4 December 2004,"The opening of Evil Dead II consists of mostly a montage of shots of the Necrinomicon 'the Book of the Dead' and a spoken narration that goes, ""legend has it it was written by the dark one, Necrinomicon Ex Mortis roughly translated Book of the Dead. The book served as a passageway to the evil worlds beyond, it was written long ago when the seas ran red with blood. It was this blood that was used to ink the book. In the year 1300 A.D. the book disappeared."" Ashley 'Ash' Williams (Bruce Campbell) along with his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) are traveling by car deep into some woods to a remote mountain cabin. After some brief romantic shenanigans Ash finds a tape player. He decides to have a listen, the tape recording was made by the cabins owner Professor Raymond Knowby (John Peaks). He talks of traveling to a an ancient castle and discovering the Book of the Dead. Professor Knowby continues and explains that the Book of the Dead spoke about passageways to another world and contains demon resurrection incantations. Ash continues to listen, Professor Knowby begins to translate aloud the incantations which awake the evil spirits within the woods. All of a sudden Ash hears the sound of breaking glass and when he investigates he finds Linda has disappeared. Ash goes outside and starts to look for her, she turns up and is possessed. She attacks Ash but he chops her head off with a shovel. Ash buries Linda and quickly finds out he is trapped as the bridge he used to get to the cabin has been destroyed. He heads back to the cabin where he must try and survive to the morning and the safety of the sunlight. Meanwhile Annie Knowby (Sarah Berry) Professor Knowby's daughter and Ed Getley (Richard Domeier) have landed at a nearby airport with the missing pages from the Book of the Dead and decide to head straight for the cabin. They soon find out that the bridge has been destroyed but hire Jake (Dan Hicks) and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva as Kassie Wesley) to show them to the cabin via a trail through the woods. Once there they find the cabin in a bad state, blood on the floors, a blood stained chainsaw, no sign of Annie's parents and Ash covered in blood holding a shotgun. They lock him in the fruit cellar. As the night draws on it becomes apparent that Ash isn't alone in the cellar and as the group start to be reduced in number by the evil spirits the survivors start to realize that the woods contain evil that wants to kill them all, Dead by Dawn! They must try to find a way to defeat the evil and try and save themselves. Co-written and again directed by Sam Raimi with a much improved budget, who like the original has a small cameo at the end as a medieval soldier. This is another great film, again full of cool camera tricks and angles and memorable sequences, it's no surprise Raimi has gone onto great success in Hollywood with Spider-Man (2002) and it's sequel Spider-Man 2 (2004). The script by Raimi and Scott Spiegel moves like a rocket, just the way it should but I couldn't help thinking it was a little too similar to the original, in fact I'd sooner call this a remake rather than a direct sequel. Lots of great scenes and cool one liners in this, like when Ash puts Linda's decapitated head into a vice and tightens it up, as Linda's head laughs and taunts Ash he points at it and says ""your going down!"" just before Linda's headless body bursts into the work shed and attacks Ash with a chainsaw. Or when Ash is looking at himself in a mirror after he had just killed Linda and says ""fine"" his reflection suddenly jumps out, grabs him and says ""I don't think so, we just cut up our girlfriend with a chainsaw, does that sound fine?!"", the shot ends with Ash's reflection strangling the real Ash but the camera zooms out to reveal Ash's own hands around his throat. A sequence where the possessed Linda is dancing as her body spins around independently of her decapitated head, which remains in the same position looking towards Ash throughout the spin. A funny sequence where Ash's own possessed hand beats himself up, smashing plates and bottles over his head and punching himself in the stomach! Ash goes onto cut his hand off with a chainsaw and puts a bucket over his still alive possessed hand and puts some books on it, one of which is Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms! A really nice touch of black humor. Or the getting tooled up scene in the work shed where Ash fixes the chainsaw to his wrist and saws the barrel of his shotgun off after which the camera zooms in on his face and he quips ""groovy!"". A short dialogue scene where Ash thinks he heard a noise in a bedroom and wanting to take a look he says ""we'll all go in together"" to which Jake answers ""hell no! Your the curious one"". Or the shots of a stag's head over the fireplace that comes alive, turns to Ash and starts to laugh at him, and a rocking chair in the corner of the room that starts to creepily rock on it's own. Again Raimi goes overboard with the 'dead cam' point-of-view shots, and continuous unbroken shots where the evil spirits follow Ash around the cabin breaking doors down and the like, I could probably carry on but hopefully you get the idea. Acting is much improved over the original and Campbell is still great as Ash. The effects are also much better this time around, according to the booklet supplied with my DVD no less than three FX groups were brought together to make Evil Dead II work. Having said that rather disappointingly there isn't much on screen gore. When anything graphic is supposed to be happening it's usually off screen or rather tame, Ash's hand amputation is off screen, when Ash kills Linda it's in shadow, when he kills 'Evil Ed' with an axe it's mostly off screen, Bobby Joe's death isn't seen and Jake death is just a ridiculous amount of spurting blood from cellar that looks like red water. Some of the effects look dodgy particularly the stop motion animation and living severed hand sequences. The ending in which the evil is turned into a physical being I thought was a bit over ambitious and a turned out a little flat. Overall another great film, I was just a bit disappointed by the restrained gore and violence when compared to the original, by comparison in the original when Ash decapitates Linda with a shovel and her headless body falls on him, a large amount of blood from the wound squirts out all over his face. In the sequel when Ash decapitates Linda there is not a single drop of blood spilt and when Ash dismembers 'Evil Ed' when his blood splashes over the walls it's green and looks more like washing up liquid. However, I highly recommend it to horror fans and is still one hell of an entertaining horror film that's great fun at the same time. Watch it, as soon as you can.",Evil Dead II

They were out of this world.Bruce Campbell was the man! I heard his name mentioned the other day, and I had to see who he was. He was so funny and well worth watching.

23,grantss,So bad it's almost good. Almost.,5,22 January 2015,"So bad it's almost good. Almost.I'm generally not a fan of zombie movies. They're generally quite unoriginal, predictable and one-dimensional. The central plots hardly vary, the actions scenes could just be cut-and-pasted from one movie to the next. Evil Dead II isn't an exception in those regards. What's worse, its special effects and production values are incredibly bad: obvious dolls as zombies, toy bridge and car for the early bridge scene, special effects which hardly look real for a moment.Add in some pretty bad acting and you should have an horrendously bad movie. However, it almost works.The amateurish nature of the production gives the movie a lightness and unintentional humour that keep you entertained. Plus there are some intentional funny moments. The movie could just as well be labeled a comedy as a zombie movie.Unfortunately, the humour doesn't quite negate the pitiful other aspects of the movie. The last few scenes involve the usual zombie vs human and supernatural crap and the movie ends in chaotic fashion.Good for a few laughs though.",Evil Dead II
24,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"""Groovy!""",10,21 January 2006,"The sequel to the gory, atmospheric horror flick The Evil Dead is really more of a (black) slapstick comedy... something there was a hint of in the first. Here, it's pushed all the way through... it's cartoony and provided you're into the humor, fun. I found it more cool than fun, honestly; never been into laughing at pain, no matter whose it is. But there's no doubt about it; this film is cool. It's also very much a 'guy' film... get 'the gang' together, call up all your guy friends and get a copy of this film, preferably an uncut one. You'll love it. So did I, no doubt about that. The better part of the film is basically a remake of the first... new characters and new plot points, but the progression and such is the same. The situations are the same, but the ways in which we get to them are different from the first film. It's a fine idea, and it works great, too, because the outcomes of the situations are different, as well... meaning, you see a scene and go ""Oh, right, I remember this from the first... oh yeah, now he... what the ...!?"" The plot is interesting, new and old parts alike. It's not Shakespeare, but it keeps your interest. The acting is the same fairly low standard as that of the first. The characters are equally ill-developed(though this time, I *could* tell them apart... they were easier to tell from each other, however, so maybe I wasn't the only one who couldn't tell those in the first apart?). The editing is excellent, just as the case was with the first. The special effects have improved... harder to figure out than those of the first, and that says quite a lot. The budget is higher(ten-fold, according to this very site), and it's most definitely noticeable. The emphasis throughout all of the film is mostly on humor and 'coolness' factor, very little on scares and horror. There's about the same amount of gore, at least as far as I could tell. The film is worth watching for just about any guy... regardless of maturity, really. There are things here that will make every guy watching it go ""way cool!"". One scene in particular had said effect on me... around the one hour mark, involving a chainsaw and a shotgun... anyone who has seen the film already know what I'm talking about, and I won't say anymore so as to not spoil it for anyone who hasn't. See it for yourself; you won't regret it. I recommend this film to any fan of Sam Raimi, gore, the first The Evil Dead, slapstick and/or Bruce Campbell. Of course, all guys should check it out. The film has such a thick 'guy' vibe, it should almost be mandatory for guys to watch it. Anyway, if you fit into one or more of the aforementioned groups, get a hold of this flick and watch it. Chances are high you'll love every second of it. 10/10",Evil Dead II
25,view_and_review,Same but Sillier,1,30 August 2019,"The first The Evil Dead was done in 1981. It was very much a low budget scary film and it looked like it was made in 1981. Why, in 1987, does The Evil Dead 2 also look like it was made in 1981? Did they film both of them at the same time and just wait to release the second?I don't know and I don't care. I got through 19 minutes before I cut it off. I only made it through 19 minutes because I paid for it. Had it been free I don't think I would've made it five minutes through this movie.I didn't like the first one and this one is pretty much along the same lines with bad special effects and a terrible plot. I thought part two would be better because of advances in cinematography, better special effects, possibly a bigger budget... nope. It was more of the same if not sillier.",Evil Dead II
26,AlsExGal,From somebody who knows nothing about the first film..,8,1 November 2015,"...but has thoroughly enjoyed the second one since it came out in 1987. From reading other comments apparently history has been rewritten in relation to the first, but I can't speak to that. Let me just say that if you haven't seen the first one the second one fills in enough details that you know what is going on.The film starts with Ash and girlfriend Linda taking a romantic weekend trip to a cabin. It's a cabin that Ash knows about, but says he does not know the owners, thus he really doesn't know their whereabouts. He says they'll just claim to have gotten lost in the woods if they show up. The cabin is actually where Professor Knowby brought the recently discovered Book of the Dead. We know this because Ash finds the tape recorder and plays Knowby's entries. On the tape Knowby speaks aloud the words that are supposed to resurrect the evil dead - those evil spirits that inhabit the forest and world around us. Once brought to life they can apparently manipulate objects and possess people at will, in search of a way back into this world via possession and a way to harvest souls for hell. Those spoken words do their work, and the evil dead are brought back to this world. Well it is nighttime, and since that is when the evil dead are active they immediately begin to make Ash's life a living hell.Meanwhile, Knowby's daughter Annie is on her way to the cabin with more pages from the Book of the Dead where she thinks her parents are doing research. She has with her a research assistant, and two locals who show her a way around the destroyed bridge that leads over the canyon to the cabin - a bridge destroyed by the evil dead to trap Ash where he is.There is confusion at first as Ash fires a shotgun through a closed door when he hears the four trying to enter the cabin - considering what he's been through up to that point that's no wonder. Likewise, at first Annie looks at the blood and destruction of the cabin and thinks Ash killed her parents. However, it is soon obvious what the real enemy is here, one you cannot see or hear, one that can possess anything, anyone, or even just part of a person. It can make the dead appear as they did in life, it can make the living appear as demons. One particularly creative thing done here is that you see things occasionally from the evil spirits' viewpoint as they rush through the woods, making an awful roaring noise, headed towards the cabin. The action and the chaos just never lets up from the time the forces of evil first attack the cabin. It's hard to describe, and I know it sounds strange, but there is enough tongue in cheek humor merged with some really riveting horror, that you don't feel completely drained from the intensity of it all. For example, when you have both a possessed lamp and a possessed stuffed deer head laughing at you, things get both so horrible and funny that you feel you are watching a satire of a horror film. Only the very end confused me a bit, and maybe that is because I haven't seen the first film. I'd recommend it as horror well done in a different and creative style.",Evil Dead II
27,morrison-dylan-fan,The Evil Dead Series:Part 2.,10,29 January 2017,"Looking at the obit page on IMDb's Classic Film board,I was sad to see that Evil Dead 2 co-star John Peakes had died over the weekend. Talking to a fellow IMDb a few days ago about watching the movie for the first time,I decided to pay a tribute viewing to Peakes.View on the film:Setting the mood for the flick, John Peakes gives a charming performance as Knowby,whose eerie voice in the opening whips up a Gothic chill. Picking up the chainsaw again, Bruce Campbell beams with a real growth in confidence as Ash,via Campbell hitting the quirky Comedy shotguns with a demonic glee,and taking down the living evil dead with brash one-liners.Kicking the cabin doors open,the screenplay by co-writer/(along with Scott Spiegel) director Sam Raimi leaves no waste on the bone,with the 20 minute set-up of the first film being replaced by a rolling 5 minute intro. Not needing to set anything up,the writers tear the horror jugular with outrageous slap-stick and cackling demons. Playing fast and loose with the plot,the writers grip all of the horror chills and comedy spills on Ash's grisly fight or flight survival instinct.Finding themselves with some decent cash for the first time in the series,director Sam Raimi & cinematographer Peter Deming masterfully mash gooey Horror,vicious slap-stick Comedy and quirky stop-motion Fantasy animation for a deadly delight. Splashing the screen in green and red ooze burning in lighting fast tracking shots circling the cabin,Raimi unexpectedly dips into Horror surrealism.Hitting Ash with buckets of demon blood,Raimi uses the surrealism to stop the flick becoming overly serious,via darkly hilariously bonkers set- pieces where Ash chainsaws a demonic head and fights against his own hand!,with Ash finding himself facing the evil dead for the second time.",Evil Dead II

It is like a more comical version of the first film. The opening is rushed with one car scene of Bruce Campbell and his girlfriend, then they're at the cabin where a recorder of the book of the dead is presented. His girlfriend is possessed immediately and decapitated with a shovel. He buries her but witnesses her dancing headless corpse emerge then he is battling severed hands, laughing with a wall mounted deer head, and attaching a chainsaw to his severed limb. This all again ends with another cliff hanger. Director Sam Raimi has fun but continuity is a major factor when green goo is splattered about and then everything is clean. There is also a seemingly endless number of doors in this tiny cabin. Campbell is hilarious in his constant agony as he battles various monsters that emerge from under the floor door. The supporting roles are mainly flat although Sarah Berry has a little depth as someone eventually placed in the Campbell position dealing with his possessed demonic other. The others consist of a researcher boyfriend with no personality, Mr. White Trash and his white trash girlfriend. While the film is creative and visually innovative the screenplay is unfortunately a mirror image of the original. Score: 5 / 10",Evil Dead II
29,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Just as demented and crazy as it's predecessor,10,25 August 2015,"Heading off to a cabin in the woods, the reading of a demonic book unleashes a horde of vicious demons that plague a man and others that arrive there looking to translate the work forcing them all to fend off the beings.This one is easily among the top films in the genre. What works so well for this one is that there's far more emphasis on this one being unbelievably funny and hysterical as its utilizing physical slapstick comedy to do it's terrorizing and torture, resulting in this one containing numerous side-splitting gags. The possessed-hand material is superb slapstick comedy, from it striking him in the head with plates and grabbing at his face while the scenes of him hunting the disarticulated hand around the cabin are hilarious, Ash being tormented by the baying laughter and howling from the stuffed animals and furniture in the room and the over-the-top reaction to the situation by dumping gallons of blood from minor wounds. As well, there's tons of times here involving him tripping and stumbling over something, beating himself into the walls or with furniture to dislodge something stuck to him or puts on numerous factional distortions that are all quite hilarious. Still, beyond the hilarity this is still first and foremost a horror film so there's a lot of big scenes here that go for the chills and jumps quite effectively, from the opening battle with the possessed girlfriend in the woods and the ensuing POV chase through the woods into the cabin, a great battle with the reanimated body and the series of attacks down in the cellar all provide plenty of that. The finale is where all the best action is, as the possessed individuals become much more bold and daring in tormenting the remaining survivors, the humor gets dropped and the pace quickens substantially which not only highlights the nearly flaws-less make-up on the possessed, deformities and wounds as well as the fantastic finale that mixes some rather impressive action alongside the black magic workings featured here which makes this one all the more fun. There's really only one area here that holds this down which is the clumsy way this brings everyone together, letting him stay there along for a long period of time and sloppily bringing the group in later on. The cutaways don't do much and makes it seem like forever before they get there. As well, especially early in the movie, not a whole lot made sense. One character is possessed by the creatures, and remains so for the early part of the movie, then all of a sudden, in the middle it disappears and never comes up again. It's weird that something that powerful could be gone just that easily. Otherwise, there's not much this one gets wrong.Rated X/R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Language and Brief Nudity.",Evil Dead II

When the professor's daughter and her entourage show up at the cabin, the night turns into a non-stop battle. With chainsaw and shotgun on one side, demon horde and flying eyeball on the other...So it carries on straight from the last shot of the first movie, and carries one from there, but really, its more of a remake, which is good in parts, and seriously overrated in others.Campbell defines himself as a cultural icon in this movie, he's an amazingly physical actor, and has brilliant comic timing. The rest of the cast suffer though because of Campbell, and really just stay in the background, until they turn into deadlines.It's got plenty of splatter, and effects are good, but do yourself a favour, and don't watch it too soon after the original, because you will get a sore sense of déjà Vu.Fun, but a little lazy, and seriously overrated.",Evil Dead II
31,Aaron1375,The second flick in this series a gory good time.,9,6 October 2007,"I did not remember this movie being as funny the first time I saw it, but then I was just a kid. Now years later with my sense of humor effectively warped I had quite a few chuckles. This is of course a sequel to ""The Evil Dead"", but then it is not quite a direct sequel. The first part of the film sort of recaps the first, but then it doesn't. You will notice only Ash and his girlfriend are shown at the cabin. The cabin is significantly better looking on the inside and there are various other differences as well. Still, this does not detract from this film as I like this one better than the first. Campbell as Ash is great, the first part of the film is like a one man show of someone doing a self torture stand-up. You get to watch a man have his hand possessed and proceed to beat the crap out of himself. And the scenes of Ash laughing along with the rest of the cabin is like a demented episode of Pee-Wee's playhouse. Soon though others arrive, of course they are just fodder for the evil dead to possess and kill. The effects are good for the most part, and where they are not so good it is usually done in humorous manner. The chainsaw arm is cool, and it is a nice ending as well considering the third part. I kind of wish Sam Rami and Bruce would make more horror movies as they are very good at it.",Evil Dead II
32,Wuchakk,"Awkward, confusing start turns into insane, over-the-top horror comedy",6,12 February 2018,"RELEASED IN 1987 and written & directed by Sam Raimi, ""The Evil Dead"" chronicles events when two Michigan State students (Bruce Campbell & Denise Bixler) travel to a remote cabin in western Tennessee for spring break wherein they discover a copy of the Book of the Dead and an audiotape whose incantations resurrect demons in the woods. The daughter of the archeologist who made the tape (Sarah Berry) also visits the cabin with her beau (Richard Domeier) and a couple of dubious locals (Dan Hicks & Kassie Wesley DePaiva). The first film was low-budget, cartoony and extreme, but it was serious horror. This sequel is also cartoony and extreme, but it's decidedly comedy horror. It's entertaining for what it is, but it's hindered by a confusing opening ""recap"" that doesn't match the previous film. Raimi stated that he didn't have the rights to use material from the original movie so he did a 7-minute recap with only two people instead of five (with Denise Bixler taking over the role of Linda). But there are other inconsistencies: The Book of the Dead and audiotape is found in a room rather than the basement and Ash (Campbell) later ""rediscovers"" that the bridge is out, which he already knew via events in the first film. Once you get past the awkward and perplexing set-up, the movie settles into an entertaining over-the-top gory horror comedy, which is so creative it's as if it was made by a lunatic. Bixler is a great replacement in the role of Linda, but her part is too brief and you only catch glimpses of her stunning beauty. It took me a while to warm up to Annie (Berry), but I eventually did and she's a worthy secondary protagonist. There are several amusing and thrilling sequences, like the demonic hand scenes.

33,Mr-Fusion,Wickedly entertaining,8,12 October 2011,"""Evil Dead II"" is a departure from the first, in that it's not a straight-up horror film. After a short (slightly altered) recap of the first movie, we find Ash (Bruce Campbell) still in the cabin, having survived until daylight, the last man standing. But the forces of evil still lurk in the woods, and the bridge is out, so Ash is stranded.The tone is significantly lightened this time around, with much of the film spent on watching Ash get his ass kicked inside the cabin - whether it's getting beaten over the head with glass plates (by his own possessed hand) or being doused by a spray of blood from the walls. Just witnessing Campbell wage war with his own hand is worth the price of admission. There's so much Looney Tunes comedy and Three Stooges slapstick that you can't help but laugh at Ash's abuse (which seems to be the driving force behind the making of this film).It's the prototype for the horror/comedy we see so much of today. Even so, ""Evil Dead II"" bristles with so much manic energy, you can't help but appreciate the humor and sentiment from the filmmakers. A supremely watchable film of the highest order.8/10",Evil Dead II
34,HumanoidOfFlesh,"Nowhere near as good as the first one,but still pretty cool.",8,8 December 2000,"""The Evil Dead"" is probably one of the most popular horror films of all time and it has inspired too many horror flicks to name.It is not only extremely scary,but also gory as hell.In comparison to that masterpiece ""Evil Dead 2"" is nowhere near as gruesome,but it is still worth checking out.The camera work throughout the film is spectacular and the special effects made by Mark Shostrom are pretty good considering the budget.The cinematography is really beautiful and the action is furious.Some scenes are deliciously funny especially when Ash cuts off his own demon-possessed hand or when a woman swallows a flying eyeball.Sam Raimi was a really talented guy,he could be a real horror master but nowadays he is making Hollywood garbage.What a shame!!!To sum up,if you love horror movies this one is a must-see.Highly recommended.",Evil Dead II
35,siderite,"Middle part of the trilogy, lose some horror, add some humour",7,16 April 2006,"The movie starts with a stripped down version of the first Evil Dead. The first movie ended with a thing coming very fast at Bruce Campbell and he screaming. After 5 minutes or so of getting to that part, the evil force or whatever it is carries him a few meters and transforms him into a monster. But then the sun arrives to turn him back.What follows next is basically the first movie, but with a lot more humour and a completely different ending. This movie was actually the last I've seen from the Evil Dead trilogy and it makes the smooth transition from the pure horror flick that was the first movie to the funny third part.I think watching all three movies one after the other gives one insight not only into the makings and evolution of Evil Dead, but also of the entire horror/fantasy/monster genre from 1981 to 1993.",Evil Dead II
36,Smells_Like_Cheese,One of the best Sequels out there,10,13 May 2002,"This has to be one of the best sequels to a horror film. It not only had some scares, but some great laughs. I couldn't believe the fan base when I looked online to see what the Evil Dead pages looked like, these movies have brought so many fans together and brought a whole new look to horror movies. Evil Dead 2 brings comedy and horror together and makes it work on so many levels.Now, it does start of differently and has a different story, I heard because Sam couldn't reserve the rights to the original story. But we still have Ash, he is fighting to survive while trying to get out of the woods, but he is encountered by the previous cabin owner's daughter, her boyfriend, and two hick's who helped them get to the cabin. Together they face the Evil dead once again and try to bury them once and for all. But that's a problem when they are getting possessed and facing one heck of a beast in the basement. Not to mention, Ash has been sucked back into the past, leading us into Army of Darkness.10/10",Evil Dead II
37,MovieAddict2016,"Groovy! A lot of fun, even if it's not a masterpiece or anything",9,10 March 2005,"A spawn of the same cult film pool as such diverse projects as ""The Goonies"" and ""Donnie Darko,"" the ""Evil Dead"" series is similarly one popularized (and yes, to some extent overrated) by its endless legion of fans, most of whom were teenagers when the originals came out, and are now in their twenties and thirties. Each film separated by six years, ""Evil Dead, Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness"" (or ""Medieval Dead"" as some fans enjoy referring to it as) all certainly hold a certain low-budget fanbase appeal. None of them did very well financially, at least not in theaters (particularly the third, which had the largest budget and flopped on initial release), but the same can be said for ""Donnie Darko,"" the ""flop"" of 2001 that went on to do very well on video and has played continually at midnight showings across America, enticing new fans every day.""Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn"" stars Bruce Campbell as the returning Ash, the hapless hero who visits a remote wilderness cabin with his girlfriend only to inadvertently unleash the Deadites from another world. After his girlfriend is possessed and murdered by one of the demons, Ash finds himself fending for his life in the cabin and enduring endless physical pain.This is a film set free of logic, cohesion, and reality. Ash murders his possessed girlfriend but never really seems to mourn his loss. Soon he's cutting off his own hand and doesn't really seem to miss it very much in the following scenes (he replaces it with a chainsaw  a clever idea that nevertheless is totally and utterly ridiculous). If I cut off my hand, I might be sort of upset, but not Ash  he doesn't really seem to mind, and it doesn't seem to hurt him very much, either, as he immediately wraps it in a bandage (which must have a magical effect, because blood never stains through the fabric). Furthermore, Ash never seems to fear death from blood loss, or the fact that when he returns to civilization, he might have a hard time convincing local authorities that he's not responsible for the murder of his girlfriend and the visitors who show up midway through the film and all proceed to quickly die painful deaths at the hands of the Deadites.No matter. That's not the point of this film. ""Evil Dead II"" is pure fun, and nothing more. With this in mind, its strong fanbase comes across as being rather intimidating  visiting any ""Evil Dead"" message board will reveal some people who seem to thrive on this film, daily reciting quotes, acting out scenes, and dreaming up scenarios for the (pending) sequel ""Army of Darkness II."" That begs the question: Is ""Evil Dead II"" really deserving of its critical and public acclaim? Having been referenced by Jack Black in ""High Fidelity"" as the film you must see in order to stray away from devolving into a ""movie idiot,"" ""Evil Dead II"" is a fun experience with a charismatic, energetic lead performance and a clever and witty script. Before I saw ""EDII,"" Black's recommendation in ""High Fidelity"" (""there's so much blood!"") was a joke -- a parody of the macho male ""action, sex, nudity, loud music"" attitude. After having seen ""Evil Dead II"" I realize that Black was right -- the blood and guts really do make it worth seeing  they almost become a punch line to the joke, such as when a body is dragged into a fruit cellar by a demon and a spew of excessive fake red water drenches the heroine as the corpse is churned into a million pieces.So, no, it's not a masterpiece and it probably isn't quite deserving of its strong reputation. It's that type of movie, where you kind of enjoy it for the cheese factor  and don't try to heavily criticize its flaws, because to do that would be way too easy. And obvious.The film is more of a remake than a sequel, recapping the events of the first film, dropping three characters, and generally picking up somewhere in the middle. For example in the original ""Evil Dead"" Ash stumbles upon the Book of the Dead, and he does so again in this movie. Many events are totally re-filmed as if they never occurred. It's a rare beast of a sequel  somewhere oddly in between continuation and smug self-parody.I personally prefer the original ""Evil Dead"" if only because I find the horror elements stronger and the ""comedy"" far less goofy (if there are even any traces of comedy in the original at all). ""Evil Dead II"" goes a bit too far sometimes  the dancing furniture is lame, for example.However, no one can say this series lacks originality. Instead of presenting us with a banal representation of the original film, director Sam Raimi reunites with Campbell and creates a whole new beast  packed with excessive physical humor (think: ultra-violent Three Stooges on a macabre level), self-parody, tongue-in-cheek humor, and what Campbell himself described as ""splatstick"" comedy. On top of that, Campbell is much better here than he was in the original (where he seemed to be a pale shade and more cowardly version of the typical action hero persona)  Ash is still somewhat of a coward but Campbell lends his character a great sense of irony here that if anything only establishes Ash as one of cinema's most iconic characters.Overall, ""Evil Dead II"" is a really fun ride, with a superior performance from Campbell. It may not be on the same level as the original in terms of horror or just general enjoyment, but it's still a blast. Groovy, baby!",Evil Dead II
38,Red-Barracuda,Sequels rarely come any better than this,8,11 June 2012,"Evil Dead 2 is one of those very rare films - a sequel that surpasses the original. Where the original film was a straight ahead horror flick, this one adds comedy to the mix. In different hands such a move would prove disastrous, with both the horror diluted and the comedy not funny enough. But comedy-horror is probably the sub-genre that ultimately suits Sam Raimi's sensibility best. His kinetic direction, fast paced editing and reservoir of inventive ideas are put to their best use with the addition of comedy. While star Bruce Campbell turns in a truly hilarious star-making performance as the hero Ash. His knockabout acting style is something of a revelation here. Both men peak in this movie.It's technically a sequel, with events from the first film recapped in the early scenes. Once Ash is picked up by an unseen force and propelled through the forest we are at the point just after the first movie ended. To be honest though, it feels more like a remake than a sequel. A lot of important details are dropped from the first movie, such as the two other companions. But whatever way you want to look at it Evil Dead 2 benefits from the higher budget at Raimi's disposal. The make-up is rather good and there are better special effects throughout.Where it really scores though is in its brilliant combination of genuine horror with proper laughs. There are many scenes of pulse-pounding tension, there's a horrific hag in the cellar and loads of bloody splatter violence; this is offset with moments of inspired comedy mayhem such as the possessed hand or the demented laughter scene. There are many individual moments of originality sprinkled throughout though. Campbell is a real asset here; he understands the nature of the role perfectly. He's not just a great physical actor but also delivers numerous funny lines right on the button.The Evil Dead 2 is a triumphant combination of slapstick and over-the-top horror. You can't take it serious of course. It's like a gory comic-strip come to life. It's a movie that deserves being called a cult film.",Evil Dead II

40,KineticSeoul,"""Groovy""",8,7 May 2013,"This one actually surpasses the original in just about every way. Out of the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy most people refer to ""Evil Dead 2"" for a reason. Two is basically what makes this trilogy stand out. This is probably the film that made Ash a iconic figure in the horror genre and probably made the chainsaw the iconic horror weapon. It's more crazy and humorous than before and has way more supernatural elements going on. In fact this time the whole cabin looks like it's been possessed. Bruce Campbell again plays Ash but he now feels like a trademark character in these genre. His facial expressions and his crazy laughs are a classic. Everything is just more humorous this time around in a good way. It just has many innovative elements which adds onto the originality from the first. This one is a classic for a reason and shouldn't be missed out on. Especially if your into the horror genre.8.6/10",Evil Dead II
41,thesar-2,Evil Dead Part Redux,1,4 April 2013,"Hulk was remade, or, ah-hem, rebooted with The Incredible Hulk. While neither worked, the second film was a slight improvement over the previous. They felt the need to remake the first one, because, well, it was pretty shitty. So, why did they feel they needed to remake the original The Evil Dead?Perhaps, I should recommend people watch Evil Dead II (which, by the way is NOT a sequel, but a remake, as stated) before they make it to part one. This is because I just re-watched the first one last night, part II tonight, and will watch #3: Army of Darkness tomorrow night. All in preparation of the second remake: Evil Dead (2013.)And watching it in order makes me feel lousy for giving the first one only 3½/5 stars. This disaster, alone, should throw an extra star onto the first chapter. Much like what Jurassic Park III did to either of the first two installments of that series.I have heard that Sam Raimi wanted to remake his first cult hit because in 1987, six-years later, he was allotted a budget he didn't have in the first one. Humph! This part II seemed to have half the budget of the first one, more claymation than Wallace & Gromit and worst of all, replaced ALL scares with slapstick humor. Yes. Not one scene, not one frame, was either scary or eerie or even gross. And Brucey, boy, manof course you're embracing the, by this movie's release, B-Movie status, but come on. Even you are better than this garbage.Oh, and don't get me started on the numerous inconsistencies. Doors break, and are replaced, only to break again. Night seems to last for 15 minutes, the day even less, and then just when you get used to a short calendar day, it fluctuates back and forth between day and night within seconds. This is all the while, sunlight hurts the demonssometimes. And one of the greatest tricks, is the cabin goes from one story to two and back to one within the next shot. Maybe that's so the writers can throw themselves off the balcony before the movie was done.The plot was not found, but I can tell you what I observed: the first six minutes is about 80% of the first movie, so, basically, a fast forwarded recap of innocents going to cabin – A, B: having demonic words read and finally demons coming alive to possess and taunt. Then, just when you get somewhat used to Bruce Campbell – sorta – reprising his role as Ash, or previously, Ashley, running around higher than a Cheech & Chong guest at one of their midday parties, they attempt to throw in the replacements for Ashley's friends from the first movie, only dumber. Hell breaks loose, but at least they may have outs this time to stop the demons surrounding the transforming cabin in the woods.One incredible feat I will credit Evil Dead II for is that, incredibly, it's one minute shorter than number one and feels indubitably four times as long. And we're talking only 84 total minutes!Since, as mentioned, this is now a comedy, not horror. When the single and minutely humorous thing doesn't even make sense – Ashley holds down his severed hand with a copy of ""A Farewell to Arms"" when it's, uh, again, the hand Ashley had to say goodbye to – you got problems. No horror, no suspense, and certainly no comedy in a movie that's ""made"" for all three.Now, I did like the very ending – meaning the final 30-40 seconds, but I had already checked out by that point. For now, since I haven't watched the 2013 remake yet or the third film in order to review, I would just stick with number one. It's a lot better (now) than when I review it last night.",Evil Dead II
42,Pjtaylor-96-138044,More 'splatstick' than scary; it isn't quite as good as the first but it balances its humour and horror expertly.,8,22 February 2018,"More 'splatstick' than scary, the second instalment in the cult franchise cranks up the goofiness but wisely retains the horror, resulting in an entertaining flick from start to finish. My only real hesitations with 'Evil Dead II (1987)' come thanks to the numerous continuity errors that come from its bizarre 'recap' opening (a result of a rights issue, as I understand it). These are especially noticeable when watching the first two 'Evil Dead' films back to back, and almost make this feel like more of a stand-alone than a sequel. Its first few scenes are really rather hard to get through (although they're still well-made) because not only do they undermine the events of the previous movie, they also don't act as an engaging opening due to how rushed and inconsequential they seem. Having said that, after about ten minutes (and some mental gymnastics), the plot starts to act as a proper follow-up to the events of its predecessor and it settles into a proper sense of pace. When all is said and done, this is a really enjoyable picture. Who knew that seeing Bruce Campbell go crazy in a cabin (which this essentially is for its entire first half) could be so genuinely compelling? Though it's ridiculously over-the-top and is intended to provoke chuckles, the piece retains the off-kilter vibe, gore and occasional suspense required to make its silly humour work in its horrific context. Basically, it balances its two core elements incredibly well. While it isn't quite as good as its predecessor (despite its numerous technical improvements), it's still an inventive, ambitious, energetic and thoroughly entertaining experience. 8/10.",Evil Dead II
43,bowmanblue,Hail to the King (baby),10,5 May 2016,"'Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn' – is it a sequel? Is it a remake? The argument rages to this day. However, ultimately, who cares? It's awesome! Well... if you like seeing grown men screaming as they're repeatedly covered in a variety of different-coloured bodily fluids. Luckily, I do.Ignore the original 'Evil Dead' (yes, it was fun – for the time – but this one's head and shoulders over it when it comes to special effects, gore and characters). Whether Part II is a remake or sequel, it basically covers the entire of the first film in the opening ten minutes and then gathers steam from there. It is basically the original 'cabin-in-the-woods-movie.' So many times since we've seen a group of annoyingly-good looking teenagers head out to a cabin in the middle of nowhere, only to meet their end at the hands of something pretty nasty. But, back in Evil Dead/Evil Dead Part II's day – it was actually quite an original prospect – especially when it's done as well as this.Yes, the prospect of people being stuck in a remote location and hunted by someone out of this world isn't that revolutionary, but it's the way it's done here that makes 'Dead by Dawn' a classic. Here the hapless humans are hunted by, not just the undead, but the 'evil' dead. If you're unclear of the difference, the evil dead aren't just your run-of-the-mill zombies, but demons who just look like zombies, but are a hundred times more powerful and are completely insane.If the gore and general craziness of seeing a man fight his own (possessed) hand isn't enough for you to get you to watch this, you have Bruce Campbell as the central character, Ash. After this performance the B-movie world had a new cult hero who has gone on to not just star in the sequel, but countless computer games, comics and most recently a TV show. Basically, Ash is a chump – a stupid, sexist idiot who causes more problems than he actually gets round to solving. He is definitely not your average Hollywood hero – and the film is all the better for it.Ash makes Evil Dead. Evil Dead would just be another horror film without Ask. If you don't believe me – look into the remake of Evil Dead that completely omitted him (and I'm not counting the 'too-little-too-late' cameo at the end of the film). It was rubbish. Or rather it was just another horror film. If you like your horror films, B-movies, or just wise-cracking insane heroes battling even more crazy demons, give this one a go.

I preferred this one to the original, maybe because the story was tighter. The main drawback is the cast, none of whom can act to save their life. There is camp appeal to that though, and as the film never wants to be taken seriously, it allows itself to be zany and take chances out of sheer entertainment.

45,ericstevenson,It's gotten better!,9,3 September 2016,"My favorite movie in the entire series is ""Army Of Darkness"", but it's great to look back at these movies and see how they got better with every single entry. I keep hearing that AOD was the one that was quoted the most, but I'm fairly certain this is the one that's the most well known. It's so funny because I've seen so many brief clips from this movie before. Whether it's Ash's hand hitting himself with the dishes, the final scene, or the laughing furniture, it was just great to see all this stuff put together! Thank you for letting me know more about pop culture! It does have a few flaws in that it is hard to put together with the first film. Of course, I don't care because the end result is so awesome. I am really impressed by the special effects in this. Normally, I don't care for stop motion because it always seems to stick out in a live-action film. This actually did it rather well. I'm not sure if stop motion counts as practical effects. There's a lot of good creativity with the monster designs. It's great to see the series become wackier and bigger as time goes on, all leading up to my favorite entry at the end. I have now seen every movie in the original series. The characters are pretty likable and Ash is as good as ever. It's great to see a horror movie series where the most recurring character is actually the good guy. ***1/2",Evil Dead II

Seriously the storyline like the first movie, is the worst description of a horror movie! I wish the Evil Dead movies didn't exist because, some people I know really liked the films so you kinda have to put with them in saying how great it is.

47,CuriosityKilledShawn,Too similar to the first one.,6,31 October 2000,"Just for the record, this is not a remake, but a sequel. Sam Raimi could not get the rights to re-use scenes from Evil Dead so he re-shot some of them to explain what is going on and how Ash and Linda got to the cabin. But there still is a major sense of deja vu.Ash barricades himself into the cabin after the events in the first film and finds himself going crazy. The furniture starts laughing at him, his reflection talks to him and an evil force is determined to take him over. It manages to possess his hand and so he cuts it off. It starts scuttling around the floor on its own and randomly attacking him. Strangers show up in the hope of finding the Professor, who was staying there, and lock Ash in the cellar. They assume he is responsible for the bloody carnage.People die, people turn into monsters - same old same-old. It's hard to imagine why this is such a cult favorite when it is obviously a badly made movie. Or perhaps Raimi just works the best he can with a low budget (although many times higher than the original) and the shoddy production values are a result of that.He goes over the same ground he did before, except with more resources for gore and mayhem. Very little of this makes sense and none of it is scary. There are a couple of good moments, like when Ash's hand beats him up and when he is chased through the house by the unseen evil force. Campbell is a terrific physical actor and he is a delight to watch, but I doubt whether he understood what on earth he was doing, or why.Having a low budget does not excuse a bad storyline and although this looks more professional than Evil Dead, it still looks like a student film. The best part is the cliff-hanger ending that leads to Army Of Darkness.",Evil Dead II

I gave up on franchise and made terrible mistake. ""Evil Dead II"" is what its name says but also much more than that. At the beginning movie reboots the story from ""The Evil Dead"" and then continues where it left off. Story is painfully stupid and characters make stupidest possible movies in a given situation. But it does not matter at all. There's no introduction or characterization, it's complete madness from the start. The movie is an unstoppable bloody over-the-top action, exaggerated out of all proportion, with a camera that savages all over. Shots that shake and move in all directions, scenes from the first person and a lot of slimy liquids of all colors splashing everywhere. And in the middle of all that Bruce Campbell, whose acting deserves at least nomination for Oscar. The man is damn genius and I can not wait to see him in ""Army of Darkness"" and ""Ash vs Evil Dead"". Without delay, tonight.

This is a non-stop roller coaster ride of thrills, chills, disgusting horror, and amazing visual and special effects. It truly is unlike anything you've ever seen.Sam Raimi is back in the Director's chair and Bruce Campbell is back as Ash - the poor victim of the demonic onslaught. In this film, he deals with much, much more than he can handle - and its wonderful! 'Evil Dead 2' is even more demented than the first film. It is disgusting and gross, with bucket loads of blood and guts. The make-up and effects are mind blowing! Some scenes are downright silly and stupid, yet it works so well within the genre of the film. This is a very unconventional film, after all. There's a scene where lamps and furniture in the house start laughing, and - as insane as it sounds - it truly is a wonderful scene, capturing the very essence of Ash's disturbed mind.As I said with the original 'Evil Dead', these films will not appeal to everyone, so choose your audience wisely if you intend showing these at horror movie nights.

After some time and many fights, a group of strangers arrives there from a secret path that disappeared after their arrival. While the demons continue their attack the group trying to find a method to stop the evil and escapes from the cabin.Since I had already watched the first movie I had high hopes for this movie and I was happily surprised with the outcome. I liked this movie because it remained in the same pattern as the first one and became even more interesting and with the same amount of suspense. As the first movie consisted of a simple and at the same time interesting plot so, did this movie too. Much of suspense, many action scenes and good interpretations made by its cast. Regarding the interpretations, I have to admit that I liked again the interpretation of Bruce Campbell who played as Ashley 'Ash' J. Williams and in my opinion, he was the best in this movie and Denise Bixler who played as Linda. For one more time the direction which was made by Sam Raimi it was amazing combined action and horror scenes with some comic relief moments.In conclusion, I have to say that ""Evil Dead II"" is an interesting movie with a great plot which continues a great way of the first movie. I recommend everyone to watch this sequel because I am sure that you will have a great time watching it and if you have already watched the first movie like me then I believe that you won't be disappointed by it at all. If you haven't watched the first movie then, in my opinion, you should watch the first movie and then the second in order to be prepared and understand what is it all about.",Evil Dead II
55,poe426,No-holds-barred...,8,3 February 2002,"This time around, Sam Raimi throws in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink. It's an odd mix, bloody horror and slapstick humor (see Charlie Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR, in particular the scene where a man is lynched from a lightpost, and you'll understand what I'm getting at here). Not that it can't be done, of course; we've seen it done, and done well, in movies like THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS and YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN and RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, etc.;  but it was more than a little strange to walk into a theater to see the sequel to one of the spookiest shoestring-budget shockers of all time, THE EVIL DEAD, and find oneself laughing one's head off. Money changes everything. Raimi indulges himself (to the point of overindulgence), and yuck follows yick in this no-holds-barred assault on the senses. Although I prefer my horror straight, I'm also able to laugh when the opportunity presents itself, and Raimi kept me laughing throughout this one. EVIL DEAD II: DEAD BY DAWN qualifies as an immensely ENTERTAINING film, but I'm not sure if I'd classify it in any way as a ""horror"" film (in title only, perhaps)...",Evil Dead II
56,Tweetienator,Hail the Groovy Bruce!,9,12 October 2017,"This is the 2nd movie that made Bruce Campbell immortal - as a B-movie actor. And how glad I am that he's back with the delicious Ash vs. Evil Dead that got everything I love regarding the Evil Dead movies: gore, splatter, demons and a good shot of (dark) humor. On top, this is one of the very few movies that really made something worth watching out of Lovecraft's invention/writing the Book of the Dead, the NECRONOMICON. I am still working to evocate my first demon with the help of the Book of the Dead, but maybe I need an edition that is really bound in human skin ;)Sam Raimi directed and produced a lot of movies but imo the best ones are still the two first Evil Dead parts and Army of Darkness.",Evil Dead II
57,BaronBl00d,To Have and Hand Not,4,30 March 2005,"Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is a splashier, dare I say, more sophisticated re-make/sequel of the original Evil Dead. It is not a true sequel as it revisits basically much of what happened in the original but only changing things around. Things are changed around enough; however, to clearly make this a different film and not a true remake. At any rate, this aspect of the film was interesting to me. Now, confessedly I was not a huge fan of the original Evil Dead. I didn't think it was a bad movie nor a real good one either. I do understand why so many people love it, but I admitted then - and now - that this type of material is just not my cinematic cup of tea. Bruce Campbell(again playing Ash) and his girlfriend wend their way over the river and through the woods to some cabin in the remotest part of nowhere - where only weeks before an Archaeologist(something like that) and his wife were staying decoding the book of the dead(Necrominicon(?)). I did like the obvious homage to Lovecraft. Anyway, Campbell arrives, plays a tape revealing the words that wake the evil dead, and his girlfriend quickly dies, only to come back and lose her head, be chainsawed, and dance(through a type of clay-mation) naked in the woods with her headless torso and head in hand. All of this happens in the first ten minutes or so into the film. From there, Campbell begins his one man comedy/horror show. He is about as big a slice of ham you will find. Obviously, more people come - and die - and there is a neat ending to the film which opens for another sequel(Army of Darkness). Campbell breathes some life into this movie creating a frenetically eerie, over-the-top performance of Ash, a man having lost his hand by cutting it off himself still having a sense of humour and seeming to fear nothing(including in his performance). Director Sam Raimi shows us why he became a big league director. He has talent. He still is using a small budget in comparison to what an A-list film would take. You can't tell watching this. Raimi gets the most out of everything(and even more with Campbell). He also creates some innovative camera shots - uses a lot of the same shots from the first Evil Dead - and paces his film with a high energy that will make you jump a lot. That all notwithstanding, I like a little more meat to my story. I like a bit more logic - not just fun. That is why again I will say that Evil Dead 2 is not a bad film, not a great one, but just not my kind of film. I am ecstatic that so many people enjoy mindless violence in rural areas with chainsaws, cleavers, etc...but it's just not me. For me, I just didn't find Evil Dead 2...all that Groovy! I did prefer it though to the original. This one is a bit more fun and doesn't have nearly as much screaming. The best part - hands down - was when Campbell, after having taken his hand off, places a bucket over it to restrain it and then puts a bunch of books on top. The top book was Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms. Now that was clever!",Evil Dead II

59,insomniac_rod,DIABOLICAL entertainment for the wicked!,10,30 August 2005,"""The Exorcist"" made you feel respect and fear to the Devil. Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead II"" makes fun of the Devil and demon possession. Although there are some really scary scenes, there are some really twisted funny situations that would leave you wondering ""what the f*** just happened?!"". The movie is funny for the wrong reasons. I eventually don't laugh about when a man is breaking himself dishes on the head. I don't think it's funny when a man is repeatedly beaten up by grotesque characters. I would never imagine a man getting eaten by a demon locked under a cellar and throwing gallons of blood! ""Evil Dead II"" makes it look hilarious in a wicked kind of way. For example, when Linda's head tells Ash that ""she is being tormented, and suffering in hell; you can feel a little scared but the next scene has a corpse without a head holding a chainsaw. There's no time for logic here, just sit and enjoy!It also has the ability to make you feel tense and I must say, scared. The combination of demon possessed people, EVIL sounds (I love the weird noise in the movie), wicked laughs and chanting (""dead by dawn!""), and intrepid camera angles are the perfect ingredients to make a sui generis Horror-Comedy movie. Watch out for the ""A Farewell to Arms"" joke, the whole situation with the evil hand, and the eye that gets in a woman's mouth!.Sam Raimi went too far for the good reasons. He created an unbelievable and unforgettable work that has served as inspiration for many movies in recent years. The movie is easily one of the most visually stunning Horror movies of all time, for sure. Die hard fans of gore get an eye candy for an hour and a half. Raimi created a cult movie in all the sense of the world. ""Groovy!"". ""Dead by Dawn"" will never bore you because in every scene there's a feeling of uncertainty and that makes it even more interesting. There are no rules here. The plot is as scary as you can imagine but it's held in such a way that it isn't taken very seriously. I mean, demon possession caused by the Necronomicon is something that happens in the real world. Not exactly with that book but it can happen via satanic books and rituals. Raimi takes it to a different level of humor mixed with gore. Bruce Campbell deserves a special mention. He delivers a wicked, solid, and totally believable performance. Something you haven't seen before mainly because of the strange situations he goes through. His performance could be described as a ""solo"". Easily, one of the best performances of any actor in a Horror movie. Also, one of the characters that suffers the most in any movie! Ash is beaten up by demons, humans, objects, etc. Even possessed creatures make fun of him. The gore here is great, glorious. You get decaps, mutilated bodies, a hand cut off, bleeding demons, etc. Blood spread all over the cabin is the common denominator. One of the goriest movies of all time. Watch ""Evil Dead II"" to witness one of the most creative, brave, and goriest movies of all time. It delivers something for everyone. It has action, gore, spectacular camera angles, and some action! Check out Ash V.S. possessed Henrietta. * After it, phrases like ""join us!"", ""swallow this!"", and specially ""groovy!"" will be part of your daily vocabulary. Recommended for every Horror fan in the world. This movie is an obligation to watch.",Evil Dead II

61,Anonymous_Maxine,"Evil Dead, too!",10,5 May 2008,"I have no interest in involving myself in the pointless debate about whether Evil Dead II is a sequel or a remake. It really doesn't matter, there's an argument for both sides and so the endless debates will, of course, go nowhere. What is not up for debate is that the movie begins with a recap of what happened in the first film, and then there is another group that heads out to the woods to spend a weekend in the creepy cabin in the woods. They discover a recording of a man studying the Necronomicon, The Book of the Dead (also found in the cabin), which included incantations that bring forth all manner of bad things.Soon the movie becomes strikingly similar to the original, resulting I suppose in the controversy about whether it's a remake or a sequel. Personally, it feels like a rethinking of the first movie, where certain ideas and effects are fleshed out in ways that the financial constraints of the original film wouldn't allow, as well as a beefing up of the significant comic relief. Indeed, for all it's blood and gore and self-mutilations and animated severed limbs, this is one of the funniest horror films I've ever seen.One thing that is shown in part II is a visual presentation of the evil force in the woods, which is sadly a disappointing attempt to add more complex special effects into the movie, but the majority of the film will be remembered as Ash's truly classic battle with the evil force in the cabin, which ultimately starts to take over his own body, but he is able to stop it by cutting off his own possessed hand. Love it or hate it, this stuff has never been done in a horror movie before, and that's not the only genuinely original thing. Even furniture becomes possessed and laughs hysterically at Ash, and we laugh along with them. This is about as fun as gore films can get! I think that one of the best things about the original film was its meager budget, but the best thing about the trilogy as a whole is that it is a horror film that is intended almost exclusively for horror fans. Bring a date to watch this movie and I'm willing to bet that you will find yourself lonely in a hurry. Evil Dead II is packed with horror thoughts and ideas that seem to have come out of nowhere, they are so over the top and unique. Ash is attacked by a severed head, a headless body, and his own severed hand in the movie, along with countless other beasties, and the effect, due in no small part to his hilarious reactions, is horror entertainment of the highest order.Of course, the budget is bigger now, but Raimi was able to take more money and still retain the same feel of the original film, except that he was able to give us more detail and use more effects this time around, but definitely without selling out. Whether he did this later in his career is up for debate, but in the first sequel in the Evil Dead trilogy, it almost seems like he took more money from bankrollers who expected a more accessible horror film and then tricked them, giving us a movie that is still intended for the original fans.Raimi soon moved away from the gritty horror genre with more accessible films, like The Quick and the Dead and the astonishingly brilliant A Simple Plan, before moving into mainstream Hollywood with the Spiderman movies, but it is the simplicity of the Evil Dead films that his fans will always remember with the most fondness. It is telling that the Spiderman juggernaut is known, among fans, and being directed by the guy who made the Evil Dead films, and not the other way around. Peter Jackson, on the other hand, will always be associated with the Lord of the Rings films, while his own early horror films are all but forgotten. For horror fans, there are not many truer films than the Evil Dead series",Evil Dead II
62,videorama-759-859391,I love this kind of evil,8,12 June 2014,"These are one of those sequels you like so much, you choose it over it's predecessor. Evil Dead 2 is like one terrifying ride, you don't really wanna get off, where special effects, whizzing camera shots and angles rule which are used exuberantly. It's ongoing, that flying human eye which Campbell nearly swallows, which wouldn't go down too well, I always remember. These are the reasons is why this movie is so much fun. BC, a Raimi favorite, the lone survivor of the first, returns with his sweetheart back to the scene of the crime, so to speak, where all those demon forces and evil spirits are long gone, we hope. By example here, sometimes hope doesn't work, where so begins another frenetic and maddening and unreal experience, where soon Campbell's the only one to carry it off, and in that case, it's a blessing as through the business of the role, his crazed, and chaotic self can also bring humor to his performances. BC is one of those bloody good but underused actors, where here re really see what he can make out of a role. If opting to choose an Evil Dead to watch (we won't mention Army Of Darkness cause that's crap) I would of already picked this one, without second thoughts. It's one thorough and exhilarating roller coaster of horror. Poor Campbell, he's reliving a mayhem of hell, left to fix up this madness, his work cut out for him, all cause that other couple opened the bloody cursed book again, with it's human skinned pages of flesh That hairy, crossing broken bridge shot, was awesome.",Evil Dead II
63,gwnightscream,Good 80's Horror!,7,11 March 2012,"Bruce Campbell, Denise Bixler and Sarah Berry star in Sam Raimi's 1987 horror sequel. This is more of a retelling with Ash Williams (Campbell) and his girlfriend, Linda (Bixler) heading to a cabin in the woods for the weekend. Ash finds a tape recorder and an ancient book, the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis aka Book of the Dead. Ash listens to the tape translating the book and Linda gets possessed by demonic forces. Ash fights Linda and dismembers her because it's the only solution. Soon, we meet woman, Annie (Berry) who is trying to find her father's cabin where Ash is currently staying. She seeks help from a group of people for directions and they head to the cabin. They eventually meet Ash thinking he's crazy, but realize he's not. Ash also gets possessed for a short time, but snaps out of it helping them. Their only other help is a couple missing pages from the book to rid the evil forces. Bruce is great as usual and the film is a highlight of K.N.B. make-up artists, Robert Kurtzman, Greg Nicotero & Howard Berger with the help from special effects artist, Mark Shostrom. Raimi also uses slapstick humor in it and the next film inspired by his love of ""The Three Stooges"" and his brother, Ted is also featured as Possessed Henrietta.

65,Polaris_DiB,ADD horror comedy,6,18 August 2008,"Ironically enough, I saw Army of Darkness before seeing this one. It's weird, but I don't actually like Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness quite as much as Evil Dead, and not nearly as much as most other people seem to do. I'm no stranger to camp cult classics, but Sam Raimi's particular brand of over-the-top pleasure always involves a sort of forcefulness, a kind of shouting, of the dialog and actions so that everything seems so frantic all of the time. Evil Dead still had this type of humor, but relaxed it and let it flow a bit... this movie pretty much shows off the scenes Raimi was interested in and which ones he just put in there for the story to connect. The beginning shoots by without a breath... the ending drags... some scenes or jokes are emphasized beyond their range, and other stuff is just shown and thrown away before the audience has time to really grasp it.However, Evil Dead 2 is much stronger than Army of Darkness, mostly from its physical comedy. Ash's wrestling with his own hand is some pretty genius stuff, and the scene where the entire house becomes animated, starting with a deer's bust, is pretty much one of the most trippy and bizarre scenes I've seen in cinema--the type of thing that would have scared the crap out of me if the silliness of the rest of the movie hadn't bracketed it in.I think the intention behind Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness was good, but I think Raimi could have stood to pace it down a bit and put less emphasis on being frenetic and hyperactive. If it wasn't for the fact that obviously these two movies took a lot of work (especially with the stop-motion animation and other special effects), I'd assume Raimi was having a prolonged bout of ADD during the filming of them.--PolarisDiB",Evil Dead II
66,dee.reid,"More ""Evil"" than the first; bloody fantastic!",10,27 September 2005,"I didn't think it was possible, but ""Evil Dead II"" surpasses the  original in nearly every way. It's scary, it's gory and lastly, it's  hilarious. It's pure, inspired comic mayhem and madness for 80  minutes straight! It's no secret director Sam Raimi loves to torment  star Bruce Campbell, putting him through the most grueling experience  an actor should ever go through. Essentially, it's a sequel/remake of  the first film, and Ash (Campbell) is once again battling the forces of  the dead, which have been resurrected by the reading of passages from  the dreaded ""Book of the Dead."" But unlike the first movie, the ""Three  Stooges""-type humor is rampant and outright, and it makes this entry  deserving.

Little more than a one man show, Evil Dead 2 is where Bruce Campbell really made his name, and deservedly so. Whether he's shrieking like a little girl at the sight of a poorly-animated headless marionette, cackling deviously as he nails down his own evil right hand or playing it cool as the gritty, badass soldier-man with a chainsaw appendage, Campbell boldly plants his flag right in the center of every scene. I can't begin to imagine the kind of fun he and director Sam Raimi must have had cooking up one outlandish, unbelievable situation after the other, then playing it up on-screen to this degree. It's a film you'll never quite nail down - is it meant to be serious or slapstick - and that's precisely why it works so well. A load of fun that escalates faster than you can blink.",Evil Dead II
69,MBunge,The essence of Raimi,8,16 September 2010,"All artists change over time. Their evolution reflects their own personal growth, the development of their skills and the different influences that pass through their lives. If an artist is lucky, they'll produce a work that is uniquely their own. Something that embodies the purity of their own thought and feeling, without being too constricted by external forces or degenerately self indulgent. Evil Dead II is Sam Raimi's unique contribution to the common aesthetic.I realize that seems a bit pretentious when focused on a horror movie where a corpse dances, a man cuts off his demon-infested hand and a woman swallows a witch's eyeballbut it's true. Evil Dead II is the most honest, purest expression of his own vision. It's the thing that from start to finish, only Raimi could have made. The fact that it's a remake is what's so unusual.Evil Dead II isn't a sequel to Evil Dead, it's a retelling of the same story but freed from the expectations of others. Both films tell the story of a group of people in an isolated cabin with the infamous Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead. Both films feature unclean spirits summoned back into the world by words played from a tape machine. Both movies even feature a young woman who runs into the haunted woods and is molested by devilish shrubbery and the main character in both is a young man named Ash (Bruce Campbell). But there is a profound difference between the two films.Evil Dead has a great many startling and bizarre elements to it, but it is essentially a conventional horror movie. When he made it, Raimi was making what other people had told him made a movie a horror movie. It has the same dynamic and the same essential nature as other horror movies. When he made Evil Dead II, Raimi made what he thought a horror movie should be. And what Raimi thought a horror movie should be is Man facing terrifying eviland surpassing it.Evil Dead II embraces the idea that the grotesque is both frightening and silly. That the proper response to the most extreme situations, circumstances where reality itself is out to get youwould look goofy. Raimi's vision was that terror taken to the otherworldly limit would be not even a hair's breadth away from silly. That's what makes Ash one of the great characters in film. Unlike others in horror films, who represent the audience desperately clinging to the real and the safe, Ash is confronted with the outrageous and the insane and he's right there with it all, step for step and crazed laugh for crazed laugh. Oh, he's frightened and he's frantic and he's jumping at shadows. But Ash doesn't reject the horror before and around him. He dives into it. He fights with it, not against it. What Ash represents is the idea that the indescribable nightmare out there isn't really ""out"" there. We're part of it and it is in acknowledging and accepting that, we can defeat it. What defines Evil Dead II are those moments where Ash is even more inhuman than the hellish monsters in those dark woods.By the time he did the third film in the series, Army of Darkness, Raimi had lost his purity of vision. There are only moments of the film that are at all scary. Ash become a figure of comedy in a world of laughably over-the-top creatures and situations. If Evil Dead was Raimi making what other people thought a horror movie was, Army of Darkness is Raimi making what other people thought a Sam Raimi movie was. It has all of the style but none of the heart.Which isn't to say it's a bad film. All three are enjoyable on their own merits, like many of Raimi's other works. Evil Dead II stands out, though, because it wasn't made by Sam Raimi. It is Sam Raimi.",Evil Dead II
70,barnabyrudge,"Sequel to Evil Dead opts for laughs - ""slapstick gore"" as its has been labelled. Give me the original any time!",4,29 May 2013,"As a trilogy, Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series doesn't really weigh up. The first film is an ultra low-budget – but quite suspensefully made – gore film, containing many genuinely unnerving moments thanks to its clever camera work and editing. The second and third films in the series change the tone and style completely, aiming instead for a cartoonishly over-the-top comedy feel – 'slapstick gore' as it has been described in some circles, reminiscent of a Three Stooges movie except that it's full of dismemberment and other such bloody delights. If you're after a serious, genuinely scary style of film, then Part One is the one to watch. If you're after something spectacularly bloody yet simultaneously humorous, then numbers 2 and 3 fit the bill. For me, the original Evil Dead is a quintessential master-class in low budget horror-making skillful, tight, often very frightening. This sequel doesn't really work, showing too much affinity for its madcap gore and monsters. Evil Dead II has a much larger cult following than its predecessor but, at risk of upsetting this army of loyal fans, I'm going to stick my neck out and admit I really don't like it.Survivor of the original film Ash (Bruce Campbell) is unable to escape from the woodland cabin where he so recently endured the mother of all bad nights. Trapped for yet another evening, he prepares himself to endure more freakish horrors as the light begins to fade. He is joined by four outsiders – Annie (Sarah Berry), whose parents originally unleashed the demons in the cabin whilst researching the Book of the Dead; Ed (Richard Domeier), a professor who is also Annie's research partner and boyfriend; Jake (Dan Hicks), a white-trash handyman; and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva), Jake's air-headed trailer-trash girlfriend. The five inhabitants of the cabin are left to endure various spooky events, bloodthirsty demon attacks, bodily possessions/invasions, and so on and so forth, before they finally figure out a way to send the demons back from whence they came.Raimi's bigger budget proves a curse rather than a blessing here. He doesn't need to build up to the shock moments slowly and carefully this time around. If he requires an elaborate monster to pop up suddenly, then that is just what happens if he needs gallons of blood and bile to gush forth rather than a mere trickle, then gallons is what he gets. The unfortunate thing is that the original worked so well because Raimi had figured out that often less can be more – his slow and skillful build-ups created real intensity. That philosophy is completely dismissed here, as Raimi opts to throw a non-stop barrage of gross and gooey carnage at the viewer right from the start. There's still a degree of inventiveness on show, especially in the scene where Ash has to sever his own hand after it becomes possessed. The sight of his uncontrollable 'demon hand' smashing plates over his head and trying to gouge at his own face, not to mention dragging his unconscious body across the floor, is rather funny. Sadly, in other parts of the film much of the humour over-shoots the mark, coming across as 'frantic' and 'hysterical' rather than genuinely funny. The acting is pretty terrible all-round. Campbell has a goofy self-confidence which enables him to nearly get away with it but the others simply look inept, their hopelessly amateurish efforts serving only to damage the film further. Evil Dead II will undoubtedly appeal to some, with its penchant for bad taste comedy and breakneck slapstick carnage. However, if its outlandish sense of humour is not to your taste, you may find this a very long 84 minutes indeed.",Evil Dead II
71,NateWatchesCoolMovies,simply the best,10,4 December 2016,"Sam Raimi's Evil Dead 2 is similar to Robert Rodriguez's Desperado in the sense that it takes what was already there, in this case Evil Dead, and tells the same story once again, simply smoothing out edges, ramping up certain areas, using more money than it had before and generally giving the story a tune up. It also gets quite a bit funnier than Evil Dead, which although schlocky was pretty much outright horror. The sequel emphasizes comedy far more, and is the more definitive of the two in terms of the franchise's legacy. The story is more or less the same: Ash (the eternal Bruce Campbell) and a group of friends venture to that creepy, archetypal cabin in the woods and foolishly set loose a rambunctious horde of unholy demons, zombies, cackling fiends, rapey trees and a mountable deer head with a disconcerting case of the giggles. This marks the first time Ash donned his now iconic chainsaw hand and picked up that ol' boom stick to give the nasties a good whupping. And whup he does, like the smooth talking badass that he is. I love the aesthetic in these films; the monsters all have a devilishly mischievous attitude that provides endless laughs, always trolling, taunting and teasing the poor victims. Nothing beats the sight of Ash's severed hand flipping him off before it scuttles off into the corner like an angry facehugger. That's one key element which the 2013 remake ditched: I liked what they did in terms of special effects, but the pissy humour wasn't there, the decayed, sarcastic ADHD madness that I came to love so much was replaced by something far too grim and somber. Bad move. No, kids, this is the ultimate Evil Dead flick, the most complete and entertaining entry into a franchise that has influenced every facet of the horror genre for decades. Ash is now a household name, a beloved halloween costume, a celebrated pillar of pop culture and still one of the most enjoyable protagonist's to spend time with, as we now get to see with Starz's terrific Ash Vs. Evil Dead. The original Evil Dead spawned it all, but this baby turned the dial up past eleven, tossed on the buckets of gore and has more than earned it's place both in our hearts, and horror infamy.",Evil Dead II

73,kluseba,A horrible lack of ideas and originality,1,24 October 2010,"One friend of mine, who was normally likes movies that I like, absolutely wanted to show me this movie and said that it would be a funny and very gore horror movie that wouldn't not take itself serious at all. My friend had presented me ""Shaun of the dead"" and I liked the mixture of horror and comedy in this movie. I also like ""Scary movie"" and ""Final destination"", horror movies that go into a funny and ridiculous direction. I even saw movies from the legendary Ed Wood such as ""Bride of the monster"" or ""Plan 9 from outer space"" and I thought that they were trashy, but very charming and atmospheric somehow. I think that I can consider myself as an open-minded person that finds this genre of horror comedy at least interesting.I am really sorry to say this, but this movie is just complete rubbish. I know that this movie wants to joke about serious horror movies but after the first two or three sketches and the first ten minutes of surprising absurdity of this film, the whole thing is just not funny any more and you are waiting that there is some development, something original, something crazy to come, but that isn't the case. The childish jokes are repeated within the eighty minutes of the movie and become really annoying. The acting is particularly bad, the substance of ideas is running low, the dialogs are more than awful, there is nothing shocking or surprising, there are many mistakes in the movie and I could continue this list eternally. I know that those were the intentions of the director, but it is too much of everything and just not funny or entertaining anymore after ten minutes. All the movies that I have mentioned in my introduction are more original and funnier than this piece of garbage. I really tried to laugh, to put myself on a very low and childish level and took some beers during the film in the hope that it would help, but it didn't. It just helped me to almost fall asleep during this so-called cult movie but as I wanted to watch this completely and until the very end, I continued to torture myself. The only other horror movie that I know that is as awful as this one is Rob Zombie's ""House of thousand corpses"".Even if some people find this ""cult"" movie funny and entertaining with its charming trash, I think that this stuff doesn't deserve such a high rating at all, when the other films that I mentioned are mostly rated about at least two points below this movie.",Evil Dead II

Later I watched Bruce Campbell's explanation on Youtube and couldn't believe how ridiculous the whole story is ( they couldn't get the rights to their own movie LMAO). Anyway, I liked the first one more because it was more serious and scarier for me. That one guy who threw pages was so annoying. Once again great music, effects, make up and all the other things.",Evil Dead II
76,slokes,Bloody Good Time,8,1 November 2012,"""Evil Dead II"" is a gory horror movie for people who don't like gory horror movies. That's not entirely true, as some splatter-film aficionados love it, too, though others protest the Three Stooges-style comedy that predominates after the ten-minute mark. For me, it's a marvel of story-telling economy, suspense, and sustained momentum that manages to be really funny, funny enough that you don't know whether to laugh or scream when director Sam Raimi uncorks his next surprise. Which is a large part of the fun.Amorous Ash (Bruce Campbell) takes his girlfriend to a cabin deep in the woods. Unfortunately, the cabin was occupied previously by a professor studying the Necronomicon, a book of ancient and dangerous lore. Soon all sorts of terrors are forcing their way into Ash's world, chanting ""Things that were shall be again!"" and turning the cabin into a blood soaked shambles. Ash works single-handed, first figuratively, then literally, to stop the ghoulish invasion.Blending comedy and horror was old hat when Boris Karloff was introduced to Elsa Lanchester in ""Bride Of Frankenstein."" But the two genres were never commingled so directly until ""Evil Dead 2."" Nor, before ED2, did you get much comedy in gore sequences. ""Evil Dead II"" would seem an unlikely place to introduce this concept, as it is the ostensible sequel to a movie that was grimly serious about much of the same situation.Is ""Evil Dead II"" a true sequel? Technically, yes, though tonally it plays very different. The key to that is Campbell, who reprises Ash from the prior film but plays him here with an array of silly faces and mouth-agape stunts that would have impressed Buster Keaton. His firm jaw and big teeth are played for magnificently kooky effect whenever there's an opportunity for blood splattering, grinning insanely as he takes a chainsaw to his lover's head or his own wrist.""That's right...who's laughing now!""Well, you are, most of the time. The violence is often shocking, but never in an ugly way, things always progressing in cartoon-like fashion. Raimi keeps the camera in motion for episodes of thrilling humor, like one sequence early on when the lens chases Ash through every room of the cabin, with doors whipping and crashing so fast you never see the joins necessary to make it play on screen. ""Evil Dead II"" was made on the cheap, it even looks cheap at times, but it never plays cheap. The film does have weaknesses. There are substandard performances by the supporting cast or a woolly ending that leaves things up in the air (for a sequel that would wind up being a mild disappointment). None of that diminishes the energy rush one gets watching a film that is as unrelentingly clever as ""Evil Dead II"", so clever it actually gets funnier, if not scarier, with multiple viewings. It's a wonderfully twisted example of the magic of cinema.",Evil Dead II
77,fertilecelluloid,"Slicker and tighter remake of the first ""Evil Dead""",8,20 October 2006,"Bruce Campbell returns as the manic ""Ash"" and fights the things in the cellar all over again. This time, however, he's brought some weapons, a maniac's laugh, and lots of colorful insults. Funded by Dino De Laurentis after the original's surprise success on video (it fared OK at the cinema), it has a marginally larger budget and some clever and bloody set pieces. Slicker and tighter than the first ""Evil Dead"", it is virtually a remake. Though it is still nudity-averse, it is more entertaining than the original and dispenses with that that film's cheesy character work. Campbell establishes Ash as a silver screen anti-hero and carries the entire movie on his able shoulders. After all these years still a classic.",Evil Dead II
78,dworldeater,My favorite of the trilogy,10,2 December 2012,"Evil Dead 2 is the best in the series for me as it has the best combined elements of the original as well as Army Of Darkness. The pace is quicker , the overall quality of the pictures is better as the budget is bigger and Bruce Campbell has matured as an actor and had more experience acting between Evil Dead 1 and 2 . There are more elaborate f/x and visually the film looks better across the board. There also is the introduction of splatstick comedy but stays on target with the horror by maintaining an unsettling , brooding atmosphere . Lots of splatter and gore and a great blend of horror and comedy . I love all 3 Evil Dead films , but Dead By Dawn is my personal fave. As well as one of my favorite tracks from the 1st Deicide album.",Evil Dead II
79,Witchfinder-General-666,"Ash Returns... With Gore, Guts and Morbid Fun",9,16 February 2009,"Sam Raimi's low-budget masterpiece ""The Evil Dead"" of 1981 was an absolutely astonishing film in all regards, and without any doubt one of the most terrifying, creepiest, most suspenseful and simply greatest Horror films ever brought to screen. The second entry to Raimi's wonderful ""Evil Dead"" franchise, ""Evil Dead II"" of 1987 is not so much a sequel, but rather a remake of the first film, this time with a higher budget, more complex special effects, and a strong focus on Comedy elements. Many people actually seem to prefer the sequel over the original, as it got a higher rating here on IMDb. While this sequel is doubtlessly a great film of its own right, I will personally always prefer the 1981 original, a personal all-time favorite of mine which is simply unrivaled in its creepiness and its status as an absolute Horror/Gore milestone. The sequel once again takes Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend on a trip deep into the woods, where the residents of a small cabin are one by one possessed by evil forces after playing a mysterious tape... The plot is basically the same as that of the original, only that, this time, the film is a very morbid black Horror Comedy rather than a terrifying Horror film like the first one. The original ""Evil Dead"" was basically the epitome of Horror, and while it also had some humorous moments, the humor was only present in small doses, and it never lessened the film's constant terrifying suspense. The sequel still has its creepy moments, of course, but in this film, the Comedy elements are predominant. The film is, once again, extremely gory, but even the gore is funny and goes more into the direction of Gore-comedies than of the terrifying original. While ""Evil Dead II"" may not be quite as scary as its predecessor (it's still suspenseful though), its humor should appeal to the tastes of the fans of the original - in short: it's the most morbid kind of black humor imaginable, just delightfully demented from the beginning. The film also introduces a bunch of new characters, including a stupid redneck named Jake. The original had turned Bruce Campbell into one of the most popular Horror/B-Movie stars ever, and he is once again great when he reprises the role of his life, Ash, in this sequel. The film's higher budget allows more complex special effects, great makeup and a spectacular cinematography. Yet, as said above, I will always prefer the original, which stands out as of the greatest Horror films ever and the ideal proof that a relatively low budget can result in an absolutely amazing film. Even so, ""Evil Dead II"" is a great film, and an absolute must-see for all Horror fans and lovers of morbid humor. Enjoy!",Evil Dead II
80,TOMNEL,"Like the first, this has next to no plot., but it's one of the funnest movies I've ever seen.",9,5 June 2008,"The ""Evil Dead"" trilogy stays about the same each film in quality and entertainment, but as they go on each one is more silly than the last in seems. The first ""Evil Dead"" was funny in a morbid way. It had some very dark humor, and was more of a horror film than a comedy. This movie has many horror elements to it, including several jump scenes and a very creepy atmosphere, but this a comedy. People who take this as a horror movie will probably be disappointed, but most people it seems in the first few minutes will figure out that this is meant to be funny, not scary.To (sort of) retell what happened in the first film, the first 10 minutes of the film show a different but similar story as the first movie, including leaving off exactly where that one did. Ash (Bruce Campbell) is stuck in the woods in a cabin haunted with ""Deadite"" demons that possessed his girlfriend and caused him to dispose of her. The demons are brought to life through a professor's recording of the Book of the Dead, and the professor's and a few others end up in the cabin with Ash. Blood, guts and hilarity ensues.Some say this is a remake of the original, and it's not, though it is similar to the first. Both take place in the cabin, though this one obviously takes place right after the first. Where most sequels pale in comparison to the originals, this one was even better than the first. The special effects were amazing. The over the top direction and acting were hilarious, including one scene where a moose head in the cabin begins to laugh and it's obviously infectious because soon the whole cabin including Ash in uproariously laughing. Weird and funny creatures are around every corner, as are the one liners from Bruce Campbell that go with them. There's little plot, but that's a good thing here so we get to see more creatures. One problem in this is the ending. It's a great, though bizarre cliffhanger, so make sure to have a copy of ""Army of Darkness"" to pop in right after to pick up where this leaves off.Overall, this is a hilarious, sort of scary comedy/horror film that takes from many genres making it an extremely fresh film. It's probably the best of the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 80 mins. R for violence.",Evil Dead II
81,aidanratesmovies,"Ridiculous, but fun",7,31 March 2020,"Ridiculously campy, stupid, yet amusing, Evil Dead II is an improvement over the original, even if it's hard to take it seriously. The film features, yet again, a stellar performance from Bruce Campbell, although this time it's simply because of how campy he is in it. Without him, the film would be sure to fail, and Campbell totally encaptures the insanity that is this films script. In short, the film doesn't make a lot of sense. One of my biggest gripes with it, is the fact that it has almost no continuation at all from the original, as if the first film never even happened. Instead we are greeted to a few minutes of what is semi-like what happened in the original flick, and then absolute madness and mayhem. Never fret though, because as dull as the original may have been throughout its dragged out corpse of a runtime, Evil Dead II is able to capture that same runtime with much more entertaining results. The results are bonkers, but its makes for a funny and by far amusing time, even if it does provide for some cringe-like moments. In the end, Evil Dead II is by far not perfect, but an enjoyable horror-comedy romp that is far more entertaining, and thus more impressive than its predecessor.
My Rating: 7.5/10",Evil Dead II
82,a_chinn,Sequel/Remake ups the comedy and makes a hilarious and scary cabin-in-the-woods classic,9,28 June 2020,"Picking up right after the event of the first film, following a quick recap using new footage since the filmmakers couldn't use footage from the first film, ""Evil Dead 2"" the picks up with a new group of disparate characters trapped in a cabin in the woods that's under attack by the titular deadites and hope to survive the night with the lone survivor of the first film, Ash Williams. Although the film is a continuation, the story is essentially a remake of the first film, but with a bigger budget, better special effects, and better actors. The key players return for the sequel, notably director/co-writer Sam Raimi and lead actor Bruce Campbell as Ash, both much more polished at this point in their careers. Filmed seven years after the original, Raimi had directed the bigger budgeted Coen Brother scripted comedy ""Crimewave"" and Campbell had three films under his belt (including an appearance in ""Crimewave""). Two other talented folks who joined the sequel. One was cinematographer Peter Deming, his first film, who'd go on to become Raimi's regular DP as well as going on to shoot major films such as ""Twin Peaks"", ""Mulholland Drive"", and ""From Hell"". The other major addition this sequel was special effects artists Howard Berger, Robert Kurtzman, and Greg Nicotero, who following their work on ""Evil Dead 2"" formed KNB EFX, who have done everything from ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" to ""The Walking Dead"" to ""Reservoir Dogs"" to ""Misery"". Beyond the film being superior to the original on a technical level, it's much funnier far more clever than the original. The dancing stop motion skeleton doing a Fred Astaire-like dance, Ash doing battle with his own severed hand, or this hilarious ending that sets things up for a wonderfully absurd sequel all make this film a very cheeky take on horror film tropes. Campbell really ups his comedy chops for this sequel, particularly when it comes to some very funny slapstick bits involving his hand ""turning bad"" and his mock heroic moments (which he'd go one to perfect in the third film in the series). The practical special effects and the complete absences of CGI offers old school horror fans a lot of nostalgia and retro charm as well, particularly director Sam Raimi's brother, Ted Raimi, as the Possessed Henrietta in the torn hag suit. Those are the parts everyone remembers about ""Evil Dead II"" but the sexy tobacco chewing Bobby Joe, played by Kassie Wesley, is a lot of fun, as is her hillbilly boyfriend Jake, played by Dan Hicks. Interestingly, Bobby Joe was inspired by Holly Hunter, who was a roommate of Raimi in the 80s along with Joel Coen and Frances McDormand. He wrote the part for Hunter, but producers overruled him and wanted someone ""sexier"". Overall, ""Evil Dead II"" is a classic. It's more openly comedic than the first film, but still manages to be scary and is a rollercoaster of fun, even if it is absolute fluff. FUN FACT! When Kurt Russell first met Bruce Campbell on the set of ""Escape from L.A."" the first think he said to Bruce was, ""Say 'work shed'"".",Evil Dead II
83,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Great Follow-up to a Low Budget Classic,10,30 May 2019,"This follow-up to the low budget masterpiece brings more comedy to add to the horror. The mythology of The Evil Dead also grows. I got the chance to check this film out in the theater for my most recent viewing to revise this review. The official synopsis of this film is the lone survivor of an onslaught of flesh-possessing spirits holes up in a cabin with a group of strangers while the demons continue their attack.Now I know there is a lot of speculation about this film. My interpretation of it is that since they could not get the rights to use footage from the original film, they just decided to give us a recap sans Ash's (Bruce Campbell) sister and the other couple from the original film. This one just has him and his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) going to the cabin. Everything that happens the morning after the original night is the beginning of this film technically. It does violate continuity and after this last viewing it actually bothered me more. Example is the Necronomicon is burned at the end of the first film, so it really shouldn't be here.I do happen to love that the film then starts to build on the mythology from the Necronomicon and the demons. I originally thought that the new part that the demons die by dawn was violating continuity, but after viewing this it doesn't. I like the concept that they are bound to the darkness. The one question I have here though would do the words that bring them to life need to be spoken each night or would have come back when the dark does every time. Ash plays the words the first night he gets there, but we know that they were spoken when the professor was there with his wife. I do just think that that was the film showing us that, but they would have come regardless.For the story of this film, there are some issues I have that came from the original one. Like what constitutes some people to get possessed and others that don't, but I do feel that this one is a little bit better about it. I also like that this one builds on the story with bringing more pages of the Necronomicon so they can actually have a shot at defeating the evil that is after them. As stated, this one actually is conscious of the comedy and definitely uses it to its advantage. I actually think it adds something to the film since Ash has his moments where he is descending into madness and the comedy actually makes it that much more real. There is some slapstick during the fight scenes with the Deadites, but I don't think that hurts the film at all.Now the editing of the film is good. The film builds tension throughout. It introduces things around the midway point that makes you wonder if anyone will make it out alive and at the climax it does all come to a head. I thought the film ends in a solid way, building to the next film. I love how it actually plays out in the end.The acting in this film is much better than the previous one. We get more from Campbell as he starts to become the Ash that we know and love. You can tell that from the original to this one he is honing his craft. I thought Sarah Berry as the professor's daughter was good. She is cute, but believable as an archeologist. Dan Hicks and Kassie Wesley DePaiva were great as the redneck couple. It is crazy because DePaiva is also really pretty, but has enough country to be believable in the role. I also have to give a shout-out to Ted Raimi, younger brother of writer and director Sam Raimi. Ted appears as Possessed Henrietta and the suit he wore made him sweat enough to fill buckets. Plus the contacts when they were in you couldn't see out of them. He is one of the scariest parts of the movie and it was great.Effects of the film were really good as well. This film had more of a budget, but they stuck with the practical effects. Part of that was probably the time the film came out, but I thought they were still great. The blood looked good. I thought it was interesting that they changed the color of it sometimes to prevent an X rating, but I think it works, especially when it comes to someone who is possessed. Now I will say there are some things with possessed Linda that don't look great. It doesn't ruin the film, but I noticed them. This also applies for Possessed Henrietta and other Deadites at the end of the film.The sound design of the film was good also. The score definitely helps to enhance the scenes by building the tension. I also thought the voices of those that are possessed were good. It comes off as creepy and even after a few viewings of the film makes me feel uneasy. The haunting melody that Ash plays in the beginning of the film recurs a couple of times and I thought it fit for what they needed. That is definitely something that is a positive for the film.Now with that said, this film is great. I love that this is a sequel, but it actually took what made the first one great and added on it. I still prefer the original to it, but this one deserves to be in the conversation. This one adds comedy, yet it doesn't hurt the film. I thought the acting was much better. The story is good and the editing help to build the tension needed to a satisfying climax. I do have some issues with violating the continuity though. The effects were great aside some issues with the movements of a character. Sound design was also really good as well. I would definitely recommend giving this film a viewing as I feel it is a great sequel to a horror classic.",Evil Dead II
84,Backlash007,"""Come to sweet Henrietta!""",10,21 September 2001,"Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn is the sequel to the ultimate experience in grueling terror. Evil Dead II is the definitive cult flick and perhaps my favorite horror film (top five at least). Bruce Campbell takes on the role of Ash once again in this hilariously horrific sequel to a legendary movie. Few sequels live up to the original and fewer still surpass it. This is one of those rare instances. This movie is out of this world. Sam Raimi is a genius with a camera and has gone on to create some damn fine films. He deserves every amount of success he has gained. The script is inventive, highly original, and funny as all hell. It's a mix of horror, laughs, and gore; or splatstick as Campbell calls it. Once again, Campbell's facial expressions alone are worth the price of admission. If that doesn't get you the laughing deer head will. Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn is a true horror masterpiece. A completely original concept, some screwy camera angles, and one Bruce Campbell make for an entertaining combination.

87,nycritic,Fantastic Lunacy!,10,6 March 2005,"While the original EVIL DEAD was genuinely a horror film, this one went completely the opposite direction and decided to amp up the gore factor to make it basically a demented cartoon show. EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN is really a re-telling of the same events from the first story, but in this case, only Ash and Linda (Bruce Campbell and Denise Bexler) come to the cabin and less than 10 minutes into the movie he has played a recording from a professor who mouths the infamous lines from the Necronomicon and unwittingly brought his girlfriend to an untimely death, though she herself becomes re-animated and returns to torment him as a severed head and a body with a chainsaw in its hands who unwittingly slices itself in two.And this is only the beginning of a movie that will not let down the zaniness, as the professor's daughter makes an appearance with her partner and two locals and get sucked into the madness that ensues. Raimi uses a hyper-kinetic editing to make the essentially silly story even sillier -- the POV of an eyeball flying into the screaming mouth of a woman is a (pun intended) scream -- and distorting the dead into stop-motion figurines only adds to the lunacy. Looney Tunes gone berserk (even the furniture becomes possessed), not precisely frightening, but swiftly paced and with great use of Bruce Campbell's over-the-top acting and slapstick humor. Hilarious, entertaining stuff.",Evil Dead II
88,Matt_Layden,"""It Ups The Ultimate Experience In Grueling Terror""",10,26 September 2005,"This movie is equal to the original Evil Dead, here we have ASH the lone survivor from the first encounter with the evil dead, fighting off the deadites yet again. ASH encounters some unexpected guests and now everyone must fight for the lives, or become the evil that hunts them.Sam Raimi does an excellent job of keeping us scared in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, with the dead surrounding us. When ASH is alone in the cabin, we are alone in the cabin and every creaking sound we hear feels like it's right beside us. The eery feeling is not as terrifying as the original, because the original was a punch in the face of terror. This one is more of a drench you in the face with blood, instead of a punch. The touch of dark comedy is great. ASH versus his hand is some comic gold and is a great way to give you some breathing room when you're not terrified of what might happen next.The script of course is just one guy in a cabin against the dead, but what makes it different is the great one-liners ""Swallow This"", ""Groovy"". The movie showcases other characters that hold no emotional value to the viewer what so ever. You don't even feel sorry for the hillbilly who gets stabbed, slammed by the door, kicked, yelled at, while still being stabbed mind you, dragged and then finally something unknown happens to him under the cellar, but it involves gallons upon gallons of blood.The ending to this film sets up the third installment ARMY OF DARKNESS, which is a total turn around from the first two. The cameo of FREDDY'S glove is a classic nod to Craven's work...or a diss, however you look at it. The whole idea of an evil unknown force underneath you in a cellar is scary enough, not to mention the fact that we have to go down there with our hero, who's armed with trademark boomstick and chainsaw.This film holds one of my all time favourite scenes. Can you guess it, it's when Ash ""saws"" off his own hand with a psycho laugh, while blood splatters across his face and his laugh slowly grows into agony and screaming. If you love blood, dark comedy, great directing, classic B movie acting, one-liners and want to be scared ****less, then check this movie out, as well as the original.This is what horror is all about, the gore, the atmosphere, the EVIL DEAD",Evil Dead II

The fake blood flows by the gallon and the Deadites are more gruesome. This is a movie that's just fun, fun, fun to watch.

91,brando647,The Ultimate Cult Classic!,10,23 May 2014,"For whatever reason, I've been on a horror kick for the past few months, which is odd because it's a genre for which I've never had much love. I've seen some good and some bad but it all made me want to go back to one of my favorites. A movie I had seen in over a decade: EVIL DEAD II. There is so much awesome in this movie and I'm pretty sure anyone reading my comments on here has already seen this movie so I'll probably just use this space to share my love for it. In an age where the new horror movies flooding theaters on a yearly basis are near carbon copies of each other, following the same formulas and hitting the same notes, just remember we'll always have Sam Raimi's cult classic to fall back on. The argument could be made that EVIL DEAD II is more comedy than horror, but any movie that features supernatural tree rape and loads of chainsaw violence are going to have a foot in the genre. The movie is essentially the same premise as the original: Ash Williams brings his girlfriend to a remote cabin in the woods for some romance but finds a tape recorder containing readings from the Necronomiconthe Book of the Dead. As the words are spoken aloud, an ancient evil awakens and terrorizes Ash, driving him to the point of insanity. But hope is not lost as he is soon joined by a handful of visitors, one of which might be able to decipher the texts and find a means of sending the evil back when to the depths of Hell.Where do I begin? I love pretty much everything about this movie. It is the ultimate low budget movie that proudly displays the love of the craft from everyone involved. The cast and crew endured less than favorable shooting conditions and minimal resources but their desire to create a memorable piece of horror/comedy fun drove them through it all to create the epic-ness that is EVIL DEAD II. Sam Raimi and crew have an obvious goal of pushing the envelope of taste to the very edge without going over to the point that their movie never would've seen the light of day. When you think about it, the violence in EVIL DEAD II is pretty brutal. Decapitations, stabbings, dismemberment, blood and ooze everywherebut it's all done with this screwball tone that makes it less cringe-inducing and more laughable. When a character is dragged to their death through a basement trap door, it's accompanied by gallons and gallons and gallons (and gallons) of blood pumped from below in tidal wave proportions. Ash cutting off his demon-possessed hand is preceded by a Three Stooges-inspired fight between Bruce Campbell and himself in the kitchen. While the movie is still totally inappropriate for kids for the content, there isn't a whole lot you could consider ""scary"" about this horror classic. Even if you the humor injected through the film's total absurdity isn't enough to keep you laughing instead of screaming, the film's minuscule budget ensures that nothing here will be sending you screaming from the room.I love, love, love the practical effects of this film. Raimi shoots for the moon with only enough budget to cross the county line, but he uses every conceivable trick to craft his film. Miniatures, matte paintings, and puppetry give this movie a perfect retro vibe. Creature effects are done with rubber suits and make-up, and camera tricks are used to perfect cheesy effect. And let's not forget Bruce Campbell, the man who became legend thanks to his role as Ash Williams, hero of the EVIL DEAD series. I honestly don't believe anyone but Campbell could've pulled off a character like Ash. Equal parts stone-cold hero and bumbling moron, Ash wages a one-man war against the Evil Dead. When the series was rebooted with EVIL DEAD in 2013, I enjoyed the movie but the one thing it could never recreate would be this character (and I'm glad they didn't try). Campbell gets it. He and Raimi knew just what this character needed to be this time around and they absolutely nailed it.EVIL DEAD II is a movie that needs to be passed down through the generations, whether it be by friend of family. I was introduced to the series by a friend when I was in high school; he had the movies on VHS and we binged on them in a single night to introduce them to me. When my daughter gets old enough, you can be sure I'll be sharing this movie with her. EVIL DEAD II is a classic. It's rare that director and his crew do so much with so little, especially in an age when most movies do the exact opposite. Keep the love for this movie alive and share it with future generations of fans.",Evil Dead II
92,Gislef,A Rack for Sam Raimi...,8,15 March 1999,"...to put his off-beat brand of humor on sums up Evil Dead 2.  Basically it's a Bruce Campbell vehicle, as his lantern-jawed hero (is it just me, or does Campbell look like Jay Leno's brother?) stumbles through incredibly gruesome and hilarious encounters with the Deadites.  Actually, ED2 does tend to drag in spots while Ash is alone in the cabin, but picks up a bit once a new batch of cannon fodder...I mean, the rest of the cast show up. Overdoes itself intentionally to excess as a parody of the blood n' gore of both the original Evil Dead and horror movies in general.",Evil Dead II
93,Lady_Targaryen,Kiss Your Nerves Good-Bye!,7,28 June 2006,"''Evil Dead II ''is a very funny trash comedy that I watched just yesterday and I had a lot of fun! I thought this movie was older then actually is, because the character's hair in general looks from the 60's. I love the scene where Ash loses his hand and he attached a chainsaw to the stump. The monsters and the special effects are not perfect and you can clearly see that is a doll in many of the scenes, but that's what makes the movie a trash cult. Ash is a young adult who takes his girlfriend to a recluse place thinking that they are going to have a good time. The problem is that Ash plays back a professor's tape recorded recitation of passages from the Book of the Dead, and this makes many zombies,evil spirits and monsters to be awaken. Linda is possessed and becomes a zombie monster, and Ash needs to prevent himself to have the same faith.",Evil Dead II
94,denis888,"Outdated, Cheap, Not Scary Anymore",4,11 May 2014,"In some 1988, when I watched this movie as a teenage boy, I was scared a hell out of me. I loved Bruce Campbell's funny acting and his heroic actions. Now, in 2014, I watched Evil Dead II again - wow. A bunch of laughs and deep yawns. Cheap, naive, outdated, pathetic movie. Too much blood and too many plasticine ghouls are not scary at all. naive FXs add to general misery and make the whole affair a real comedy stick. Campbell is OK, and he is very funny, even when using his chainsaw. But the whole movie is a just a cheap video as if to some 80's song a la Thriller. Monsters? Funny and unconvincing. Horrors? Nope, none of that. Suspense? Hardly ever. Fear? No, smiles all around. Some films do not stand the test of time, this is a typical example. I know, the 3 rd part was a pure comedy/parody. They even think of a 4th part. Nope, too much of this stuff. The films belongs to its time. It was a real smash sensation then, it ain't anymore now. Just a bit f a shame, in fact.",Evil Dead II

The film has higher production values than the previous installment and this time we get a creditable performance from Bruce Campbell, who is riveting in is over-expression and camped up characterisation.

I love the crazy bonkers effects and the ridiculous over the top amount of gore! The first seven minutes of the movie are kinda confusing; it completely retcons the original and gives a new explanation to how Ash got to the cabin. I guess just ignore this part and say the original still happened.Taking place right after the original, Ash is still trapped at the cabin and looks for a way out. Meanwhile, Annie, the daughter of the archeologist who brought the Necronomicon to the cabin shows up with her friends and searching for her dad. They assume Ash killed them, but soon realize they are still surrounded by Deadites. Ash, Annie and her friends try to survive the night before the Deadites try to possess them and kill them.

102,mentalcritic,"For what it is worth, it works...",7,5 March 2005,"In a nutshell, Evil Dead 2 is what happens when you take the original Evil Dead, chop it into parts, put the parts in a bag, and shake. The film recaps the ending of the original by bringing Ash back to the mountain cabin with a new girlfriend, who is shortly chopped up with a chainsaw before the spirits of the dead come calling after Ash. As Ash struggles to fight off the dead, a new group of unlucky adventurers, one of which is related to the archaeologist on the tape, come calling. Little Miss Archaeologist just happens to be carrying a series of new pages from the book that detail more recitations, and a prophecy about a warrior destined to destroy the evil spirits.If you were just after a description of the plot, you can stop reading now, because that was pretty much it. At a mere eighty-five minutes, nobody is going to confuse Evil Dead 2 with the epic machinations of horror maestros such as Stephen King, who once described the original Evil Dead as one of the funniest and most original films he had ever seen. And therein lies one of the franchise's essential problems. Like the child raised in a violent environment who just wants to be loved, the Evil Dead sequels progressively attempt more and more to endear themselves to a teen or family audience. This is not so obvious in Evil Dead 2, thanks to a smattering of fairly mild gore, but the third effort just dumped all pretense and might as well have called itself Teenage Mutant Ninja Ash. Heaven help us fans of real horror if the fourth Evil Dead actually sees completion.Getting back to Evil Dead 2, what makes it work is a sense of cruelty carried over from the previous film. Hands are severed, heads are knocked off, corpses dance around, and the forest comes to life once more, though not as notoriously as previously was the case. In fact, a lot of what goes on in Evil Dead 2 reads like a cleaned-up version of what happened in The Evil Dead. Which makes the short running time all the more frustrating, giving the new story little, if any, chance to develop. Not that Sam Raimi has ever been big on story, or anything that requires more than a pair of brain cells.What rescues Evil Dead 2 from being just another inferior clone is some truly creative gore. While the setup, as previously described, is unoriginal, the execution is fairly spectacular. While the idea of eyeballs popping out of heads and flying into mouths might not seem particularly original, this is the film where such creative nuances of gore entered the public consciousness. There is nothing here to compare to the red shower that occurred at the end of the original Evil Dead, but some points are won for variation. Unfortunately, restricting Ash to only using a chainsaw reduces the scope for variation to some degree. I realise that the chainsaw is supposedly a Raimi trademark, but it does get a little boring when reused too many times.All in all, I gave Evil Dead 2 a seven out of ten. It is a competent retread of the original, but little more. This puts it well ahead of the third entry in the series, which basically dissolves into an LCD version of the original. In the end, the series should have ended here. The film certainly ended on the right note of irony.",Evil Dead II
103,Joxerlives,"Screw you forces of darkness, here comes a sales clerk with a chainsaw!",10,5 June 2013,"I must say I never had time for the 'slice-up the helpless victims' genre of horror films, even though I spent most of the 90s working my way through the Friday 13th/Halloween films (Part6+Jason goes to Hell/Curse of Michael Myers my favourites because they break that mold). For that reason I never really cared much for The Evil Dead which fell very squarely into that genre but love, love, love Evil Dead 2 because it's so very different. It simply oozes imagination from every pore, the pace is relentless and the slapstick humour wonderfully relentless. No insult to the rest of the cast but a terrific performance from Bruce Campbell who without a shadow of a doubt owns this film (although a great deal of credit must go to Ted Rami who suffered horribly in his bodysuit as the witch in the cellar, the bit where he tips his head to the side only for all the sweat to drip out is much more horrific than any of the fake gore on screen).It's funny now to think that this was considered one of the 'video nasties' at the time of its' release, it looks so tame nowadays. Sure there's a lot of blood Shining style but the bodycount is in single figures, it's not at all sadistic and actually is pretty tongue-in-cheek and good humoured. A great thing about the DVD is the commentary, Bruce Campbell and Sam Rami are just wonderful with their comments, informative and funny as hell. Shame no Bob Tapert to complete the trio.

104,ElijahCSkuggs,Slapstick horror at its finest!,10,14 June 2007,"The sequel to ""The Evil Dead"" has arrived in ""Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn!"" The plot is practically the same; Ash is attacked, his girlfriend killed and everyone else gets slaughtered...is that a spoiler? Nah, because this is what Evil Dead films are...a showcase for Bruce Campbell to get the s*** knocked out of him! So even though the formula is the same, how is this film so much fun, and perhaps, arguably, better than the original? Well, the budget has been anted up from ten bucks to fifty bucks and the film, unlike the original which tried harder to be an actual horror movie, is a laugh riot! Albeit dark humor, there are several scenes with Ash losing his sanity before our eyes that are just hilarious. If there was one drawback: not enough gore. But all in all, ED2 is great entertainment that has plenty of awesome camera angles, great one-liners, a severed hand, and touches of horror and comedy mixed to perfection! Thank you Sam Raimi, Bob Tapert and Bruce Campbell.",Evil Dead II
105,mattymatt4ever,"I have mixed feelings, but I still found it fairly entertaining",5,8 January 2003,"This movie kind of lost me from the get-go, since I was wondering why the hell Ash would go back to this cabin, after all that happened in the first ""Evil Dead.""  Now I'm reading that this was actually supposed to be a remake of the first ""ED.""  Why a director would want to remake his own movie, I don't know, but I'm sure all the ""Evil Dead"" enthusiasts out there could come up with some logical reasoning behind the creation of this sequel, so I won't get too much into it.  The scenes in the opening go by like flashes of lightning, and sometimes the effects are too overwhelming to digest.  Raimi obviously had a bigger budget, so it seemed like he wanted to take full advantage of this bigger budget, but at times he just gets way over the top.  But I became more engaged in the film when the additional characters came into play.  Like the first ""ED"" I wish it could've had a little more plot, but also like the first ""ED"" I sensed Sam's joy in making the film.  Like a teenager making a student film, he jumps at any chance to create visuals that'll make the audience go ""Wow.""  And there are some truly original visual sequences, which combine his knack for visuals and slapstick comedy. The scene where Bruce beats up on himself is classic.  I also loved it when Bruce, armed with his chainsaw, uttered the line ""Groovy.""  And if you're looking to buy the DVD, it has a great commentary track that's definitely worth checking out!  All in all, I still won't regard this as a ""good"" film, but it has its moments and serves as pretty good entertainment.  But I still wish Raimi could've tempered himself a little bit with the f/x sequences.

108,phubbs,Evil Dead II,10,23 November 2013,"Sam Raimi already gave us one of the most iconic horror films ever devised by man so what does he do next? he gives us the sequel which is even more iconic than the previous film!. 'Gimme some sugar baby'...oh wait that's the third most iconic horror film ever.So up to a few years ago I was a little confused by this sequel. The plot appears to show 'Ash' venturing back up to a remote cabin with another girlfriend, was this the original cabin or a completely new one? I asked myself. As things progress (very quickly) Ash discovers yet another recorder which he plays and inadvertently sets the dark demonic forces free again. It was at this point I was thinking why on earth Ash would do that? didn't he learn from his first cabin experience? and when you think about it why the hell would he go back to a remote cabin?! dude seriously!.Twas then I found out that this sequel is actually a reboot of the first film, yet Raimi called it Evil Dead 2 as though its a continuation of the first. The plot is exactly the same as the first film because its a remake basically, a remake with better effects, more action and less build up...essentially more game time. Ash is even wearing the same outfit he had on in the first film!. So yes that is a bit confusing if you're not in the know but somehow it doesn't matter, the film is so damn fun you let it slide. Myself I think he should of avoided the 2 in the title and tried to make it follow the first but hey.As I said there's no messing around in this film, no sooner has Ash arrived at the cabin he's released the demons and all hell is breaking loose. This is good as we know the basic outline from the first film, everybody simply wanted to see more of Ash kicking undead ass. And that is exactly what we get with much sweeter looking effects.The effects are much the same type of thing as in the first but due to success and extra mula they are simply better. Of course by today's standards they aren't that good, a bit basic, any fresh faced kids are gonna laugh at most of it truth be told. But again its the old adage that with little money and tech you've gotta work to make your film look good. You've gotta be inventive and once again Raimi and co excel with their visuals. A nice blend of classic makeup, mask work, models, stop motion, bluescreen, miniatures, puppets etc...the full gamut of special effects to bring every creature alive in the best possible way.Personally I loved the sequence where 'Linda's' corpse rises from the grave and then dances around in the swirling bleak mist as Ash watches in horror from the cabin. The whole scene is using classic stop motion and even though it of course looks a bit hokey the atmosphere is just so flippin eerie. It could almost be a Tim Burton moment. There is so much to enjoy here, chock full of tasty visual kookiness, the severed hand that scrambles around, the excellent possessed makeup jobs on the survivors and Campbell especially and then there's the huge demon head/face thing at the end. Corny as hell but so much fun.Its also no secret that this sequel was taken down the horror comedy route. The first film was suppose to be an all out horror but this started down that surreal goofy route which has now become so legendary. Not for the most part though, most of the film is still very dark, some of the demonic sequences are clearly more slapstick but its still evil looking. Its only when the last female survivor crafts Ash's chainsaw onto his bloody stump along with his shoulder mounted shotgun do we finally cross over fully into the comic book/graphic novel genre. Its at this moment that Ash becomes a superhero of sorts and enters into the world of merchandise.Does this mood swing cause any problems? no, no it doesn't, in fact it just makes the film even more awesome and gives it a whole new scope. We go from classic horror gore with Ash being the victim in all manner of slapstick tomfoolery, to action man gore and violence with the start of ice cool witty quips and full on hero posing.It is strange how this franchise developed no doubt about that, plus the oddity of rebooting/remaking his first film virtually scene by scene and calling it a sequel. Like the first its not really scary but this time it was never meant to be scary, its a wild ride bordering on fantasy that happens to have a lot of blood and goo. Its one of those perfect 'sequels' where everything is just right, it all works...even the bits that kinda don't work, work. There are moments of great horror and moments that are almost childish in nature, you could even say its a satire of certain grotty horrors. End of the day Campbell can simply make these things work.No excuses here, its a balls to the wall, hyper demonic blood n ooze frenzy with typically gritty low budget ferocity and absurd creations. A completely cheesy turbo charged B-movie of diabolically hellish proportions, you wanted it you got it...and its groovy baby.10/10",Evil Dead II

111,ivo-cobra8,The best Evil Dead movie of all time my personal favorite,10,24 October 2015,"Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987) is more than a sequel to a cult classic film from The Evil Dead (1981) this film is more of a prequel to the Army of Darkness (1992) that was made 5. years later. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is my number 1 favorite film best Evil Dead movie in the franchise. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. I love this film to death and I love it so damn much. I enjoy this film a lot, it is one of my favorite movie's in the trilogy. This is a great movie fun gory entertaining kick-ass sequel. It has action, comedy and horror mixed together that is why I love this film to death! Bruce Campbell is pure fun bad-ass Ash I absolutely love him in this sequel. I miss the 80's and that really best action gory movies un like they are today.This sequel to the original movie is the perfect balance between the horror of the original and the silliness of the third installment. It succeeds because it has fun with the ""B"" movie genre, never claiming to be better than it is while employing witty direction and dialogue. The scene I remember most is when blood splashes on the lightbulb, making the room glow red. The first time I watch it, this film really confused me a lot because I thought it was sequel to The Evil Dead but it had a lot of changes, which I love that. I have enjoyed a lot of this film, it is one of my second favorite movie's of the trilogy. Bruce Campbell is pure fun and it's witty. Don't get me wrong I love both of Evil Dead films, but I just prefer Army of Darkness more, because it has funny scenes and it has a happy ending, those two films doesn't have happy endings, that is why I love Army of Darkness much better. The film it is just more of the same thing. Literally. But don't take that as such a negative thing. With the success of the low-budget original under his belt, director Sam Raimi re-imagined his first draft and added many elements he just did not have either the time or the money to accomplish on the first pass. On some level, the film certainly works as a nightmare that has to be replayed by our poor reluctant hero Ash. second Evil pairing of writer-director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell doesn't pick up from where the first Evil Dead left off, it instead reinvents some of the same characters from the first film, notably Campbell's daffy hero Ash and putative girlfriend Linda (played by Denise Bixler in this film), and plops them back in the same basic plot setup as the first film, in a kind of horror-comedy Groundhog Day scenario.Once again Ash visits an isolated cabin in the woods, turns on a tape recorder that has a professor spouting verbiage from the Necronomicon, and the next thing you know, all hell has broken loose, quite literally. Raimi is a director who may not win points for finesse, but he works in a manic, breathless style that is perfectly suited for the outré black comedy of the Evil Dead franchise, and that devil may care, throw caution to the wind spirit is what has made the Evil Dead trilogy (Army of Darkness was the third film, though there's evidently a Raimi-Campbell remake of the original Evil Dead in the offing) such a cult sensation and what continues to draw audiences to the films to this day. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is an extremely gruesome affair, but it's also laugh out loud hilarious a lot of the time, with Campbell's intentionally arch delivery and wide-eyed crazed, cartoonish performance style making the most of Raimi and co-scenarist Scott Speigel's reinvention of the Evil Dead premise. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is really a sly, if sometimes sinister, comedy, one blacker than, well, death, but which delivers some consistent guffaws mixed in with the more typical ""avert your eyes"" blood and guts.Ash (Bruce Campbell), the sole survivor of THE EVIL DEAD, returns to the same cabin in the woods and again unleashes the forces of the dead. With his girlfriend possessed by the demons and his body parts running amok, Ash is forced to single- handedly battle the legions of the damned as the most lethal - and groovy - hero in horror movie history! Welcome to EVIL DEAD II, director Sam Raimi's infamous sequel to THE EVIL DEAD and outrageous prequel to ARMY OF DARKNESS!Evil Dead II (referred to in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is a 1987 American horror comedy film directed by Sam Raimi and a parody sequel to the 1981 film The Evil Dead. The film was written by Raimi and Scott Spiegel (they wrote the screenplay during the production of another collaboration Crimewave), produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams.I love this film and Army of Darkness!!!!",Evil Dead II
112,fernandoschiavi,"Evil Dead II is a great horror film with dark humor elements, more euphoric and has a chaotic energy that makes the movie just so much fun to watch",7,26 June 2021,"Evil Dead 2 is a rare case in cinema. As Bill Warren points out in the book Evil Dead - The Archives, the production is a sequel that doesn't exactly continue the historical precedent, like a kind of ""A Thousand and One Nights"" horror version. Six years after the success of Death of the Demon, Sam Raimi and his team returned for a second film, this time bolstered by the production company of Dino De Laurentis, making the financial problems of the first part a distant memory. The production came at a defining moment in the history of the horror genre.Slasher movies were in decay. Nightmare Hour, Halloween and Friday the 13th were the main franchises at the time, but they were already showing signs of fatigue. Killer Toy, the remake of The Killing Bubble and this sequel to Death of the Devil, are some of the facts that pointed to a new direction for horror movies.In the film, Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda go to the cabin hidden in a dark woods. When they reach the place, they discover the Book of the Dead, awaken evil forces from the forest and a bloodbath, viscera and severed limbs mark yet another immersion of the viewer in the macabre-comical universe of Sam Raimi. This time, a group of people, including an archaeologist and his ""almost"" protagonist daughter, appear to increase the count of bodies transformed into demonic beings.The character of Evil Dead 2 is already different in the way of filming, since the photography, costumes and ambiance seem much cleaner than the rusticity of the original film, which makes one wonder what the real intention of its director would be. There are many factual coincidences between the story of this and the other film, starting with the role of Ash (Bruce Campbell), the trip he takes with his beloved Linda (this time played by Denise Bixler), to the trip to the same cabin in the other chapter, now called Knowby. There is no mention of the previous misadventure, but it is not exactly clear whether the facts occurred or not, since Ashley's first contact with the evil creatures takes place in a scene that seems to mix reality with fantasy.For die-hard fans of the first movie, this sequel comes as a shock. The direction taken by the director is different: there is the graphic violence of the predecessor, but the bet on the assumptions of humor gains greater prominence. The fabulous camera that zigzags the woods, through subjective framing, one of the best technical details of the first one, is back in this one, allied to the excellent sound work and the great lighting support, more sophisticated features due to a more structured budget. There is also a care in explaining what was previously a mystery. The recording that accompanied the book now has a narrator named Raymond Knowby (John Peaks), who would have found the Morturum Demonton in an ancient ruin, called the Castle of Candar. The plot bifurcates, between the moments of the origin of this artifact and those of the couple's interaction in the cabin. Everything that involves Linda's reappearance after being decapitated takes an openly trashy and playful approach, this being the biggest change in posture in Raimi's approach. This whole idea serves very well the purpose of showing the mental confusion that the hero goes through, in a moment of extreme existential crisis.Ashley's intentions are divided through hilarious scenes, in which he begins to struggle with himself, trying to resist the domination that was imposed on the other characters and that finally came to him. The rotten hand that inflicts him pain and agony awakens all of Campbell's genius canastry, since his character must demonstrate a clear spiritual duplicity. Ash's bloodshed horror show is interrupted by the arrival of Annie (Sarah Berry) the heiress of the house and the doctor's daughter Jake (Dan Hicks), Bobby Joe (Kassie Wesley) and Ed (Richard Domeier), who would go to meet the deceased and heartless archaeologist. The classic events start to repeat themselves, including the scene of sexual violence. The main character is taken by the thing, which proves that even he is not immune to the opponent's powers, a feeling maximized by the entrance and exit of the trances he has.Many consider Evil Dead II as a remake since much of what was present in the first movie is here, only this time Sam Raimi has a considerably bigger budget, so he redoes the first Evil Dead, but this time extrapolating what was done before and with a different execution, one more focused on the comic part. Here Raimi brings together two radicals, the horror and comedy genres, not that this is anything new or innovative, but he makes moments that at first seem like they're more on the horror spectrum, which should scare you, and makes them funny because of the execution, whether it's the visual gags, influenced by The Three Stoges' humor, or how absurd and exaggerated the scenes are, mainly because of the violence and the gore. Raimi also constantly changes the tone during the film, and that's without breaking the moment or making one scene seem out of place from the rest of the film, and all these changes fit with the situations they're placed in, which makes this film so fun. To watch since it always surprises you and does it satisfactorily. It's practically a roller coaster, but Raimi also knows when to stop and let the viewer breathe, not letting the movie get tiring.All the seriousness that inhabited the first moments of the film is put aside after an hour, during the preparation to face the incorporated beasts. As in Evil Dead, this number two also serves as an inspiration for many other products of the horror subgenre, which mimic both the use of animatronic creatures and the indiscriminate use of improvised weapons as a bodily supplement, with electric saws giving way to effective limbs. Sam Raimi flirts more with fantastic style this time around. He brought some visual elements that remind us of gothic and literary and cinematographic references.The second film in Sam Raimi's trilogy is full of funny scenes like the dance of the decapitated and possessed corpse of Linda, Ash's girlfriend, in a sequence filmed in traditional stop motion (a technique developed with extreme skill by Ray Harryhausen in dozens of films ago). More than 50 years ago). Another moment of refined dark humor is when Ash's right hand is possessed by a demon, forcing him to cut it off. He tries to kill his own hand that makes obscene gestures and makes weird noises. In addition to the priceless sequence where a moose head hanging on the wall as hunting trophy and various other inanimate objects from the cabin start to give huge and annoying provocative laughs against Ash, who was immersed in a true universe of madness. In fact, the hero was all the time being tormented by terrible hallucinations and manipulations of his mind by demons, constantly confusing reality and fantasy.As a curiosity, in an exercise in deep good humor, Raimi showed the cover of a book in the form of an anthology by several authors, entitled A Farewell to Arms, in a reference to the new condition of Ash's possessed hand, decapitated from his original arm because ""arms"" also means ""arms"".Another curious and different fact was the use of green blood in the mutilation sequence of the demon that had possessed Ed's body. There are also several prominent scenes, such as Ash's violent blows with a chainsaw against Linda's severed head; or the various bloodbaths, in real floods to wet even the spectators; or the scene where Bobby Joe swallows a hideous eye of the possessed Henrietta, nerves and all, or the fierce attack of the forest's possessed trees against the cabin walls.The conduct of the film is interesting, as it manages to bring together all the mess that is a mixture of elements in the final moments, bringing together the post-apocalyptic Mad Max style with time travel to the medieval era, challenging the narrative limits that a horror film can be to allow. A Hallucinating Night 2 loses a bit in quality to its original, and is clearly a mimicry of ideas inspired by the first volume, but it's still expensive thanks to the total delivery of Campbell, who wins over audiences even in his dramaturgical limitations, making it his own charisma the alloy that holds together all the dissonant elements of the confused and playful argument.Still, Evil Dead II is a great horror film with dark humor elements, backed up by a significant budget and more developed special effects than its predecessor (not that it means much, as stop motion effects today sound totally outdated, which curiously increases even more the comic sensation we should feel when watching the scenes). This sequel to the 1981 classic is euphoric and has a chaotic energy that makes the movie just so much fun to watch. Raimi's love of the B movies is what makes this movie so unique. In the end, Evil Dead II is Raimi's interpretation of the appeal of the B movies and his celebration of them, and by satirizing them, Raimi makes a memorable movie. Throughout its 85 minutes, there are a series of absurd situations, but what can you expect from a work that is inserted in so many categories, including horror and the fantastic? Giant monsters, menacing trees, very caricatured demons and many horror scenes mixed with hilarious moments.",Evil Dead II
113,FilmMan47,The Most Weird Sequel Ever Made In Film History,3,10 April 2015,"this is it guys this is the part where all that groovy catch phrase started by actor Bruce Campbell the evil dead came out in 1981 this is a sequel to it but it misses the mark and does not have the spark of the first film.evil dead 2 or dead by dawn 1987 is a half remake & half sequel it is one of the most weird sequel ever made in any franchise ever out there and also in film history at least i think so things don't make much sense here as the director Sam Raimi lost the rights to his original film or so whatever the controversy was this film should not have been made even army of darkness is better any then this.its got a lot of blood,gore but most things look Cartoonish & over the top the movie fails to take itself seriously it relies heavily on comedy then actual theme i mean eye balls can fly like superman wow.just what was the studio thinking and i don't blame Sam Raimi for this he is a master director he did his best he wrote the script himself but it would be a lot better if it followed the path of original & included some serious tone i felt Sam was restricted by the production company to keep it in a Pg rating hey i am just speculating it i saw this i felt maybe this is why the project feels awkward.i lost interest in the franchise after this as it was too goofy to handle but evil dead 3 army of darkness 1992 is better then this along with latest version of Evil Dead 2013 of Jane Levy.Overall Evil Dead 2:1987 feels like a parody of its own original so if you are expecting some scary stuff please don't just check this one out only if you like Sam Raimi my rating is 3/10.",Evil Dead II
114,K3nzit,Much better than the first one,6,28 December 2019,I must say I was very impressed by this 1987's horror/comedy. Loved the effects and the humor. Bruce Campbell was just perfect as Ash and I liked it much more than the first one.,Evil Dead II
115,Ben_Cheshire,Like watching a horror movie do standup comedy.,8,30 June 2004,"I saw an interview with Raimi about Spiderman 2 where he said he's always learning how much is too much, that he's never sure when he's gone too far.He didn't have to tell me twice. I already watched more than ten seconds of The Quick and the Dead. A crazy steadicam followed by a crazy zoom, steadicam, zoom, dolly, pan, thrust! And all this within three seconds of celluloid. There's no other way to put it: this isn't clever, its ridiculous! Its so too much it hurts your eyes!Same here, if not quite as bad. Raimi has a bigger budget this time, so he decides to throw away all the credibility of the original. Like the worst sequels, he takes it that because there was a first movie, then absolutely no buildup is necessary in this one: we can have zombies within the first ten minutes, people cutting up their girlfriends and hardly seeming surprised, etc. There's just no lead-in! Maybe at a drive-in, but even there your audience aren't laughing with you, they're laughing at you.Clearly Raimi and I have different ideas of what makes entertainment: this, to me, is just too ridiculous. Its like watching a horror movie do standup comedy. Its just constant riffing, a collection of sketches, not a cohesive movie. If that's your thing, check this out. For me:5/10.",Evil Dead II

117,Darkside-Reviewer,Reviewed and Dead by Dawn,7,12 May 2019,As a big fan of the original Evil Dead movie I watched it's sequel Evil Dead 2 not long after its release and while it surpassed my expectations it did so in a very different way.While the first movie was heavy on the gore and horror with lots of blood and screams Evil Dead 2 takes a different approach toning down the Violence in favour of dark humour and story which works very well and started a trend of horror movies being funny as well as scary.The first 20 minutes of the movie are essentially a remake of the original with Ash going to the cabin in the woods with his girlfriend Linda who then becomes possesed by a demon and Ash dismembers her after that the movie becomes more of a sequel to the first.The Dark humour is very funny with Bruce Campbell using his own style of physical comedy performing all his own stunts as he slowly starts to lose his mind he goes from dancing and laughing with the furniture to strangling himself.The gore is toned down more in this movie and in the most violent scene in the movie the blood is made green instead of red as an attempt to avoid getting an R rating which didn't work the demon possession transformations are also toned down and less graphically shown with less blood and gore effects on the body the only demon that is Scary has stopmotion animation added to it making it look more cartoonish than scary.The sounds effects are excellent and give the movie an atmosphereic tone and when it gets to the action the effects are loud and clear like the chainsaw and the shotgun sounds.I would recommend this movie to fans of the original Evil Dead and people who enjoy dark humour combined with horror if you have seen the original Evil Dead just remember to keep an open mind and don't go in expecting hardcore gore like the first movie.,Evil Dead II
118,DonFishies,A groovy cult classic!,8,3 April 2006,"Before anyone even attempts to watch any of the Evil Dead films, they need to understand that there is zero continuity in the series. Absolutely none. What happens in one film is totally different in the other. Apparently this was done in Evil Dead II because the filmmakers could not obtain footage from the original film to put into the sequel, so they decided to redo it altogether – completely different from the first film (I assume they just did this for kicks in the third, even with the big footage excised from this film).After a brief interlude about the Book of the Dead (or Necronomicon Ex-Mortis as it's called in the film), the film opens with Ash (Bruce Campbell) taking his girlfriend Linda up to an isolated cabin in the woods for a little R & R. He finds a tape recorder and the Book of the Dead on a desk in the cabin; he plays the tape. Turns out, it's a recording from the previous owner of the cabin, and by subsequently playing the tape, Ash wakes up the evil spirits within the forest – the Evil Dead.This is a bad thing, as it literally takes Linda, leaving Ash frightened and saddened at the same time. He goes into the woods to look for her, but eventually only finds a possessed being in her body coming to attack him. He decapitates her, buries her in the ground, and goes back to weep within the cabin. Some how, all of this takes place within the first ten minutes of the film.What follows is probably one of the single most bizarre films anyone will ever see: fog runs rampant; blood of every color flies everywhere; a man loses his hand to demonic possession and then further attaches a chainsaw to replace the stump; tree branches attack and further abduct a woman and that's just the start. To explain anymore of the film would completely take away and ruin the remaining 74 minutes of the film.This is the movie that made Bruce Campbell a cult B-movie God. His acting is off the wall, never the least bit serious. This is the cult actor in his prime, before he became known for bit parts in cheesy movies and a successful novel writer. He gets beaten up throughout the film as well, leaving a lot to say about how far actors have to go for their directors.Speaking of directors, can anybody believe the man who went on to create the hugely profitable Spider-Man series started off with movies like this? Sam Raimi created his entire legacy with this film, and the rest of the series; one can easily see how much it has influenced his later work. Remember that scene in Spider-Man 2 where Doctor Octopus attacks all of the surgeons and doctors operating on him after his accident? With the crazy camera angles and totally random chainsaw? The scene is straight out of Evil Dead II. And the influence extends to all other horror films as well. Peter Jackson, Oscar winning director of The Lord of the Rings series, credits Evil Dead II as one of his early influences, as do many other directors.The influence and the legacy of this totally silly, but undeniably, cult film can be felt all over the film industry – and it continues to influence to this very day. A definite film to see.8/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).",Evil Dead II

120,gigan-92,Groovy ; D,10,22 November 2010,"In this one, Ash finally picks up the chainsaw, yeah!! I have to say upon initial viewing I was dumbfounded but exhilarated. Usually horror films are unintentionally funny, I assume when they are trying real hard to be scary. I won't call any one out, but I'm sure you can think of a few, several, lots, more than a few.lol This film got me into the idea of dark humor and for that along I admire it. Bruce Campbell is terrific in this film and the cast is just secondary to him in reality. The comedy fits in quite nicely with the horror, which truth be told can be quite scary at times.Joseph Do Luca returns for the score, and it still fits the film quite well. The make-up by Mark Shostrom is more than enough to hold its own against the original, and there's some pretty gory scenes in this one as well. The photography is just as great and it's just a very good visual experience in itself. Ash seems to be somewhat adjusting to the cabin from hell and its demons in this film, exemplified in one of my favorite scenes in the film; where quite disturbingly, everything in the room begins to laugh manically. And Ash, in his madness, joins them. It was out right funny and to die for, but probably the best example of this is when he decides to use the chainsaw near the climax, and says ""Groovy"" :D",Evil Dead II
121,sashank_kini-1,Scheiße,1,5 September 2011,"Peter Jackson directed the blood-splattering comedy-horror Braindead in 1992, which was about the deadly consequences of a Sumatran monkey's bite. I remember how repulsive yet amusing the lunch sequence with the mother was. The zombie priest fondling with the nun was hilarious, and so was the Priest's fight with the no-gooders. It was slapstick, gory and hysterical. It had actors who tried to sound convincing even in the most absurd circumstances, and the writing was crisp and farcical and a plot was at least visible.About 6 years prior to this movie, Sam Raimi came up with the sequel of his 1981 hit Evil Dead. I couldn't find Evil Dead so easily, but got this from my inefficient CD home-delivery service-guy. The runtime was 76 minutes, cutting about 8 minutes from the original cut, but retaining majority of the horror scenes. Also it has an UR (unrated) rating on it, and is prohibited for children. There's a sneering skeleton with on one side of the CD cover and the picture of Bruce Campbell being choked by a blood-soaked hand on the other. EVIL DEAD 2 title is printed in red, and the entire look is campy. On the back, there are three other people with him, all looking unnerved. Below that is a generous summary of the movie which tells that a number of guys are possessed and asks the question with one imaginary raised eyebrow, ' Will Ash be Dead by dawn??'The first scene takes us into a car, with Ash (Bruce) and his girlfriend Linda driving to a remote and dilapidated cabin, as they invade a professor's home to dance and make love; Bruce Campbell tells this in an uncomfortable, overacted manner. Then he discovers a Book of the Dead, and a professor's audio message on the Dictaphone, saying that a spell in the book would release dark, unimaginable forces. When the professor's voice utters the mantras in the book, an execrable force is unleashed which possesses Linda and turns her into a psycho-monster. Ash fights her off and her character is abruptly cut off. Ash now has to fight the remaining ghosts, as he runs, ducks, hides, laughs and battles all the spirits. The moment the morning rays fall on the earth, everything is back to normal. The only difference is that the way to the cabin has been eaten up for the misfortunes who enter it. When Ash realizes this, he howls ""NOOOOO!"" like a wolf.His entire body is bruised and lacerated, and he gets perhaps the most serious case of alien hand syndrome as his hand thrashes him with plates and plays hide and seek with him once he does away with it. Then there's the demented reindeer head that laughs maniacally with Ash following it, along with all the other items that go mad. And critics term this 'iconic'. The professor's daughter Annie arrives with stone-man with an awkward smile and the two go the the cabin along with a straggly man and his arrogant girlfriend who take their bags. The four too get possessed, and brutally tortured by the creatures, which includes the witch of the professor's wife in the basement.This happens for about half an hour, and characters keep dying, oozing green liquid as they're stabbed. There's some loud, vociferous and obnoxious screeching by the ladies, not to forget continuous and ear-splitting. The professor's daughter companion gets killed quickly, which is the best part of the movie since is acting is embarrassing. The end is predictable- big monster goes for all or nothing, as Annie (Sarah) recites some strange words to get rid of the spirits. This leads to Ash being taken to the past, where the soldiers try to kill him but are interrupted by the most fake-looking pterodactyl ever seen, and Ash shoots it with his gun. The soldiers spare him and now worship him as a leader, as Ash screams ""No! No! No! No! No! No!""76 minutes for this drab to be called a masterpiece and Rob Zombie's gore-fest Devil's Rejects getting 53% on RT is a travesty. Okay, the film was made in the late 80s, but to have uninspired humor, cheap references, abysmal acting, lazy gore, poor voice synchronization and a dim-witted plot and then become a 'cult classic' is something I cannot understand. At least something should be good or different- the plot could've had more weight, but even that is wafer-thin. The movie takes us right into action which is a different technique but then there's just no pause. And the little pauses are filled by horrendous, mechanical, lazy, pretentious and amateurish performances. And I hear some critics going 'Oh, the movie succeeds because of Bruce'. Seriously guys, what does he do that's so special from the performances by the actors of some cheap Hollywood movie nowadays?? The jump scenes are so poorly done, without creating any anticipation, excitement or fear. And what's SO funny about the film- the 'swallow this' joke? Okay, Ha Ha.... I can't laugh more than this. Better movies were made before this - Rosemary's Baby, Carrie, Exorcist and better movies are still being made, yet a movie like Evil Dead tops all lists. One word, travesty. And I still don't get the UR rating for this- did the censor board get brain dead watching Evil Dead 2?My rating: 1/10",Evil Dead II

I have enough stress and nightmares from my normal life, thank you very much.But a friend told me to try out ""Evil Dead II"" as sort of a spoof, and sure enough, it wasn't very scary. But it sure was baaaaaaaad.""Evil Dead II"" is a parody of horror films, but comes out juvenile and lacking in every area, even worse than ""Spaceballs"". A parody needs to have a real plot and interesting characters, rather than just imitate in random sequences the films it's trying to parody.""Evil Dead II"" is a sequence of incredibly over-the-top gore and blood, and I found it to be as mindless and uninteresting as ""Dumb and Dumber"", but worse. There wasn't a clever pun or a clever twist that subtly pokes fun at the horror film industry in the entire movie.To add to it all, the low budget effects, acting, everything. I like plenty of ""cult"" films: ""Buckaroo Banzai"", ""Last Action Hero"", ""Monthy Python and the Holy Grail"", ""The Blue Brothers"", because I realize that bad can become good, if it's campy and kind of fun and doesn't take itself too seriously.

127,PIST-OFF,A look through the eyes of a truly insane man,10,18 March 1999,"This is my theory on Evil Dead 2. I believe the whole, or most of the movie is told from an insane killer's perspective. Looking at life through the eyes of a nutball. A demented man thinks zombies are killing his friends. When in actuality he's doing it. When he finally figures out that he is responsible for at least one of those murders he says a book made him do it. He buries the bodies of his victims and continues on in his demented little world. He does thing and sees things only a truly truly insane person would. Would a sane man cut off his own hand? Would a sane man see bookshelves and clocks laughing at him. Would a sane man think that little versions of himself are out to kill him. Ash is obviously a paranoid delusional schizophrenic with suicidal tendencies. Sam Raimi slyly makes it look as though Ash believes all this is happening to him but in actuality he is probably a loner cabin dweller gone off the deep end.

I was at a dollar store where I saw the widescreen version of Evil Dead II sitting around in a case where I bought the film and became both entertained and interested in more of Raimi's work.Evil Dead II is the sequel to the infamous Evil Dead where Ash (Bruce Campbell) drives off to the woods with his girlfriend to get a little action until an evil spirit manages to possess Ash's sweetheart turning her into a monster. He kills her before realizing that the cabin is haunted where in some scenes he'll be possessed into a demon monster forcing him to chop his own hand off. Other characters from a babe scientist and her husband and a pair of locals go to the house to discover that something evil is in the house and discover what's going on before it's too late and they're all dead.The film is both scary and funny, but the special effects make it truly realistic where an NC-17 rating was almost added unless the blood wasn't red on all scenes.

The first movie didn't impress me much because it was over-hyped when I was in high-school, and I didn't find it as horrific as it was made out to be. In fact, I tended to view the first movie less than scary for having monsters in it that reminded me of muppets!Anyway, this movie continues the plot of the first movie-the dire consequences that ensue when the notorious Tibetan Book of the Dead is read aloud, namely, the unleashing of lots of demons intent on killing humans.This movie contains some paradoxical time travel scenarios, which is most enjoyable.The hero of the movie has some great scenes involving parts of his body being possessed and how he goes about defeating the demon possessing him. It is riotously funny!If the first movie in this trilogy was a muppet horror movie, the second was pure slap-stick comedy and mind-bending plot-lines. The last movie in this trilogy I tend to remember as being like one of those matinée sword and sandal epics-like ""Jason and the Argonauts"".

In some ways this is good and in some bad.It doesn't have the same horror feel as the first film due to the injection of more humour and slapstick elements, but it does deliver more action and more gore, and also a lot more 80s cheese (GROOVY!!). I think Evil Dead II is more self aware and leans into this in a joyous and carefree fashion which makes it very enjoyable.In terms of plot a lot of this film feels redundant as it is just retconning the first instalment and treading over the same ground. The plot points are largely the same, with some scenes and sequences practically replicating scenes from the first film. As with the first, there are also some very dated stop motion effects which are pretty jarring, but charming at the same time.I'm not quite sure why this is better reviewed on IMDb (at time of writing by 0.2 points) than the first film, as I think it was definitely worse and didn't really build off of the first film enough. It felt far too familiar and didn't deliver the horror elements as well.Still, a very enjoyable watch and a good bridge between the styles of the first film and the third.",Evil Dead II

""Who's laughing now!?"" Another scene is the laughing furniture, the way Ash laughs with them is a classic.The eye popping scene was good as well, Ash seems to have more of a character in this one. In the first he was just a guy trapped in the cabin, in this one he's more of a bad ass especially when he gets the Chainsaw attached to the stump of his hand and the sawn-off Shotgun.But he still shows fear so that's another interesting thing about the character. Bruce does a great job again as Ash.A great sequel to the Evil Dead. 10/10",Evil Dead II
136,rdoyle29,An amazing sequel to a classic horror film,8,16 July 2017,"One of the best horror sequels ever made, and a key film in the development of the horror comedy in the 1980's (the most significant decade in that genre's development). Raimi walks a very fine line successfully ... reproducing all of the elements that were most loved about the original film while altering the tone enough to make what is essentially a remake seem completely fresh. While I still marginally prefer the first film to this one, this is a rare example of a sequel that equals the original film in nearly every aspect.",Evil Dead II

This movies has the makings of one of the greatest horror movies ever made. The first Evil Dead was over the top just straight horror, this however was the first crack at incorporating comedy and humor into the series. You will see more of it in Army of Darkness. Now this honestly was not out to impress and did not star big name celebrities, but it was probably one of the most well done horror movies that I have ever had the privilege to view.10/10",Evil Dead II

Still, this is a great horror flick that somehow manages to amp up the ridiculous gore of its predecessor while also adding lots of delightful absurdist horror-comedy that always keeps you on your toes and thoroughly entertained (see the possessed hand bit, laughing home decor). One-liner-spouting Ash is glistening and great.

THis movie seemed to make no sense whatsoever, and every scene just got more and more ridiculous...but thats what makes it fun. People are gonna talk bad about this movie because of that. I got news for those people...this movie is supposed to be super-cheesy and corny. Its not meant to be serious or realistic. If it was serious or realistic...there'd be no Evil Dead to begin with! I couldn't stop laughing in this movie at parts...I think my ribs still hurt at times. I give this a 9/10. Only reason I don't give it a 10 is because some parts were just TOO much for me.

140,skybrick736,Evil Dead II (7/10),7,28 February 2016,"Considered by many, Evil Dead II is the most fan and critically received film in Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy. From my point of view, the sequel's big mistake was not adjusting the script to follow Part 1 with more fluidity. I get the fact that the movie rights weren't given to Raimi and the first half of Part II was a more simplified recap but there was seriously nothing wrong with the first Evil Dead, it was fantastic and no need rehash it. Picking up where the first film left off would have been a better way to go about it. Aside from that, the film exponentially gets better as it progresses. Raimi does a great job making the film more chilling with better makeup artistry and a well written script. It takes a certain taste to enjoy the Evil Dead movies, so take a chance and its likely you'll find yourself being a part of the huge cult following of Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell and the Evil Dead.",Evil Dead II
141,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,8,22 November 2004,"A favourite of horror and gore fans everywhere, and virtually a remake of the first film as Ash again finds himself trapped in a house in a solitary forest which becomes overrun with zombies and deadites. That Necromonicon is at it again! Campbell again steals the show, one of the most under-used and underrated actors around. Raimi keeps the film moving at a quick pace, and some of the camera work, including the chase shots through the house as doors explode off hinges, lots of strange POV shots etc etc show his flare as a director if not as a storyteller. But the main selling point is the gore, of which there is lots, and the set-pieces involving a flying eye and a possessed hand. Again the effects are good by today's standards-with today's technology, stop motion could be very effective. 8 out of 10",Evil Dead II
142,charchuk,Much the same as the first,8,6 June 2007,"It's nearly as good as the original, and it has the same problems as well. It's just as fantastically directed, has better effects, and Bruce Campbell truly personifies Ash in this one, but the supporting cast is weak at best, the story is lame, and the pacing is even more strange. The beginning of the flick, with just Ash alone in the cabin doing his best horror slapstick, is so excellent that you just want it to span the entire film, but, unfortunately, it does not. Another silly story and some more stupid characters are in store, instead. From that point on, it just feels like a remake of the original, making it rather boring and somewhat of a chore to sit through. The scene where Ash 'becomes' Ash is brilliant though.",Evil Dead II

144,bh_tafe3,As much a reboot as it is a sequel,9,28 February 2015,"After enjoying a cult success with the original straight horror film The Evil Dead Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell return with a bigger budget and a lot of laughs for this much loved sequel.The film starts by altering the story from the original. Rather than travelling to the cabin with friends, Ash takes his girlfriend to the cabin alone and then has to shoot her and bury her after they read the Book of the Dead. Bruce Campbell is then left to run riot in the cabin with a possessed hand, laughing inanimate objects and more physical comedy. He is eventually joined by Annie, whose father discovered the Book of the Dead, and some yokels who helped her get there.Ash cuts his hand off and replaces it with a chainsaw, people get possessed, including Ash, who is able to shake it off, and then Annie's dead father tells her she can use the Book of the Dead to defeat the zombies. As she dies she is able to suck all the evil into a whirling vortex, and Ash as well. He arrives in medieval England to set up the sequel.This is a pretty good comedy horror, made at a time when most horror films were comedic in tone. Bruce Campbell is terrific, if quite over the top, and everyone does what the director asks them to do. The effects are hokey in parts, but overall are good and a big step up from the original.Evil Dead II is an effective continuation of the original film which notches up both the gore and the fun. An exceptionally entertaining and infinitely watchable sequel that deserves its reputation.",Evil Dead II

The cinematography was good and action scenes were furious. Some scenes which were intended to be serious, were funny.Director should have continued the story from where the first part ended but instead he changed the story little bit which I think was not the right decision. He should have continued with the story and added the details of the book as he did afterwards.Overall, this one was better than the first one. Many say that first one is better but I don't think as it is filled with more details, action and horror.",Evil Dead II
146,tankace,Remake/Sequel with horror and comedy together!,8,12 November 2016,"Though the movie is called Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn it is more a remake of the 1982 flick and was obvious that it would be a different creature from its predecessor. But firstly it is as good if not better than the 1981 with improved effects and better acting. That was expected fro it had a budget of 3.5 millions and up to now both Raimi and Campbell had more experience in the movie making process.So what it is so better with the Dead by Dawn?To begin,as mentioned then practical effects are amazing, are on par with other well known,for their practical effects, eighties movie like the Thing (1982), the Indianna Jones Trilogy (kingdom doesn't count) and the Fly (1986). They both spooky and interesting to watch which is what you want if you are making a flick about demons. Groovy!Secondary the movie has something that was missing from the original flick, a lore. You get to know why the demons attack our crow, from where are they coming from and a prophecy for if you make a fantasy world why don't ,if done right, put also a prophecy. And side note with that flick the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis, the Book of the Dead, became famous and out side from the Lovecraft work and made more people interested to reading his work, pretty neat ,I think!Thirdly the movie fused horror and slapstick comedy with great efficiency. This fact alone made it ,for me at least better than the previous installment which was a simple horror film, a good one and a historic but just a horror film none the less. For that credits must go to Bruce Campbell who lift about half of the movie all by himself, the dude worked hard to provide us with something good and he didn't disappoint. All in all it is one of the best horror movies I have seen and I highly recommended to anyone, this one of these films you have to see before you die. For real I am dead serious about it ;).",Evil Dead II

It's kind of a comedy version of the original.The effects in this one are fantastic, the acting, especially from Bruce Campbell, is fantastic and the story does a good job of being fun but still different from the original.

148,jayjaycee,Ash VS The Evil Hand,8,28 October 2019,"""Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn"" is a 1987 horror comedy directed by Sam Raimi starring Bruce Campbell and ... . When it comes to categorising this flick the people still argue to this day: Is it a remake or is it a sequel? I would say it both, it's sort of a remake and obviously a sequel. When I watched it for the first time I was highly confused how it's only loosely based on the horrifying events of its predecessor. Now that I know that it's the result of legal issues I can appreciate the production. While the first movie was pure gory horror, Raimi decided to go in another and more experimental direction with this one. The hilarious genre mix of splatter, slapstick and stop motion animation delivers absolutely weird fun. The first act shows us the fight of the charismatic lone survivor, as he deals with both his declining mental health and the supernatural possessing forces. It shows how great of a comedy actor Campbell is, as he dominates the scene for almost half and hour. With enough jokes and humourous ideas (Ash vs. The Evil Hand!) it offers a unique pleasure, but with the start of the second act the horror begins to show itself. While the atmosphere isn't as packing as it's predecessor's, there are enough gruesome and gory effects to terrorise the audience (Henrietta!). Most of it might be over the top, but that's why it works so well. I mean, a guy with a chainsaw prothesis and shotgun! What do you want more? All in all, this one might not be the perfect sequel for everyone, it definitely doesn't come close to the original, but if you embrace the madness and love the style of Raimi, you're in for hell of fun. Groovy!",Evil Dead II
149,jcbutthead86,One Of The Best Horror Films And Sequels Of All Time. A Classic Horror/Comedy.,10,15 February 2013,"Evil Dead II:Dead By Dawn is one of the best Horror films and Sequels ever made that brilliantly mixes Horror,Comedy,great direction,an excellent performance from Bruce Campbell and great special effects. Those are the reasons Evil Dead II is one of my favorite Horror films,one of my favorite sequels and one of my favorite movies of all time and why Evil Dead II is a true Horror classic.Taking place right after the events in the first Evil Dead,our hero Ash(Bruce Campbell) is still at the cabin in the woods still trying to fight off the flesh possessing ghouls. Now with a group of strangers also in the cabin,Ash and the group must stay in the cabin and trying to fight and survive The Evil Dead or the demons will swallow their souls.Evil Dead II:Dead By Dawn is such an amazing and brilliant Horror film because while it still has the scary feel of the first film,ED II takes on a different direction by adding Comedy into the mix and gives viewers one of the most insane,crazy and over the top Horror films of all time. Mixing Horror and Comedy together is never easy,but director Sam Raimi manages to pull it off so flawlessly. Raimi fills up the film with funny and imaginative slapstick and mixing it with over the top gore,making us laugh and squirm at the same time. Raimi is obviously a huge fan of The Three Stooges(even calling the stunt men fake Shemps)and Raimi applies that same slapstick Comedy and hilarious suffering with this film,especially with the character Ash. The character Ash goes through such maniacal and hilarious torture from either the demons or himself that you'll wonder if he'll make it out alive or lose his mind and that's one of the great things about the film. Horror and Comedy are two sides of the same coin and Raimi knows this because Raimi balances out both Horror and Comedy by taking the most horrifying situations and making them funny and also taking the funny situations and making them horrible and it's done in a smart way. EDII is one of the few films that can wonderfully and greatly mixes hilarious Comedy and over the top gore and the only films that can match it are other Horror Comedy classics such as The Return Of The Living Dead,An American Werewolf In London,Re-Animator and Dead Alive just to name a few. EDII and those other great Horror films are apart of the great Horror sub genre called Splatstick(a mixture and combination of Comedy and gore). Even though there is a lot hilarious Comedy,Raimi still knows that EDII is at heart a Horror film and Raimi gives viewers a lot scary,intense and suspenseful moments,using the demon POV shots with great effect and crazy insane energy using loud sound effects and dark atmosphere and Raimi lets his imagination run wild. This movie is like the first Evil Dead on a bad acid trip and you're coming along for a crazy ride. The movie's violence and gory scenes,while toned down from the first film(most of the blood and gore is red,green and blue)is still great and intense and matches the violence of the first film. The main character Ash is a lot different from the first film,where in the first one he was scared and heroic but in this film he's tough and heroic and willing to face the demons head-on and spitting out great one-liners,even though he still shows fear and terror. Ash is one of my all-time favorite movie characters cause of this film. The ending is great cliffhanger ending and is a good set-up for the follow-up Army Of Darkness and will have viewers laughing. There's been debate over the years about whether or not EDII is a sequel or a remake of the first film. While a few scenes are a remake of the first film,the whole film is a sequel and has it's own creativity and originality like the first film and is a classic like the first one.The cast does a good job. Bruce Campbel gives a brilliant,hilarious performance as Ash,saying great one-liners,being tough,funny,taking out the demons with an iron fist. This performance made Ash a classic character of the Horror genre and made Bruce Campbell a B-movie icon,a Horror icon and a Genre movie icon. An excellent performance. Sarah Berry does a good job as Annie. Dan Hicks and Kassie Wesley give funny performances as rednecks Jake and Bobby Joe. Theodore Raimi(Sam's Brother)is funny and freaky as Possessed Henrietta. Richard Domeier does a good job as Ed,Annie's boyfriend. Denise Bixler(Linda),John Peakes(Professor Raymond Knowby)and Lou Hancock(Henrietta Knowby)give good performances as well.The direction by Sam Raimi is excellent,with Raimi bringing manic,crazy energy to the film with great angles,close-ups and the POV shots of the demons and Raimi also does well in the scary and funny scenes. Great direction,Raimi.The music score by Joseph Doluca is impressive and memorable and fits in with the insane,crazy energy of the film. Great score.The special effects by K.N.B FX group are excellent,well-done,gory and at times very realistic and work for the film.In final word,if you love Horror films,Cult films,Sam Raimi or Bruce Campbell,I suggest you see Evil Dead II:Dead By Dawn,a Horror classic that will stand the test of time and stay with you forever. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Evil Dead II
150,GeorgeRoots,Evil Dead 1.5.,10,8 September 2014,"Is ""Evil Dead 2"" better than the first one? Depending on your tastes I guess it's entirely debatable, but to me ""Evil Dead 2"" is a superior quasi-sequel remake that builds upon the comedy and bloodshed. Taking it to new levels of absurd, when I first saw this movie at the age of 16 I can happily say it would take over the next 6 months of my life. It started to disrupt my schoolwork, I would show friends and talk about this movie so profusely, I would actually be upset if the person I was explaining it to hadn't seen it.Almost like a parody of the first movie, we have Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda, take a romantic getaway to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. After coming across a certain tape recorder, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology professor who begins reciting passages from the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead). This leads to the unleashing of various demons and spirits, who are nothing but blood thirsty.Ash gets a lot more developed now, and it makes us really connect with the character better. Also that has to be mentioned is the level of slapstick Bruce Campbell has to endure this time around, it has me laughing every time I see it. Sam Raimi continues to incorporate a lot more unique camera techniques, and I feel that the scene where the POV shot of Ash being chased around the house has to be one of the best horror scenes ever. When everything is said and done, the film does extraordinary well in keeping us entertained with great make-up, gore, and laughter from all inanimate objects. In many ways I see it as some kind of obscure live action ""Looney Tunes"" episode, but to see parts of ""The Evil Dead"" (1981) redone with a larger budget kind of makes me respect this one just a little more.Final Verdict: Shows that a movie can succeed without much of a story, and can totally keep the laughs up strong. It's great to see a sequel that doesn't have to entirely repeat itself in order to capitalise on the success of the original. 10/10.",Evil Dead II

Yes, great directing by Sam Raimi.

152,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Really good!,6,24 June 2008,"Writer-director Sam Raimi's extremely stylized, blood-soaked follow-up to his creepy Evil Dead isn't really a sequel; rather, it's a remake on a better budget. It also isn't really a horror film (though there are plenty of decapitations, zombies, supernatural demons, and gore) as much as it is a hilarious, sophisticated slapstick send-up of the terror genre. Raimi takes every horror convention that exists and exaggerates it with mind-blowing special effects, crossed with mocking Three Stooges humor. The plot alone is a genre cliché right out of any number of horror films. Several teens (including our hero, Ash, played by Bruce Campbell in a manic tour-De-force of physical comedy) visit a broken-down cottage in the woods--miles from civilization--find a copy of the Book of the Dead, and unleash supernatural powers that gut every character in sight. All, that is, except Ash, who takes this very personally and spends much of the of the film getting his head smashed while battling the unseen forces. Raimi uses this bare-bones story as a stage to showcase dazzling special effects and eye-popping visuals, including some of the most spectacular point-of-view Steadicam work ever (done by Peter Deming). Although it went unnoticed in the theaters, the film has since become an influential cult-video favorite, paving the way for over-the-top comic gross-out films like Peter Jackson's Dead Alive.",Evil Dead II

I love this film to death and I love the original horror movie. The Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn are the master of horror movies of the 80's they are masterpieces both. The first two movies are my favorite horror films of all time. Sam Raimi and Scott Spiegel both wrote an excellent script are real bloody slasher rated - R movie. Bruce Campbell is back as Ash and he is much better than he he was in the first movie. With a shotgun and a chainsaw he is a bad-ass. Sam Raimi fantastic directed the sequel, Robert G. Tapert excellent produced this movie.So the low budget fan fair that made The Evil Dead a success are at it again with Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn. This one picks up where the first left off as Ash drives back to the cabin with his girlfriend Linda in the woods and accidently they unleash evil spirits from the book of dead Henrietta that constantly terrorize Ash. Of course there wouldn't be a sequel without some intent to return to the horrific scene of the crime. That said Evil Dead 2 is gory as the original even goriest.I love the other actors and actresses Sarah Berry as Annie she was likable who helped out Ash fighting against evil demons. She did a good job. Kassie Wesley as Boby Joe was the hotest sexy babe she was so hot and so damn beautiful sexy I love her so much. I love her performance in this movie. Denise Bixler as Linda she had only a few scenes in here she was good. Bruce Campbell is a bad-ass fighter against evil dead spirits that terrorizes him. His hand get's alive and try's to kill him, so he cut's his hand off ballsy.I love when Ash jumps on a witch Hehnrietta in the basement and her eye jumps and fly's direct in to Bobby Joe's mouth when she screams groovy awesome. Love Ash's line Swallow this, groovy. Ash shooting with a shootgun his hand. Linda becomes possed by evil demon and Ash with a shovel in his hand hits Linda's head off. There is a lot of blood in this. A lot of horror really love this film to death. I love the woods where they filmed when Bobby Joe (Kassie Wesley) tries to escape, but is attacked by the demon trees and dragged to her death. That is basic Evil Dead movie from the first one and not Army of Darkness.The sequel was filmed in North Carolina, USA the cabin is still there the filming loactions of this film are on YouTube. Of all the movie sets in the world and film locations. I've noticed by far evil dead is the most popular film series. There's been a lot of people visiting,morristown Tennessee and Wadesboro North Carolina. What started out as 3 college guys filming a movie. Became a world wide fan base. Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Robert G. Tapert. These movies made Bruce popular. Even the next generation of kids is visiting the film locations.

Helmed by Sam Raimi this is the (sort of) sequel to the campy, more serious gorefest known as Evil Dead. Although it takes place after the last film, the events of the previous film were retconned to cut out some characters. We start with our hero and the last film's survivor, Ash, being chased and possessed by the Evil Dead.This film, like the previous film, has lots of gore and generally grossness, usually involving copious amounts of blood and the mutilization of body parts. However, ever since aspect of the film is done with some amount of self-conscious parody, without becoming a spoof. Evil Dead II is assuredly a horror film, but at the same time, it doesn't take itself perfectly serious. Nowhere is this more evident than in the writing and in Bruce Campell's acting. Bruce's character turns from regular guy to a sort of manic semi-hero/anti-hero and Bruce plays him by seriously overacting, but in such a way that you believe the character to be genuine (especially given the ridiculous, yet horrific, nature of the story). The film is also home to some gem lines, such as:Henrietta (Demon-possessed): I'll swallow your soul! I'll swallow your soul! I'll swallow your soul!Ash (pointing a shotgun at her): Swallow this!This blend of ridiculous seriousness and comedy horror would further be refined in the amazing tour-de-force of campiness and low-budget production, Army of Darkness. But as it stands, it remarkably entertaining and Sam Raimi's direction elevates camp into an artform. If that's possible.The film is full of flaws, from the awful production values to the cliché-ridden dialogue to the overacting and utter ridiculousness in the face of grotesque horror. The genius of Evil Dead II is that it turns all of its flaws into strengths. I burst into laughter as I witnessed Ash struggle with his possessed hand (screaming, ""Damn you! Give me back my hand!!"") turning the film into a bizarre Tom-and-Jerry scenario. When buckets of fake blood explode onto the screen, I can't help but be amused rather than frightened and the ""glory-shot"" at the end of the film being contrast against an overwrought ""Nooooooooo!!!!"" just serve to make the film somehow better, rather than worse.Yes, it's cheesy, crappy, silly and underproduced and reaches beyond its means. And I honestly couldn't be more entertained by that. This film is utter garbage of the best kind.

If I hadn't seen the first oneand it really doesn't matter if you have or not because there is no plotI would have liked this a lot more, but because I have, this looks, as I said, pathetic.I don't think Sam Raimi realized that the original was the perfect comedy because it didn't try to be a comedy. His obvious attempt to make this a comedy made it less funny than the original. He lost the element of surprise, which is disappointing. Instead, this movie plays out like a mix between Ghostbusters, The Evil Dead, and an episode of Tom and Jerry. It no longer stands on its own two feet, which is another reason it isn't nearly as good as the first.Another major flaw is the lack of gore. What happened? I'm a gore-hound. I've seen the goriest movies ever made, and camera cut-off scenes make me mad. The original was easily one of the goriest movies of the 80's, and it could even hold up to some of the top-gore movies of the 2000s. But then Evil Dead 2 comes along and the only on-screen gore is a bloodless decapitation. After that, EVERY gore scene, every limb severing, everything is off-camera. Sure, you see a bit of blood every now and then as an aftereffect, but why couldn't they show decapitations and limb severing on camera anymore? Once again, the lack of gore is so obvious it had me screaming at the screen in rage. What happened? What was Sam Raimi thinking? With all that said, I'm not going to deny there were some purely awesome scenes in the beginning and somebut very fewin the middle and end. Dead by dawn, chainsaw for and arm, the laughing houseit was great to see how all those clichés originated. Apparently this film is more groundbreaking than I had known.But then again, this seems so safe compared to the original. So clean. Everything that made The Evil Dead laughably disturbing is noticeably gone (like the tree rape). As I said, the violence is noticeably gone. All the cheese-creepy visuals, like the amount of zombie-demon-things on screen laughing, are gone. What's left is pretty much a safe attempt at black comedy, minus the black. And that's disappointing.As much as I trash it, I still think it's worthy of being watched, though not a worthy sequel. Just grab your girlfriend or your 12-year-old son or a group of best friends and try to have the best time you can. But if you can't have that fun because you realize this movie isn't even deserving of licking The Evil Dead's bloody boots, I can't blame you.5/10",Evil Dead II

162,noahgibbobaker,Short review,6,10 October 2020,"I tried so hard to love this and the first evil dead but I can't. I liked the first one more as I thought the characters were more entertaining, in the evil dead 2 two of them are almost unwatchable for me. Jake and Bobby Joe aren't Tuco levels of annoying but it's close.The makeup and effects have improved since the first movie but I like the older effects more. There was a certain charm to the original evil dead. The small budget and the inevitable problems that come with that like, poor audio and bad ADR, I find things like this charming when they can't really be improved. The evil dead 2 was made for 3.5 million and I think the audio and ADR has gotten worse, the music has gotten worse and the actors are worse. Yes there are obviously technical improvements, but with such a huge increase in budget everything should all be improved.I didn't like the even more comedic tone than the first one, some jokes were good but most didn't land for me. Like I said Bobby Joe and Jake are really annoying and not funny at all, they ruined a lot of scenes for me. I stuff with Ash chasing his hand around was pretty good and him later getting a chainsaw arm is funny and very badass.The ending was pretty good and the foreshadowing of it was really great. I'm assuming it sets up army of darkness very well. I hope it does as it would be a great setup for a sequel and I really want to love an evil dead movie.",Evil Dead II

The way he confidentially sits his ass down holding the shotgun in his hand and then - rattle-bang! - he's on the floor.The absence of immaculate computer special effects makes it only better. The leading actor can teach a lot of first-class actors how to perform with heart on screen. ""Who is laughing off top 250 now?!"" This movie doesn't need any Oscars. It is just in the hearts of millions who saw it and evaluated its creativeness.Especially interesting is Ash's ability to solve a nearly impossible question without hesitation. When his hand is being possessed, he doesn't think, he doesn't cry his eyes out - he just saws it off. A real man. A real hero. And a real nut. Without muscles he can kick a zombie's butt just with the help of his incredible stamina.All the rest has been mentioned, and mentioned so many times.One of the best epic movies - 8 out of 10.

165,zmaturin,Pleasant Valley,10,6 April 2000,"People are always groaning about Hollywood's tired practice of churning out weak sequels to popular movie to make a few bucks. Well, I contend that not all sequels suck- in fact, a few even improve upon the originals, like the classic ""Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn"". Technically, I suppose ""Evil Dead 2"" is more of a remake of ""The Evil Dead"" than a real sequel, as it starts out from a fresh beginning with one returning character, the amazing Ash (as played by the amazing Bruce Campbell). Ash ends up trapped in the woods by an unseen demonic force that turns his traveling companions into laughing, maniacal ghouls. For most of the movie Campbell pulls off a one man show, fighting the possessed house, his girlfriend's severed head, even his own hand in an amazing performance full of slapstick and character. Eventually more characters show up, including a love interest for Ash who sports some of the ugliest socks I've ever seen. This is an amazing, one of a kind movie. It is relentlessly clever, throwing one great idea after another on screen (the only disappointment is the final, climactic appearance of the demon, which isn't very scary). It's got way more personality than the first one, as well as better make-up and a great sense of humor. The Ash character appeared in another movie after this, ""Army of Darkness"" which is a totally different kind of movie than this  (a comedy/adventure set in medieval times), but still recommended.",Evil Dead II
166,mistoppi,Great,6,22 May 2017,"I liked the first Evil Dead and I finally manage to rent the second one. The whole debate on whether or not this is a sequel or a remake did create some confusion when watching, though, but afterwards IMDb gave some real answers though. Thank god for that site, huh?I was going to start the review by saying how much better Evil Dead II is story-wise, but since it's a sequel and all the inconsistencies in the beginning are there mostly to give a short recap, I can't really say that anymore. Instead I can say that while Evil Dead was mostly horror, ghosts and blood, Evil Dead II gives something new to the story, it gives lore. And for me, interesting lore is always a big plus. The audience wants to know more, they are intrigued.And luckily Evil Dead II is a wonderful introduction to the Army of Darkness, which is like a big promise on more lore and background to the movies. But pretty much whatever I said about the first movie goes here too. The cinematography is weird but interesting. Time is used effectively - movie is only 80 minutes long yet a lot manages to happen in that 80 minutes. The effects are completely awful but mostly they make creepy situations even creepier. In short, Evil Dead II may be a weird sequel but it gives something new to the story and I really want to see Army of Darkness already.",Evil Dead II
167,nesfilmreviews,"Visceral impact is what ""Evil Dead 2"" is all about-- and it delivers.",8,13 October 2013,"Maximum visceral impact is what ""Evil Dead 2"" is all about-- and it delivers. The brilliance of ""Evil Dead 2"" is found in its psychotic blend of over-the-top gore, and it's fantastic sense of humor. Not a sequel so much as an elaborate do-over, ""Evil Dead 2"" amps up the ghastly laughs to generally thrilling results. As in the first film, director Sam Raimi lets out all the stops and plays on almost every cinematic trick in the book. Although the movie is obviously indebted to any number of sources, the film has an infectious energy all of its own. After a high-speed recap and continuation of first film's ending, Ash (Bruce Campbell) ventures out to that same lonely cabin for a romantic weekend with his girlfriend (Denise Bixler). There he discovers the same tape recorder again. When the voice reads a translation of the ""Book of the Dead,"" a vicious evil force awakens in the woods, and rushes into the house, and all hell breaks loose once more. Despite ""Evil Dead 2"" being more of a rehash than a sequel, it's the tone of the two movies that are significantly different. While the original is more of a conventional horror movie, the sequel ventures into full-blown surrealism. While both movies contain moments of humor, ""Evil Dead 2"" raises the comedic stakes. Campbell's performance shifts to match the needs of the humorous script, and Ash is now all swagger, spitting out one-liners and taking on the forces of darkness with style. The overall intensity and old-school effects give the film a lovable quality that high-tech movies just can't provide nowadays. An acknowledgement to Mark Shostrom's prosthetic makeup and the camera work of Peter Deming and Eugene Shlugleit. Vivid, utterly unique, and quickly paced, ''Evil Dead 2'' is one of the goofiest, goriest movies this side of the grave.",Evil Dead II
168,FairlyAnonymous,"Fast paced, hilarious, and creative (funniest horror movie)",9,10 October 2014,"The Evil Dead (first movie) was a good movie. It was cheap, it was self aware at its own cheapness, it had some hilarious jump scares, and it had great timing with its humour. It always knew how to hold something scary long enough to make it funny.Evil Dead II is almost the exact opposite of The Evil Dead, but in a good way. While The Evil Dead's humour generally revolved around showing someone die for 5 minutes or just how obnoxiously long it takes to fight the evil. However, Evil Dead II is INCREDIBLY fast. Not only does it have a short run time, but so much happens to quickly that it makes the movie hilarious. The movie is so half- assed and so quick that it is hard to catch your breath because the jokes keep on coming. This is literally the funniest ""horror"" movie I have ever seen.The movie starts with a brief recap of the first movie at the beginning (and yes, this movie has a recap and is NOT a remake; as some would like to believe). The movie then quickly leaves us off with where the first movie ended and continues from there... and man does it take off. Non-stop weird shots, strange angles, ridiculous concepts, dancing zombies, laughing furniture, demented hands, and tons of really fake looking blood. The movie has so many continuity errors in itself that the errors are their own joke. Sometimes the possessed people will have different colored blood, sometimes the clothes will change on actors, and supposedly sometimes there are multiple actors playing the SAME character! The movie is a joke on every level.DEFINITELY watch Evil Dead II. While it does work as a standalone movie, I think part of its humour comes from how different it is from the first movie. The Evil Dead felt like a b-movie that was aware of its lameness while Evil Dead II feels like a full fledged comedy.",Evil Dead II

This movie is also a bit more capable in the visual department and overall was an OK watch for something regarded as having a cult following.I don't know, it is an average affair altogether, it shows some more interesting details and does set up the 'Army of Darkness' film quite well.7/10, In my opinion skip 'Evil Dead' and watch this movie followed by 'Army of Darkness' for a crazy comedy horror adventure.",Evil Dead II
171,Mr_Censored,"""Swallow This!""",8,31 October 2008,"After a brief prologue that serves as half remake, half re-cap, ""Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn"" continues the unfortunate adventures of Ash (Bruce Campbell) and the demons that inhabit the cabin he once shared with his friends. Much more stylized and over-the-top than it's predecessor, ""Evil Dead 2"" is certainly not for everyone. However, if you've seen enough horror movies in your day and can recognize and appreciate pure entertainment when you see it, you'll have a blast with this sequel.What is normally sacrilege for horror movies is a gift here. Forsaking a conventional plot, ""Evil Dead 2"" instead delivers shock after shock topped with mountains of gore, so much so that if it were real, any sane person would start vomiting. By the time we're well into the second act, the cabin is wall to wall with blood and the first film has officially been outdone. Don't be mistaken, however; this movie is not just gore for the sake of gore. It's always there to serve a punchline and to further stimulate the over-caffeinated vibe the movie has going for it. And if you thought the first movie was brutal, brace yourself, because its sequel doubles up on just about everything. To describe what happens in this movie doesn't do it justice. Hell, no mind-altering substance known to man can compete with ""Evil Dead 2""!Returning to his signature role, Campbell plays Ash quite differently than in the first film. Becoming the anti-hero, Ash whips out quotable line after quotable line, becoming an instant fan-boy favorite. Along with an ever-resilient Campbell, director Sam Raimi is back in the saddle and he's letting loose. For whatever reason, it seems like Raimi has more artistic confidence and less pressure and, in turn, delivers one of the purest, most unbridled horror film of the 80's. ""Evil Dead 2"" plays almost as a gift to horror fans who had become complacent and grown tired of the typical slasher fare of the 80's. Almost as an oasis of the genre, it's a movie that you can come to time and time again when you're not in the mood for anything in particular, but know you want to have a good time.",Evil Dead II

The reason's mainly are because of a certain classic chemistry between Sam Raimi and Bruce Campball, the retarded but very excellent direction, the class horror/comedy element, a laughing moose head, a retarded hand that fights back and the over the top story. Bruce Campball plays Ash - the sole survivor of the original 'Evil Dead' returns with his girlfriend Linda to the remote cabin in the woods. Ash then finds a tape recorder that a professor has used to record incarnations from the Book of the Dead. When turned on the recorder releases a dark and horrific force from the surrounding woods.A very funny horror comedy with real heart. It takes nothing seriously and everything deliberately.

Soon he is joined by Annie Knowby (the daughter of Professor Knowby, the archaeologist who recorded the incantations from the Necronomicon), Ed (Annie's boyfriend or something), a redneck named Jake and his girlfriend Bobbie Joe. Yup, Bobbie Joe...Now the forest has more victims to claim, and it isn't long before the deadites are back in full force.

Essentially the same story, but the horror scenes are better and more varied than the first, more comedy, the special effects are much much better.

Ash is still one of the best characters in any horror franchise. My favourite line in the film is ""groovy"", who doesn't love that part. His hand becoming possessed, and him having to cut it off is probably my favourite scene. The actors and actress's do their job just fine.

This is far better than the first installment. Far better.The setup is Ash returns to the place of the first with a new squeeze. Why he returns, I don't know. The movie starts quickly too. Before you know it, the action and violence moves quickly.Similar to the first movie, we only have a cast of five people. Two babes, Ash, and some dudes. Ash, who starts off as a coward will get more balls-out and will stand up to the Evil that confronts him.The violence is just as gruesome as the first. Even more blood here and gets obscene. The Evil Dead here is even more maniacal than the first. The acting is better and more focused. Unlike the first movie, the acting is not novice. And Ash utters the famous catch phrase here: ""Groovy"". You will also notice that this is the prequel to the Army of Darkness.The directing is even more insane than the first. Sam Raimi is nuts with the camera. The casting was well done. And the makeup is even more grotesque and sinister. They outdone themselves here. Well done.This movie is also has well executed humor too. Nothing beats the sight of a headless body with a chainsaw trying to kill you!The Last Word: Excellent.

181,Idiot-Deluxe,! ! ! Greatest Movie of All-Time ! ! !,10,25 May 2016,"First off: I am a fanatic for this movie, Evil Dead 2 is without the slightest doubt the best horror-comedy ever made, as well as the best movie ever made. I've never seen a more exciting and more entertaining movie and I CAN'T STOP coming back for more! I estimate that since June of 1989 I've watched it over a thousand times, literally. No joke. How's that for replay value. To me it's the absolute ultimate movie-experience and it never seems to lose it's ability to entertain. Evil Dead 2 is THE keystone to ANY respectable home-video collection. Nostalgia aside, let us delve into this iconic masterpiece of comedy and horror.The plot is very similar to the first Evil Dead film (an excellent horror film in it's own right), but the second coming of the Evil Dead franchise leaves it's predecessor in the dust, it's superior in every possible aspect. Where to start, lets start with the talent in front of the camera: Bruce Cambell reprises his iconic role of ""Ash"" and he plays it MUCH better this time, it's in this movie that he's undeniably in top form to wage his war against the mighty Deadites. It's a good thing too, because Ash is tortured and abused mercilessly throughout the entire movie.Evil Dead 2 plays up the humor angle more so then the first entry, the splatter effects are more spectacular and Ash with ""old double-barrel"" is better armed then before; not to mention the chain-saw plays a much greater role, eventually finding itself grafted onto Ash's bloody stump of a wrist. The first half of the film, is essentially Ash versus the evil spirits of the woods and the possessed severed head of his freshly decapitated girlfriend and eventually her headless, chain-saw wielding, animated corpse. Not to mention his left hand becomes infected and demon possessed, which turns violent towards him almost instantly and makes an all out effort to kill Ash, who eventually pins it to the floor with a knife and then cuts it off with the chainsaw; all this makes for some of the most intensely entertaining scenes in the movie. The first half of the movie culminates in one of the most intense ""laugh-outs"" ever committed to film, where parts of the interior of the cabin (starting with a deer head that's mounted on the wall) begin to jitter and jangle with demonic vibrations; in the spanse of an electrifying minute no fewer than 8 to 10 distinctly different laughing fits, Ash included, fill the air - this terribly ticklish scene might make you feel a little tingly. The first half seems to pack more of the distinctive black humor, that's a trademark of the series, that's because it's largely just Ash versus the evil spirits in and around the cabin, or more accurately: Ash vs The Cabin. Later on with the introduction of four more people (to kill off), who are often at odds with each other, it becomes more character driven and less spook-house in feel. However, the movie still manages pack PLENTY of that deliciously unholy (and often hilarious) super-natural mayhem, which is the main driving force behind the movie - that and surviving it. Bursting with manic energy, Evil Dead 2 moves along like an unholy roller-coaster, riding upon rails of blood, spewing smoke and fire at it's viewers from beginning to end. It's completely unhinged and utterly insane.The second half of the film finds four unfortunate people, (one of which is the daughter of the guy who owned the secluded cabin) walking through the woods up to the cabin and, unbeknownst to them, right into a nightmarish hell-realm of demon-born chaos. Their clearly not aware of the danger and one by one over the course of the next 40 minutes they each meet their demise - some of which (Jake) at the hands of each other, well more or less. The finale see's Ash in combat against, the witch in the cellar or ""possessed Henrietta"", as he slowly emerges from the cellar's trap-door, battle weary, but still standing. A heroic Ash absolutely unleashes a can-of-whoop-ass and proceeds to kick some serious Deadite ass, victoriously slaying the demonic ""extendo-neck"" witch with his partners in crime: his wrist-mounted chain-saw and old double-barrel, which by now is sawed-off ""Groovy!"". Once thou hath slayed Henrietta, it's now up to Annie to dispel the evil, by way of certain incantations found in the pages of the Book of the Dead (aka Necronomicon Ex Mortis), she recites the passages and basically counteracts evil with evil, effectively vanquishing the very spirits, that just days earlier her father unwittingly unleashed, by reading aloud from the very same book, BUT ultimately - Annie wins out; but then wastes no time in dying herself, by way of a bloody, back-stabbing Kandarian dagger made of bone. Ash is thusly and dramatically sucked into a vortex and transported back in time, to 1300 A.D. and, as was prophesied, becomes ""The Hero From The Sky""; as he immediately finds himself amid an army of medieval armor-clad knights, that are in battle with a winged Deadite demon. Ash, as cool as can be, blows it head off with trusty old double-barrel, seeing this, the knights all begin to worship him, their proclamation goes as such: ""Hail he who has fallen from the skies to deliver us from the curse of the Deadites Hail! - Hail! - Hail!"" And slowing panning out and ending with a double-fisted clang: roll end credits. Evil Dead 2 is ""the sequel to the ultimate experience in grueling terror"".29 years after its release I've yet to see any movie that comes even close to knocking it off it's throne. Hyper-kinetic in pace, brilliantly filmed and edited, splattered with spectacular gore effects and brought home by the best acting performance of Bruce Cambell's career. Evil Dead 2 has long-proved to be the best of its kind......and the best overall.",Evil Dead II
182,schroeder-gustavo,Roller Coaster Ride,8,12 March 2016,"Evil Dead 2 was once again directed by Sam Raimi and it's supposedly a sequel to the original The Evil Dead, although I see this film as more of a remake of the original with a bigger budget and a different goal. The Evil Dead is one of my favorite films of all time, it's a film that took many chances and I respect Raimi for going through hell to create that project. Evil Dead 2 had about 10 times the budget of the original film, so is it good?For the most part, I really like Evil Dead 2. It's a completely different film than the first one. The first one was actually trying to be creepy and campy. This one is a straight-up slapstick comedy with horror and gore elements in it. And it really works. For me, the first minutes of the film that are focused entirely on Ash are just as good or even better than the original. And for me, that's saying something. I know a lot of people prefer this over the original film and I can definitely see why. Ash becomes the iconic character people have grown to love and the film is just hilarious and crazy. Some things don't make any sense at all, but it's established by the tone of the film that it doesn't matter. However I do think this is a flawed movie, at least for me. And yes, I do prefer the first movie in the franchise and I'll explain why.Ash is one of the coolest characters in movie history. He's funny and delivers some of the best One-Liners ever. Every second of the film he's in frame is gold. However, the film deviates into this subplot of other people getting in the cabin with Ash and for me personally, I don't like any of them. To the extent where I just want them to die, quickly. If the entire movie focused entirely on Ash, it would have been great. Instead, when these people reach the cabin, some of the focus is taken off him and it just hurts the movie for me. Also, in Evil Dead 2 there are many jump scares that seem to be there for the sake of being jump scares. In the original there were some, but they all felt earned and they came when the movie needed them. Here, they're just all over the place.In my opinion, Evil Dead 2 feels more than a roller coaster ride than a movie. It's crazy, the gore is ludicrous and nothing really makes sense. Again, these are positives. However, I do believe the movie should have been entirely about Ash and they should have brought down the jump scares. But again, the costumes and makeup are amazing and the effects are great. The ending also pretty much sums up how insane this movie is. It's a flawed movie, but an entertaining and enjoyable one. Funny as hell, too. It's worth your time.7.5/10",Evil Dead II

I feel that the humor did work and makes the film a lot of fun, even though personally I wasn't falling out of my seat laughing.

187,Chromium_5,Best movie in the history of the universe.,8,9 November 2005,"I wasn't able to get into the Evil Dead trilogy at first because I watched them all out of order. I was put off by the over the top juvenile humor in Army of Darkness, but I now realize it was just an extension of what Sam Raimi was perfecting here. This is an awesome black comedy featuring some of the sickest slapstick I've ever seen in a movie, and loads of dry humor (example: horrible demonic noises start coming from behind a bedroom door. Girl points to door and says, ""It's in there"").The first half is basically a one-man comedy show starring the amazingly talented Bruce Campbell, who makes an idiot redneck into one of the most memorable movie heroes ever. In fact, when other people finally reach the cabin, it slows the whole thing down. That's my only complaint: the movie is too long. It would have worked better as a short. For example, they could have done without the tiresome sequence of the girl running into the woods and the others coming after her (and no shock factor like in the first movie's version). I'm not watching this to see a damn search party, for heaven's sake, I'm watching it to see Bruce Campbell fighting off possessed body parts with a chainsaw and saying things like, ""You're going down!"" If your idea of a good movie is black humor combined with old-fashioned slapstick, this is the movie for you. It's a shame Sam Raimi abandoned stuff like this to make trendy crap. I'd rather watch insanity like ""Evil Dead 2"" than the Spiderman movies any day. 8/10.",Evil Dead II

It's a horror film, but not as much so as the original. What we have here is a bunch of guys having fun with effects and and a camera. It's all very tongue in cheek, and fortunately very entertaining.You don't care about continuity problems, goofs, or dodgy effects. There's an amateurish charm over the film that works just fine. It's nice to see that you can have a film with many faults without someone going back after-wards trying to cover up their mistakes and make it look better (Yes George Lucas, I'm talking to you.) The central thrust of this film is of course Bruce Campbell, who oozes of charisma as he picks up his chainsaw, ready to take on the undead. The rest of the cast are obviously just cannon fodder, but who cares? Evil Dead 2 is also interesting for its surreal tone. At times, it feels more like an art film than cheap horror. There are flaws, after all it really is a cheap horror flick, but the sheer enthusiasm and warped comedy that's gone in to this film makes up for much of it. [7/10]",Evil Dead II
192,joshi_3592,"A weird sequel, but nonetheless awesome to watch. Kiss your nerves goodbye.",10,24 December 2009,"I will start with a common question regarding this movie; is it a sequel or remake? Well it's sort of both. Having seen the previous film helps, but isn't really necessary. The director Sam Raimi claims that is is a sequel, and that the differences between the first movie and Evil Dead 2 ""flashbacks"" is because of ownership rights to the scenes from the prequel which lead to them having to re-shoot them. In my opinion the differences is so extreme that it should qualify as a remake. But nonetheless Evil Dead 2 continues the story of the first movie.Now this movie is definitely a bit of a cliché, but that's what makes it so great. Imitating it's predecessor in so many ways, evil dead, living trees, demons, chainsaws, it's simply a very enjoyable horror film. Alos where the first one may have left you feel a little uncomfortable, this movie makes you feel better with it's more humorous tone. I actually think they made a little fun of themselves making this movie. And what more can I say about Bruce Campbell, than that he's awesome. In the first movie he spent most of the time freaking out and surviving almost on pure luck. In this one however, he's merciless. He grabs a chainsaw, a shotgun, says ""Groovy"" for some reason, and kicks ass. The thing that makes the Evil dead trilogy some memorable is definitely Bruce Campbell himself.Once again I feel I've got to mention, this movie is R rated for a reason. It's not as gory as the first one, and as I mentioned it a little funnier than the first one. So just don't show it to any kids, I would say anyone over 13 or 14 could get through it as long as they got the nerves for it. The movies tag-line was ""kiss your nerves goodbye"", and their not holding back.So for this hilarious and nerve wrecking horror masterpiece I give a 10/10.",Evil Dead II

As if the first ""Evil Dead"" movie wasn't bad enough, which it was, they (the filmmakers) decided to make a sequel. Actually, it's not even really fair to call it a sequel. It's more of a remake of the first than a sequel.I've heard this film described as a horror comedy...although I think if you find any humor in this movie, I'm willing to bet you must be under the age of ten. It's truly an insult to the intelligence of any person with half a brain, and a total waste of life to watch.I just can't believe this film has the following it does. It's quite remarkable, in my opinion. I think Sam Raimi should have stuck to making his Super 8 shorts in his backyard instead of directing Hollywood features. The guy is a hack, sorry folks, it's true.I wouldn't even recommend watching it on television for free, it'd still be a waste of your time.",Evil Dead II

To top it all the film opens with a fake recap of the last film, where only Ash and his girlfriend is in the cabin, this is just utterly confusing and idiotic. There was no need to recap this at all. Apparently Raimi lost the rights to the first film and had to reinvent what happened.We them get some of the worst acting I have ever seen from Bruce Campbell, which includes screams worthy of being in troll 2 and a few stupid one liners. We are also introduced to some other bad actors who play the children of the scientist who started it all and to top it all throw in a super cliché red neck couple.Luckily this one gets even dumber than the first which in a way makes it so bad that it's borerline entertaining and at times somewhat funny. I get that it's just a goofy comedy with lots of gore but I would place this on the level of Date Movie. How people can like this film leaves me confused.

195,kclipper,A horror/comedy classic that made the 80's great!,9,2 May 2015,"Bruce Campbell etches himself into history as a physically comedic icon in horror movie history with this gruesome but hilarious sequel to Sam Raimi's 1981 low budget gore-fest, ""The Evil Dead"". This is a stand-alone film that has no connection to the original. Actually it is a sort of remake that has been improved upon with a more slapstick approach to the genre. H.P. Lovecraft's infamous Book Of The Dead is utilized once more, with an archaeologist stumbling upon its deadly passages and foolishly reciting them within the confines of a remote cabin in the woods. The demonic forces are once again unleashed, and Ash (Bruce Campbell) and girlfriend fall victim to the unseen demonic forces while attempting a quiet vacation. This crazy movie has it all. The action starts right away, and its a onslaught of bloody mayhem as Ash has to chop up his possessed girlfriend, battle his own possessed hand in a scene that defined Bruce Campbell as a dynamic actor. Super-fast camera shots panning through walls, busting down doors and hurling poor Ash through trees and car windshields. The on-going antics in this film resemble a sort of demented ""Looney Tunes"" like cartoon element, and when the rest of the cast, including the archaeologists daughter, and a couple of redneck locals, the hilarity really kicks into gear. The special effects are the classic stop-motion combined with make up and prosthetics that made the 80's great. Its Sam Raimi's finest hour as gallons of blood are sprayed, eyeballs pop out and fly across the room and there is mutilation galore, and its all done with a comic-book like style and glory. You'll love it! Raimi goes on to finish the Ash saga with ""Army of Darkness"" just before he hits the box office mainstream with big budget films. This was history in the making indeed.",Evil Dead II

The film starts off quite well and I thought when the moose's head (which is on display in the cabin) starts laughing was quite amusing, but from there, the rest of the film was just Bruce Campbell screaming and shouting in a cabin. But they save the worst for the end when, believe it or not, a giant tree breaks into the cabin and teleports him back in time to some ancient city, where he shoots a Dino-bird thing, then he is celebrated by a load of knights. Come on what the hell was wrong with Sam Raimi when he decided to go along with that! 5/10 a very disappointing film.",Evil Dead II
197,KHayes666,groovy,7,28 January 2008,"After the underground success the original Evil Dead had, 6 years later Hollywood decided to make a sequel. By this point Bruce Campbell was in his mid to late 20's so playing the college kid was a little far-fetched so they altered the plot a bit, basically rendering the original movie as useless. Seriously, if you watch the whole series one after the other, its like the first movie never happened.The story is Ash and his girlfriend go on a romantic getaway in a secluded cabin among the woods somewhere in Michigan, sound familiar? Ash then finds a tape of some doctor who used the house for research on a mysterious evil book known as the Necronomicon. Professor Knowby somehow translated the book and with the help of a huge 1980's tape recorder begins reciting passages from it. The passages he recites resurrect the deadites (the demons of the Necronomicon) and then WHAM all hell breaks loose, literally. Ash is forced to kill his possessed girlfriend, cut off his own hand and fight a tree...yes you read that right. Meanwhile while all this is going on, Professor Knowby's daughter and her boyfriend make their way to the cabin to find ol Knowby himself and run into a redneck couple along the way. All things come together where the handless Ash must join up with the crew to stop the Evil Dead once and for all.I won't give away the rest because its too good to give it away so you'll just have to watch it yourself. Again the special effects were the star of the show but this time its kicked up a notch thanks to it being a better funded film than the first one. What made Evil Dead 2 a little better than the original was the original one was 100 % serious while the sequel was more of a horror/comedy with a few scenes that make you laugh including a Hulk Hogan style hulk-up before the final fight and of course the transformation. In the first movie Ash was this wussy guy caught in the middle of something strange but in this movie he transforms into a chainsaw welding, shotgun carrying superhero. He somehow manages to hook a chainsaw to where he cut off his hand (nevermind the fact he didn't bleed to death nor suffer gangrene) and carry around an old sawed-off shotgun......groovy.Discount anything you've seen in the first movie if you want to enjoy the sequel, otherwise you'll be scratching your head wondering what's going on. Otherwise kick back with popcorn and enjoy the show. The highlight of the movie is the laughing scene where every inanimate object in the room begins to laugh and then Ash joins in the fun, priceless comedy.7 out of 10",Evil Dead II

What got me the most was probably Ash's attaching a shotgun to his missing limb, flipping a shotgun and just saying ""Groovy"" with the most serious face he could make while the camera zooms in on his face.Talking about the kills, they are memorable, though some are off screen. Jake's death is probably most memorable but it's comically over the top... The thing that disappointed me the most were the deadites since they aren't as scary or as gross looking as in the first one, they look much worse and and they got way more goofy. And they weren't the only weird and trippy thing that this movie got to offer. I lost my ""what the f..."" count at around 37 (without even seeing half of the movie) out of pure confusion because I'm just not sure where this movie tried to take me.The bizarre nature of the movie has it's charm and the craziness of it all was entertaining to digests.

If anyone else tries to tell you otherwise, don't believe them.  I'm not saying that I didn't like the movie, I like it a little.  I just thought it was a cleche 70's horror movie. It had original scenes, but the plot was stupid and unoriginal, and the dialog was just as cheesy as the 2nd movie.Now that I've said that, I'll talk about the second movie.  The movies have a lot in common, many of the same scenes from the first movie are remade in this film.  The big difference is that this movie is just as stupid, but it doesn't take itself seriously.  It's a comedy.  It's sort of a spoof of the first movie.  The first movie was serious, and tried to scare you, but this movie tries to make you laugh.  When you're watching this movie, try and keep a ""Pulp Fiction"" frame of mind: dark comedy with gory, unpleasant images.I'm not saying this movie is a hall of famer.  Not at all.  The plot is far too stupid and the dialog is far to awful to win any awards of any kind. Evil Dead 2 just as stupid as the first movie.  Only this movie has the balls to admit it, and LAUGH IN YOUR FACE!My only major problem with the movie is that they try to summarize (redue) Evil Dead One in the first few minutes.  And it sucks.  I wasn't too wild about the first movie, but this redue is awful.  It should have been cut out all together.

200,Snake-666,Extremely brilliant horror comedy,8,1 May 2002,"Those of you who think that this is a sequal to the Evil Dead are very much mistaken. Before watching this you should discard all knowledge of the original otherwise the plot is nonsensical.The hero once again is Ash (Bruce Campbell), the setting once again is the cabin in the woods (see what I mean? why go back somewhere your friends were killed?).Ash takes his new girlfriend to the cabin for the weekend and as you can guess the forces of evil are summoned, just like in the original. Unlike the original, more characters are introduced later in the film, rather than have all the characters introduced at the start and picked off one by one.This method allows for some extremely funny moments involving Ash battling not only the evil alone, but his own hand (watch the movie and you will see what I mean).Once the new characters are introduced the comic element of the film fades away, and apart from a few brilliant and incredibly timed one-liners the film reverts to the gore-based orientation of the first.I have to say that this film is more of a remake of the first than a sequal. But the film is funny and will satisfy horror fans. It is one of the few films that knows when to stop the comedy and resort to the horror, which many films have tried but few have pulled off successfully.And the events of this film lead up nicely to the Evil Dead's true sequal, Medieval Dead - Army Of Darkness.",Evil Dead II

Yes it is a little goofy and a little 'what?' at times but this movie stands along on its own pedestal amongst others of its type. I prefer this installment over the original by far and I would recommend it to any horror fan of any type.

Director Sam Raimi evidently is in luck to sequels because Spiderman 2 is also superior to the 1st part. What is the biggest virtue of Evil Dead 2 is undoubtedly its originality in attitude towards seemingly worn out story. Evil finds its way to real world thanks to mysterious book called Necronomicon. Brave Ash (great Bruce Campbell) whose girl has changed into zombie is forced to fight and overcome evil powers. Raimi has really no interest in developing some kind of complicated story here, his film is just a wonderful, daring exercise in horror combined with comedy. It seems that director's inventiveness has no limits and viewers has no option but to cheer and laugh their head out while Ash's attempts to oppose evil. Ash with his chainsaw and sewn rifle is undoubtedly an icon of horror movies. His nonchalant behavior mixed with shrewdness works superbly no matter what bizarre challenges he has to face. The flick contains a wide range of ingenious special effects and first-grade gore scenes in no way disrupting the simple, but convincing plot. Besides, the camera work is often unconventional and many intriguing tricks occur. To sum up, Evil Dead 2 is one of the best and most entertaining horror films in history.

I did some research to realize it was basically a ""requel""(a remake sequel) because the movie was own by a different company and the ratings for this movie change. I did look back at the movie and see what it was trying to be and I like Sam Raimi's style.The atmosphere of this movie is horrific and goofy at the same time, which I think works for this movie since the first movie was corny as well, but very gruesome. Bruce Campbell back as Ash goes through a lot of torture in this film which makes him lose his mind in a funny. Mostly of the movie is funny but relates understandable by going over the top. I think most people like this movie so much is because of the story and with Sam Raimi's campy element, it makes it more like a dark humor.Some people will hate this style of the movie, but going back the first film it did the same thing just more embrace. The movie tries to be scary in the funny way and that's fine because that's is what it's going for. Creepy but funny. Heck, there are some effects that are some effects in this movie that are visible to see and you can tell this movie isn't meant to be taken seriously.

Ash is cooler, there are some comedy elements but still has a twisted horror feel to it that no other horror movie has. Some of the effects are a little bit dodgy but this was made slightly before the days of CGI. Ash is darned cool as a normal guy coping with the pressures of demonic spirits and without this man the film would be mediocre at best. I love the way the demons (not zombies! morons!) walk, very twisted and scary. The follow up to this called Army Of Darkness pushes the comedy even further which in a way spoils it. Evil Dead 2 is a horror with comedy element but Army Of Darkness is a comedy with horror elements which is about as scary as an episode of Hercules or Xena. Watch this and then Army Of Darkness and forget about the first one.

212,Manthorpe,It's all about the chainsaw...,10,28 September 2004,"Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell come back to the woods to try and capture what made the prequel so great, and almost succeed. I prefer it's predecessor, but that is not to say this is not a good film. The reason is not because this is an inferior film, they're just very different. The original had vomit-inducing ultra-violence and shriek-inducing scares and thrills with a tad of black comedy thrown in here and there. This is the exact opposite, where the scares and violence are toned down, but the comedy and camp value has been scaled up. For reasons that don't make any sense to me whatsoever, ED2's first ten minutes or so are a recap and mild remake of the first, supposedly due to the fact that Raimi could not get permission to use footage from the original to put in this sequel. I don't know about you, but I don't see how that's necessary. Rarely do sequels include exact footage from the original, even more rarely is it needed. So for what it's worth, I've heard all of the reasons and it just doesn't add up. Fortunately though, this doesn't matter much and does not take away from the film as a whole...it's just not exactly a sequel and not exactly a remake. But it is, exactly, a very entertaining film.Now what I do prefer in this film compared to the original is that the characters act in ways that are slightly more plausible. The first film had me screaming at the screen trying to help out the characters. Don't go outside, look behind you, and for God's sake, get the damn chainsaw and go to town on those nasties! Saw their friggin' heads in half! Here, my voice was saved a bit as Ash must've heard my advice from earlier and decides to bust out the bad boy flesh eating zombie stomper and shred their minion asses into oblivion. Never have chainsaws been so much fun.We are also treated to the same wild and uninhibited camera work from Raimi, something that made the original stand apart from the rest of the genre for that attribute alone. Raimi does not disappoint here. His frenzied technique fits perfectly and he knows it. Watching the Darkness from the woods chase Ash as he tries to escape into and through the house is truly an awesome sight. As for the camp value, unless you're dead, you'll find some humorous elements here amongst the insane absurdity. And I will state, for the record, that I enjoy this film's ending much more than the original's.A delightful addition to the horror/comedy genre, and a different although worthy sequel/remake. If you liked the original, you'll find something interesting herein.",Evil Dead II

Its the whole body that turns into a zombie not just a tiny body part! Another rule that is broken once a man is a zombie he can't turn back into a human. But in Evil Dead 2 he can! Its unlikely you would go back into the same house were you're friends and girlfriend died. Would anyone be that stupid? No. Was there anything as fake as possessed Henrietta's monster in the basement? No and the only thing thats close to being that fake is the monster at the end of Children of the Corn III.

Opening up the doors to slapstick and comedy alongside the bloodshed and goo works well in sections but feels pained and too obvious in others. Yes it's a better looking film but it somehow feels small, in terms of the pure scope and imagination of the first. Characters merge into stereotype and some of the creature effects towards the end look decidedly Sesame Street overkill.Then of course there's the mangled ending that introduces the 3rd installment, which on its arrival was not even a horror flick.",Evil Dead II

219,punctate,good horror-comedy,9,15 January 2000,Though Army of Darkness (Evil Dead 3) was an action-comedy the first two films are horror-comedy. Ash and his girlfriend Linda stay the night at a cabin that belongs to an archeologist who was studying the book of the dead. The evil that was awoken by the book kills Linda and several humorous attempts to take out Ash. Ash troubles increase when a group of people comes to the cabin one of which is the daughter of the archeologist. The film makes good use of creepy and funny elements to tell its story. The setting of the story is set up well and the film gets right down to business instead of dragging along. Funny of use the blood splashing all over the place especially the face. Lessons Learned: Dead people look like walking rubber from a distance. Trees can leave their places so they can attack cabins. Trees have faces well sort of.,Evil Dead II

223,neon47,Is this really a... sequel?,10,27 October 2005,"I still can't understand yet if this is a sequel or a remake. There's no connection between Evil Dead and it's ""sequel"" Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn. If you've seen Evil Dead 1 then you should know the drill with this one. While this isn't in anyway at all a bad movie, it doesn't do much to go above and beyond the gory glory of its older, and superior, brother. Dead By Dawn pretty much kicks off from the very beginning with people being possessed by the dead. This version has a bit more of a twist, and this is also the movie where Ash gets his signature ""boomstick"" and chainsaw arm. Dead By Dawn also focuses more so on being a horror comedy, still leaning more towards horror, instead of being a full fledged horror like the older brother. It does succeed in doing this, but falls short at a few parts. Overall this is a worthy... uh... sequel? It's got a two in front of the name so I guess we can call it that. Just realize that there is NO connection (at least that I could find) between this and Evil Dead 1. I highly recommend it to those already fans of Evil Dead 1.

224,nathanjamesemerson,EVIL DEAD 2 - Dead By Dawn,10,23 September 2018,"Lets begin by saying this movie is one of the greatest sequels ever made. And it is also a sequel to the GREATEST horror movie ever made.Forget what some people have said. This IS a sequel and not a remake of the original. If you wonder why the beginning of this differs from what was shown in the original movie, this is why. As the original movie was sold to several different distributors around the world, they could not get the rights to use the footage from the first film in this. It would have been too much of a headache, so they reshot some scenes to get the viewers up to speed. Pretty much where the FORCE comes at Ash's face in the beginning is where the actual sequel part of the movie starts. So yes, it is a sequel.Though EVIL DEAD 2 is not as gory as the original, there is still plenty of blood to be scene. And this time some comedy elements were added. Bruce Campbell, Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert love comedy movies and there earlier short films attest to this. And what they have added does not distract one bit from the movie. The movie is still pretty brutal. If you like the original film or ARMY OF DARKNESS (the sequel to EVIL DEAD 2), then you should check this movie out and see for yourself why so many peope consider this one of the best sequels ever made",Evil Dead II

226,pookey56,rosebud,10,16 October 2005,"this is by far, the scariest movie i have ever seen. and it even made me laugh. i saw this a very long time ago, in the theatres, and i had never heard of Sam Raimi at the time. this film is an example of what you can do with a bit of money and a brilliant mind. using cameras, sound,editing and anticipation, what we have here is an engrossing, raw horror movie with a uniquely charming eternal champion. and i loved the special effects, which includes his use of sound and camera work. they weren't up to the block-buster digital computerized seamless stuff we see now, but for me this only added to its' charm. the film also didn't take itself too seriously either, which is always appreciated. i really like the character of Ash, and his progression from ordinary guy to cocky, evil dead fighter. as for Sam Raimi, it didn't take long to see just how gifted he is as a director, and i couldn't wait to see what he could do with a bigger budget. i think his track record now speaks for itself. this is a hard-core, for horror fans movie. i'm only guessing but i think baby-boomers who want to be scared will love this film. i also like seeing Bruce Campbell show up in Raimi films, like the face in the crowd in the last shot in Dark Man, right on up to his television shows and the power-tripping gate-keeper in Spider Man 2. He uses his brother in his films too,(aarrgh Henrietta!) nice to see, as well as seeing his partner's wife in cameos in his other films( great punk look, xena). i understand that Bridget Fonda asked Sam to give her a small role in Army of Darkness because she is such a fan of the movies, and probably of Mr Raimi as well, whom she worked with in A Simple Plan. great film. my understanding is that he has written the screenplay for an Evil Dead 4. this is great news to me, and makes sense considering how Army of Darkness ended. Army didn't scare me, but i loved it all the same. i don't know what to expect from a fourth one....scarier than hell or campy fun, or both? i say, bring it on! he wont have any trouble getting real money for #4, which he didn't need in the first three to make them so truly great. so, trust me on this. if you love horror films, check out Evil Dead 2, dead by dawn. i wouldn't watch it alone either. i don't care how macho you are. it's an engaging roller-coaster,fun ride. not for the uninitiated and not for Sleepless in Seattle-type fans. this is pure, classic, camp with a great ending.",Evil Dead II

228,andrewnmiller,The prefect mix of horror and comedy.,10,25 July 2017,"Now, I wasn't super-pumped about watching the first Evil Dead film, but it turned out to be pretty awesome thanks to it's atmosphere, Bruce Campbell, and it's usage of music, so by the time I watched Evil Dead 2, I was completely engrossed in this series and where it was going. As with the first film, Evil Dead II is a total blast from it's usage of comedy and scariness to Bruce Campbell and it's music.The movie kicks off with Ash Williams and his girlfriend, Linda going taking a trip to a supposedly vacant cabin in a forest. During their stay, Ash listens to a recording of the former resident, an archaeologist quoting segments from The Book of The Dead which awakens an malicious force that murders and then takes control of Linda who proceeds to attack Ash, compelling him to behead her and entomb her. Ash is then taken over by a demon, but when morning comes, the evil flees and Ash returns to normal and tries to leave but the only way out has been demolished. Meanwhile, the professor's daughter and her research colleague return with more pages from the book, only to discover that the bridge to the cabin is gone so they enroll the help of two locals who show them an alternative route, but once they arrive they find Ash battling the demons all while trying to keep his head straight, now the five of them must destroy the evil before it's too late.If The Evil Dead introduced us to the talents of Raimi and Campbell then this movie is the film that shows us the first one wasn't just some one-hit marvel and while the story of Evil Dead 2 is identical to the first one, the second one buries it's precursor in the dirt, it's better in every single area. As with the first movie, the low budget is clearly shown but it's the love of the craft from all the people that worked on this movie and who withstood unfavorable filming conditions and limited finances to give us something truly wonderful. Sam Raimi and the crew clearly had a objective to push the envelope of filmmaking as far as it would go without veering off a cliff; of course, the concept of people being trapped in a far-flung locale and being killed off one by one isn't that new of an idea given how the first Evil Dead movie invented it and has become a mainstay in horror films to this day, the way that it's filmed and written that makes this film such a classic.The violence of Evil Dead 2 is even more gruesome and bloody than it was in the first one with tons of be-headings, people getting stabbed with things, bodies being ripped in two, and lots of blood and goo everywhere and while it may seem incredibly disgusting, it's all done with a signature zany manner that makes all this gore a lot less winching and more hilarious like when a character is pulled into the cellar and a tsunami or blood comes pouring out.While the first one was more of a straight-on gore fest with some dark comedy thrown in, the sequel ups the ante when it comes to the humor like when Ash battles with his possessed hand which leads to something straight out of an episode of The Three Stooges with the hand repeatedly punching Ash, bashing plates on his head, and ending with Ash cuts his possessed hand off with a chainsaw making for one entertaining scene but the first half on the film then wraps up with one of the most hysterical moments I've ever seen on film in which parts of the inside of the cabin start to wiggle and clatter with evil vibes and in the space of a captivating minute, no more than 8 diverse laughing outbreaks, even Ash and the furniture, fill the place, this dreadfully tricky scene will certainly make the viewer feel a bit thrilled after it ends and even if the jokes scattered throughout the film fail to keep you howling with laughter rather than shrieking in horror, the movie's tiny budget will make sure that nothing will direct you to run out of the room screaming your head off.Having more money at their disposal, the visual effects look a lot better then the first one although by today's effects values, some people will find them laughably terrible, but in my honest opinion, the inventiveness that Sam and the crew put into the effects still looks wonderful today with a delightful mix of old-school make-up, masks, scary monsters, the usage of stop-motion, blue screen, and models which runs the complete range of practical effects needed to bring the world of the Evil Dead to life. The scene where Linda's headless corpse rises from her grave and then waltzes around is a perfect example of old stop-motion and while it does look a tad corny, it's still extremely creepy to watch, certainty better then the cheap CGI used in the Ring 2.When it comes to the actors in the movie, they all play their parts well but It's truly Bruce Campbell who makes the movie such a treat to watch. As with the first one, Bruce isn't playing the strong-armed hero or a super intelligent spy, but rather an normal guy who becomes a hardened bad-ass and goes into battle against the undead and yet completely steals the whole movie with spells of first-rate zaniness, insensitive weakness, over-the-top scene chewing, and irregular bravery, making him one of the coolest movie heroes ever to grace the big screen, the scenes of him battling the demons are pure cheese.Go see this movie at all costs, you will not regret it.

231,Ziggy5446,"Extremely cheap, yet well crafted film: loads of great scenes!",7,9 April 2007,"Sequel or remake? There has always been a huge debate whether Evil Dead II is a sequel or a remake, since the second film contradicts the story that occurred in Evil Dead. Such as, the ending of Evil Dead ends with Ash being chased down by the evil spirit which deceased the other characters. However, after the paraphrase of events at the start of Evil Dead II, which only features Ash and Linda and Ash is once again hit by the same evil spirit. That's where the story begins in the second film.So, the book was destroyed in The Evil Dead, whereas it appears again in Evil Dead II. This certainly isn't a huge factor. Actually, if one can recall James Whale's 1935 masterpiece sequel entitled Bride of Frankenstein. There is no question that director Sam Raimi used the Whale masterpiece as the blueprint for his sequel. In Bride of Frankenstein, the film starts with a prologue that recaps the events of the first film, however, completely contradicting the entire ending of the film which is where the sequel starts. I understand that Raimi was going through legal issues, so he was forced in this position to contradict the first film, but he certainly used the way that made Bride of Frankenstein the classic in remains. Not to mention, in Frankenstein, it is a straightforward horror film, whereas in the sequel it is a macabre, satirical film that uses the blend of horror and black comedy at it's finest. No doubt Raimi's Evil Dead II uses the same concept.So is Evil Dead II a sequel or a remake? It is undoubtedly a sequel! A fairly good one as well, that in many ways surpasses it's original prototype. It's certainly not one of the most visually inventive, relentless, and truly original films ever made as some claim it to be, it's not even one of the top films of it's very own genre. However, it remains one of the best full-on gore slapstick's ever seen. The script is witty, and well written (mostly on the part of Scott Spiegel). It's no secret that one of films main inspirations was The Three Stooges, along with many other slapstick comedy's. Though it's director Raimi's unbelievable POV shots, weird lighting, stop motion animation, moving hand held camera, etc. that makes the film work.That being said, Evil Dead II just isn't a grade-A horror film, it isn't on the level of the classics such as, Peeping Tom, Freaks, Nosferatu, Vampyr, The Phantom of the Opera (silent), The Man Who Laughs, etc. It does not have much of a plot. It has very little acting, little continuity, and no logic. Evil Dead II is a classic cult horror film in every sense of the word. You simply have to come along and experience it for yourself.",Evil Dead II
232,Medacakathareal,All but a one man show,8,4 May 2008,"After watching Army of Darkness and fully enjoying it I figured I was obligated to watch the other two Evil Dead films. The first struggled to be a real horror movie, can't say it was all that great. Evil Dead 2, however, is a great film, and a good 75% of the film is all Bruce, holding his own. Even scenes where Bruce gets attacked by some creature or demon he is the only real actor there, creating a few classic slap-stick comedy moments as he is essentially beating the crap out of himself.Gore to a hilariously excessive degree makes any in danger of being grossed-out remember that its just a movie... This may be the funniest horror movie ever made, with a wit sharper than Freddy's twisted sense of humor. Some moments left me haunted and disturbed, Ash's dead girlfriend dancing and the lullaby of the possessed mother in the cellar, but for the most part the film is far from serious...This film really awakened my deep love for practical effects, which I had all but forgotten in this age of movies over polluted with CGI. While the effects seem painfully simple, that makes them all the better...The best part of the film, undoubtedly, is the creation of the hero who is ASH. The chainsaw and boomstick are in supporting roles and the battle for survival is on. If this movie doesn't have you laughing, cheering, and mentally disturbed by the end then something is wrong... Classic, easily equal to Army of Darkness...",Evil Dead II
233,SamuraiNixon,Slick and stylish -- a perfect Christmas movie.,9,9 November 1999,"What would Halloween be without ghouls, phantasms, or Bruce Campbell? The Evil Dead series has a fanatic following akin to The Rocky Horror Picture Show and UHF. In the spirit of all cult picks, it has its own idioms and terminology. Evil Dead was scary, but Evil Dead II with its over-the-top gore and a sense of humor, which is sorely lacking from most horror films, became an underground classic and turned its leading character Bruce Campbell into a cult hero. Think of Night of the Living Dead meets the Three Stooges.Ash (Bruce) takes his girlfriend up to a deserted cabin. What harm could there be in borrowing a place for the night? However, evil incantations are said and his fiancée becomes one of the living-impaired. He is forced to dispose of her and in the meantime is attacked by a powerful force that lives in the woods. For the better part of the film, the phantasm is never seen. We see through its eyes as it follows Ash knocking down trees or trying to break through doors. This is always a good approach to horror, because the fear of the unknown and not showing the specter right away is psychologically more terrifying. It is very effective and frugal for low-budget films. In most horror films the creature seems silly and the audience's fear is taken away.Later in the film, we get the superfluous humans who come to the cabin to find out what happened to dear-old archeologist dad. He wrote them that he had found the Necronomican (sp?) -- the book of the dead. Now these friends and family of this archeologist are going to be fodder for the apparition. They will be turned into 'deadities', the living impaired, so that Ash can dispose of them in interesting and shocking ways. Ash has to live to see the sun light or he will be dead by dawn.What sets this film apart from others in its genre is style and humor. In one scene, Ash's hand is possessed and he has to cut it off or the hand will do him in. After he lobs it off with a chainsaw and it escapes its imprisonment from a pail covered by the book, Hemingway's Farewell to Arms, it runs amok like an evil Thing from The Adam's Family. This scene is played off like a Three Stooges skit and the possessed hand alludes to Dr. Strangelove.Try to find all of the movie's allusions. The many horror ones are obvious -- all of George Romero's films, several unknown B-films, the original Evil Dead, and mucho, mucho mas. Now try to find all of the Scorsese allusions.
I like this film on a multi-faceted level. Bruce's performance is an understatement of panache and ruggedness. The over-the-top gore is done with stylistic humor. The humor helps the more squeamish viewers. The direction of Sam Raimi is quite good. The sequel Army of Darkness is a good movie too. This film is entertaining to watch and not just around Halloween. Just watch it with the lights off and a chainsaw next to you.",Evil Dead II

235,bhicks56,Another Case of Cabin Fever,9,3 December 1999,"Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell reunite for this ""follow-up"" to the goriffic hit EVIL DEAD. This is actually an improving remake of the first (pay attention to the familiarized story) that not only lets Ash ""win"", but also shows what happens with a slightly larger budget (thanks in large to producer Dino DeLaurentiis's investment). We get more sophisticated special effects, including a hand with a mind of its own (one of the BEST scenes in any horror movie). If one word could describe this movie it would be GONZO. The violence can be repulsive at first, but suddenly turns a bit cartoonish and you end up looking at some twisted cross between a George A. Romero flick and a comic book.Sam Raimi is a wunderkind when it comes to his camera, and he proves it best with his tricks here, along with its predecessor. Although ARMY OF DARKNESS is too slapsticky and considered the worst of the Evil Dead Trilogy, it is still, in my opinion, a worthy look. If you see all three of the movies in order, you will see the complete idea Raimi had for this movie.

238,milescorn,"Great flick, good laughs.",10,26 December 2001,"Take out the first five min. of this film and the last two min. and it picks up right where the first one left off with Ash going out of the cabin in the morning wearing the same blood stained clothes from the first movie and the demon busting through the house and hiting Ash. Then at the end Ash goes into the time warp where he ends up in the past. Then if you take out the first three min. of Army of darkness, it picks right up where 2 left off and what you have is something that all sequels miss, the whole story from start to end, put them all togather and it runs about 249 mins. and you'll never stop laughing or holding on to your chair. My hat's off to Sam Rami who has done something very few directors have done, and that is make a full trilogy that is better than any other horror film in the history of the cinema. No other film can do that. I would love to see Evil Dead 4 with Ash back at the University and S-Mart fighting off deadites because he didn't say every single word right. But for the most part Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is the best. See it for yourself.",Evil Dead II
239,TheLegendOfThe42,Iconic and gruesome fun,9,2 September 2020,"Taking up his impactful ""Evil Dead"" from 1981, Sam Raimi delivered a fantastic reimagining of his vision.Within 10 minutes, ""Evil Dead II"" manages to descend into absolute madness of the best kind, with a protagonist that became an absolute horror icon. I dare you to find another example of a perfect blend of horror and comedy, a wildly free camera that serves as the second protagonist and a more influential low-budget, basically one-location film.In my opinion, it was this film that cemented Sam Raimi as one of the most imaginative and humourous genre directors of our time, and it hasn't lost any of its appeal to this day. Highly recommended!",Evil Dead II
240,Chris-332,Best horror movie ever!,10,23 February 1999,"Evil Dead 2 is most likely the best horror movie of all time. It's loaded with gore, it has over the top acting by my idol Bruce Campbell, it has tons of black comedy (though not nearly as much as Army of Darkness, its sequel). Evil Dead 2 takes black comedy where it's never gone before. A cult classic usually has an element of black comedy, but Evil Dead 2 has so much that it doesn't take itself seriously. This movie has taken horror to a new high. This movie has inspired many cult classics such as Dead Alive, a movie which also doesn't take itself seriously. This movie rocks!!",Evil Dead II
241,ShinKyo81,Bruce Campbell shines in the best terror movie of all times!!,9,14 September 2000,"After the succeed with Evil Dead I, Sam Raimi had to prepare a sequel as soon as possible. Five years after ""The Evil Dead"", ""Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn"" appeared with a great expectation.One curious point is that the film is not a continuation of the ""Evil Dead"". It's a remake of the story, quite changed but still the same base. Instead of being a pure frightening horror movie, Sam Raimi included the comical part of the action. And with the performance of Bruce ""The Master"" Campbell, the movie became an incredible success.The combination of Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi has created one of the best terror movies of all history. Evil Dead was the first and the best, Evil Dead II improved several things from the first of the saga, and the ""Army of Darkness"" concluded the Evil Dead Trilogy with a film full of adventure and less horror.But, in my opinion, Evil Dead II is the best of the three, because it's frightening & funny at the same time, Campbell rocks in the film with his outstanding performance, and the effects are very original and well-done for a non-commercial production.Just say that Evil Dead II is a must see for everyone who likes the horror genre!! 10/10",Evil Dead II
242,kimcoxmonm,Have an open mind to appreciate this movie.,7,1 October 2021,"In my opinion, you had to have grown up during the time a movie like this was made and have an open mind about the style intended. I enjoy reading positive reviews from younger people who are seeing them years later and have that appreciation of a time when you had to rely on practical effects (the lower the budget, the worse they were) and battles with the studios over content and very few options for ratings.I think practical effects are far more impressive, no matter the budget, when you had to use your imagination and your hands to create the effects. Though CGI can be impressive, it's still being programmed into a computer. I'd rather see someone's ""art"" in creating creatures and gruesome body parts than someone who created with CGI.This movie was meant to be cheesy and over the top, that's what makes it great. It was outside of the box and it grosses me out and makes me laugh at the same time. That deer head or when Ash ""fights"" with his own hand are classic. The copious amounts of blood is obscenely overdone but that's the point. It's as fake looking as it is because they were trying to avoid an X rating; didn't work so it's unrated and through ""Rosebud"" pictures.These types of movies aren't worth giving a crappy review on because it's redundant - of course it's a crappy movie, it's suppose to be. It's like bashing ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" because the wires were showing or the daytime/nighttime changes in the same scenes. It's an extremely low budget trainwreck that you can NOT look away from. They are not meant to be thought provoking-cinematic masterpieces.They are simply light hearted - or heart ripping - campy fun.",Evil Dead II

244,Ore-Sama,Worthwhile Sequel,7,23 November 2007,"While this film overall isn't as entertaining as the original, it's still a worthy sequel that get's it right:keeping enough and changing enough.After an inaccurate recap(for many reasons out of their control)the film begsn right where the original leaft off with Ash exiting the cabin at sun rise. However, the rising of the sun means little as Ash is trapped in the woods still. Add onto that a group of people come to the cabin to check things out, getting caught in the middle.The biggest problem with this film is not the more comedic tone. The biggest problem is all these new characters. They are the most annoying bunch of twits to ever enter a horror movie. The film would've been miles better if Ash was leaft alone to deal with these demons. They really bring the film down. The cast from the original weren't exactly 3 dimensional but they were likable at least.As for the tone of the film, I'm sure even those who haven't seen it have heared that it's a much different breed. While the film took on an overall dead serious tone with some cheese, this one is all about cheese and guts. It surprisingly works. There are some very hilarious moments in this film and watching Ash transform into his action hero esquire self that would take over ""Army of Darkness"" The effects are more polished then the original and the acting from Campell improved, although I can't say the same for the other actors in this bunch. The make up is equally as good as the original, and to top that all off is a uinque, darkly comical ending.",Evil Dead II
245,brainofj72,The Dawn of Splatstick,8,28 October 2005,"Shaun of the Dead. Undead. Dead & Breakfast. Bubba Ho-Tep. Without Evil Dead II, it is more than likely that none of those films would exist. This film really did usher in a brand new form of both horror and comedy. A form that is now lovingly referred to as ""splatstick"".Before I even begin the plot summary, I will say that if you have not yet seen The Evil Dead, DO NOT watch Evil Dead II. By no means is it a stand-alone film. That said, the story is of Ash (Campbell), the hero from the first film, who, like in the first film, must do battle with evil demons summoned by the ancient ""Book of the Dead"". That's really about it.So what is it that makes Evil Dead II so special and so different from The Evil Dead? What makes it more than a cheap rehash? The answer is simple: humor. The Evil Dead was a low-budget classic of frightening, gory horror, and while there are certainly some very funny moments of extremely black humor (it somehow manages to make a man decapitating his girlfriend with a shovel seem hilarious), it was a rather intense and horrifying ride. Evil Dead II, however, is just the opposite. It has moments of frightening horror, but it is really a screwball comedy reminiscent of The Three Stooges (whom director Sam Raimi is an avid fan of). Gags include a projectile eyeball flying into someone's mouth, guffawing possessed furniture, a possessed headless corpse putting a chainsaw in its own neck, and my personal favorite, a sequence involving a possessed severed hand and a copy of Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell To Arms. Trust me, it all sounds much darker in writing than it is in the film; it's all quite light-hearted (as much as possible considering the subject matter, anyway). This type of bloody macabre humor would come to be known as ""splatstick"", and would be utilized in many more films to follow.Yes, there were a few splatstick films prior to Evil Dead II (Re-Animator comes to mind), but what really sets II apart is its sheer inventiveness. Everything just feels so fresh and exciting, even today, as the film is approaching its twentieth anniversary.And of course, no review of this film would be complete without at least one reference to B-movie icon Bruce Campbell's performance, which can only be described with the word ""awesome"". He's not quite achieved the level of bada*s-ness he's at in the second Evil Dead sequel, Army of Darkness (which is in a class all its own), but he's getting there.Evil Dead II's influence is widespread and undeniable. While it is personally my least favorite of the Evil Dead series (I look to The Evil Dead for horror and Army of Darkness for comedy; II feels like a slightly diluted mix of the two), it is still a classic and essential viewing for any self-respecting horror fan.8/10",Evil Dead II

After losing all his friends to flesh-possessing demons, Ash is forced to continue to hold up in the cabin and fight off the demons. However, when a group of strangers arrives at the cabin, Ash discovers that one of them may hold the key to stopping the demons once and for all.Evil Dead II is a great follow-up to the original gore-fest. The film does change in it's tone, but the dark humor is fantastic. The special effects are also great. The acting is, as like the first, awful. However, Bruce Campbell is perfect.Even though it's been thoroughly explained many times, people still insist that Evil Dead II is a remake. All one should do is skip the first 7 minutes of simplified recap, and watch on. It's a sequel. They didn't add a ""II"" at the end just to sound cool.In the first film, Ash was rather wimpy. However, in Evil Dead II, he's just sick and tired of the constant onslaught of demons, and he becomes the ultimate movie badass. From his chainsaw hand to his sawed-off shotgun, Ash is finally the guy that you don't wanna mess with.So, all in all, Evil Dead II is awesome, about on par with the first.

And thus playing with camera-work to create the illusion that there is something happening.In this sequel, which is partly a remake, we see some of the same scenes as in The Evil Dead, but made with more money. Sometimes good, sometimes not so good. But Raimi adds something more to his film. Ash, the main character, was kind of a wimp in the first film but now quickly grows into a mean moron who is a wonder in one-liners. If you want too see a movie with historic one-liners (and hilarious scenes), you should see this one. At one point in the movie, Ash just keeps spitting them out. Again this is a nice masterpiece from Raimi, who sets his name as the inventor of horror movies with humor and also develops the character for the third film.",Evil Dead II
253,mazec666,Ash comes back for seconds.,10,15 April 2013,"Five years after releasing his horror masterpiece ""The Evil Dead"" onto unsuspecting moviegoers, Sam Raimi returns for a sequel along with Bruce Campbell. This time it would have a higher budget ($3.6 million), different cast members, an aspiring make-up effects team and a slapstick tone that would contrast itself from the original film.The always strapping but irregular Ash Williams (Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda (this time played by Denise Bixler) are about to have the hellish weekend stay of their lives. Once again, they unwittingly play a dead professor's recordings of mystical summonses from the Necronomica, better known as ""The Book of the Dead."" When his girlfriend unexpectedly gets possessed by evil forces, Ash becomes trapped in the cabin with no means of escape until four people show up. Now teamed up with the professor's daughter (Sarah Berry), Ash faces a one-man battle against the forces with only his chainsaw-hand and a sawed-off shotgun. Will Ash win the fight and get the girl, or will he find himself in desperate peril? ""Evil Dead II"" is one of the few sequels, especially in horror, that managed to be as great as its predecessor. The film adapts to broader, more comical characteristics such as laughing furniture, a runaway possessed hand and several memorable one-liners: ""I'll swallow your soul!"", ""Groovy!"" etc. As for Bruce Campbell, he gives another great performance as an older but wiser variation on Ash Williams. Instead of the meek innocent Ash from the first film, Campbell is now prepared, armed to the teeth and a lot more muscular. Despite these additions, it never managed to sacrifice some of the darker aspects that made the original a classic.Gone were the primitive make-up effects from Tom Sullivan, the task for that position was handed to Mark Shostrom along with three Pittsburgh natives, Greg Nicotero, Robert Kurtzman and Howard Berger. Their cutting-edge creations such as the Possessed Henrietta and Mr. Rotten Apple Head are brought to bloody life on a limited budget with fewer resources. The reason these effects hold so well after nearly two decades was because the less money you have, the more creative you are.Off to encounter the ""Army of Darkness""!Possessed Henrietta: I'll swallow your soul, I'll swallow your soul!

It is interesting how this movie has divided many horror fans. Some don't like the comedy aspects of the film, and some of us seem to feel that it fits in pretty well with the over the top nature of the story. I am one of the latter horror fans. Let's face it, the first movie was a great horror movie, but how much more could you do with it? Would you rather see a sequel in which Bruce Campbell is attacked by demons for an hour and a half? Sam Raimi did a great job coming up with ways to keep it all fresh, and the comedy was one of those innovations. All that said... I still like the first movie better. One thing that part II does better than part I is the character development. The characters are a lot more personality driven in this installment. Hats off especially to Dan Hicks for the greatest redneck role ever captured on film. I'd love to see him in something else.While there are shortcomings here, this one still makes it into my top 10 list (along with part one). A final note: If you've seen part I and then see part II but don't like the comedy angle... don't see Army of Darkness because you'll hate it.9 out of 10",Evil Dead II

How could this be funny?  Trust me, it' hilarious.  Camera work, jerky movements, over-the-top special effects, and most importantly, Bruce Campbell.

It's much more like a comedy. The black humor is hilarious but at the same time it is still scary. The horror is more psychological than in the first one because it shows Ash (Bruce Campbell) slowly going insane.The film was quite weird though because I wasn't quite sure if it was a sequel or a remake. It can't be a true remake because the story is not the same as in The Evil Dead but on the other hand it wouldn't make much sense for Ash to go to that cabin again (He obviously didn't like it up there the first time).Some scenes are very funny as for example Ash fighting his own hand after it turned against him. But at the same time it was very spooky too. There are more effects in this sequel but I think The Evil Dead was more interesting to watch because it was made on an almost non-existent budget.Evil Dead II is a very carefully-made sequel and if you liked its predecessor you won't be disappointed by this one either.My rating: 10/10 (Go for ""Army of Darkness"" to see the best comedy ever!)",Evil Dead II
261,Lunchbox-8,"A funny, violent cult masterpiece",8,21 May 2001,"Evil Dead was a somewhat funny, scary, and cheaply made movie that definitely brought back a hefty profit.  Evil Dead two was even better. Perhaps the greatest of the three Sam Raimi zombie films, it is definitely the funniest and was a little bit less of a sell-out movie, so to speak. I'm going to turn to Kevin Smith for a prime example in the thinking of saying that Army of Darkness, although an awesome movie, was still reeking of selling out while Evil Dead two was pure genius (well...): Clerks, the first movie in the Jersey trilogy featuring the charcaters Silent Bob and Jay and all written and directed by Kevin Smith.  Clerks was a materpiece in independent film making.  It was deeply insightful, hiarious, and overall entertaining.  It was made in a distinct style that quickly famed Kevin Smith.  Mallrats: the next movie in the Jersey trilogy, was a little bit more of, as said before, a sell-out movie.  It was made entirely not to provide deep theme or insight, but to make money.  That is what Army of Darkness is to Evil Dead two.  Evil Dead two is a pure, funny, gorey movie that shouldn't be missed if you're into ""scary"" movies that just end up being funny.",Evil Dead II

You can't take a movie seriously in which a sawed off hand gives it's former owner the bird. It's almost as if the writers of ""the Naked gun"" dropped by for a visit. Almost a replica of the original, the story follows the same road as in the first. Ash drives to a cabin in the woods with a new girlfriend, accidentally brings the demons back to this world and hell breaks loose again, only to make the movie become one big joke. First of all, it's totally incomprehensible why Ash would even THINK about setting foot in a cabin again, let alone willingly speak out the lines that would bring out some evil force. Did he suffer from amnesia after what happened to him the first time? It's almost as if Sam Raimi, the director said: ""ignore the first movie, and start with this, then go see Army of darkness"".If his intention was to make a comic book like horrormovie, he succeeded. The brilliant photography is almost another spirit as it races through the woods, tilts and spins. Bruce Campbell is fantastic as an anti-hero, especially when spitting out one-liners. However, never is this movie scary or shocking as the first movie, and that's always what i go for when watching a horror movie. As a spoof it's hilarious, as horror it's only average.

When more people arrive and become possessed, he is forced to arm himself with a chainsaw, which he attaches to his arm in place of his hand, and a shotgun, which he carries in a holster. Ash faces off what is revealed to be the ultimate evil in this highly entertaining horror sequel. Let's break it down.I watched Evil Dead 2 for the first time when I was very young, shortly after seeing the 1981 original. I thought the first film had a unique charm about it and was definitely imaginative, but other than that I was never too crazy about it. With that in mind, I popped this film into my VCR with fairly low expectations. Let me just say that I was blown away by the amazingly captivating story that unfolded before my eyes. The structure of the plot and the way it was told was simply extravagant. Ash quickly became one of my favorite horror characters of all time with his transition from a cowardly nerd to a heroic, one-liner spitting, chainsaw armed, shotgun toting action hero. The solitary woods setting gives the entire film a very gloomy and hopeless mood, which definitely works to its advantage. This is by far my favorite horror film (and possibly my favorite film in general) of all time, alongside ""Return of the Living Dead"". This is a must-see, or better yet, must-have for every horror fan in existence. This gets a solid 10 out of 10! Groovy!",Evil Dead II

This time around, in addition to terror, Raimi showcase his comedic genius as well. This is one of the few movies I've seen besides the Godfather II, and Aliens and Terminator 2 where the sequel was superior to an original that wasn't half bad. Bruce Campbell is amazing as Ash, and gives a wonderful performances as the square-jawed hero. This is similar in tone to the darkly comedic Roger Corman/Vincent Price collaborations based on Poe's stories such as Masque of the Red Death except, arguably, better. Raimi uses some great camera techniques similar to the ones in his first movie (the good old strap a board to a camera and run technique was pretty much invented by Raimi). The special effects are great too. A absolute must see for horror movie buffs and those with a strong stomach and a dark sense of humor, as well as anyone who's ever read a comic book (Raimi's visual style and the manichean notions of good/evil are heavily influenced by that). The only cons to the film are its basically a remake of the first film with the newly introduced comedic overtones (so some might feel like theyre watching the same movie) and a larger budget. Quite honestly, the first film was scarier since it lacked comic relief.

Fortunately, 'Evil Dead 2', doesn't fall into this category. 'Dead' proves to be as funny as it is gut-wrenching.  The plot involves a man (Bruce Campbell) trapped in a cabin haunted by hellish demons.  Sure, some of the scares are standard horror gimmicks (i.e. zombies, severed hands, etc.). No matter, the film's strength lies in its satirical approach toward itself.  Most of the horror in the movie is purposefully made over-the-top and it works, in terms of humor. It's also a kick to watch Bruce Campbell, who also starred in the first 'Evil Dead', act like crazed psycho throughout the movie. 'Evil Dead 2' provides plenty of laughs for those with a strong stomach. Rating: (7/10)",Evil Dead II
271,Ash-89,One of the greatest movies on earth,10,8 April 1999,"The story of ''evil dead II, dead by dawn'' is basically the same as the first evil dead. The major difference is the way that Sam Raimi(The greatest director of all time) directed it to become of one the most visually interesting horror movies of all time!! The camerawork is devilish and plunges the spectator into the demence that Ash, exquisitely interpreted by Bruce Campbell, experiences after playing a tape who wakes up the evil dead, who was hidden far away in the forest. This movie is also very funny, with references of the three stooges,like most of raimi's movies, and contains some good one-liners but not as much than in Evil dead III:Army of darkness. This movie is so concentrated  ,like the 2 other evil dead movies, that you cannot find it boring!!",Evil Dead II

This is not a bad thing but I just prefer a more serious horror film. Now thats not to say its not scary because it is, It just has a few funny segments of humour. Overall though Sam Raimidoes a amazing job. Overall 8/10",Evil Dead II
273,sbrobin,What a horrible horrible movie,2,1 July 2001,"**SPOILERS**I enjoy Sam Raim's work on Xena, and am also a small fan fo Bruce Campbell, so I thought I would rent this film to see why everyone liked it so much. I don't care for horror movies that much, but had heard this was a ""cult classic.""  What a mistake.  This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I wanted to turn it off after 10 mins but figured I'd sit through it and eventually I'd ""get it"" and start to enjoy it.  I didn't see any comedy in this film.  If there was any, it was well hidden.  There were a couple of funny scenes and some lame one-liners by Ash that came off as humorous, but nothing that made me crack a smile.The sound work in this film is quite possibly the worst I've ever heard. I watdched it on video and you couldn't make out what people were saying half the times when other things were going on. One of the Deadites in the film is quote obviously using stock sound work of a bunch of chimpanzees.  Maybe Raimi does this as a joke, but it seems more like he wanted it to be scary, since it is covered fairly well.The majority of the film didn't make sense (what is up with his wife's locket, what is that thing that keeps coming at the cabin, why does his hand get posessed, what did he kill when he shot a hole in the wall and blood poured out, how do you kill the deadites, what makes someone a deadite, etc etc etc).  SPOILER: At one point, Ash turns into a deadite, and then a few minutes later he turns back.  WTF?!  What makes him turn into one, that he got bit?  Is that how it works?  And why does he turn back to normal?  Why does Jake turn into a Deadite when no one even touched him?  If the deadites want these people dead, why don't they turn all of them into deadites? This movie made NO SENSE. It was FILLED with plot holes, and for the first time in my 25 years of watching films, I saw one that had NO CLIMAX.  There was nothing at the end of the film to cheer for or even be upset about.  It's like they ran out of film and just said ""okay, we'll pick up where we left off with the sequel.""  It's amazing that Raimi can make such good work now, and back then it appears like he made EDII without ever having seen a film before.I wanted desperately to like this movie, but the horrible visual and audio quality of it, combined with even worse acting (not Campbell's best) and no story made it impossible.  I didn't find anything humorous about it, and must have missed every single joke that everyone else seemed to get. Watch at your own risk.However, I will be renting Army of Darkness to see if Raimi can improve upon the story any with a higher budget and more experienced actors (I still have faith in Campbell).",Evil Dead II
274,Was-it-All-a-Dream,Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn (1987),5,6 May 2009,"Sam Raimi's 1981 masterpiece, The Evil Dead, is a seminal film in the horror genre. It was extreme for its' day, pervasively atmospheric, unpredictable, wild and original, inventive, sharp, scary... It's the kind of film that you know was going to breed a sequel at one time or another. As every successful film in the genre seemed to have a sequel to it by the mid-80's, and Sam Raimi had too much talent and ingenuity to let sit idle. So, the old team decided to reunite a second time making a feature. Well... while many fans will try and convince you that this film was magic, to me it felt more like microwaved leftovers from the first. There are many reasons I'm sure that this film was so disappointing. One I'm told, was the result of controversy the original stirred over audiences being shocked by the scene in which a female character is sexually violated by a tree. It remains a sole flaw in the original, it went too far for pretty much no reason at all. It personally never disturbed me, but that's because it looked so silly and wasn't even recognized by the music score (unlike similar scenes in something like, The Last House on the Left).Another reason is that some people had a problem with the graphic mutilations and gore in the original. But one of the things that made that film so great was that it mixed terror with large quantities of gore. And it was good-looking gore, too. Even where some of the makeup designs of the zombies was primitive, they're still a lot scarier than what we get here. For this sequel, it appears Sam and company thought they could generate the same level of terror by trimming down gore and doubling on the wacky, speeding camera-work, and admittedly very freaky editing. This I think backfires. Now, the editing is the only thing that generates any scares and the camera-work is the only impressive thing about the movie. Although this sequel hired more skilled special effects technicians, the zombies look terrible. The best thing here in fact, is how creepy they make objects in the cabin look. The film's best scene features the inanimate objects altogether erupt in a spontaneous bout of laughter. Which brings an unbelievably creepy deer head on the wall to life. In the original, the zombies were the scariest thing (other than the creepy woods, but that's before you saw any zombies) and they knew it. Here, they don't seem to know how scary that deer head is. Why couldn't that have attacked someone?Next, I've heard Bruce Campbell go on about how upset audiences were that the film begins with a short re-do of the original's plot. They had plans to just edit-in clips from the original but couldn't get the rights to them because New Line was being stubborn (and I always got the idea that they were really generous with horror filmmakers). So they shot a new prologue, which retells the original story as though it were only Ash and his girlfriend Linda who went up to the cabin, instead of them and three friends. I could accept that, if Raimi hadn't decided to play up the character of Ash. This sequel is more a personality showcase for the crazy guy Bruce Campbell was cultivating than a terrifying movie, like the first film was. There's a lot more emphasis on his facial expressions, physical comedy routines, and one-liners than in the original. In fact, what one-liners did he even have in the original? This is another big problem. In the original, he wasn't a hero. He was just another victim, one who managed to survive the longest. It's not the fact that it's different that's a problem. It's that it isn't nearly as good. Like the third film, Army of Darkness, Dead by Dawn exists more for Campbell to show off than to really scare people.People have already said this functions more like a remake than a sequel. But, considering it as a remake- why remake it? You should never mess with perfection. This film is too different from the original. For example, part-way through the film, they add four characters out of nowhere. Seemingly just to have more potential victims to slaughter (not that I'd call anything to happens to the victims in this movie slaughtering). And if three of them aren't the most annoying characters in any horror film I've ever seen before- I'll go out, buy a hat, and then eat it! Now, I would say ""especially the backwoods, redneck hicks; the ignorant, overall-ed, black-toothed, most likely inbred, banjo-baby Jake and his bratty, whorey, too-pretty-for-him girlfriend Bobby-Joe,"" but there is actually someone three times more annoying. Annie the archeologist's daughter (she might be one too, I don't know). The movie does make us like Bruce Campbell (what's the point in calling him Ash anymore? He's really just playing Bruce Campbell), so it's a waste of time to do this whole sub-plot of her walking into her father's cabin, her father being missing, and her assuming Bruce killed him, so she goes psycho and wants vigilante-styled vengeance.The movie does have a few creepy or cool moments. Particularly- anything involving the deer head, the intro narration about the 'Book of the Dead' with some very cool animation, and a short sequence where Bruce talks about the woods and what he thinks is going on out there. Oh, and there's a little thing about a glowing spirit that warns them about something- I liked that quite a bit. And the sequence where Bruce goes into the basement to ""find"" Henrietta. It's scary for about a minute. The silliness of the movie really does kill it. And you know something? 1986's House was silly enough to take care of my ""silly horror"" fix for almost the rest of the decade. House also feels a lot more original than this does.",Evil Dead II

I really liked the original, yet nothing prepared me for just how insanely gory and awesome this flick was. I don't really remember the plot, but it doesn't matter at all. This movie was gore. That's it. No plot, just pure unadulterated gore. Just the way I like it. Spoilers ahead: Some of the insanely cool gore effects in this film included a headless body slicing itself in half with a chainsaw, a bloody, deformed possessed fat chick spinning on the ceiling, and some chicks face being squished to the point where her eyeball pops out of its socket and lies into a person's mouth. Wow. A lot of ""Spiderman"" fans don't realize how disgustingly gory old Sam Raimi movies are. Well, that's all I really have to say. This movie ruled.",Evil Dead II

Evil Dead 2 is sort of like a sequel/remake if that makes any sense. Evil Dead 2 is about Ash heading up to an isolated cabin in the forest with his girlfriend for a little R and R. Things go from 0 to 60 when Ash decides to read a passage from an ancient,evil book. Then we are introduced to a group of people that are also headed to the cabin to research the book when they find a bloodied Ash spinning strange tales of possession and death. Soon the vengeful demons come back for another round but this time the group is prepared and they put up quite a fight.I personally like this one better than the original but that is just me.

This is really the story of Ash's coming-of-age, although the possession story works too... But oh, what to talk about first? I suppose I should say that Bruce Campbell (who I just discovered went to high school with my mother) was shafted out of the Academy Awards for this movie.  And since he is the heart of this movie, plus the Coolest Human Being On The Planet, I feel that that says it all.

If finishing this movie and you still want more, try out Army of Darkness. Sure like any other movie it has it's goofs, but it all just adds to the enjoyment of the movie to noticing these things.

I can understand if you missed the original, this may be entertaining... no, I can't understand.  This movie tries to be funny and scary, but succeeds at being neither.  Watch, rent, and buy the first one, but leave this one alone.  This movie is the definition of a ""set-up"" movie.  How can the director get from ""Evil Dead"" to ""Army of Darkness""?

You have more money than you know what to do with and you're a little bit shocked by the fantastic response your first ever movie created. So what to do?? Well, surely the answer is obvious. Go and remake the first one, only with a bigger budget. WOOHOO!!! If you've seen the Evil Dead (1) then the storyline will be hauntingly (hehe) familiar. The only real difference is, better quality all round, a little more blood (well, you can never have too much blood) and a sublte movement of toungue, now pressed more firmly 'in cheek'. In summary: Bruce Campbell (King of Chin) screams a lot, comically falls over a lot, cuts off his hand and generally acts smoother than a frictionless-moleskin.

290,Ospidillo,Not for Baby Boomers!,2,27 January 2008,"Baby Boomer alert! This horror flick is not for us -- it's for X-generation viewers and younger. Why? Because it is NOT in the least scary.If this is actually a SPOOF of horror films, I relent and give it three stars for my generation of viewers. But I don't think it IS a spoof. I think that they meant for this to be a shocker. The younger crowd should really just ignore this review because you probably have a very different basis for gauging this film.Here's what the film is about: it's a cabin-in-the-woods remake/ripoff of the old B&W original of ""Night of the Living Dead"" with an additional caveat... the producers tossed in every possible type of monster, moving pieces of monsters, evil spirits, demons, Texas Chainsaw Massacre Guys, and so on. The action is akin to that found in the second half of ""From Dusk 'till Dawn,"" (a film that I liked a lot!) The sound track is little more than a generic sound effects recording played in reverse, at various speeds, manipulated with digital delay. I think I might also have heard a variation of backwards ""Revolution No. 9"" in there at one point. All in all, not terrifically innovative.The story: A guy and his gal travel to this evil cabin and, as the legitimate residents aren't there, they help themselves to the place. She gets taken over right away by the evil spirits from the so-called Book of the Dead (he should NOT have played back that tape recording!!!) and the guy ALMOST falls to the same fate but he continues to drive the critters out of his system.Sometimes he outruns them in his big 4-door GM automobile, sometimes he outruns them on foot, and finally, the sun at dawn nixes them for the day. But the bridge is out and he cannot escape this rotten spot on the planet.The daughter of the legal residents and her husband come along a bit later and attempt to visit her parents at the cabin but, again, the bridge to get there has been utterly destroyed by some of the ""creatures"" (only God knows which one DUNNIT!); however, a half-witted, local Hillbilly-type and his chickie agree to take them in via the secret back route for a few bucks. All travelers to the evil cabin soon regret THAT unfortunate trip! The reason that the movie makes little sense to older horror fans is because there's no ""for-certain safe spot"" from these multiple monsters (the cabin is somewhat safe, sometimes !?!), nor is there a standard means of killing them. Sometimes, the following are effective to nullify monsters: double-barreled shotgun, sunlight, chainsaw, knife, bludgeon, etc. Sometimes, none of this works for crap.We finally learn (from the semi-good spirit of the original male resident) that our heroes have to read a certain passage from that dang Book of the Dead to rid themselves of all the monster-demon chaos, so I was at least glad to hear that there was finally one clear way to end this misery.So, the group battles on and on with no apparent plot on which any of them can ride. And is it a SPOILER to say that the main guy is suddenly sucked into a Time Tunnel near the end of the flick which lands him in the middle of a pack of Medieval knights who are being attacked by a Pterodactylish Demon-headed Gargoyle??? ""The Exorcist"" is scary. Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is scary. ""Halloween"" is scary. This film is as scary as ""Exorcist, The Heretic,"" (Exorcist II) with Richard Burton.... but there is some decent head-mashing-type humor dribbled here and there. The film is also well-made, strictly in terms of picture quality and for its letterbox format.A final comment.... this film appears to be the prequel to ""Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness"".",Evil Dead II

It also throws in a rare mixture of comedy to the boil, which contributes highly to my 7/10 rating.It is a VERY well-made horror film; fantastic camera-work, realistic blood and gore, and the actors chosen are perfect for their roles, especially the sexy young Bruce Campbell as Ash; although in this film, you are made to not care for the victims.Is it as genuinely frightening as films like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Ring""? No. Sometimes it is extremely scary, but the main aim is not to scare the living bejesus out of you like I've heard the first one did, but to make you laugh as well, and the result: it works better than I had ever imagined.I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good laugh, and likes their horror movies extremely gory.

Despite it's title and appearance this is a remake, not a sequel. It was a bit disappointing to me because I, naively, had waited for another horror movie, and instead I get a clumsy, and confusing slapstick comedy, which doesn't seem to make much sense. It isn't all bad, though, Bruce Campbell is funny as the main character Ash, and he does his best to make the visual jokes as funny as possible. Unfortunately, most of the funny parts are unintended, and therefore a bit clumsy. But for those who liked the first Evil Dead, and payed close attention to it there's a lot more in store. Funny references and inside jokes towards the first Evil Dead are plenty and most of them are pretty good. SPOILER For example, when Ash hits a monster with an axe, you only see the shadows of the blood and gore, which was shown so graphically in the original. This kind of reflects upon the whole movie, not as gory, not as scary, but done with slightly more taste and style than it's predecessor, allthough that isn't very much. If someone who didn't see the original saw this he/she probably would hate it, but those who have will probably notice the same (and more so) tongue-in-cheek attitude of Evil Dead I, and the numerous inside jokes.

303,orangestar,Classic? Maybe not,4,5 April 2006,"I'm going to preface this by saying that I haven't seen Evil Dead 1 or Army Of Darkness, so I'm taking this movie at face value. I can't compare or contrast it to either its predecessor or its sequel.I watched this movie when I was in the mood for something scary...not hokey. I also watched it with someone who had seen it before and felt the need to warn me before anything happened. But even disregarding these factors, I didn't enjoy this movie. The one-liners for which this movie is so often praised were not only predictable, but they weren't funny. If I had to use one word to describe Evil Dead 2 it would be Boring.There were a few bright spots, however. Bruce Campbell is undeniably charming as Ash. The other actors were forgettable, but Bruce is a legend for a reason. Also the 'monsters' were well done and satisfied the need for a bit of gore in this flick.Overall, I rated it a 4. Maybe if I saw Evil Dead 1 it would improve the experience....then again maybe not.",Evil Dead II

I found some parts from this movie to be somewhat very scary like that semi driving demon voice and awkwardly, that tree rape scene was sort of scary as will; don't know why it's scary and it had to somehow freak me out. I have to admit that I think 'Evil Dead 2' makes no sense, but it's very enjoyable; kinda of like those cheesy slasher films that have no good plots but are pretty much watchable. At the end, I thank all the cast and crew that worked on this film.",Evil Dead II
305,Dr_Drew_Says,Dr. Drew says... 8 out of 10,8,26 September 2013,"Evil Dead II (1987): The Good, the Bad and the HeroicSynopsis: Classic ""go to abandoned cabin in the woods and bad things happen"" style of movie starring Bruce Campbell, who reprises his role as Ash Williams. Technically more of a reboot than a sequel, the movie follows Ash and his love interest back to the little cabin in the woods where another reading from ""The Book of the Dead"" makes things rather interesting for its new inhabitants.The Good: Honestly, if you can't watch this movie and have a freakin' blast doing so.... I don't know what is wrong with you. For starters, don't take yourself or the movie so seriously... life, and this movie, are better that way. Raimi takes the concept of the original film and sort of reboots it (which can be a little confusing upon first view). It's basically the original Evil Dead on steroids. The result is a MORE over-the-top version of the original where Ash is now solely in control of the screen time, which is a marvelous thing. It's almost like Raimi and his writers are sitting in a room thinking, ""How much ridiculously awesome stuff can we throw on the screen? Okay, yeah... let's do all of this!"". It's brilliant. He leaves nothing on the table and the result is a wild, wacky movie with a frenetic pace. You just have no idea where he is going to take you next and it's a hoot. Also, the fact that he centers the movie around Bruce Campbell was a wise decision and ultimately makes it comparable to the original. If a different casting decision is made, this one is likely forgotten and Army of Darkness never happens.The Bad: Well, the fact that it's basically a retelling of the original story (or maybe ""re-imagined"" is a better way of saying it) is a cop out of sorts. Most would think a sequel (thus the name of ""Evil Dead II"") would pick up where we all left off. But no, Raimi instead revisits old stomping grounds. If he had failed to come up with new ideas, this would be a big problem, but thankfully, the acting of Campbell and the wild imagination of Raimi save this movie and honestly, make it very comparable in quality to the original - which from me, is high praise for the sequel. Some of the effects are tad out of date, sure... but the fact that the film is a little more black comedy versus straight-up horror helps the film date a little better. The characters not named ""Ash"" are pretty boring as well. Or maybe it is just that they are overshadowed by Campbell's performance. Either way, this tends to bog down the later parts of the movie a bit.The Heroic: Speaking of Campbell's performance... it is one of the all-time greats. In a vacuum of performances, Campbell's is truly Oscar-worthy, which many might think is a ridiculous thought. Still, I can't think of a single other ""A-lister"" that could do what he did and bring more value within the confines of what this movie is. In fact, Bruce Campbell IS the movie! Watching him slowly go insane is one of cinema's true pleasures. Campbell lays it all on the line and not for a minute does he disappoint. His catapult to cult status is no coincidence. It was well earned.",Evil Dead II
306,gold712,screw everyone who thinks this movie sucks,7,28 January 2000,"This is a great movie! Not as gory as the first, but who cares. This one is actually a horror/comedy, also a sequel/remake. Evil Dead II has so much more in it, that you forget it's really a remake. But in many other ways it's not.Let's get this out of they way. Yes, it is a remake, but hardly so. The film get to business very quickly. The first seven minutes of the film is kind of a retro of the first film. Then when the demons first possess him (but the sun scares it away) is right where is first film left off. Now the second epic really begins. But there are scenes that are back in there.SECRET: In ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", there is a scene where someone is watching The Evil Dead on T.V. In response to this, Freddy's glove can be seen somewhere in the ""fruit celler"".This film is really a comedy. What's more comedic than a man who has a battle with his own hand, or a laughing lamp. This is where the sarcastic side of Ash really kicks off. RENT THIS FILM!! A must-see for fans of horror/comedy like Braindead (also called Dead Alive).Rating: 7 out of 10 ""Groovy..""",Evil Dead II

308,stemage,"Nothing more than simply ""entertaining""",10,26 October 2001,"Evil Dead II is one of my favorite movies but not for the quality of the movie necessarily.  Surely not for the acting and storyline.  People that tear it to pieces don't realize what was put into it, what movies were out at the time, and really don't have an understanding for what goes into low-budget cinema.  People that are in love with Evil Dead II have an undying appreciation for what is in the movie.  If you're looking for Oscar quality acting, you won't find it here, but the directing is amazing, and it's hilarious.  There's a reason they used green blood (MPAA), you can see the set and strings if you look hard enough, and Bruce Campbell is one of the best overactors in the biz (next to Jeffery Combs).  If you haven't seen it, check it out, just because everyone should, just know what it is ahead of time.  It's in my opinion, one of the most ""ENTERTAINING"" movies of all time.  It never gets old.",Evil Dead II
309,le_chiffre-1,More a remake than a sequel; disappointing,3,17 September 2009,"Rather than picking up where the last one ended, Evil Dead 2 takes elements from the first movie and creates a new story that doesn't quite jibe with the old one. So it's more of a remake of the first than a sequel. But at the same time, it doesn't really stand up on its own and I can't help but think that someone who watched it without having seen the first would be lost; a lot of the references and inside jokes would go over his head.I found this movie pointless and don't understand why they bothered making it (other than the obvious financial motive, and to lay a foundation for the third movie of the series). As a remake, it didn't better or even equal the first or add anything original. It seemed like more of an excuse to mess around with special effects than anything, as there wasn't much in the way of story or character development. You could say it was ahead of its time, since like most current horror movies, it comes off like a long MTV video, with lots of gore and special effects, fast (too fast, IMO), jump cut editing, with the story taking a back seat.Bruce Campbell didn't bother me in the first one, but in this he was awful. His acting was self-conscious and he was trying too hard. I felt like I was watching a performance by a clown who thinks he's being funny but isn't.The comedic elements were less subtle than in the first. While I laughed at a couple of scenes (like the one with the meat cleaver), ultimately I was neither frightened by this movie nor amused by its attempts at slapstick. Bruce Campbell is no Buster Keaton or Jim Carrey, and Evil Dead 2 fails both as a comedy and a horror flick.The last 30 minutes were an improvement over the first hour, but only because by then it had turned into a prelude for the action-adventure-oriented third movie, with Campbell being a bit more credible as an action hero. (On a side note: Who came up with the rule that time travel always has to be depicted in movies as a tunnel or vortex?) The puzzling thing is that if they had chopped off the first 7 minutes of this movie, it easily could've been made into a real sequel rather than a remake and it would've been much better.Die-hard fans of the other Evil Deads or of Bruce Campbell might like this but I can't recommend it to anyone else. I sat drumming my fingers through most of it, wondering why they were wasting my time rehashing this material. This was one of those rare movies where I was tempted to fast-forward through parts. AFAIC, it wouldn't have made any difference if the producers had gone from the first Evil Dead straight to Army of Darkness and skipped this one.",Evil Dead II
310,MaybeTomorrow,They don't make them like this anymore.,9,17 January 2007,"Good old classic horror movie which delivers everything a horror fan wants. More blood, more limbs, more scares. Overall: More fun!Bruce Campbell returns as Ash, the foolish but cool hero who has to fight for his life and kill his friends when they get possessed and turn on him. KNB Effects Group (Kurtzman, Nicotero, Berger) really did an amazing job with this movie. The amount of monsters, limbs and all others kinds of special makeup effects alone is worth watching this movie.Once again directed by Sam Raimi.Funny, Scary and one hell of a ride! 10/10",Evil Dead II
311,DigitalShark1,A Stellar Sequel,7,20 October 2021,"Evil Dead II is a sequel that doesn't sound like it should work but it does. If I were to pitch a Evil Dead sequel that's basically a remake but with a much goofier tone to the point where it's much more a comedy than a horror movie.But nevertheless, Evil Dead II is impressive and so much fun to watch. Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams is single handedly the greatest part of this movie. He is so much fun to watch and the fact that he seems to be having so much fun playing it makes it so much better.You really don't need to see Evil Dead in order to see Evil Dead II, and while I still prefer the original, I can definitely see why so many prefer the sequel.",Evil Dead II

313,MisterAwesome,Definitely not as good as the first one.,4,15 May 2012,"I must say that I liked the first Evil Dead. It was original, fun to watch and had some really inventive parts in it. The second part of the franchise was just a cheap sequel/remake of the first one which just couldn't beat is predecessor in any way. A lot of the second movie looked like it was ripped out of the first movie and refurbished. Some of the scenes were almost exactly the same and made me feel like I was looking at the first one again.There is hardly any story to be found in this one. 'The book of the dead is found again and by listening to the tape recorder, the Evil is released on earth and tries to murder everyone brutally.' Where have we heard that one before right? All of the actors are very bad and I was really annoyed about how naive they were. The movie was predictable in many ways and even tough a lot of horrors have naive main characters this one was just ridiculous. They were running all over the place and there was no plan whatsoever. There was some hysterical shouting overall, but little emotion was showed by any of the main characters. There are only a few things I can praise this movie for: At first there are the great props, costumes and make-up. They look really great and make the movie watchable. People who have watched the first Evil Dead will know what i'm talking about. Second there is great camera work in this one, comparable to the first movie. It's very recognizable and gives an aery touch to the movie. If you've seen the first Evil Dead and are looking for a lot of the same then i suppose you should check this one out. Other then that i'd recommend you to stay away from it. I can see how people who liked the first one will like this one as well, but for me it just didn't bring anything new to the table. Overall, i was really disappointed by Evil Dead II and am definitely not thinking about seeing the third installment.",Evil Dead II
314,ThatSlackerOnSci-Fi,Groovy,9,21 February 2019,"If the Evil Dead is a great Horror passion project, the Evil Dead II is a masterclass of a sequel. Taking all the passion and unique style from the original film, this film is the refining and perfection of that. Whilst we again get to see Ash go insane, we get see to see a man trapped in the house for a second time, no way out, there's no escape to the evil.What can I say though, the film is just a great Horror Comedy, it mixes the style, the stranger elements and refines them in a way that is funny but still keeps the same style of scares. It also holds one of the most iconic characters in the whole of cinema. The script, the effects, the direction and all the elements of the film are just incredibly well done.There are also problems I have with the film such as the way that the whole of the last film feels retconned due to the recap they had to make because of Sam Raimi and Co not having the rights to the footage from the first film but that's just a small part of the movie and allows it to stand on its own as a great sequel.Great Horror Comedy, on par or even better then the first, truly iconic.

Upon playing a tape in the cabin they're staying at, Ash releases an unseen force which brings the forest to life – and his weekend to a halt.Sam Raimi, now with a bigger budget, decided to employ all the over the top effects he couldn't afford when he directed the original. This remake/sequel is as good as it gets for most horror aficionados, but many argue its existence was unnecessary. It's the film that started Sam Raimi's career and a step into Hollywood for Bruce Campbell's chin (inside joke).The first film was made on a shoe-string budget and quickly reached cult status due to its creative use of very little. The second had a lot to live up to and it's not hard to see why the team were happy to rehash it.Direction: 9/10 (Sam Raimi is hungry for it. You can see him forming as a director) Cinematography: 8/10 (Peter Deming really used every part of the budget to make it work) Editing: 9/10 (Fantastic combination of shots to over-animate the performances) Acting: 8/10 (Bruce Campbell is the capital B in B-Grade acting.

Bruce Campbell returns as Ash and is delightfully hammy in the role. Everything he says and does, from the corny lines to his facial expressions, make me burst out in laughter. The other actors do a decent job, but Campbell just steals the show.Being on a much higher budget than the first Evil Dead means that the special effects are much more lavish and impressive than the first movie which really spectacular uses of animatronics and great monster designs not to mention the Ray Harryhausen style stop motion animations. It is a visual feast for the eyes.If there is anything that this movie has that is inferior to the first, it's that, having more of an emphasis on comedy, it is less atmospheric and spooky than the first Evil Dead which is a real shame, in my opinion however it is still entertaining and I love it more than the first Evil Dead.If you enjoyed the first Evil Dead and have not seen this movie, then it is a must-see, with hilarious slap-stick comedy, fantastic special effects and a brilliant main character.",Evil Dead II

Funny things can happen TO the monsters, but they themselves cannot be the source of the laughs, and that's the case with ED2!  The deadites are truly menacing and there are some great scares, but Ash the hero is the one who draws the laughs.

327,Our_Feature_Presentation,Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn,10,18 January 2014,"The movies plot is very simple, people trapped in a cabin while demons attack them, seams simple enough, but the crazy stuff that the demons do to the people make this movie immensely entertaining. The hero of the movie is Ash, and he's already survived the first Evil Dead and now he's the only survivor. but later on the owners of the cabin return to it and then they all need to fight to stay alive. The movies writing felt very natural in the way the people talked and interacted with another, but that doesn't mean it's without it's campy one-liners. The campy one- liners are all memorable and don't hold the movie back, if anything it helps the movie. Now the main thing about the movie that holds your attention is that you have no idea whats going to be thrown at our protagonist next. It could be trees attacking the cabin, your own hand getting possessed, or an eye popping out of a skull and into someones mouth, all this zaniness really keeps your attention and makes the movie very fast paced and enjoyable. The main character of Ash is one of my favorite movie character's ever because of Bruce Campbell's performance, he's able to do serious acting when needed and at the same time he's able to be campy when needed. Whats surprising for the type of movie this is, is how good the camera work is. You get so many shots at many different things that are all edited together perfectly. But the movies biggest strength would be most other movie's biggest weakness, and that is the flaws in the movie, the little imperfections. These imperfections work in the favor of the movies campyness and they make the movie perfect because you can tell that everyone working on the movie put there best effort into it. It showed that they didn't make the movie to make money, they made it to make an enjoyable camp filled horror comedy that will stand the test of time. This movies great for it's enjoyment, horror, comedy, camp, and all around the inspiration factor that says ""make your own movie to just make a movie"" my rating 10 out of 10. In the words of Roger Ebert the movie is ""Manic, inspired genius. A great time!"" and in my own words ""It's the most original, and entertaining horror film ever made""",Evil Dead II

He plays it, and the translations on the tape unleash some evil spirit, which possesses his girlfriend. Ash ends up cutting her head off with a shovel. A SHOVEL! Anyway, other people come to the cabin, and they all start getting killed. The acting was just brutal, I mean horrible. The only decent acting came from Bruce Campbell, though he didn't do a lot of talking until the other people arrived. So his part wasn't too difficult. The blood was largely exaggerated; blood spews from someone when they get killed, which doesn't realy happen in the real world (I don't know about the wide-world of film-crap.).

This particular chapter of the trilogy _ Evil Dead II _ gives us as much as you can expect from a sequel, and more. That is to say, you must expect more ghoulish demoniacal possessions; more hand-held camera movements; and more, much more BLOOD! However, Evil Dead II starts to separate it self from other movies in this genre (and its prequel for that matter), particularly in a growing non-sense comedy style witch very smoothly sets in. Although one might think that horror and comedy don't mix, Sam Raimi really pulled it off. For that purpose its clear that Bruce Campbell gets ""carte blanch"" with his character Ash. You can't help to laugh in some of the scenes inside the lodge with his over the top performance. But don't worry, because the horror and gore side of the movie is still there, all the way to the end. So, if you were a big fan of the first movie, and are not in the mood of something a bit different, don't watch this. On the other hand, if you can keep an open mind about it, then you'll get a great trip for sure. Enough said! I don't want to spoil it for you!",Evil Dead II

The thriller leaves off right where he first ended. It does recap in the first 7 minutes what happened before, but done a little bit differently due to legal reasons. The same guy, Ash, is stuck in the cabin after the spirits take over. while he tries to survive, four more strangers come along in search of the book of the dead, which when read causes the evil spirits to be released. As Ash tries to help defeat the demons, he is forced to cut off his own hand after it is possessed. The film makes you laugh and cringe at the same time. The make up for the possessed people is great for the time that it was made. I enjoy these types of movies. The film ends with Ash being sucked into some time warp and being thrown into some medieval time when the demons first took over. Thus leaving us to see the third and final movie, Army of Darkness.",Evil Dead II
332,mattyrowden,Great sequel,9,2 November 2020,This movie is very entertaining and fun good gore effects and Bruce Campbell is awesome as ash Williams who goes from scared to badass mixed in with a little bit of comedic elements but the comedic and humorous elements don't come off as well there surpassed too and just comes off as horror it only comes off a tiny bit also I don't like how they remake the first film in the opening 7 minutesPlot ash continues fighting deadites and the forces of darkness,Evil Dead II

Bruce Campbell is great, and it's the best film he ever starred. He carries the whole movie with his hyper acting.The plot seems unoriginal but how Sam Raimi has worked it out is terrific. His exaggerating style makes the viewer and Ash go mad. You'll laugh, you'll cry. But mostly you will love this movie. For many fans of the genre this is the best movie.The Evil Dead trilogy is one of its kind, the sequels are not based on the box office success of its predecessor like the Nightmare on Elmstreet series, Friday the 13th or Scream.

338,dogg01,The Greatest Film Ever Made!Tm,10,19 April 2001,"The Greatest Film Ever Made! This is my description of Evil Dead 2, you will probably want to ask why the sequel to a crappy 1982 gore-fest is the Greatest Film Ever, but I'll get on to that later.The film starts with a re-run of the first Evil Dead, only it has been re-shot. In this new version, only Ash(Bruce Cambell) and Linda go to the cabin, not five of them as there originally was. This pretty much renders the first film obsolete, but it should clarify that this is not a re-make, but a sequel. After this 'mini-Evil Dead' Ash is thrown through the woods on an unseen revolving crucifix. Then the film really starts.Ash is alone in the cabin, where he slowly becomes insane, and his hand becomes possessed (""Give me back my hand!"") It is at this point in the movie that the audience should realise that this is not a straight horror film. It is a comedy-horror. When Ash's hand is possessed we see the best pysical comedy ever seen! Easily beatng Jim Carrey beating himself up in Me, Myself & Irene. Then some people come to the cabin and the film shifts into blood-soaked high gear, and we are taken on a rip-roaring rollercoaster of a ride, ending up in the best set-up for a sequel ever!Now, you are probably still wondering why I have called it the Greatest Movie Ever. It is because no other film has combined so many genres and made it work. It has Horror. It has comedy. It has action. It has a bit set in Medival times. It has cheese(Bruce Cambell's performance in the first 5 minutes). There's a sort of romantic-thing going on between Ash and Linda (Yes, I know, It's disgusting). I could go on. To sum it up...Groovy...",Evil Dead II
339,FatChino,The Sequel to the Ultimate Experience in Grueling Terror indeed,9,13 September 2005,"This is the type of film we really wish we made ourselves before some else thought of it. It's intelligent but not entirely complex ... entirely enjoyable yet a serious piece of film making ... everything adds up to cult status. It's the type of film your uninformed friends (or mine at least, I'm surely surrounded by fools) dismiss as trash without giving it a chance.Raimi showed us the thrills, chills and blackly tinged laughs he could bring about in the first in the series on a virtually non-existent budget. Here with just that little bit more he retreads old ground but everything still works ... probably more effectively too! Seeing some of props used and slightly off production values (the 'muppet' headless girlfriend in the shed, the demon head stuck to camera attacking Ash towards the end, Ted Raimi's ripped old lady from hell suit and the quickest of glimpses of set floor boards during one stage of shooting) shows how Raimi was still constrained by budget issues.Seriously though, who cares ... this film has 6 different colours of blood, some seriously funny slap-stick scenes (didn't think I'd say that anytime soon) and a chemistry between lead Campbell and director Raimi that let the jokes flow freely.Campbell proves himself a master of face contortion, self-harm as well as flipping himself over! So many classic scenes in such a short space of time ... my favourite being when Jake is dragged into the cellar and a torment of pink blood comes pumping out. The camera work is as dynamic and as fast paced as in the first outing, the shot of ash standing by the remains of the bridge at the start of film standing out for its grandness among otherwise less cinematic shots.The film leads on nicely to the 3rd installment in the series with one-handed Ash getting sucked into another dimension to face the undead in jolly olde England (or something like that). It really is no wonder that the in-store geeks/pop-culture snobs of High Fidelty described Evil Dead II as the greatest movie of all time.'Groovey' indeed.",Evil Dead II

Maybe he should of chose a different vacation. Confusing to some people this film may be, why would Ash return to the cabin after what happened in the past? I would say this film is a remake of the original rather than a sequel. The makeup and effects are fantastic throughout the film, i actually think part 2 was better than the first, the same as Aliens was better than Alien. There are not many horrors out there, especially the 80's type, where the sequel was better than the first. The story line is very similar to the first film but more detail and depth is incorporated into part 2. The gore level is pretty good, i think sadly some scenes may of been cut or removed before video release, but still there are a good few demons and demonic creatures popping up throughout the film. The ending involving the tree was too much and for me totally ruined the end. The scene with the chainsaw and the eye of the tree was over the top and should never have been used, but still it was a brilliant film.",Evil Dead II

The story basically takes off where the first film left us, but this time the director and all his crew manage the perfect balance between comedy and gore/horror. The comedy is mainly due to Bruce Campbell's excellent performance as Ash, the stereotypical anti-hero. Combined with Raimi's unique camera angles, moving shots and great sense for directing this creates a creepy yet hilarious ambiance which doesn't disappear until the very end of the movie. The backup characters are all really funny and typically dumb, and all the monsters costumes and make-up are perfect. I think Sam Raimi is a great director, A Simple Plan being his best movie since ED2 so I just hope he forgets all about spiderwebs and starts working on Evil Dead 4.",Evil Dead II

While there, they come across the Necronomicon. Ash plays a tape recording of the book's translations, which awakens an evil spirit in the woods. From here on out, the movie turns into a splatterfest, but a very original one at that.

Best of all, the good guys all die!The second... well, even Bruce once said that they went the wrong direction with it and it didn't work.  Instead of a horror, we're given a slapstick comedy.  Scenes seems to happen because they wanted to, and it's UNfunny.What a waste.  My wife was interested in seeing this movie becaused she was suprised how good the first was, but she left after 10 minutes, and I finished it.  After it was done I had NO intention of watching the third movie because from the little I saw it was done in the same style.If you like the first one, that bears nothing on the second.  They are compeletly different styles of movies.I can't really make a recomondation because some like it, some don't.  You won't know until you try.

Grimly fiendish Evil dead 2 is a stylish comedy horror by director Sam Raimi who wrote and directed the original Evil dead and third film -Army of darkness. It's not so much a continuation from the first but more of a retelling gone into madcap extreme. The horror starts almost straight away after a quick introduction that is alike in essence to the first film. Dark forces are called up from the surrounding woods by the playing of a tape recorder when a hapless couple dabble with it. And so begins the start of a relentless horror which results in one man struggling to stay alive and safeguard his sanity. Ash-Bruce Campbell plays the comic hero to great effect. The zany camera work and atmosphere make the film both haunting and psychotic. All the ingredients in the film amount to make it the best horror show you will ever see. If not. You're going' down.

Its cheap effects and terrible acting only serve to emphasize the humour and irony depicted by director Sam Raimi. Not only does Evil Dead 2 completely retcon everything that happened in its entirely serious predecessor, it does it on a very low budget, which always leaves room for laughs. I may seem to be picking on this great movie, But I assure you every moment was enjoyed. From the second the legendary ""Ash"" cuts off his own possessed hand with a petrol chainsaw, I knew this film was destined for great things. Several buckets of fake blood and plenty of latex later I was not disappointed. Ranging from flying eyeballs, blood spewing walls, dancing corpses and of course a good old spattering of tree rape, Evil dead 2 completely re-writes the conventions of the classic B-movie. With its obvious tongue in cheek style and purposely bad narrative, this funny, action packed horror romp really did brighten my day. From start to finish you will be laughing and cringing at this masterpiece of film, and will want to watch it again and again.This beautifully made horror parody to this day remains a cult classic, so I recommend anyone reading this to go and invest in what I can only describe as sheer brilliance.",Evil Dead II

353,dwoolfe99,possibly the funniest movie of all time,10,9 March 2016,"**Some minor spoilers ahead**The plot of ED2 concerns a young man named Ash (portrayed brilliantly by Bruce Campbell) bringing his girlfriend to a remote cabin the woods. There, they find a mysterious and sinister book called ""The Necromonican."" They accidentally activate the book in a way that summons ""the evil dead"" - creatures which are either undead or demons. The rest of the film concerns their torment at the hands of these creatures.In one scene, Ash's hand is possessed by a demon. In a wonderful slap stick sequence, the hand, now with an evil mind of its own, begins to bludgeon Ash by breaking dishes over his head. Desperate, Ash decides to cut off his own hand. But the hand is still alive and menacing him, so he places it under a bucket, then puts a heavy book on top of the bucket. The title of the book: ""A Farewell to Arms."" To this date, there are still people who believe this movie was meant as straight horror. It is, in fact, possibly the most most hilarious movie I've ever seen.A sequel to the origin ""Evil Dead"" - an imaginative film which was nonetheless more horror than comedy - director Sam Raimi, operating with a slightly higher (but by no means high) budget than the original, really outdoes himself here. The camera work, editing and special effects are all meant to amplify the humor and camp, and all of it works beautifully. Interestingly enough, those who do not respond to the humor in this movie seem to find it incredibly scary as horror. So I would recommend this film to anyone who either appreciates black humor or simply enjoys a good horror film. If you don't fit into either category, you can skip it but then you're missing out on a true low budget classic.Props to those who recognize that when Ash says ""groovy!"" the actor is doing a perfect impression of Clint Eastwood.",Evil Dead II
354,RyanCamplin,Worst film I've ever seen.,1,27 January 2015,"This film really is terrible. I really liked the first 'evil dead' and was so excited to watch this sequel, (if you can even call it a sequel), but I was left extremely disappointed. The first film was scary, filled with suspense and plenty of gore. The ending of the first one definitely left the possibility open for a sequel and I couldn't wait. However, Evil Dead II really does not follow on from the first film whatsoever. I won't write any spoilers, but if you watch both films you'll see what I mean about the beginning of Evil Dead II being very confusing given what happened at the end of Evil Dead. The genre is listed as 'comedy, horror'. This is my main gripe with this movie. It is caught between both genres and achieves neither. Firstly, I don't understand why Sam Raimi decided to make this film a 'comedy'. The first film was a genuinely good horror film. Sure, the gore was a little over the top at times and I can see why some would have found it a little amusing, but to actively try to make Evil Dead II funny was a huge mistake in my opinion. There is nothing funny about it and there is nothing scary about it. It's just really cheap looking gore and stupidity. I have to admit I only watched the first 45 minutes because I found it so unbelievably bad. Who knows, maybe it redeems itself entirely in the last half an hour but I highly doubt it. This film has amazing reviews as well... maybe I'm missing something or it's gained a cult following due to its strange attempt at comedy; or maybe its simply because it's an old film and the good reviews are the result of Nostalgia. Either way, I simply don't get it and would not recommend this film to anyone.",Evil Dead II
355,camcmahon,An absolutely excellent follow-up to Evil Dead!,9,7 March 2005,"I have to say that this is definitely one of my favourite films of all time. Bruce Campbell gives one of the finest and funniest performances i've seen. The film's constant movement from one horrific happening to the next leaves you wondering how Campbell's Ash retains any threads of his sanity. Even when it's just him in the cabin dealing with a variety of gruelling experiences Campbell gives every scene his all, filling them with a strange mix of disgust and humour. The scene where Ash has the entire room laughing at him (including the furniture!) has to be one of my favourite bits, it's almost as if Campbell himself has finally lost it. Raimi's direction is superb, I love the rushing camera movements and angles. This is a great film which relentlessly throws comedy, horror and gore at you (and Campbell) in vast quantities. If you're looking for something which will entertain you, scare you, and gross you out at the same time then this is definitely the film for you.",Evil Dead II

362,ozborovac,Groove is in the heart,8,27 November 2017,"So, Jaws started the whole summer blockbuster, commercially successful US horror movie shebang with its dose of tense thriller action, socially relevant drama, gruesome horror and likable, down to earth heroes. Now take that satisfying horror formula, add a dash of Looney Tunes and lace it thoroughly with PCP and you might get a glimpse of what Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn has in store. The unhinged second chapter in the bizarre saga of Ash Williams is a true sight to behold.After the chilling gore-fest that was the first Evil Dead film, the question of escalation was surely on the production crew's minds. In comparison to the preceding two movies, the original was a fairly grim affair, one of those morbid low budget Gorenos that can make even the most callous horror-hound wince. So instead of upping the amount of bodily fluids being more or less willingly spilled in the next movie, they evolved the movie in an entirely different manner. The concept already was pretty absurd, so let's try to make a horror flick where people laugh with the weirdness instead of at it. The idea itself wasn't as novel, since there already were a number of successful horror comedies like Young Frankestein and Re-Animator, but the majority of them were nudge- wink genre spoofs or happy accidents when the humour is a result of the crew's over-exuberance or tenuous grasp on film-making. Evil Dead 2 is different in its zaniness, because it knowingly embraces its extreme violence and uses it as a method of furthering the story in its own disturbed way. The Setup? Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) takes his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) up to a cabin in the middle of a forest for some romantic R&R. Things would have been peachy had it not been for the Sumerian demon haunting said cabin. You can guess what happens next, relationship milestones get set back due to demonic presence, heads get chopped off and one's grip on sanity becomes ever twisted. The cause of all the mayhem is the Necronomicon Ex Mortis, an ancient tome that contains spells to open portals to the demon realm. The previous tenant, an archaeologist, unearthed the book and by reciting a number of passages aloud, unknowingly released the demons sealed within. So far - so typical. There is also a B-plot where the archaeologist's daughter tries to return to the cabin and befriends a pair of yokels along the way, but it's not particularly riveting when compared to the rest of the movie.While the story itself isn't exactly memorable, the execution is where the movie shines. Structurally, the movie is like a hellish cauldron in which a veritable treasure trove of set-pieces and ideas are left to brew. One minute, the movie can be a kinetic collage of short bursts of violent action, only to become a tense panoramic scan of the environment the next. A paranoia inducing tracking shot will be followed by an athletic Buster Keaton-esque gag. Anything goes in Evil Dead 2 making this movie a rich cornucopia of filmmaking techniques. Impossible camera angles and skewed crane shots are frequently used to give the movie an often vertigo- inducing sense of immersion. Every scene has its own tempo and visual style giving the movie a busy, almost euphoric sense of style. This movie champions the use of special effects as well, and a whole pallet of different techniques is used. Whether it's stop motion animation, deranged muppets, atmospheric matte paintings or room-sized latex monstrosities, Evil Dead 2 finds smart and hilarious ways to integrate special effects into the movie without feeling overbearing. All of these disparate elements might spell doom for a movie if there was nothing to pull the audio-visual madness together, but luckily the editing in this movie is something of small miracle. All of the movie's flights of fancy are miraculously blended together by applying a scare-a-minute approach to timing. The breakneck tempo of the movie is smartly balanced by interweaving the disparate horror styles into a cohesive whole that actually manages to streamline the traditional slasher-movie fare without feeling bloated. The second third of the movie is a prime example of that - focusing on the main character's slow descent into madness, the story just hones in on a singular continuous action scene that efficiently conveys both menace and humor. All of the scenes related to the possessed hand are cinematic gold, especially if you consider the fact that it's just Bruce Campbell with a little makeup on throwing himself into the furniture. And how could we forget the arguably single best moment in the movie –when Ash stabs his own hand with a knife and delivers the half victorious, half plaintive cry of Who's laughing now?"".Much can be said of Bruce Campbell's acting. It's a genuine treat to witness this hero with a soap opera heart-throb visage go, quite literally, insane. Campbell delivers manic energy by the boatload, and even manages to land all of the exhaustive physical comedy. And, of course, this man was born to deliver one-liners. The rest of the performances in the movie are par for the course when it comes to horror flicks, but it's hard to not get the feeling that this is Campbell's one-man show. The last third of the movie unites Ash with the rest of the cast, and at this point the movie does seem to slack a little bit. Or to be even more precise, falls into a rut of predictable slasher tropes. Group infighting, misunderstandings and forced tensions rise to the forefront, and stand as a stark contrast to the earlier, more unique parts of the film. This rut fails to derail the experience, but it can induce whiplash after the more intense middle part.In the end, Evil Dead is beyond recommending. This movie is deservedly a horror classic, and is absolutely worth revisiting time and time again.",Evil Dead II

I thought Evil Dead 2 wasn't going to be anything special at all, due to the mix of horror and comedy. I usually don't like when a horror film has some elements of comedy in it, but this time it worked.Evil Dead 2 revolves around Ash, as he brings his girlfriend Linda to the same house which he and his, now dead friends, were staying in, in the first Evil Dead film. They find this cassett, on which there's a spell being read by a professor. This spell awakens the demons out in the woods. Their first target is Linda, who becomes one of these Deadites. Ash finally manages to kill her, but that's not the end of it all. When he finds out that the bridge, which is the only way back, is broken, he has to stay in the cabin and fight the demons from the woods. But this time, weird thing happen to him - which are a bit funny. After some time, the professor's daughter and her entourage show up at the cabin and help Ash to kill the demons.I don't really know what it is that makes me like this movie so much, but it's probably Sam Raimi's brilliant creation of these demons and Ash, of course, with his chainsaw and shotgun - hilarious! Do NOT download this film, do NOT rent this film, but BUY the film! It's really worth having in your collection. This movie won't let anyone down, that's a promise :-D Evil Dead 2 gets a solid 10/10 - excellent",Evil Dead II
365,Spoonhui,Bruce and Raimi are pure Genius,10,10 January 2010,"Raimi is well known for his Spider man series but not as much as his evil dead series which is equally as good maybe even better.This is a gore fest mixed with great comedy and the cheesy quotations from Ash makes the film even more enjoyable.This film is remarkably much better than the original Evil Dead but don't be so surprised first read on By mistake i stumbled upon this film thinking it was actually a zombie film, sorry if you expected that but in all honesty its more of a ghoul kinda film. If no one agrees with me then write a complaint but to me a zombie is something that is slow, non Witty, dumb and don't talk thats not at all what is portrayed in this film.Acting is very over-dramatic but it's supposed to be so don't think you've bought a rubbish film when you switch on. Great direction from Sam raimi and definitely worth waiting for EVIL DEAD IV.If you want a good hour and so of gore slash and thrash then this is a perfect film for you, if you like black comedy same again, if you like old films then this again is the one for you. It's a true tribute to some of the best film legends you'll see. In some way you can kinda say this is one of the best horror films made if you can label it that.But anyhow this film is definitely in my top five films of all time Buy it, rent it and enjoy it 10/10",Evil Dead II

367,filmobsession94,"Not as amazing as the first, but still pretty amazing!",8,8 June 2014,"In the second instalment in the series we're back in the cabin in the woods with our main character Ash. After a brief introduction (it's not really an introduction. It's more of a short remake of the first movie, because most of the characters are missing) of what happened in the first movie we see Ash go back to his normal human state, but given the fact that the bridge to safety has collapsed he has to find a way to escape his undead girlfriend and all the other demonic creatures lurking in the forest.Evil Dead 2 is a great sequel and a great addition to the franchise. The story might even be better than the first one. We get more explanation on the reasons why all these strange things are happening whenever someone reads from the flesh-cover book. This adds more meaning to the series as whole, because things just happened in the first movie. There was no explanation why that book was in the basement;why people go mad when they read from it;why the forest was possessed. Most of those questions get answered in the second movie. It's good to have an origin story and with the second one that's what we get. It's good to point out that humour has a much bigger part in this, than in the first movie. It works much better as well.The acting, music and cinematography are all top-notch, as they were in the original. Those swooping forest shots make an appearance again, but they look much sleeker and better made.The movie has a lot of high points, but the special effects are right at the top. They're the main thing that has been improved from the first. The make up is a touch more realistic too, which adds to the intensity and the realistic aspect of the movie.The only bad thing I can think of is that it slows down around the beginning of the second half. Even though not as good as the first, the movie is a success and a must-see for all horror fans.Acting - 9/10 Cinematography - 10/10 Idea - 7/10 Joy - 8/10 Music - 8/10 Script - 9/10 Special Effects - 8/10 Overall Rating - 8/10Just as a last note, except a lot of weird things to happen in this movie.

368,jamie_hayden,A very confusing movie at least for me...,5,17 August 2020,I went in with the mind of the first original evil dead and all the glorious blood and gore that came with itI watched evil dead 2 not really knowing what was going on and what I mean by that was I didn't know if it was trying to be a horror or a comedy film. The 1st ED felt like a horror you knew what it was but with 2 I didn't know if I was meant to be spooked or laugh just left me confused.There are some brilliant scenes in this movie and I recognise they took the film edle hands directly from this movie along with other films going forward.Wasn't all that gory with many scenes cutting away from what's happening but it's obvious what's going onI love the character ash and his chainsaw but the story didn't really seem to go anywhereI wanted to love it after all the positive reviews but I left more confused suppose I'll have to watch the 3rd now to find out what actually happens or is that going to confuse me even more.Still don't know if this is a sequel or prequel,Evil Dead II
369,Minkymouse,One of the most imaginative films ever,10,13 May 2004,"I first came accross this film in a documentary on TV, and was desperate to see it. When I finally did I was definitely not disappointed and I have seen it many times since. It never gets boring because it is so eccentric, and I never fail to love watching it. It is both gruesome and hilarious, although it does get pretty painful at times. The special effects are fantastic, and the zombies are so evil and so entertaining, which is unlike most zombie films where they are, frankly, pretty boring. The bit where all the furniture and ornaments start laughing at Ash is probably my favourite bit, because it is so surreal. Bruce Campbell is just wonderful. He has a slightly cartoonish appearance which fits in with the whole feel of the film so perfectly.

375,mondo_kane,"The ""Ultimate Experience in Gruelling Terror"" Just Got Better...",9,25 July 2005,"Back in the day, when I had a full head of hair still and a growing lust for horror cinema, a friend gave me a battered-looking videocassette to view. The label read EVIL DEAD II in a faded red typeface. Being English, I had no clue what to expect, I'd never heard of the original EVIL DEAD as it had been swept up in the BBFC's roundup of so-called ""Video Nasties""(movies deemed likely by a short-sighted and infantile board of censors to ""deprave & corrupt""). Either way, the weekend arrived, my house filled up with friends, the tape went in and we were changed forever.EVIL DEAD II a sequel to the original EVIL DEAD  the tragic tale of a group of teenagers assaulted by demonic forces while stranded in a remote cabin in the wilderness. EVIL DEAD II replayed the entirety of the first film (with several differences) in ten minutes, then brought more young folk out to the cabin to get generally mistreated by the demonic powers circling their cabin refuge like sharks at a shipwreck. Our hero is Ash, an average, slightly dumb guy who's out at the cabin with his girlfriend Linda. They find a tape recorder left by the previous tenant (a history professor working on the translation of an artefact he has discovered), and upon playing the tape release a demonic force into the woods around them. Linda gets possessed, Ash decapitates her with a shovel and then gets possessed himself (albeit temporarily). Plagued by demon-induced visions and a Linda that wont stay in buried, Ash descends into madness. Meanwhile four more victims arrive in the shape of the prof's daughter, a fellow colleague and a couple of local hicks out to make a quick buck. The circle is drawn, the demon's attacks build up in pace, and you just know it's all going to end in tears.EVIL DEAD II is like a ride on the best ghost train imaginable. It does not let up until the very end. Even the most ADHD-gripped teen can appreciate how balls-to-the-wall this movie is. Each gag is rapidly followed by another. I use the term ""gag"" as this movie, despite being filled with gore and violence, is funny. I mean fall on you ass laughing funny. Even when people are dying you have a malicious smile on your face. People get drenched in blood and goo, accidentally swallow eyeballs, get possessed and generally go mental, corpses are reanimated, trees come to life and attack and disembodied hands run amok. All the while the movie's tongue moves not an inch from its cheek. If you don't at least crack a smile at this film, you're probably dead already.Without a doubt though, this is Bruce Campbell's movie. As Ash he steals the show with bouts of world-class lunacy, crass cowardice, hammy scenery-chewing, physical comedy and occasional heroism. Ash is indeed a superhero in the making in this movie, soon after to become one of the greatest horror heroes ever. When he finally gets his act together to become the hero and dons his hero's ""armour"" I defy anyone not to think they're watching one of the coolest scenes in cinema history. Ash might be an idiot, but you'd want him at your six if demons were attacking your neighbourhood.The script is at times a bit limited and clunky, and some of the other performances are minimal. Also the effects sometimes look seriously bargain-basement. It doesn't matter in the slightest though. This is a film made with real passion, a sense of humour, and no desire to do anything that scare and delight the viewer. It's horror from a simpler age; one not afraid to be silly or gross in equal parts. It's classics like this that have cemented Sam Rami's career as a director to watch long before SPIDERMAN. EVIL DEAD II is without a doubt one of the greatest horror movies ever made. And if you've never seen it, there's only one thing you can do. Go out now, rent the tape for yourself and join the rest of us in the world of the ""Ultimate Experience in Gruelling Terror"" Come on join us join us join us",Evil Dead II

The scene where Ash cuts off his hand cuz it went evil was pure genius. The slapstick comedy was tremendously funny as it always is. All the demons were just flat out awesome. The Animation was the best in a Horror film at the time and is still great to look at. A very good film for the low budget of $3,500,000. The film is one of those few horror classics that you can watch over and over again and it never gets old. Better Than the Original Evil Dead. Not to mention how awesome it was to see Ash go evil and try to kill everyone.CONS: The first 10 to 15 minutes was kind of on the boring side. The film seemed to be a remake even though on the back of the DVD it says he returned again to release the evil once again. They made a few mistakes in the film but its hard to notice. And it is semi inconsistent with the 3rd film ""Army Of Darkness."" The film ended.CONCLUSION: Even with all the mistakes, the semi-boreingness, & the inconsistanties; the film still takes my breath away, the good things about the film makeup for all the semi-bad.

Many others, on the contrary, are enthusiastic about it. Well, IMHO, the deal here is just to understand what this stuff really is, and if I had to describe it in one word I'd say it is ""grotesque"". Don't focus your attention on the horrific elements, not either on the funny elements, but rather on the total weirdness of the whole. Yes, this movie is a gem of weirdness, it's a caricature of a horror movie; it exaggerates the stereotypes of that genre, therefore ridiculizing them (but not necessarily presenting them as plain funny).The first one of the series I saw was... well, the last: ""Army of Darkness"", and I really enjoyed it as a comedy, so I managed to see this one, thinking it was pretty similar and guess what? I was disappointed 'cause I considered it more of a horror flick than of a comedy. Then I read the comments here and realized that for many other guys happened the opposite thing: they saw the 1st Evil Dead, enjoyed it as a horror, and expected this sequel to be something similar, but they were disappointed 'cause to them this looked more like... a comedy. What's the moral of this rigmarole of mine then? Here is: if you're looking for a horror movie get rather the first Evil Dead, and if you're looking for a comedy get rather Army Of Darkness; ED2 falls in between but nevertheless it got its own appeal, with its odd moments and weird hysterical characters (Yeah, Ash rules, but what about the witch in the cellar?).

Bruce Campbell's second go at playing Ash also results in a much more interesting character. He's more charismatic than in the first film, but avoids the cartoonish action-hero version of Ash seen in the third film.The movie is so full of memorable scenes that it's easy to excuse the occasional bit of bad acting or low production values. Besides, I don't even think the effects look as bad as some people claim.

The comedy has been upped though.The overall story is this: Ash (Bruce Campbell) and girlfriend Linda go to the infamous abandoned cabin for a weekend alone, in director Sam Raimi's trademark beat-up Oldsmobile (in practically every one of his films, with the exception of ""The Quick and the Dead""....Cause you wouldn't see one of those in the 1800's...). Ash discovers the Necrimonicon, the book of the dead, and its ritual dagger, and makes the mistake of playing the reel-to-reel tape of the owner of the cabin reciting verses....Which (surprise!) awakens the evil spirits and captures Linda. After trying to destroy Ash, it's off with her head, and I'd give everything away if I said any more.Surprisingly, more people know about this film then the landmark original, which sparked as much controversy as it did acclaim (it was personally reccomended by Stephen King), and one-upped the original by boasting a bigger budget, better acting by the front man (Bruce Campbell even admitted that in the first film he was still perfecting his acting skills and may have gone a little overboard), tongue-in-cheekiness, and an overabundance of gore, which all horror fans should be happy to hear.So, before I ramble on till Kingdom come, go and watch this movie.

The second of the three films is basically a remake of the first.  Once Sam had sold himself with ED, he gathered enough financial backing to make the second.  I mean let's face it the main character (Ash) is stupid anyway, but who returns to the same cabin a second time with another girlfriend !!I've always been a fan of Sam Raimi.  There are plenty of moments of slapstick throughout this film, wonderfully innovative camera shots/angles and even the speed of the movie is increased at times to give it that Benny Hill flavour !Have to admit I loved the scenes with the possessed hand.  He really did look relieved to chop the damn thing off.  Well wouldn't we all be !?",Evil Dead II
400,douglas.rae,Sickeningly funny film which should be on the 'must see' list for all fans of black comedies / horror flicks.,10,13 October 2000,"This absolute classic film was a real stomach churner for it's day. Although the idea has been copied many many times this remains the original black comedy horror film. The film, expertly directed by Sam Raimi, starts as it means to go on. Within 5 minutes of the opening credits, one of the main characters is dead and the other gets possesed. What follows is a real treat - a must see, and above all, a very very funny film. N.B. Watch out for the scene where Bruce Campbell tries to shoot his own hand and ends up almost knee deep in blood and goo! It has to be Cinemas biggest Blood-Bath!",Evil Dead II

402,rubix_cube2,Evil dead 2? SOUNDS GREAT!!,10,16 September 2006,"Well, since i only watched the movie last night, i can get straight to the point. This movie is fantastic! The first Evil dead was scary with lots of violence and gore. Evil Dead 2 has less gore, less violence and is funny! Sam Raimi was very smart to think about putting comedy in this great sequel. The good thing is that the comedy is not over exaggerated (Unlike like Evil Dead 3: Army of Darkness) so it keeps its horror genre over all. I would be lying if i said this movie was perfect, but it was pretty damn good! i was disappointed with the remake of Evil Dead 1. The entire first movie was crammed in fifteen minutes, eliminating all of the characters except Ash and Linda. Then it skips straight to the part where ash lops off Linda's head with a shovel when she is possessed. It made me think that all ash had done in the first movie was gone and it seemed that he had no experience with the deadits anymore. In about 15 minutes into the movie, it goes on from where Evil Dead left off. Ash gets hit with the unseen evil force and gets thrown against a tree. When he recovers, it is night time again and the deadits have returned. My personal favourite part is when he battles his own possessed hand. Evil dead 2 is the most perfect sequel for the most perfect movie. Sure, I thought Sam Raimi went a little too far when Ash starts dancing with the laughing lamp but, hey! It was funny! The ending is hilarious too.I recommend this movie to all horror and Evil Dead fans! The great thing about this one is that you don't have to watch Evil Dead to get Evil Dead 2.GREAT Sequel!",Evil Dead II
403,emepol,One of the best horror films,10,20 April 2004,"Wow!! I've seen this movie more than once, and I don't get tired. I think this is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. Why? Well, it has suspense, it has gore, it has a crazy directing by Raimi and an excellent acting by Bruce Campbell. Also, there are other things that has nothing to do with horror but are well used. First of all, the humour. It's excellent!! Moviegoers who love to see those 'Scary Movie' flicks, should see this film, and see how a film can take laugh of some horror cliches. In the bad side, I must critic the secondary actors. I didn't care very much about them and their fate... but, this is all about Ash, isn't it? :)",Evil Dead II

Sam Raimi has never quite matched the level of style and comedic timing he had in these films.And Evil Dead II, in my opinion, is the best of the series.  It is the perfect balance between grotesque horror, and three stooges-like slapstick.We are eternally grateful to you Mr. Campbell for giving the world Ash. Now let us pray for a fourth installment.",Evil Dead II
405,tomi_tikkanen,Sam Raimi oh why oh why?!?,1,5 December 2002,"I skipped a few lessons with my friends and we decided to rent a movie. We DEFINATELY wanted some ultra gory horror splatter flick so we picked Sam Raimi's Evil Dead 2 which I remembered having quite good rating at IMDB.We were prepared for some extremely gory blood orgy, but instead of that we got 85 minutes of boredom. I like b class splatters like Bad Taste, Braindead and Tales from the Crypt series, but this pile of junk doesn't qualify.Bad Taste was done with shoestring budget too, but it's full of self irony and WAY better special effects. Evil Dead 2 had its moments (an eye flying to that chick's mouth - priceless), but one or two good moments don't save a film.The whole time the film isn't quite *there*. It almost makes u laugh, but u are left disappointed in the end.3/10 (Seriously, if u like splatters, go and rent Bad Taste or Braindead instead of tormenting urself with this s**t.)",Evil Dead II
406,gideonsorman,"""Who´s laughing now, huh!?""",8,1 April 2003,"This is great! After a month of fighting to see this movie I have now done that. And the movie is great. This sequel is more like an ""Evil Dead I with a new budget"". Because it's almost the same things that happends all the time, but now it is done with much better effects. And come on; who can't resist to laugh in the scene when Ash gets a lot of whopass from his own hand (!!)... and also when he saw it off with the infamous CHAINSAW.A very good movie actually, I'm just dying to see the third one (Army of Darkness). I like it very much and give it 9 of 10./Cypher",Evil Dead II
407,mysteriousbhat,Best of the Trilogy,8,13 November 2003,"First and foremost, I want to say as a horror fan and a person who is intense with details, Evil Dead II is not a remake. Yes, Evil Dead II did take a lot of things from the original but that should not be taken as a negative. Most sequels from its originals do not stick with the formula, making the sequel not as enjoyable. When someone thinks of the best sequels, nobody can give you more than Terminator 2 or Godfather Part II. Evil Dead II fits in on the list. Bruce Campbell breaks out and shows his heroism in this movie. He is on the offensive, not the defensive like the original. With this in mind, it is clear that the spook appeal is gone from the original. Even with this said, Evil Dead II still contains the occasional jump-out-of-your-seat thrills.My suggestion is to not come into this movie thinking you will be scared out of your wits like the first one. Evil Dead II is rather a joke on the movie and horror itself, than a Halloween or Friday the 13th film that never seems to lighten up. Sit down and watch Evil Dead II for the enjoyment. The ratings for this film do not lie- IT IS THE BETTER EVIL DEAD movie. In wake of the Spider-man sequel coming out soon, you should not be worried. This movie is a good reminder that Raimi can pull of a better sequel that matches or surpasses the original.",Evil Dead II
408,Cactus737,Best horror movie ever,10,13 February 2015,if there was one movie that makes me wish I could go back to being 11 years old and watch again for the 1st time it's this one. Starting out as a terrifying demonic scare fest then with ash through his ordeals becoming a badass. I remember being one of the 1st kids to see this one right before going to summer camp and of course had all the other kids in my cabin convinced it was a true story and that happenened in these cabins. That the demons and necronomicon were real and still here. Convincing them that the counselor's all knew about the evil but were too afraid to mention it and that's why they slept in the locked main building and left us kids alone outside all night. Of course that came back to bite me when it was time to go to bed and my imagination would catch up to me and I would start to think what if I'm right and it's really out there😨? I guess compared to today's standards of human centipedes and hostel todays youth would probably find it bland but this one will always hold a special place in my heart.... The year I went to camp with the evil dead and survived =O. I have to wonder if I traumatized any of my fellow campers who hadn't seen this movie with my tales of terror about this movie lol. Eventually some of the kids were so scared they were moved to the locked main building and the counselor's weren't happy with me.,Evil Dead II
409,sam_authier,Fun Bloody & a whole lot of humor,10,23 September 2017,Even though the first film was a huge cult classic I feel this was stands out even more which I think is the true style of this Iconic franchise. My all time favorite part of this film & maybe others alike is that the fact to avoid a X Rating they use a variety of colors & Fluids for Blood Besides the Traditional Graphic Red we see in everything. This film I believe is the Apitdumy of What Not only evil dead films are but also true horror comedies. When I first saw this film it was when I was about 10 or 11 I believe first time I ever notice Horror Gore Blood & Grotesque Monsters was in the video game series Splatterhouse which scared the hell out of me even more than evil dead did.& so now of Day I'm a super fan of cult films that have this sore of stuff.,Evil Dead II

Along with some other people, Ash must destroy the evil and save the day!  Armed with a double barrel shotgun and a chainsaw attached to the stub of his right hand, Ash kicks some demon butt!",Evil Dead II
411,artstockton,why is evil dead II my favorite film?,10,28 December 1999,"I love evil dead II.  I first saw evil dead (the original) in the 7th grade. And it really was a disturbing and frightening film, for a 7th grader.  So when I saw evil dead 2 in a video store i had to rent it.  This movie is one of the first movies that made me feel like i was watching a live action cartoon.  Bruce Campbell plays physical comedy and cheese to a T.  And he looks like such a classic movie star while he does it.  This is only a horror film because the title says so.  It will make you jump, but it always brings you back with a laugh. The camera work in this film is brilliant, a total barrage on the senses. and few film moments are as disturbing and infectious as the giggling living room.  if you like this film you should try and find Raimi's film ""crime Wave"".  not as well made but it has its moments.  Also Cassie Wesley (Bobbie Joe in Evil Dead II--the chick that eats the eyeball.) is from my home town, and we are all ""backards hicks"" like that.",Evil Dead II

413,fearandloath555,Campbell is a genius,10,3 August 2001,"***CONTAINS SLIGHT SPOILERS*** I think this review is basically going to take the form of me praising every little thing Bruce Campbell does in this film. From laughing hysterically with a possessed lamp, to beating himself up in the kitchen, he is the main nerve of the film. The scene where his hand becomes possessed and drags him ever further towards a nearby knife sums it all up - more acting genius in that one hand then most ""big stars"" have in their entire bodies. Perfect delivery of one liners and facial expressions help him cope with this most unfortunate situation (all summed up in one scene, where he observes himself in the mirror - ""you just cut up your own girlfriend with a chainsaw...does that seem o.k to you?""). The supporting cast is great too, from the hillbilly and his obnoxious girlfriend to the innocent couple who arrive by plane half way through. Combined with the acting we have excellent camerawork, particularly in the scene where the unforseen enemy chases Campbell through all areas of the house - and the sheer idea behind this - seeing it from the monsters eyes - and the horror on the potential victims faces - all without the viewer actually knowing what this fiend looks like. Purists may bitch and whine, but this film does have everything, and thus is well deserving of 10/10.",Evil Dead II
414,wolfson-0714,"Really Bad, way different than first",3,10 December 2006,"so funny, so ridiculous. TERRIBLE it makes no sense whatsoever how ash returned to the cabin after his horrifying prior experience. so stupid. the book was back after it was thrown in the fire. this makes no sense. none of anything in the story does. the ending is the most laughable thing you'll ever watch. i hope the director who now directed spider man 1-3 knows it is not to be taken seriously. not scary, not really any gore, terrible acting i should spare you with the miserable plot but it should be stated: ash takes his girlfriend to the cabin and i don't know how he returned from the ending of part 1 and terrifying things occur while book of the dead researchers come to investigate while horrific things occur. themes and images are strongly suggested to not be viewed by young kids go rent the first one it is OK and way better. it is actually somewhat scary. only watch it for a laugh-Evil Dead 2.Rated NC-17 for Graphic Horror Violence and Gore, and for Explicit/Intense Zombie Images.",Evil Dead II
415,AstroZombie82,Blood-Soaked Insanity,9,7 March 2011,"Few movies have left an impression on me quite like this one. I remember after I finished watching it, my only reaction was, ""what the f*** did I just watch?"" It was one of the greatest movie-watching experiences I've ever had. Evil Dead II is quite simply one the greatest horror movies of all time.The first movie was a straight-up horror, with some sporadic dark humor thrown in. This one ups the comedy, but thankfully, not at the expense of the horror. Don't be fooled, there are some truly frightening scenes in this movie. And yes, the blood flows frequently, with one scene in particular possibly ranking as one of the goriest of all time. All different colors of blood and other bodily fluids show up along the way. But it's main influence probably comes from The Three Stooges. Sam Raimi's love of the The Three Stooges shows throughout the film's many comedic set-pieces. From a demon who can't stalk fast enough, to Ash fighting a possessed hand, and even some crazy antics with a flying eyeball. There are so many classic scenes in this movie, and all this is due to the absolutely awesome performance by a certain Bruce Campbell. This is the role that made him a B-movie legend; a role he was born to play. He would make an excellent Jim Carrey in some parallel universe, as he handles the physical comedy extremely well. The supporting actors do well in their respective roles, but Bruce steals the show completely.Everything from the masterful and innovative camera work, to the somewhat dated but extremely effective special effects, simply complete the package of what is one of the greatest horror / comedies of all time. Sure, sometimes the seams show, with various puppet strings and other goofs visible, but it's that same charm that elevates this movie to cult status. You owe it to yourself to see this movie, even if just once.",Evil Dead II
416,flicmaster,Better than the first one!,8,19 December 2003,"What a great movie. I feel sort of bad in that I regard this movie as a great camp- comedy more than a slasher horror. There is plenty of blood and guts to go around but ""...chainsaw..."" come on, that's just funny stuff! I know that Sam Raimi made the movie on the premise that it was a scary horror movie and it is, but I think of it more along the lines of a horror-comedy mixture. This is a good one to watch with your buddies late at night for a good laugh fest. This movie really is great!",Evil Dead II
417,adamcar,Not intended to only scare!,10,8 August 2003,"The first evil dead movie was a creepy little movie.  Evil dead 2 on the other hand is not just for scares.Sure, the movie has some creepy parts in it but it is more fun and acting than it is scary.  This is pretty much a remake of the first but this one has more fun with the story.  The evil dead series is converted from a horror movie to an action comedy.  The heart of the movie is really Ash who in this movie really has a fun character.  He is the wise ass demon killing tough guy in this one.  The movie is at its best when ever he has I fight with the demons.  I loved the first one but the second is much better and tons more fun.  If you like a horror movie that has fun and doesn't take itself seriously then get off your ass and see this movie.  It's a classic for all fans of horror movies.",Evil Dead II

But, if you haven't seen Dead by Dawn, you need to get to the video store immediately and check this one out.",Evil Dead II
419,wiggie-5,A Sequel Done Right,8,13 May 2012,"Evil Dead II (1987) shows us how a sequel should be done. Very few films can mix the genres of horror and comedy, but Evil Dead II manages to do this, and do it very well. It really can make you scream and laugh at the same time. The film has acquired itself a large number of fans.Bruce Campbell returns in his iconic role as 'Ash', the gun slinging, chainsaw-wielding, slayer of evil that we've come to adore. Ash is once again trapped in the cabin in the woods, and is once again fighting away the evils summoned by 'the Book of the Dead'.Evil Dead II is a 'retcon' sequel, meaning that it changes the facts from the first film. It's more of a retelling than it is a remake. This gave the film makers a greater degree of creative control, because they could make up the rules as they went along. If there was something in the original film that they disliked, they could completely ignore it. Likewise, if there was something they wanted to do for the first film, but were unable to, it could now be included.Evil Dead II doesn't have the same atmosphere or buildup from the first film, instead opting for going straight to the action. This makes it less of a horror film than the first, although it does contain enough scares to warrant a viewing from horror fans.In Evil Dead II, Ash is constantly battling his own demons, literally. Throughout the film he frequently becomes possessed, alternating between the characters of 'Ash', and 'Evil Ash', further blurring the lines between hero and villain. This amps up the danger from the first film, because Ash is now becoming the creature he's been trying to destroy.The fact that Ash is his own worst enemy is played up even further when his hand becomes possessed. This entire sequence leads to some great slapstick moments, breaking up the horror with bouts of laughter. It wasn't enough in the first film for Ash to fight just his possessed friends, but now he has to fight his own possessed body parts. If you can't trust your own hand, then who can you trust? Evil Dead II shows us what would have happened had the original film been created on a greater budget. The effects are better and the gore is slightly more realistic. The film still makes use of stop motion effects, which, while not having the same realism as CGI, is still a delight to behold. The acting at times can be cheesy, and almost deliberately bad. Like the first film, Evil Dead II is a parody on the horror genre by being intentionally cliché. It's aware that it's making fun of itself, and it has great fun doing so. Sam Raimi's creative camera-work also makes a return, showcasing an incredible ability to capture point of view shots.The amped up gore gives Evil Dead II an almost cartoonish quality. Some of the situations are completely implausible, but we can forgive them because of how amusing they are. The film is highly creative, showcasing new ways to frighten an audience.If Raimi has done anything, it's listening to his audience. He kept everything that audience loved, the grittiness, the over-the-top violence, and tried to implement something new, which is the slapstick humour. The film's ending, while not giving away too much, is very creative and sets things up great for the third installment.True fans of horror might be disappointed for the sudden change in tone, but Evil Dead II still packs enough scares to sway over most.",Evil Dead II
420,spacelime,The Freakest Wactrg,8,16 October 2014,"""The Exorcist"" made you feel respect and fear to the Devil. Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead II"" makes fun of the Devil and demon possession. Although there are some really scary scenes, there are some really twisted funny situations that would leave you wondering ""what the f*** just happened?!"". The movie is funny for the wrong reasons. I eventually don't laugh about when a man is breaking himself dishes on the head. I don't think it's funny when a man is repeatedly beaten up by grotesque characters. I would never imagine a man getting eaten by a demon locked under a cellar and throwing gallons of blood! ""Evil Dead II"" makes it look hilarious in a wicked kind of way. For example, when Linda's head tells Ash that ""she is being tormented, and suffering in hell; you can feel a little scared but the next scene has a corpse without a head holding a chainsaw. There's no time for logic here, just sit and enjoy!It also has the ability to make you feel tense and I must say, scared. The combination of demon possessed people, EVIL sounds (I love the weird noise in the movie), wicked laughs and chanting (""dead by dawn!""), and intrepid camera angles are the perfect ingredients to make a suit generous Horror-Comedy movie. Watch out for the ""A Farewell to Arms"" joke, the whole situation with the evil hand, and the eye that gets in a woman's mouth!.Sam Raimi went too far for the good reasons. He created an unbelievable and unforgettable work that has served as inspiration for many movies in recent years. The movie is easily one of the most visually stunning Horror movies of all time, for sure. Die hard fans of gore get an eye candy for an hour and a half. Raimi created a cult movie in all the sense of the world. ""Groovy!"". ""Dead by Dawn"" will never bore you because in every scene there's a feeling of uncertainty and that makes it even more interesting. There are no rules here. The plot is as scary as you can imagine but it's held in such a way that it isn't taken very seriously. I mean, demon possession caused by the Necronomicon is something that happens in the real world. Not exactly with that book but it can happen via satanic books and rituals. Raimi takes it to a different level of humor mixed with gore. Bruce Campbell deserves a special mention. He delivers a wicked, solid, and totally believable performance. Something you haven't seen before mainly because of the strange situations he goes through. His performance could be described as a ""solo"". Easily, one of the best performances of any actor in a Horror movie. Also, one of the characters that suffers the most in any movie! Ash is beaten up by demons, humans, objects, etc. Even possessed creatures make fun of him.",Evil Dead II

This threw me for a loop at first, but by the time Ash's hand was smacking him around the cabin I didn't care. Usually I would like there to be more continuity in both story and character, but Evil Dead 2 makes up for it by being just plain awesome. I did not like that they redid the tree rape from the first movie, because that was one of my all time favorite horror scenes.

433,meisill,The best of the trilogy...,10,30 July 2003,"When watching the ""Evil Dead"" movies you have to keep an open mind, and an open stomach. Being a huge fan of movies with lots of gore I can give you the statement that this is one film that doesn't shy away from the fun. Although the director, Sam Raimi, did in fact take a few steps (like changing the color of the blood) in order to avoid an NC-17 rating - and a lot of good that did, eh?The beginning of the film is basically the same (but revised) thing as the first ""Evil Dead."" Big-chinned Ash(ley) travels with his girlfriend to a quaint log cabin on, what seems to be, some deserted mountain. But odd things happen after he plays a tape recording that reads aloud passages from the Necronomicon: the ""book of the dead."" The primary difference between this one and the first ""Evil Dead"" is the group of victims that fall to the wrath of the evil dead. Rather than a group of friends, it is a group of strangers, who all get tortured in horrible ways (especially Ash) till either their demise or the end of the movie. One particularly lovely scene involves a headless, naked, female zombie ballerina dancer whom pursues Ash with a chainsaw.
Anyway I recommend this film to anyone who's a fan of the horror genre or anyone who just likes a fun ol' movie, but doesn't mind the sometimes extreme ridiculousness that comes along with it. But although this is a great film be prepared for major scenes of continuity.*Gore: 10/10*Suspense: 1/10*Overall: 7/10",Evil Dead II
434,thebakersfieldboys,"If you hate this movie, chances are I hate you.",10,21 July 2013,"To put my reviews in better perspective I read the one star reviews posted and I am pretty much disgusted. Here are a few thing you need to know about this movie: This is a sequel, it is not unoriginal because it was one of the first movies in the gorefest genre, and it blends horror and comedy. Now onto the movie itself. This is in an everlasting battle for my favorite movie of all time, with the first Evil Dead of course. I have an extreme respect for this movie no matter how ridiculous it gets or how despised it is. In my opinion this is probably one of the easiest horror movies to watch because unlike most horror films it has a story, characters who can defend themselves, and breaks from the nonstop scares, which makes the scares even more effective. I loved this movie the first time I saw it and more than likely will love it to the day I die.",Evil Dead II
435,pmshayley,"""Who's laughing now?!""",9,2 March 2005,"(I just found out Raimi has authorized a re-make of ""Evil Dead"", which is what ""II"" essentially is. If a series is obviously not quite done, why stop, go back, and remake what you have already done. If Bruce Campbell is not available, leave Ashe alone! I am sick of ""do-overs""! It worked for ""Dawn of the Dead"", but not ""Texas Chainsaw"", and ""Shaun of the Dead"" was better than them both! EDII is a better film than ED, and I will never be convinced that you can re-make the first film better than the original re-make was done. Does that make any sense? Don't fix it if it ain't broke.) I originally saw this film in a theater(in Connecticut, when I was 17), and I will never forget how seriously I took the film, up until Ash has a laughing fit with every ""inanimate"" object in the room(the lamp is still my favorite). That was the day I realized there was more to horror than...well, horror. There is humor, however dark; there is anguish, no matter how badly acted(here I refer to the first film); and there is something quite amusing about a hand that gushes gallons of blood. This will always be one of my all-time favorites.",Evil Dead II

From the very beginning I couldn't stop smiling... every time I saw Bruce Campbell i laughed and every time there was a fight I chuckled. It is an extremely fun movie with a no mercy attitude. Sam Raimi perfects his shaky cam shots and first persons and makes for the most enjoyable experience in a long time. The plot is sturdy (identical to Evil Dead) and the technology is painful (purposefully). The movie moves leisurely from event to event. The supporting cast are stupid and bring more trouble to the film (a much needed element) and the best part is, the carnage starts 5 minutes into the movie. A no-think great movie, possibly the best movie the horror genre has turned out in the last 20 years.",Evil Dead II

Seems like most people don't focus on story or performance, they just toss some blood in and maybe some T&A. But Evil Dead & Evil Dead II were different. They made me life-long Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell fans.And Evil Dead II is the best of the lot. Worth watching over and over!Stand-out scenes: Ash battles his own hand. Just thinking about it makes me laugh. From the beating Ash takes from his hand, while it's still attached, to Ash hunting for his then severed hand, with a shotgun.Also, Ted Raimi in the enormous old woman zombie suit is funny.

438,ZombieApocalypse,"""If she went into those woods, you can forget about her !""",10,7 October 2005,"Our hero Ash returns in this 1987 blood bath of a follow-up to ""The Evil Dead"". The king of slapstick horror does a bang up job of combining laughs and plenty of gore to create one of the most memorable and beloved horror movies of all time. What some people may or may not know is, the movie, intended to be a sequel, was actually a revisited version of the first film. In this version, Ash(Bruce Campbell) returns to the dreaded cabin in the woods with only his girlfriend Linda(Denise Bixler) and his infamous Oldsmobile. What was meant to be a quiet, relaxing get-a-way in the woods, suddenly explodes into a bloody night of survival when Ash is forced to do battle with the evil that lies within the woods. Possessed trees, zombie mothers, and one demonic hand all set the stage for Ash as he risks life and limb(literally) to make it through the night. Joined later by Annie Knowby(Sarah Berry) the daughter of Professor Raymond Knowby,(the man who unlocked the mysteries of the book of the dead)Ed Getly,(Richard Domeier)and two wanderers Bobby Joe(Kassie Depaiva)and Jake(Dan Hicks)Ash and his crew must survive the night, or be dead by dawn.The true genius of this movie is not only the fact that it was shot very well on a low budget, but there is very little speaking. All the scares, and shock factors of the movie rely on Sam's brilliant use of silence to scare the pants off of you when you least expect it. Couple that with the concept of Ash, a average joe who can barely tie his own shoes, and just happens to be mankind's only hope against the greatest evil of all time, and you have one of the most ""groovy"" horror flicks ever created. In the words of our hero ""Hail to the king baby"". Strap on your chainsaws, and get ready to kiss your nerves goodbye.",Evil Dead II
439,iamnotazombie,the cinematic equivalent of noodles,9,4 October 2009,"Cult films are a funny group of films, some receive that status due to being so bad that they are actually good, other are just iconic and memorable, and you can always have films that started movements in either fashion or culture. If Evil Dead 2 is any of the above it would be the second one - iconic and memorable - due to the moments that are created throughout the film, moments such as 'groovy', ash having a fight with his hand, the camera on the end of a stick, there are loads. But for all the iconic moments, is this example of cult cinema actually any good? Well here's the funny thing - I appreciated the tension and the progression of the plot, the comedy and the scares (however wafer thin), I enjoyed it all. But at the same time I didn't really enjoy it, it felt as though there was something missing. Now maybe, now I've grown up a bit cinematically since I last seen it, so its references and its nuances don't thrill me in the same way that they once did? I don't know. But its definitely missing something, it's like the cinematic equivalent of noodles. You enjoyed it when you were having it, but once it was finished you have a 'is that it' sort of moment.

When I heard of ""Evil Dead II"" I thought, there is no way that movie will be as good as the first one. I was wrong. ""Evil Dead II"" is my favorite of the trilogy. Instead of making it an other horror movie, Sam Raimi decided to turn the ultimate horror experience into a horror comedy, and it worked. Bruce Campbell returns as the bumbling hero Ashley J. Williams. Following the death and possession of his beloved Linda, Ash is faced with trouble after the deadites posses his hand. This is one of horror movies most memorable moments. After the loss of his hand Ash has to deal with Professor Nobi's daughter, who has returned to the cabin and believes Ash has murdered her parents. The deadites start to take out the professor's daughter's friends one by one. Ash finally decides to fight back, dawning his boomstick and bearing a chainsaw for a hand, and with one word becomes the icon that we all know and love.

Although it does seem to be less of a sequel as Ash (Bruce Campbell) has pretty much forgotten everything that happened in the first film. My only problem with the movie would be that fact. He begins by taking his girlfriend to a secluded cabin in the woods. Now i'm not sure if this is meant to be the same cabin from the first film or a different one. It never really explains it all that clearly. Ash begins the horrors of the deadite resurrections by playing a tape recorder he finds on a desk. You would think if this was indeed meant to be a sequel instead of a stand alone film then Ash would surely remember what happened the last time the incantations were played. It seems he doesn't though as he plays them anyway. His girlfriend becomes a deadite and she is killed in basically the same fashion as his girlfriend in the first film. The main addition to this film would be the more in depth look at the necronomicon and it's evil ability. This film runs flawlessly into the 3rd part ""Army of darkness"" as it continues from the ending of Evil Dead 2 (much in the way Halloween one and two continue into each other). All in all this is a fantastic series and Sam Raimi is a genius. He was one of the very first to mix horror with comedy and the Evil Dead films have plenty of both. I recommend watching the entire series in order, but feel free to skip over part one if you feel the need as it really doesn't affect the other two films (Evil dead 2 and Army of Darkness) and you won't really lose any of the meaning. Evil dead one is more of an introduction to the entire storyline but to receive the full picture it is needed to view all 3 films.

Has the good won, or is an earlier event that Ash experienced the precursor of something bigger? I've already told you too much.This is not a remake unless you watch the first five minutes period.

467,bjlehmann,The Ultimate in Comedic Terror,5,24 September 2004,"Although Dead By Dawn is an amusing and often entertaining sequel to the classic 1992 horror film The Evil Dead, DBD pales into comparison when claiming it is ""too terrifying"" as one promotional poster did.There are quite a few problems I have with this film. One is that it is referred to as a ""sequel"", which if you watch this film straight after you have watched ED, you will notice some major continuity errors, such as: the disappearance of Scotty, Cheryl & Shelly from the storyline. In fact at the beginning of this film we even see Ash (Campbell) and Linda (doing a terrible job is Blixler, who has replaced the wonderful Betsy Baker) arriving at the Cabin alone, and now the run-down almost empty cabin we saw in the first film is a fully furnished and deluxe cabin, with a fully done out kitchen. I know I'm splitting hairs here, but the fact is if you're going to make a sequel to a film, at least try and make sure everything makes sense.. I mean it really couldn't have been that hard for Raimi to re-watch the first film and get some of the continuity right. Also, another thing is why Ash stopped being a Deadite in sunlight? That didn't make sense at all, since there is no reason why light would affect the force of the ED.The other problem I have with DBD is it's decent into mass commercialism. One of the great things about ED was that it was an independent film, and had such a freaky atmospheric feel to it. DBD has none of that, it's like mass marketed film made for all the eye candy horror-wannabes who wanted to see Ash return to fight the big bad evil. And instead of getting a great sequel to a great horror film, we have gotten a horrored up version of Ash doing an I-Love-Lucy smashing kitchen plates on his head, and going completely crazy. Now that I have said the negative, let me go on to say that as a stand-alone horror film, apart from ED. DBD is actually quite a good film. It mixes comedy, with horror(although once again the Deadites in this film, are more like Hollywood zombies than those seen in ED), and has some quite hilarious scenes such as Ash battling Knoby's now Deadite wife Henrietta (played brilliant by a young Ted Raimi), and the laughing deer & lamp in Knoby's study, which added such weirdness to the film. The ending which falls into the next film in the ED Trilogy, Army of Darkness, is also quite well done.All in all, don't watch DBD straight after ED, in fact look at DBD as a remake, rather than a sequel, because then you will enjoy it much more.",Evil Dead II
468,Seasikjellyfish,A perfect mix of horror and comedy at an amazing pace,10,17 April 2015,"The two main genres this film represents are horror and comedy. The jokes and scares are blended together in a perfect smoothie, the scares in the movie are so silly and over the top it becomes funny but the aspect of horror still remains by having the exaggeration still base around the macabre and the sinister. This perfect blend of horror and comedy produces the perfect emotion in the viewer which I call ""nervous laughter"" (Another pretty much perfectly crafted blend of these two genres is in Shaun of the Dead when the two main characters first meet the zombie girl named ""Mary"").The low budget style which permeates the film helps not only creates more laughs but also makes you smile and kind of inspire you in a weird way. The fact that a string holding a flying eye can be clearly seen and a hand can be seen opening a door to help let the camera through it and the fact that the zombie's make-up can be seen peeling off makes you view them not as goofs and mistakes but as little jokes. It's hard to describe the feel a low-budget films gives you but it can be summed up by showing that the director (in this case, Sam Raimi) wants to make a film so much they will put their heart and soul on putting script to screen despite the fact it may be god-awful in it's effects and presentation. Also, I think this movie is a movie that makes people into film makers. If a talented director uses rather rubbish effects but makes the film great nonetheless then maybe you can even if you don't have that much money. Money is not what makes a film, it's the heart that does. Many big blockbusters are emotion-less machines (Star Wars prequels, Transformers). But dedication in a film gives it heart (Peter Jackson's early movies and El Mariachi).The pacing in this film is also ridiculously amazing. There is literally (and I do mean literally) constant horror and comedy. There is no scene without a joke or scare or both like I said earlier. Some may say that the cutting back to the scene where the people get off the plane is slow but it goes on for about a minute and no more. This persistent of the genres make this one of the most entertaining films of all time.Honestly I'd skip the first Evil Dead movie and go straight to this one. Not only is the first film covered in this one in 5 minutes like it's a ""previously on..."" but also the scares are scarier and there is more jokes, there being very few in Evil Dead 1. See this movie if you love being entertained, I think it would be very hard to find someone who doesn't like this movie, unless there one of those stupid people who think violence in films is evil.",Evil Dead II

So I'm trying to determine if I had seen these movies after they came out in the 80's whether or not I would love these movies too. I just feel like most of the people who rave about this movie must have seen this movie as a kid and now has nostalgic memories of it and that is why they love it. I don't know maybe I'm wrong. I didn't find the movie funny, I didn't find it scary, it made no sense what-so-ever, special effects are typical 80's bad.

Ash finds a book and a strange knife in the basement, the Necronomicon Ex- Mortis (the book of the dead)which the dead spirits and demons come to life by reading pages in the book.

Scenography 0 points. Production is as bad as scenography. Actors are even worse than dolls. If Evil Dead 1 is on scale 1-10 for 1 this is for -1. If there are negative points I would give this movie as many negative points as I could. I really don't know how can someone watch this movie and enjoy it in the same time. There wasn't any single interesting scene. I'm just sorry for my 90 minutes lost on this movie. It looks worse than even animated movie. Didn't they watch this movie before they released it?!

But, in this sequel, Ash, the starring character, comes back to the damn cabin from the first movie, and does everything as if nothing ever happens. So, he discovers (again) the tape recorder, they listen the translation from the Necronomicon Ex Mortes, and (Have I said ""again"" before?) AGAIN they summons the Evil Spirit from the Woods. But, the black humor, the terror some times, the performance of Bruce Campbell (as well as the rest of the cast) is awesome. And much more, if we see that these movies are make with a very low budget... well, there are masterpieces. There are great funny scenes (like the ""posessed hand"" waiting for Ash to reload the shotgun), huge bloody scenes (like Ash cutting his own hand and blood literally covering his face) and a little primitive FX, but well handled, which makes this movies (THREE of them) real classics, and, from my point of view, real CULT MOVIES.",Evil Dead II

474,kris-201,A review... sort of!,10,20 April 2006,"How can anyone not like this film? It starts with our hero Ash once again forced to defend himself against an army of monsters, evil tree's and laughing stags! The film itself, based on raimi's love for both horror and the three stooges, manages to both scare and amuse throughout. I've always been a bit weary of too much humour in a horror film, especially after seeing how well this one was put together! But raimi stays true to the horror genre, touching on subjects that most directors wouldn't have the balls too.Where as most movies today rely heavily on CGI to create the 'evil' bad guys... (just think Jeepers Creepers... which I might add had the most promising start of any horror film in years... only to be let down by a massive wing'ed twiglet.... what a waste!)... but not raimi... he sticks with his foam costumes and puppets.. and still manages to create a truly 'evil' film! And then there's our hero Ash (Bruce Campbell my personal hero, just read his books... you'll never struggle to 'pick up' chicks again!)who takes on the role of Ash in possible one of the most physically demanding roles of all time (raimi even points out that he enjoyed every moment of bruce's physical torture!). I think Bruce is lucky because he gets so many cool lines... he just can't fail to look and sound like the all out action hero he is. Lose your hand, replace it with a chainsaw and simply state 'Groovy' thus turning instantly into a B movie legend!! I realise anyone reading this will probably think 'oh god, another evil dead dweeb' and you'd be right. I guess this isn't really a review and probably wouldn't be helpful to most but as someone who is in the movie industry himself (just writing my second feature!) I cant help but admire what Raimi has created.Sorry for blathering on everyone!!... oh.... WATCH THIS MOVIE! Kris.",Evil Dead II

Evil Dead II combines Sam Raimi's trademark style with some of the funniest moments ever seen in a ""horror"" movie. While the familiar ""camera chasing people through the forest"" filming technique is remarkably good at building tension, some of the most horrific scenes in the film may actually make you laugh out loud.

477,James_Dean,The Best Of The Evil Dead Series,9,19 March 2000,"If you were to watch the entire Evil Dead series (Evil Dead 1+2, Army Of Darkness) you would notice a transition in the genre of the movies.  Evil Dead mostly leans towards a typical horror film, that believe or not, still gives me chills, while Army Of Darkness is a comedy/horror that openly parodies Indiana Jones, Gulliver's Travels and The Three Stooges.  Evil Dead 2 is a happy medium between the aforementioned and gets about as perfect as a sequel can.Evil Dead 2 is a B-movie that pokes fun at B-movies.  Sam Raimi took no pains to hide the fact that he had a minuscule budget and the effect is some really wonderful moments involving animated mounted dear heads and the creature you never see but only through it's vision.  Bruce Campbell is also brilliant in this film, especially when his hand turns on him ala Dr. Strangelove.I think this film is spectacular and the best of the series.  It is well worth watching, as well as the rest of the series.",Evil Dead II

He told me they were pretty good, and so I finally got to the local Movie Gallery(ED1 was out at Blockbuster) and watched them over a weekend in December. They blew me away. Evil Dead II stood out, however. I don't know if it was because of the style it was shot, the humor, action, horror, or what, but EDII had quickly become my favorite movie.

The violence in this is more of the 'beating up bloodlessly' variety, any gore that it DOES have, is either offscreen, with tastefully low amounts of blood splattering (at most) or large amounts of watery blood spraying out of walls or (in one case) from under a trapdoor.....or to rubber monsters, with no actual gore or guts or any of that. This doesn't make it any less awesome a movie, but it HAS been continuously misrepresented as being gory, (and even as gory or more so, than the original)It has a great performance from Bruce Campbell, who i do not think is capable of a non-magnetic performance. The atmosphere IS indeed creepy and dark and cold looking, and nicely grainy, so it LOOKS like the kind of splatter movie that it isn't. It is also very very funny, and well made, which creates a kind of viewer dichotomy while watching it, because the humour and the aesthetic do not match- yet it meshes so well.So, to summarise, be wary of expectations of splatter (like the first) as you will not get it.

The humor in the movie seemed to take the horror out of it for me. In the end this movie got a little carried away with the special effects(not very good) also the ending is incredibly over done.

Bruce Campbell portrays the main character Ash, not as a super-hero but rather as a human being in a bad situation. He handles every situation with humor to deal with the maddening horror that surrounds him. Every time he dispatches a deadite he goes further down the spiral to madness thus making his character one with which the audience can identify. I thought the scene where he confronts himself in the mirror after killing his girlfriend was both scary and hilarious. The deadites were also very entertaining, as were the special effects. The camera angles and especially the sequences with the force rushing toward him or the cabin are great especially for the time it was made. The film is a little heavy on the side of gore but it is balanced by all the humor. Campbell's acting is a little over the top in some scenes but this was after all fairly early in his career. Sam Raimi does an excellent job directing this picture as he knows how to bring out the right response from his actors by putting them in very difficult situations. I find it funny that for as long as Bruce has known Sam Raimi, Raimi only saw fit to offer him a small part in Spider Man, go figure.

Completely devoid of fear and humor, the childish attempts at humor should fail to entertain even the most simple-minded folk.   Whereas some films are so bad that they become enjoyable, this film grates on my mind knowing that something this bad exists and is still lauded.  Sam Raimi should apologize for creating this genre, and Bruce Campbell should be black-listed.  Spraying multi-colored liquids does not induce fear, and that is not a cinematic vision.

Cool thoughts by some who say Ash never left the cabin, it's a continuation of the first Evil Dead.  We all can have theories regarding the Evil Dead/Evil Dead II relationship, but I just think it's funnier to think that Ash, after all he went through the first time, goes back for more abuse.

This is ridiculous, he was more composed than I'd be if my partner was killed and I was left alone in a cabin in the middle of nowhere possessed by demons who are trying to kill me whilst playing around with my nerves and laughing at me. He deserved an Oscar for this film. The faces he makes are the exact faces you would expect to see under such circumstances. He even runs through walls to escape them, he must have put all his energy into the role. He displays mental anguish so well that you feel it with him, it almost made me cry, it's not so much a scream inducing film as a n emotional roller-coaster. Whiile watching it for the first time my face slowly contorted into the very same expression Ash has when he is released from his possessor (the demon) and emerges from the mud.

503,iamnotacriminal,Evil Drab,2,9 October 2013,"After being thoroughly pleased with the original Evil Dead I had high hopes of enjoying the apparent ""superior"" sequel. Well so much for those hopes. What was encountered was an insulting and badly made rehash. The first insult is that we are supposed to forget the events from the first film as our protagonist Ash proceeds to make the same mistakes he had prior. The ""sequel"" is a misnomer, this is a remake. One that forgoes the character development, suspense and cleverness of the first for a film that gets more idiotic with each passing minute. Further insults to the viewer ensue with multiple plot-holes, moronic one-liners and attempts at slapstick humour that fall flat, dead flat. Camera tricks that were used well in the first film are now beaten like a dead horse, scenes recreated without any of the suspense, horror or scare factor from the original Dead.I am convinced that the makers of this film went in with a vague idea of what they wanted to create in lieu of a script and plot. Bruce Cambell hamming it up for much of the movie felt like ad lib, the dependence on he and his bad one-liners alone a terrible mistake and it's like at some point they realised this: ""Hey, let's just film Bruce goofing off for a few hours, add some zombies and a sh*t-ton of fake blood and we have a movie!"". ""Oh sh*t, we're gonna need a few more mindless kids to kill off so let's just throw in some characters that really don't make any sense or shouldn't realistically be there but what the hell, this is a dumb zombie flick that makes no sense and they're gonna die anyways!""And the final insult being no real pay-off in the end.

Not many films have soul stealing demons who live in the woods waiting for Bruce Campbell to show up then release the forces of hell on hearing words from a 1000 year old book which give them license to possess the living and still manage to be funny. Cool film. Watch it, watch it again, watch it some more. i did. When can we expect a fourth evil dead? Sam Raimi has said that he wants to work on a new evil dead after spiderman 3 which may be a remake of the first one. Raimi is not directing the film but his company (ghost house productions) are producing it. F-ing great film (they made me cut out the 'prohibited word')!! I sincerely advise any horror lovers to watch this film and anyone who has seen and liked another Sam Raimi film (e.g. the Spiderman movies, Darkman).",Evil Dead II
506,Demtia,3 words: Ash's Chainsaw Hand,9,17 June 2005,"This movie is excellent. While it is not as scary as the 1st it, you don't have to sit down and prepare yourself to watch it. You could just sit down and spontaneously(spelling?) decide to watch it. The movie starts as a slight recap of the 1st only with Ash and Linda. You then continue from where the 1st movie left off, seeing Ash go slightly crazy and having to chop off his own hand. The daughter of cabin's owner shows with some cannon fodder and upon getting shot at by a blood soaked Ash, manage to get him in the basement. Question why did Ash and co. go to that cabin as it is now obvious that it didn't belong to them? After locking Ash in the basement they start up the tape player and learn of the mothers death after possession. Then the corpse arises and tries to attack Ash, who fortunately escapes. After that it becomes a battle against the demons with one girl being dragged away by plants, a guy getting killed by the dead mother and the other guy becoming possessed, AND the evil manifesting the daughter being stabbed by the hand, and Ash getting sucked into medieval Europe after defeating the evil. All in all an excellent movie that is very fun to watch, and teaches a few useful lessons. For example Duck Tape is not used enough in first aid.",Evil Dead II
507,info-57007,Reboot of the Original,7,9 April 2017,"Actually, the second part should be a continuation, but in the end a reboot came out. Since the first part was temporarily prohibited, the director was forced to do a reboot. For the second part Sam Raimi also had ten times as much budget available as for the first part. The difference to Part I is that dance the devil II is equipped with macabre humor and some slapstick inserts. This makes the film more accessible to everyone. Of course, this is an aspect that comes to misunderstandings for real horror fans. The camera rides are impressive. Because the horror comes back by the close shots and the camera guide again. But as in the first part, the handmade masks are the real eye- catcher of this film. On the other hand, one finds that the second part has also lost its character by its humor and the slapstick...",Evil Dead II
508,groovybucatini,Sam Raimi at his very best,9,12 July 2017,"Lately I've been binge watching tons of 80s horror films and this movie is by far the very best.With the first film being as terrific as it is, its no wonder fans (and Stephen King) demanded a sequel. Sam Raimi could have done what every other horror movie sequel writer does, replicate the plot of the first film and throw in some lazy jump scares, but instead Sam Raimi took what made ""The Evil Dead"" brilliant and added some humor (and a demonic hand!) and made a movie more iconic than its predecessor.After the very confusing flashback sequence, that makes you stop and think ""is this idiot stupid enough to go back to that cabin"", you are taken along on the continuing story of Ash Williams and the evil dead.The movie is not likely to keep you up at scared at night, but it will induce some mighty laughs. This horror movie sequel is as ""groovy"" as they come.",Evil Dead II
509,jimbobjim,An explanation of why people like this movie...,10,6 November 2005,"The simple answer: It's just ridiculously funny.The longer explanation: No, Evil Dead fans aren't crazy, but I will concede that it's a very subjective form of humour. I find that most people I talk to about this movie (or Army of Darkness) liked it because it's so crazy, inconsistent and unrealistic. The special effects are cheesy, ditto with the dialogue and plot, but that's the charm of this series of films.My understanding is that others enjoy it when you can see cables pulling props around or crewmen in the background. The movie acts so serious at parts but at other times it's obviously just absurd. This is why I like Evil Dead II (and to a lesser extent, Army of Darkness). I enjoy that one scene can be scary and then the next can be funny. I find that to be a very good mix of genres. I like being able to feel tense only to have that feeling dispelled by a wacky joke.This IS my favourite film of all time. Of all the films I own or have seen, this is one of the few I enjoy watching over and over again. It has some great camera angles, visuals, as well as terror, comedy and something that can only be described as ""awesomeness"". *SPOILERS* That scene where Ash gets on his battle gear is what I'm talking about when I say ""Awesomeness"" *END SPOILERS*.My advice to anyone who hasn't seen this film (or maybe any of the films in the series): 1) Watch them in order: Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness 2) Watch them multiple times: I'm a HUGE Evil Dead / Bruce Campbell (actor of main character), but it took me a few tries to get into the series. The first time I saw Evil Dead II I didn't understand why people thought it was so great. But after watching the series a few times, I came to the conclusion that it really grows on you.10/10? ... I don't think so... Groovy/10",Evil Dead II
510,cooperholt,Groovy,10,23 July 2018,I'm 15 years old. And in a world of CGI this was like a blast to the past. Plus bruce Campbell is awesome!!!,Evil Dead II
511,shanechemelli,Cant say enough about what a great movie this is.,10,25 April 2020,"Saw it for the first time when I was about 13 and it blew my mind.Since then I have probably revisited it about 2 dozen times. Sam Raimi really had a really great vision and the camera work in this movie is something else. Bruce Campbell is phenomenal as Ash, as he has his best performance ever. You can really tell hes putting everything hes got into this role. I still cant believe Bruce Campbell never became an ""A"" list actor. I recommend this to any horror fan or fan of great movies. I I am quite sure that you'll never forget this one.",Evil Dead II
512,billandjennfennell,Definition of a cult classic,8,27 January 2006,"Evil Dead II is a great flick. It has the creepy haunting horror aspects, the jump out of your seat scenes, plenty of gore for those who need it, and loads of comedy. Sam Raimey really captures the feeling of seclusion in and around the cabin. One of the great things about the movie is that the 'monster' is't the zombies as much as it is the intangible evil spirit. There are spots where the effects can be cheesy but it actually adds to the films charm. The characters are great as well: The Daughter of the archaeologist and her preppy boyfriend, the backwoods hillbilly and his charming girlfriend. Then there is Ash. Its worth seeing for Ash's one liners alone.I love how the house in the woods looks like it has 3 rooms from the outside but when ash is running through it there is like 20 rooms. I found this to be an improved upon remake of the first Evil Dead. Enjoy",Evil Dead II
