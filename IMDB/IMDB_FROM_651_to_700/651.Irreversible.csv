0,SnoopyStyle,shock cinema uncompelling,5,6 January 2015,"The movie is in reverse chronology. Alex (Monica Bellucci) and Marcus (Vincent Cassel) are a couple. They go to a party with their friend Pierre (Albert Dupontel). Alex leaves alone and is brutally raped. Marcus and Pierre find transvestite Concha who identifies Le Tenia as the rapist. They go to a gay club to find him but they kill the wrong man.Watching it as intended is almost a waste of time. The first half is so chaotic with extremely violent hand-held camera moves. It is almost incomprehensible. In the middle section, there is a long uncut rape scene. The last section clarifies the movie but it doesn't really have any drama. Even the reveal can't fully save this. It's an experiment that doesn't work. As for the main controversy, the rape scene is quite vicious. It's shock cinema but I don't dismiss the movie for that. My main problems are the reverse chronology and the chaotic camera moves at the beginning.",Irreversible
1,claudio_carvalho,Unforgettably Cruel and Disturbing,8,6 August 2004,"I have been watching movies for decades, and as far as I remember, only three movies have disturbed me. The first one was `Soldier Blue', when I was a teenager, explicitly showing the massacre of the American Indians. Later, in 1982, `Sophie's Choice', when a mother has to decide which son shall remain alive. `Irreversible', which I saw yesterday, was the third one. The storyline is very simple: In Paris, a young couple goes to a party with a friend by subway. They discuss, and the woman decides to return back home alone. She is violently raped in an underground passage. Her husband and her friend decide to make justice by themselves.  What makes the difference in this polemic movie? First of all, like in `Memento', the story is presented backwards, in a reverse chronology, from the credits to the beginning. Although not being original, unfolded this way, the story shocks much more. Then, the cruelty of at least two very explicit scenes (the rape of Alexandra and the aggression and crime of Pierre in the gay night-club) are amazingly well choreographed and real. The beginning of the film, with the camera spinning randomly, and a weird soundtrack, makes the viewer sick and so disoriented and disturbed as Marcus, the character of Vincent Cassel. Therefore, technically this film is outstanding. The performance of the cast and the direction, photography and soundtrack are stunning. Living in Rio de Janeiro, a violent city, the story is very real and scary, and that is why it shakes up more than a horror movie. We never believe that this situation may happen to ourselves or to our friends, but the daily newspaper shows many similar examples. The idea of the irreversibility of time and its destruction, the same way of the lives of the characters in this movie, is fantastic. Certainly a very sensitive person will be sick and will not like this movie. The box of the DVD should advise that this story is  recommended to a specific audience. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): `Irreversível' (`Irreversible')",Irreversible
2,jboothmillard,Irreversible,8,30 August 2011,"This French film featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, I can definitely agree with that, because alongside such listed films as A Clockwork Orange and Eraserhead, this is one of those films that is really disturbing, but has to be seen. Basically this tells the story of a night out for a couple, but in a Memento style (not backwards and forwards until meeting in the middle, just backwards) this shows it in reverse chronological order. So the opening scene is the body of an assaulted man taken out on a stretcher from the gay club called The Rectum, this scene in regular order would be the ending. Then it flashes back to two men trying to find the club, looking for a man called Le Tenia (Jo Prestia), and when he is eventually found, after getting through people who don't answer and just want sexual acts, and the man wanting him starts a fight, but he ends up with his head smashed in by a fire extinguisher. It flashes back again with the two men, named Pierre (Albert Dupontel) and Marcus (Black Swan's Vincent Cassel), asking some prostitutes who knows where to find Guillermo Nunez, and talking to male transvestite Concha (Jara-Millo), and after getting beaten he says to go to The Rectum. Flashing back again to when Pierre and Marcus are leaving a party, they notice a body on a stretcher being wheeled out from the subway tunnel, and Marcus identifies the savagely beaten body as his girlfriend Alex (Monica Bellucci), and when asked by a man if he wants revenge he says yes, and they start the journey to find the guilty party. Another flash and we see what happened to Alex, she was with Marcus and Pierre at the party socialising with friends, after some drug taking and inappropriate behaviour from the boys she leaves and takes the route down the tunnel, and she passes La Tenia threatening a prostitute with a knife, and he lets her go to viciously rape and beat her for nine minutes. Flashing back more Alex, Marcus and Pierre arrive to go to the party, and we find out that Pierre was originally her boyfriend, but it is now Marcus, and there does not seem to be any bad feeling between them. Flashing before the party starts at all, Marcus and Alex lie in bed together, and they get a phone call from Pierre telling them they will have to take the subway as his car is broke down, and she also finds out that she is pregnant with Marcus's baby. The final flashback sees Alex happy and minding her own business in a park reading a book and watching children play, unaware of her fate to come, and the last words on screen are ""time destroys all things"". This is a really powerful film because it has some of the most daringly and extremely violent and distressing scenes, the beating to death with a fire extinguisher and of course the horrible rape scene are definitely the ones that stand out. Of course if the film was in the correct chronological order the disturbing sequences would obviously be towards the end, it is much more significant to see them towards the beginning, and this makes for an overall controversial, uncomfortable and distressing film, but equally a masterpiece drama. Very good!",Irreversible
3,Tweekums,Sometimes confusing; occasionally very disturbing but ultimately worth seeing if you have the stomach for it,8,23 June 2019,"As this films scenes are shown in reverse chronological order and, at least in the early scenes, the camera is always rotating it is a confusing at first. We see casualties being taken away from a bondage nightclub. We then see men entering; one of them, Marcus, looking for a man known as 'Le Tenia'... this leads to an act of extreme violence. In the following scenes we see how they found the club; how Marcus's girlfriend Alex was brutally raped and left in a coma after leaving a party alone followed by scenes at the party and earlier in the evening.It must be said this film is disturbing... and deliberately so. Thankfully I watched on a fairly small television; I imagine the constant camera movement in the opening scenes might have induced nausea on the big screen! Then there is the violence; in the night club it is sudden and brutal but in the rape scene it is slow and drawn out. By now the camera is fixed on Alex and her attacker leaving the viewer hoping that somebody will come to her rescue but knowing that isn't going to happen. The cast are solid but the success or failure of the film rests squarely with writer/director Gaspar Noé... he has created something that I suspect people will either find impressive or abhorrent... I can't imagine many 'It's okay' reviews. Personally I was impressed but also very disturbed; I can't imaging wanting to watch it again any time soon. So overall I'd say it was a really good film but I'm not sure I'd want to recommend it as it is so disturbing at times.These comments are based on watching the film in French with English subtitles.",Irreversible
4,BA_Harrison,This not rape/revenge; this is revenge/rape.,8,21 December 2009,"Gaspar Noé's Irreversible takes the rape/revenge genre and turns it on its head, presenting events in reverse order in a stunning whirl of chaotic, somersaulting, nightmarish imagery.We begin with the act of revenge itself: Marcus (Vincent Cassel) and Pierre (Albert Dupontel), boyfriend and best friend of rape victim Alex (Monica Belucci), hunt for the woman's attacker through the hellish bowels of gay bar The Rectum, where they are confronted by shunting, grunting males indulging in all manner of perversions, before becoming involved in a violent altercation that culminates in a nasty broken arm for Marcus, and an even nastier headache for one of the bar's patrons (as Pierre stoves the man's skull in with a fire extinguisher).The action then travels backwards through time, allowing the viewer to witness the incidents that lead to this moment: the frenzied search for the rapist; the ugly sexual assault itself (a prolonged and harrowing spot of buggery in a lonely city underpass); the argument at a party that results in Alex leaving alone; her journey to the party with Marcus and Pierre; and Alex's delight at finding out that she is pregnant. The final shot is of Alex relaxing in a park, blissfully unaware of the horror that is soon to come.Whereas traditional rape/revenge movies build towards a climax that is designed to evoke a primitive response from the viewer as justice is finally metered out, Noé immediately shocks his audience with extreme violence, bludgeons them further with the horrific rape, but winds things up with a serene finalé designed to deliver an entirely different kind of emotional wallop: presented with the idyllic image of a happy, carefree Alex, the viewer—already aware of the character's terrible fate—is forced to face the fragility of life, the truly abhorrent nature of violence, and the startling realisation that tragedy can strike anyone, at any moment, without warning.",Irreversible
5,Coventry,Hits you in the face like a ten ton hammer!,8,14 February 2004,"Holy Macaroni! Believe the hype, folks...this really IS one of the most shocking, confronting and raw movies ever made! It actually is one of those rare purchases that makes you wonder what the role of cinema is in modern society. Irréversible certainly can't be classified as 'entertainment', that's for sure. It merely looks like a brutal eye-opener, highly unpleasant to watch at times and it sometimes makes you even feel ashamed to be human! Some of the stuff here goes beyond your most feared nightmares and could easily provoke depression, anti-social behavior and anxiety among influential viewers. It's real-life drama and that makes it so powerful and shocking. Irréversible is told backwards, 'Memento'-style if you wish...only it's a lot more effective here as it was in Memento, which actually was a pretty boring and extremely overrated movie. This very simple backwards-structure aspect gives Irréversible the opportunity to implement a couple of unique and rarely seen style elements. The first half hour (which actually is the end of the story) smacks you in the face right away sets the tone for a non-stop, raw experience. Also, you don't really get to know the characters until the last chapter (which is actually the beginning of the film) The characters are a riddle to you constantly and you can't symphatise with any of them, since you just know too little. Through wild camera movements and simplistic techno-music, a claustrophobic and horrifying atmosphere gets created and the violence is really hard to digest. The infamous scene in which Monica Belluci brutally gets raped is one of the most perverted things I've ever seen. It seems to go on forever and you can really visiualise the painful hell the poor girl is going through. I'd call Irréversible a successful combination of ancient, rough exploitation and modern art-house film-making. The brutality portrayed here is typical for the euro-shock cinema but the stylish shooting lifts it up to Cannes Festival material. Cult as pure as it comes!",Irreversible
6,Theo Robertson,A Film Of Two Halves Which Will Polarise The Audience,7,19 May 2008,"I came in to this film knowing all about the hype that surrounded it . "" Truly stomach churning ... I had to walk out of the theater... I've never seen anything like it in my life "" . It's impossible to view this film for the first time with an open mind . Interestingly enough everyone comments on the violence while there's little written on the fact the story is told in reverse chronological order . Perhaps if IRREVERSIBLE was shot in a conventional way few people would consider it so controversial and brutal and challenging ? I'm sure this would have been the case Imagine for a moment Gasper Noe hadn't copied Christopher Nolan's style with MOMENTO ( And to be honest Nolan hadn't invented this style because "" reverse editing storytelling "" had been done as far back as the silent era ) and told the story in chronological order . We'd have opened with a metaphysical quote that "" Time destroys everything "" , ( I'll leave it to you to decide what this means if anything ) This is followed by children playing in the park , Alex reading a book , Alex going home with a pregnancy test kit , Alex finding out she's pregnant . How long would it be before the audience start to ask themselves where all this might be going ? If the story had been constructed this way it would have led to all sorts of problems , not least that there's very little going on plot wise . Adjectives like "" nauseating "" could also accurately describe the cheesy love triangle making up the bulk of the film . It could be argued that the reverse chronology makes it easier to empathise with Alex's rape because if we'd seen her wearing a mini-dress some people might have thought she deserved it , but I hope this isn't the case . No one deserves that As for the rape itself would it be sacrilege to say I've seen worse ? Certainly I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is a film that is far more stomach churning when it comes to rape . Unlike that film however IRREVERSIBLE does have a style and a merit to it . Especially during the opening half hour where Markus and Pierre charge in to The Rectum and the audience are shown one of the most remarkable , shocking and disorientating sequences ever seen in recent cinema . Again though you have to ask why do the cops tell Pierre that he's going down for ten years ? Surely the violence was justified to stop Markus from being raped ? Again there's a problem with the plotting because does it seem so credible that Markus and Pierre would have listened to the pimp who claims he'll find The Tapeworm for them if they give him money ? Is there a subtext to this ? Is Noe saying that revenge is more important than justice ? Your guess is as good as mine IRREVERSIBLE is a film you'll never forget . This is down to the opening half hour and has everything to do with style rather than content . When you switch off the DVD the next day and think about it then unfortunately things start to fall apart . It's also a film that will polarise the audience . If you're not sickened by the violence you'll be nauseated by the cheesy romantic aspects of the film or vice versa . All in all the use of reverse chronology is far more of a gimmick than what it was in MEMENTO",Irreversible
7,jotix100,The red tunnel,7,18 April 2003,"Gaspar Noe's admiration for the late Stanley Kubrik is evident in most of this film. In fact, what is even more surprising is that a movie has been created from such thin material. This is a film that depends on shocking its audience, as proven by the opening sequences. The credits are nightmarish, as are the scenes that show unrestrained violence perpetuated on the main characters. By confusing the spectator, Mr. Noe creates a suspense, as we all want to know what was the origin of such behavior. Most of this violence, I found, is a turnoff.Mr. Noe is very clever in telling the story from the present to the past, as it certainly would have been a complete let down to see it in a chronological manner. If the director would have decided to do it differently, half of the theatre would have emptied because the last sections of the film are totally boring.Did he need to have the scene in the Metro at all? How about the tunnel sequence? Did Mr. Noe have a need to show us in vivid detail what happens to a woman in a situation such as he presents it? Is it necessary to show Vincent Cassel with his 'thang' in full display? How about the disappearing genitalia in the leather bar? For that matter, how about the naked old man at the beginning of the story?The advice to any would-be-swingers is: carry enough cash for a taxi, just in case the party sucks big time. Oh, and never go into an underpass anywhere in the world late at night, let alone a red tunnel.",Irreversible
8,Hey_Sweden,"Not exactly fun, but interesting, to say the least.",7,11 March 2013,"The grim, ugly ""Irreversible"" from director Gaspar Noe is definitely one of those gut punching films that affects the viewer, whether or not they find any merit within the story or presentation. It takes a time worn exploitation premise - that of the ""rape and revenge"" tale - and gives it a ""Memento"" style spin by telling the entire story backwards.It plays out over the course of one day, focusing on a sort of lovers triangle - Alex (Monica Bellucci), Marcus (Vincent Cassel) and Pierre (Albert Dupontel) - and the strains in the relationship that lead to the untenable circumstance of Alex being raped in an underground tunnel by a demented stranger. Of course, since this tale is being told in reverse order, this event actually occurs around the midway point and the graphic revenge takes place near the beginning of the movie.If nothing else, Noe does an excellent job of thoroughly disorienting the viewer with the dizzying camera moves and the often very moody cinematography. This movie has a palpable atmosphere that really gets under ones' skin, especially when one considers the extended sequence(s) inside the gay night club - which is dubbed ""The Rectum"" - where the revenge takes place.The three leads deliver impeccable performances (Bellucci and Cassel were an actual couple at the time of filming); Philippe Nahon from Noes' earlier ""I Stand Alone"" makes a brief cameo. The dialogue of full of sexually frank lines.The pummelling of a victim using a fire extinguisher is fairly potent stuff; if Noes' intent was to make the viewer uncomfortable, he succeeds admirably. For one thing, the rape sequence goes on for an awfully long time, and is punctuated by the rapist assaulting poor Alex. The director certainly displays incredible audacity in taking a very unflinching look at material that many viewers would find repellent. It's truly disorienting that because of the gimmick the story starts getting lighter and more appealing as it progresses, ""ending"" on a happy note. Once it's over, it's impossible to not get the message of Noes' movie: that any (bad) thing can happen to anybody at any time, and that we can all be capable of the most savage acts if properly provoked.I would recommend this movie, but only to those who appreciate those movies that go to the darkest of places.Seven out of 10.",Irreversible
9,preppy-3,Harrowing,5,17 March 2003,"A woman (Monica Bellucci) is savagely raped and beaten and her boyfriend (Vincent Cassel) sets out to kill her attacker.This film is almost impossible to watch--there's an extremely horrifying and VERY graphic murder in the first 20 minutes and the rape/beating goes on for at least 10 minutes. To make it even worse was that both of the actors are so good that it looks very realistic. I was basically crying my eyes out during the rape and considered leaving the theatre. Usually I can sit through anything but this was really sickening, disgusting and beyond belief. After that sequence the movie does lighten up--but the effect lingers on. Also the story is told backwards--why? It serves no purpose that I can see. In something like ""Memento"" it worked--in this one it's just annoying.This is a hard movie to rate--on one hand the acting was very good and the script interesting but there's very annoying camera-work at the beginning (the camera keeps spinning around and never focuses), loud, ugly sounds and there was no need for this film to be so graphic. Seriously--why shot a 10 minute rape scene in all its ""glory""? What's the point other than to sicken the audience? So I liked the actors and the plot and dialogue but didn't like the direction, camera-work, audio or the unrelenting violence.Use your own judgment on viewing this.",Irreversible
10,dbborroughs,Cinematic Torture,10,19 February 2004,"If movies are suppose to effect the viewer then this movie is king of the hill. From the dis-orienting camera moves that open the film  through the violence in the gay bar, the seemingly never ending rape and the films unraveling of the days events in a backwards march I have yet to meet anyone who has not been deeply effected by this movie - if they were brave enough or stupid enough to watch it. (I'm still trying to figure out a local Best Buy displaying a large number of DVD's  as if it was the latest Adam Sandler movie)It is not an easy movie to watch but as an examination of what people are capable and how violence can come from nowhere and from the unexpected its a masterpiece. The backward structure takes what is essentially a dull revenge story and turns it on its ear as we are forced to really examine how things get out of hand very quickly and what people will do when pushed to the limit.If you want a challenge to your psyche and can brave simply some of the most vicious and nasty screen violence (yes its graphic but much is also implied) then see this movie - preferably with out distraction. But be warned, even if you think you know what this movie is about and what your limits in screen violence is, you still won't be prepared for what a mental hot foot this film is.",Irreversible
11,lastliberal,Time destroys everything.,7,23 December 2008,"There is really nothing to like about this movie.The title and opening sequence was the worst experience I have ever had in watching a film. I thought I was going to be sick. Some may call it art, but I found it to be disorienting and distracting.Then there is the discussion of the two men. It made absolutely no sense at all - and I even went back and watched it again after the movie. It still made no sense.Then things started making sense. We were watching a movie in reverse. What's up with that? It was confusing and distracting for the first 25 minutes, but then it really started to come together.The rape scene was the most brutal display of the degradation of women that I have ever seen and something that will be burned forever in my mind. That any man could be that evil is incomprehensible.The ending - or beginning - comes and all is wiped out for a moment as we see two lovers enjoying their lives together and the promise of a good future that we know will be wiped out in a few minutes of terror.If nothing else, this film makes us come to appreciate the moment; for it may not last.Vincent Cassel (La Haine, Ocean's Twelve & Thirteen, Eastern Promises) was magnificent as usual. Monica Bellucci - a treasure.",Irreversible
12,grantss,"Brutal, visceral, brilliant",8,3 November 2014,"Brutal, visceral, brilliant. Borrowing from Christopher Nolan's Memento (my 2nd favourite movie), Gaspar Noe's Irreversible tells its story backwards. Starting with the latest scene, and then moving backwards in time, it is incredibly effective. Like Memento, the plot would have been superb in normal forward order, yet in backward order it is even better. Excellent direction from Gaspar Noe helps too. Very gritty action scenes, and good build up of tension, backwards. Monica Bellucci is stunningly beautiful and brilliant. Vincent Cassel and Albert Dupontel are solid.Great, very original movie.",Irreversible
13,Boba_Fett1138,Not perfect but definitely interesting.,7,26 September 2011,"This is a movie with an unique approach, that still works most of its time but is also definitely not without its flaws.It's a movie that is being told backwards. So it actually starts with its end credits and after that begins to tell its story backwards. No, don't worry, the characters aren't walking or talking backwards as well but each sequence starts at that moment where the next sequence in the film ends. This way you slowly start to see what event led up to its final sequence, which got shown first in this movie. This way of storytelling actually adds to the chaos, which gets further more strengthened by very dynamic camera-work and the fact that the movie looks and feels realistic, without any apparent setup or rehearsals. So in that regard I really like the approach and way of storytelling that this movie features. I was actually really loving its first half (or its second half, depending on how you take this movie) but the movie can only do so much with its approach and can stay interesting and good to follow for so long.There is no real reason for the movie to still continue after its notorious rape scene, at least for not as long as it did. The movie after that point lost too much of its power and steam. Also the entire way of storytelling ensures obviously that the movie gets a bit of a confusing and messy one to watch. You are constantly forced to think back about its previous sequence, which can make this movie a bit of a tiring one to watch. The movie is about 100 minutes long and it most definitely shouldn't had been much longer! As a matter of fact, it should had been much shorter really. All in all it still remains a good and nicely executed experimental film but I'm surely glad that not more movies like this get made, since it's also such an exhausting experience, that asks a lot of its viewers. Some people will already be scared off by its approach, while others will be by its dark, depressing themes and extremely violent and graphic sequences. It's a hard movie to watch at times, in more than one way. But then again, this was probably an angle that the film-makers were aiming for in the first place. This was of course never meant to be a big commercial success at the box offices. It's almost as if they wanted their viewers to suffer while watching this and in that way the movie is also mostly an effective one.It also works as an effective one because of its convincing acting. Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel surely add a lot to this film. It was actually the seventh movie they appeared in together and it wouldn't be their last one. The two of them have been married together since 1999, so they always have some great chemistry together, whenever they're acting in the same movie.It's a great, different, original and powerful viewing experience, that is still not without its weaknesses really.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Irreversible
14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Difficult to sit through... for several reasons,8,9 July 2006,"From when I first heard of it, this sounded like a controversial and worthwhile film(it should be noted that the two are seldom one and the same; some works feature both qualities, but one should have more of a reason to see any given film or read any book than simply the fact that many found it to be controversial)... and the idea of playing with time has always intrigued me; it's one part of the freedom of film-making that too many ignore and deny the power of. Tarantino understands. So does Nolan. And as is undeniably evident herein, Noé does, as well. I haven't seen any of his other works, but the two films about The Butcher sound interesting, and I certainly intend to look for(and look twice at) anything with his name on it. The plot is simple enough... in essence, it could be summed up within a sentence or two. What is fascinating here is how it's told... the reverse order puts an unusual spin on the typical revenge-tale. With the vengeance being one of the first things seen and the story moving backwards from there, the ending has an ironic tone to it. The film opens to end credits... rolling backwards. The first visual we see is a naked man(though it should be mentioned that there are parts of him that are not visible), and the first line spoken is ""Time destroys everything"". This sets the tone perfectly; the glum, dark atmosphere, the bleak visuals, the seedy locations... only at the very end are we treated to bright, happy, beautiful colors. But by then, we almost can't enjoy it... we've seen the cruelty of the world, witnessed repulsive acts and experienced terror first-hand. In the end, one faces the ultimate truth... you don't know what you've got until it's gone. The acting, editing and character writing(as far as that can go, from just a synopsis) are all top-notch. It should be noted that most of the scenes are several minutes long... with only one camera angle, and no cuts. This, coupled with most of the acting being improvised, creates some of the most natural and *real* performances and scenes ever seen. The cinematography bothered me early on... for the first third of the film or so, it's just frantic beyond reason or belief. Seriously. You have to see it to believe it. With the subtitles on, it was also really hard to tell who were saying what in those scenes. The film contains some seriously disturbing sights... and it dwells on them. There are no quick images of something unsettling; instead, the camera finds itself a fixed position to view the unpleasantness and remains there for the duration of it. The two (in)famous scenes(I see little reason to name them here, as they have been mentioned countless times before, in relation to the film) are indeed very strong(I doubt anyone can claim them to be anything less than disgusting and disturbing in the extreme) and should *not* be viewed by anyone who thinks there is even a slight chance they may find it to be too much. It takes a lot to bother me, it takes a *lot* to shock me... but this film crossed that line, did so happily and did it several times in quick succession. Finally, I advise anyone to not eat anything for the first half hour of the film(for the reason why, read the trivia page); I, myself, did, and, well... nothing happened, but it wasn't a good idea. I urge anyone who believes they have the stomach for this film(and feel inclined to watch it, too) to just make the most of the shaky(literally) cinematography of that first bit and hold out, because after that, it gets good... really, really good, and getting to that is more than worth the wait. I recommend this to anyone who can take it and who find the subject and style interesting. I suggest you make sure that you find yourself in both groups before watching... otherwise, I would imagine, the film may be too strong for you. Difficult to sit through, but if you make it, it's worth it. 8/10",Irreversible
15,The_Void,Horribly captivating,9,2 February 2005,"Irreversible is a thoroughly unpleasant cinematic experience. It clearly knows this, and is keen to revel in it as the disorientating camera angles and monotonous tones of the soundtrack in the early moments of the film show. In fact, Irreversible appears to be on a mission to be as horrible and as nasty as it can possibly be and the result is a truly powerful film experience. After a lovely little epilogue to Gaspar Noé's earlier film, I Stand Alone, we are taken on a thriller ride through gay clubs and the underworld of France as our hero sets out for retribution after his girlfriend was raped and beaten by an unknown assailant. This isn't all, however, as the film professes that ""time destroys everything"" and to portray that, the events are shown in reverse order. This is clearly a result of Memento's influence on modern cinema, and it bodes really well in this film as the fact that the events are 'irreversible' would not have been able to be shown so destructively if the film followed the usual storytelling methods.Some people will come out of Irreversible asking themselves what it is that they've seen, why they watched it and why they feel guilty about watching it - and this is why Irreversible is so powerful. Cinema can have a profound effect on it's viewer, and Irreversible is one of the most adept films at showing this. During the film, we witness a man having his head caved in (literally) with a fire extinguisher, various perverted acts and, of course, the infamous rape scene involving Monica Bellucci. This scene is not a scene to be enjoyed, but at the same time it's utterly captivating  and despite the fact that it lasts over ten minutes and is thoroughly unpleasant, we don't notice and what Gaspar Noé has created is, in essence a train wreck - it's horrible, but at the same time we cant take our eyes away from it. This shows what a visual talent Noé is, as, for one, few filmmakers would dare to implement a sequence such as this in their film, and many wouldn't have the talent to portray it as horribly and intriguingly as he does here. Make no mistake, this film is not one for the faint hearted - but at the same time, it stays with you and it's not an experience you are likely to forget. Which makes it must see.",Irreversible
16,Mr-Fusion,"A sensory assault that leaves a bitter, horrible taste",2,27 November 2019,"If you make it through ""Irréversible"", then hats off, because you've just passed an endurance test. But what's the point?Nihilistic to its core, Gaspar Noé presents the story of a young woman who leaves a party only to be brutally raped and beaten in an underpass. Her boyfriend sets off on a vengeance trip with equally tragic results (furthermore, this is all laid out in reverse order). Noé's using both characters to comment on the randomness and cruelty of our world as well as the calamitous nature of revenge. But this is also a movie that bends over backwards to make sure the audience is disoriented, nauseated, and out-of-sorts to even ingest this kind of subject matter -- and that's what I don't get. The ten-minute sexual assault isn't enough, Noé tells this story with a clear hostility towards his viewers. ""Irréversible"" is a tale told in a sewer; a gutting, homophobic ninety minutes of utter misery.That said, I think Monica Bellucci deserves massive praise for her fearless performance during the actual assault. It is agonizing, vicious and unbelievably haunting and it took serious conviction to pull this off.I've sated my curiosity about this movie, but the chances of revisiting this are nil. Life is already too painful to put up with something like this.",Irreversible
17,HumanoidOfFlesh,Brilliant!,10,29 January 2003,"I am very surprised to see all of the negative complaints towards this film.Like ""I Spit on Your Grave"" or ""I Stand Alone"",""Irreversible"" is only rubbish to those who don't understand it,or don't want to understand it.Gaspar Noe tells us the story about love and revenge-a pregnant young woman(outstanding Monica Bellucci)is violently raped and tortured in the underground passage.Her boyfriend(Vincent Cassel)desperately tries to find her rapist to kill him.The infamous Monica Bellucci's anal rape scene is truly brutal and sickening,but at least the film can't be accused of eroticizing,trivializing or glamourizing rape,something many mainstream movies are guilty of.It actually shows that rape is a brutal and disgusting act.Congratulations should go to this stunningly beautiful actress for her brave performance.It's obvious that women should be treated with respect,unfortunately this is the kind of a sexual violence women are dealing with everyday and everywhere.In that case Cassel's savage behaviour is completely justified.The scenes in ""Rectum"" are genuinely nightmarish and infernal.The film will leave you shaken and desolated,so if you want to see something totally mind-shattering,then ""Irreversible"" is a must-see.An absolute 10 out of 10.",Irreversible
18,whpratt1,Excellent Film,10,9 February 2006,"This film is everything I had hoped it would be and even more so in many ways. If you want to see a film that portrays men's and women's feelings about life and sex, both straight and gay, this is a film that will enlighten you to what goes on in the minds of men and woman. You will experience titles of the film backwards, gay men enjoying themselves and also hookers having a wonderful time as well as a poor young gal getting raped in horrible graphic details, also a man's face being busted into pieces of blood and gore. There is also a scene about a he/she gal who shows her/his private parts.

Director Gaspar Noé, succeeds by making a film that offers shock value and a bitter hangover.What works in this non-linear narrative, is it's writing. Of course, this film is not going to be hailed by everyone. But I found the Screenplay absorbing & disturbing. It held me, the entire dull atmosphere is upsetting, but that works on it's advantage, as this story is meant to shock you.Gaspar Noé knew what he was getting into. Since it's release, the film has become hugely controversial and has remained as a boy-cotted topic in general discussions on films of the early 2000's.Monica Bellucci delivers an awesome performance. Vincent Cassel is fabulous, he lives his character from scene A to Z. Albert Dupontel is good.On the whole, Watch 'Irréversible', only if you have a strong heart.",Irreversible
20,Smells_Like_Cheese,"The 3 H's: Horrifc, Haunting and Honest",10,19 September 2010,"A few months ago while I was going through the message boards on IMDb, someone was talking about disturbing films and one that seemed to come up the most was a film called Irreversible. This film has come up in discussion so many times when the subject of disturbing film is brought to attention. When I think I've seen the worst of the worst, I figured I should see what Irreversible had to offer. I have to admit after watching this movie, it stayed with me. Definitely not being the easiest movie to watch, Irreversible has a style to it and a very disturbing story that can haunt many for different reasons. Wither it's the extreme violence, the cursing, the drugs or the 9 minute rape scene, Gasper Noe takes you into this very dark world and doesn't let you go.The beginning of Irreversible (that is, the chronological end of the story) features two men going to a homosexual S&M nightclub called ""The Rectum."" Minutes earlier, the men named Marcus and Pierre, are escorted out of that nightclub by the police. Marcus is on a stretcher, apparently injured, and Pierre is in handcuffs. Earlier that evening, Marcus and Pierre arrived at the club in a frantic search for somebody nicknamed le Tenia. Marcus finds the man believed to be le Tenia and attacks him. The man pins down Marcus, then snaps his arm. Pierre rescues Marcus by bludgeoning the attacker's face using a fire extinguisher, brutally and fatally crushing the man's skull after repeated blows. During the onslaught, the real le Tenia is seen to be amused by the situation. It is revealed that le Tenia raped Marcus's girlfriend Alex, and placed her in a coma by beating her severely.Filmed backwards I thought was extremely brilliant, at least the way I interpret it. We see EXTREME violence and sexuality in the beginning, pretty much being up front that this movie is going to be very uncomfortable and not a movie for all. Gasper Noe is basically telling the audience ""what you see is what you get"", not trying to pull you into something you might not want to be apart of. It also shows that these two men who kill this man violently are possibly the bad guys? No, it turns out as we discover that a woman they both love has been brutally raped and beaten. Then when we meet her, she's not just some woman who is the girlfriend of one of men trying to get revenge or a girl at a party dressed in a skimpy outfit, this is a woman who is walking out of a party trying to get home and comes across the ""wrong place, wrong time"" situation. The rape scene, reason being that it's so different than any other rape scene you might have viewed in another film, it's long, one angle and the words that come out of the rapist's mouth are just awful. It's the most realistic rape scene I've viewed and I have to warn you that please, if you have a weak stomach or have had that horrific experience, this is not a movie for you.Irreversible is definitely violent, there is a scene that most people debate which is more disturbing, the rape or the fire extinguisher. The fire extinguisher is at the beginning of the film and is definitely realistic and beyond disturbing, because you see everything. Also the hatred behind the killer is just there, he has no remorse for what he is doing. Then when we find out later that he kills the wrong guy, it just makes it that more brutal. Gasper Noe also films the movie in the worst way in the beginning making the audience sick with his spinning camera and disturbing noises. He doesn't lie to you, he knows this film is going to be one of the most frightening pieces of work you'll see, and he doesn't want you comfortable with it. Irreversible is one of the hardest films for me to recommend because it just depends on what kind of a viewer you are. If you can handle extreme violence, sexuality and language, you could get through this. I watched A Clockwork Orange when I was a teenager and hated it because I felt that Kubrick was trying to make me sympathize with Alex, before watching Irreversible, I re-watched A Clockwork Orange and realized I missed the whole message of the film. It wasn't about Alex, but our society and I have the greatest admiration for the film now. Irreversible shows how we can go from hating someone to understanding their position to rooting for them. Are we the animals? Irreversible will have you thinking for days, this is a film I will never forget.10/10",Irreversible
21,=G=,!!lebisreverrI,7,10 September 2003,"""Irreversible"" is an art house experience which tells a story of a happy young adult couple who suffer; she through rape and he through revenge. There's little story in this uncomfortably harsh film full of sex, nudity, vulgarity, and violence. What story there is is told a chapter at a time in reverse chronological order so we see the unhappy conclusion first and work back toward the happier beginning. In addition to the backward flow, the film uses strange floating camera techniques which could cause motion sickness and ends with a long strobing blank screen which could induce seizure in some people and laboratory animals. Given subtitles, gross unpleasantness, and imagery which is annoying if not offensive, the only reason any normal nonpervert would want to view this film would be to experience it...presumably the same reason people ride roller coasters while screaming with joyful terror. Certainly not for everyone, ""Irreversible"" is not good or bad but it is different. Recommended for realists with a taste for art projects and bitterly harsh drama. (B)Spoilers -> The most offensive sequences are a long violent anal rape of a woman and a man getting his head mashed to a pulp with a fire extinguisher.",Irreversible

23,KineticSeoul,"Disturbing and shocking film that goes in a reverse chronological order, but nothing really astonishing",6,6 March 2011,"From just few film I seen directed by this guy, I can tell Gaspar Noé is a ballsy director and from his works you can sort of tell Stanley Kubrick was one of his inspiration sort of. camera work is very nauseating at times now I know why it went in this direction but a 10 yr old could hold the camera more properly and sometimes don't even know what is going on during certain scenes. I don't know if that was the aim to make the audience nauseating or just trying to seem artsy but I didn't like it. Maybe it was to try and make everything seem more grimy and ugly on purpose to show the nature of the people and direction of it all. What makes this movie unique though is that it goes in a reverse chronological order where you see how the story end and from than on it goes in the direction of the beginning of the story. This is basically a disturbing movie with some shock value but nothing really outstanding. The reverse chronological order in a movie, maybe has been done before but the way it managed to pull it off is pretty simple and yet sort of intriguing. Gaspar Noe seems to be a director that doesn't have regards to the audience or the actors or actresses when it comes to their well-being. Which can be a positive or a negative depending on who is watching this movie. I don't particularly think this movie has notions of enjoyment or even entertainment, but other dark notions. This movie really isn't for everyone, most mainstream audiences may actually dislike this movie. But it does have it's target audiences, I didn't find this movie to be uber terrible but it wasn't anything astonishing either.6.3/10",Irreversible
24,dromasca,"Strong and expressive, but not for everyone to watch",10,6 September 2003,"'Irreversible' is the best film I saw lately. It is a strong and original work, but it is not for everyone to watch, understand, or enjoy. The film is about the brutality of rape, and about the justification of revenge. The technique of telling the story in reverse order makes a lot of sense here, and helps us understand how easily our comfortable lives can be turned into a spiral of hell. Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' used the same technique, but there the result was just a cool, technical film. Here, we are rolled back from the violent end to the normal lives of the characters before the assault, and this is why the filmed violence does not look as inserted for commercial reasons, but to make the message stronger.There are at least two scenes of intense violence and another scene of sex that may turn censors and different kind of viewers against this film. Some people will not find the violent scenes easy to watch, and may simply walk off the theater, or turn off the player. The technique of filming in one shot, in a reality TV style only emphasizes these scenes. However they make perfect artistic sense. There is nothing cheap here, and the sincerity of the acting in the whole film proves that good actors under the hand of a good director do not need strict coaching to make the film happen.
People need to be warned that this is no usual film. True cinema lovers will understand and love it. It gets a rare 10/10 on my personal scale",Irreversible

The irrelevant scene is followed by a long sequence of incomprehensible cinema, filmed using a spinning, constantly moving camera, low-visibility lighting, and repetitive screaming by a maniac looking for someone in a gay joint, probably the worst 30 minutes ever captured on celluloid by a professional filmmaker. After that it gets better although there is very little that is interesting except for the rape scene, which is quite effective in conveying the stark brutality of the crime.

I liked the interpretations of both Vincent Cassel who played as Marcus and Monica Bellucci who played as Alex, and I believe that they deserved a better direction. This movie had a great potential of becoming a really amazing movie if there were not that many scenes with the moving camera which caused nausea to many people.

30,leplatypus,Inconceivable!

I'm not prude or censor but what's the point filming such difficult moments for anything and with such care? It ranks with ""5 x 2"" for the sexual contents and ""Silent Hill"" for the ""planned"" pain in my list of useless movies.It's a pity because the director (who really mumbles on his commentary!) has something to say: going from hell (a sad end) to paradise (a happy beginning) in reverse is a strong experience for the audience: imagine ""Titanic"" or ""World Trade Center"" like this! I agree with him with the blindness and deafness of injustice: sometimes, whatever you do, you choose, you are doomed! And that's because we have limited time here, that we should act for the ""Good"".His camera-work is imaginative and artistic (see the poster of 2001 and the birth of colors).And with all that plus a fine cast (Bellucci, Cassel, Dupontel), he only delivers this",Irreversible
31,TheMovieDiorama,Irréversible has made me unable to reverse the explicit horrors I just witnessed.,8,22 December 2018,"Love is irreversible. Sex is irreversible. Time is irreversible, and time destroys everything. After delving into my first Gaspar Noé feature, I immediately wanted to escape his uncompromising mind. This is an excellent film, but one I would never want to watch again. Never. Damn...what an experience! A woman is brutally raped and assaulted, to which her lover and her friend attempt to seek their own vengeance. Edited in reverse chronological order, the narrative's sequence conveys the theme of the destructive force of time. It allows Noé to deliver chaos and nauseating camerawork within the first half, to which he then calms down in the second half to focus on the humanity between these two lovers. Each scene is filmed in one take, allowing the story to become immersive. These are separated by transitions that were ridiculously frantic as the camera spins out of control. Innovative? Sure. Nauseatingly unnecessary? Definitely. Both Cassel and Bellucci give physically demanding performances, as the former showcases both love and anger whereas the latter has to undergo one of the most brutal scenes in cinematic history. I'm just going to say it, that extended controversial rape scene was horrible and the most horrific scene I've ever watched. The sheer ferocity and helplessness made for a scarily realistic assault that definitely makes this film difficult to watch. Incredibly uncomfortable. Yet, it's necessary to convey the irreversible damage that it causes. Noé makes you feel that damage by forcing you to watch. Understandably her lover is raging after the incident, however the frequency of homophobic comments was slightly excessive (considering it's the first scene). ""The Rectum"" club sequence and the last thirty second seizure were also nauseating. Still, a unique experience like this, that both deafened and silenced me, deserves praise. It doesn't conform to exploitation. It doesn't glorify criminal acts. Subjectively and objectively speaking, it's art.",Irreversible

33,jzappa,Time Destroys Everything.,10,5 May 2011,"In truth, all time is always present, specifically, past, present and future are all occurring simultaneously somehow, but our perception goes through this concurrence in sequential form. It's like a book one reads for the first time. At any particular time, the whole book exists in itself but we can only read one page. The other pages, while existing at the same time with that one, stay beyond our ability to perceive. What Irreversible is about is if we could by some means read each page of the book together, or be capable of experiencing the book in total in a solitary instant then we'd be on the brink of a true understanding of it. Likewise in our lives, previous times are recalled but not currently experienced and the future remains unidentified.Irreversible is a film so brutal and unpleasant that most people will find it insufferable. I've even met horror fanatics that detest it on grounds of not being able to withstand the brutality of only two scenes. Or shots, frankly. The camera watches unflinchingly as a person (not yet viewed as a character) is degraded and terrorized for numerous lengthy, remorseless minutes in a ceaseless stationary shot that never cuts away, and as a man has his face literally pulverized with a fire extinguisher, in a hand-held shot that feels as if to partake in the pounding. That the movie has a profound intention is to its tribute but makes it no more endurable.Primarily, and importantly, the story is told in reverse. Memento notably employed that chronology. Now think about what happens if you reverse the sequence of Irreversible, so that it begins with fleeting, ephemeral images of the ultimate aftermath and tracks back through time to a peaceful guilelessness of youth and tenderness. There are quite a few ways in which this method creates a profound experience: It doesn't build toward sex and violence as its climactic inducement. It starts with its two staggeringly sadistic scenes, and then trails back into lives oblivious that they're about to be eternally changed by them.It also generates another sort of fascination in those earlier scenes, which are fully known to us but not the characters. When Bellucci and Cassel embrace and chat, we recognize what a slim fiber by which all happiness hangs. To both experience and realize the future, in that order, may not be a miracle but a dismay. Life would be unfit to live without the unawareness of our inexperience. Vengeance goes before violation. Simultaneously, and most importantly, Cassel is the vicious monster of our astonishing first impression, and the offense has yet to be seen. The later scenes make Bellucci appear defenseless and threatened. It also makes the charm and cordiality of both Bellucci and Cassel much deeper when we recognize what shadowy feelings she conceals.The reality is, the backward sequence makes Irreversible a film that structurally defies and laments its vicious brutality, while ordinary linearity would cajole us down a seductive plot course toward a scandalous, manipulative payoff. By placing the cruelty on the threshold, Gaspar Noe coerces us to solemnly contemplate the truly stunning brutality concerned.",Irreversible
34,jtindahouse,More cinema needs to be like this,10,11 December 2017,"""More cinema needs to be like this."" Now I can understand how at first that might be misconstrued as a strange thing to say about a film like this, however allow me to explain. Sure, this film is absolutely brutal and incredibly hard to watch at times, but because of that it is also a thing of beauty. This film is showing us how fragile life really is. In the blink of an eye your world can be turned upside down. Now a lot of films set out to tell a similar message to that, but fail. And why do they fail? Because they are afraid to be bold, memorable and show everything that needs to be shown. This film never backs down in any way and I love it for that.I've always made it clear that I'm a huge fan of French cinema. The French have so much patience in their story-telling style. I love American films in their own way too, but I wish so badly that they weren't afraid to take the time to fully express them self like the French ones do so well. Some of the dialogue in this movie is exquisite. It's designed to break you, if the imagery hasn't already done so. In fact every single detail in this film is designed to destroy the audience - in a good way. In a way that will make this film stick with you until your dying day. I can't say enough good things about this film. Please see it if you haven't already. You'll be so pleased you did (even if you might not realise it at first).",Irreversible
35,billcr12,Violent but Interesting,8,23 July 2012,"Monica Bellucci is Alex and Vincent Cassell is Marcus in a movie that runs backwards.

The camera spins faster and faster and a sign is displayed stating, time destroys everything.Marcus and Alex are having a conversation in bed, post coitus. She mentions a dream where she is in a red tunnel and brings up the possibility of being pregnant. He leaves to pick up a bottle of wine, and she takes a shower and uses a home test to confirm that she is with child. On a Paris metro train, Alex, Marcus, and Pierre talk about sex and during the conversation, it turns out that Pierre had dated Alex and he accuses Al of stealing her from him. The three are at a party and Alex leaves; becoming upset at Marcus' use of drugs and alcohol.On her way home, Alex sees a man beating a transsexual prostitute, who stops and turns his attention to her, raping and beating her at knife point. Marcus and Pierre pass by the crime scene and discover that Alex is the victim, and that she is in a coma. The two meet a couple of street criminals who offer help in finding the attacker for money.

36,freemantle_uk,Bleak and divisive,8,19 April 2020,"The French film Irréversible was one of the most gruelling and violent film ever made. The film was a twist on the rape-revenge thriller by having a high-calibre cast and showing violence to be brutal, not cathartic.The USP of the film was it told the story backward, a similar trick that Memento and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind did. It starts with two men looking for revenge after their friend was attacked and ends looking at a brighter moment with the relationship between Marcus (Vincent Cassel) and Alex (Monica Bellucci).Gaspar Noé told the film in a series of long takes, making Irréversible a bit like a series of short films. It was effective and unflinching during the violent sequences. Long, unbroken takes is a technique that I am a big sucker.The film had three excellent leads. Cassel stands out as a man a man filled with rage and hate and becomes a calmer, more likeable man at the end - but twisted on a standard character journey because the events are told in reverse.Not a film for the faint-hearted and it is understandable why it's so divisive.",Irreversible
37,Chris_Docker,"Interesting, but easy to miss the point on first viewing",8,15 August 2002,"Irreversible is a graphically violent film that intentionally leaves nothing to the imagination, including watching a man's face disintegrate as it is bashed in with a fire extinguisher, and a very violent nine-minute, single shot rape scene (with one of France's top actresses). The film totally divides viewers. Many people will walk out rather than watch the whole film - which would make it difficult to assess, especially as it goes through major shifts of mood and tone that are intrinsic to the whole.Irreversible is certainly a serious piece of film making. The use of flashbacks is sequential - we see the 'end' scene first, then the scene that led up to it, and so on. It is full of powerful images and innovative techniques. It can be described as a journey from hell to heaven. The theme is 'time destructs everything' and, starting in reverse by showing, at the beginning of the film, terrible scenes that are the conclusion of events we have yet to witness in flashback, slowly moves from nightmare to happiness.The first 'nightmare' scene is in a gay sex club somewhere in France. The soundtrack has a steady note that reverberates insistently like an audio depiction of a throbbing headache. The camera, hand held, thrashes wildly around in the dimly red-lit areas, catching up with and following the two men out for revenge. It slows somewhat to focus on the apparent object of their anger. The initial attack is thwarted, but the second of the two men takes over and pummels the victims head to a pulp - and we see the face and head disintegrate under blows as it is mercilessly bashed with a fire extinguisher (an unusual and unexpected use of CGIs).Next we follow the attackers before they reach the nightclub. We learn that they are hunting the perpetrator of a violent rape on the girlfriend of one of them. The film is still not easy to watch, but the jerkiness of the camera slows enough to allow us the indulgence of following some sort of plot. The anger of the two men as they try to trace their intended victim is still uncomfortable viewing.Next we see the rape scene. This time the camera is motionless. The movement and struggle of the victim becomes paramount. The graphic nature is mostly confined to the violence. There is no penetration seen, and very little exposure except a momentary glimpse of a breast. The attacker's penis, seen briefly at the end of the act, was added digitally (explained the Director in a Q&A discussion at it's British premiere). After the rape, the attacker beats the victim into a bloody coma.Next we enter a scene that is slightly more recognizable as ordinary life, although not exactly pleasurable to watch. It is a party where the future victim and her boyfriend and another man are present. The scene is hedonistic, with drink, drugs and a hedonistic abandon which the woman eventually finds distasteful and she leaves early.As the story unfolds backwards, ever into scenes that are more pleasing on the ear and eye, we see the future rape victim in an ordinary and delightful relationship with one of the men. It turns out that the other man was her former boyfriend. In a beautiful few scene of domesticity she takes a pregnancy test and visits an open air park area where children are playing delightfully on the grass, running in and out of a fountain. The camera work, having gone slowly from barely watchable to enjoyable, takes us on a heavenly treat as we watch the children from above in play that seems almost like a cinematic dance sequence.We put all the pieces together in the knowledge that all traces of humanity will be wiped away (as we have seen the 'ending'). The film finishes with several minutes of strobe light, enveloping to the initial drug-like hand held camera work by its concentration on light rather than specific form.There are many haunting 'comparison' elements between the horrific scenes and the pleasant ones. For instance, the victim's mouth is held shut by her attacker's hand during most of the rape. Earlier in the story (and later in the film), her mouth is held shut in a fun-loving way by her boyfriend during sex-play. Some of the lines of dialogue similarly echo and cause interesting resonances.But are these technical innovations enough to justify the film? Quite possibly, though as art and a study a study of sexual repression and violence rather than as a statement about rape. The rape scene conveys the horror of rape to women in a way that underlines the importance of not walking home through a subway in a very disreputable area alone at night, but it fails to show the traumatic effect on the woman's life after she has survived it, and the emphasis on the violence (the victim is beaten into a coma afterwards) maybe blurs the horror of the actual act of rape, or suggests that rape not involving violence is not so bad. Irreversible is a story of revenge which, at it's most basic level, simply emphasizes male violence and physical violence as a reaction and an ends to a means.Interestingly, during the rape scene in the subway, a man appears in the background, starts to enter the subway and thinks better of it and leaves. This is perhaps like those members of the audience who find the initial half of the film so distasteful that they leave. Only deep reflection on the film convinced me of its value as art. I had also made the mistake of sitting too close, so the disorientating strobe and backbeat overwhelm the consciousness so much that it is hard to view anything dispassionately. Irreversible is not an easy film, but a valuable one.",Irreversible
38,EVOL666,A Little Over-Hyped,6,21 September 2005,"IRREVERSIBLE is a decent movie. I didn't find it to be as wonderful as many other people did, but still worth a look. As anyone who knows anything about this film knows, the concept is that the film starts at the end and works it's way back to the beginning, MEMENTO-style. The story is basically about 2 guys who seek revenge for the rape of one of their girlfriends. I initially sought this movie out because I had heard how ""shocking"" and ""controversial"" it was...I have to honestly say I was disappointed. The face-crushing-via-fire-extinguisher scene IS pretty cool and graphic, and the extended rape scene IS pretty brutal, but I just didn't feel that those two things alone create a ""shocking"" or ""controversial"" film. Those two scenes happen relatively early in the film, and everything sort of slows down after that. The ending has a decent added surprise that made the whole film come together a little more, but I have to admit I was just kind of bored with the whole film. It's worth a look, and the rape and head-crush scenes may be a little much for the casual film-goer, but if you're looking for hard-core exploitation or gore, it's not in this one... 6/10",Irreversible

40,Jonny_Numb,more than the sum of its shocks,7,10 July 2005,"I'm a sucker for film-world hype--always have been, and probably always will be. When I stumble across a film that is so controversial it inspires both gasps of horror and cheers of praise, I flock to it. There is something intriguing about film's capacity to house unpleasantness, and just how far a director will go in conveying his message (it's always interesting to see whether or not they have a justified reason for the excess). ""Irreversible,"" the backward-structured film from French shock auteur Gaspar Noe (""I Stand Alone"") spins you out of control with as much regularity as his camera and characters will allow. It's a curious piece of work designed to provoke the audience--at the beginning, you're disoriented and confused (and, if you're like me, getting carsick from the deliberately erratic camera movements), and even repulsed by the actions of the unfamiliar characters hassling the patrons of a seedy homosexual club, a sequence that ends with a ghastly murder. Okay, then, so what? Clearly the rest of the movie is going to give us an explanation...but would the film have had a similar effect if it were told in a straightforward manner? Is the backward motion of ""Irreversible"" just a gimmick used by Noe (who is not immune from snobbery and pretension) to draw attention to his film? It's hard to say. Personally, I reject the notion of the reverse storyline being used as a gimmick, simply because of how deliberately the previous pieces fit (certain passages of dialog, particularly a discussion of orgasms that serves as a prelude to one of the most horrifying rape scenes in film history); Noe certainly wasn't asleep in his construction of the film. ""Irreversible"" displays the type of oppressive misanthropy (the dialog is loaded with racial and homophobic slurs) evidenced in Noe's ""I Stand Alone"" (the tale of an out-of-work butcher driven to madness by everyone around him), but then pulls back from the hard-edged violence to show a tender humanity that might be even more startling, since the film could have easily played itself for nothing but shock value the entire time. ""Irreversible"" is an unsettling conundrum that guides us through the highs and lows of the human condition--it pushes buttons of morality, shows in graphic detail what others would only suggest, and brings us out the end of the tunnel exhausted, invigorated, and breathless. A stunning film, somewhat hampered by its excessive dialog.",Irreversible
41,I_Ailurophile,Difficult content in an okay movie,5,26 January 2021,"Let's not mince words: Every one-line synopsis of 'Irreversible' tells you exactly what happens in this movie, and the pivotal scene is extremely difficult to watch. I can't say I kept track of how long the scene is, but it seems considerably longer, and is very much the agonizing focal point of the narrative. It's not fun, it's not entertainment, it's not thought-provoking; only in the most bare technical sense could it be considered art. This is storytelling, and it's not a pleasant story being told.That having been said, I adore both Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci, and wish always that I could more easily watch more of their films. They both put in outstanding performances here, and are ultimately the real draw, if you can get past the stomach-churning violence at the film's core.Credit to the editing team for splicing this film together in the way it's intended. That the narrative of 'Irreversible' is told in reverse chronological order is a point in its favor, bolstering against all odds the argument that this is art. On the other hand, this certainly isn't the only movie to do so, so don't take that novelty in itself as reason to watch. Yet the emotional gut-punch that caps off the beginning of the narrative/end of the film wouldn't have nearly as much impact if this story were told in a conventional way, so there's that to consider as well.I watched this because I had previously heard, in essence, everything that I've described above, and wanted to challenge myself with a film outside my comfort zone. And the thing is, having watched 'Irreversible,' I'm not entirely sure of any other reason to watch this. It's a grueling feature that is the cinematic equivalent of climbing a mountain: the only real explanation for enduring the experience that I can think of is ""because it's there."" I'm likewise unsure of any motivation for creating such a test of will save for ""because it's there."" I don't know who I would ever recommend this to, or why.As a result, I'm a little torn. For a film to broach difficult subject matter certainly isn't an automatic mark against it, and this is, from a production standpoint, a very well made film with fine performances. On that basis, despite myself, I consider it more highly. Yet I can't conjure any reason to watch a movie like this, or to make one, except for the challenge, ""because it's there."" So... Why, though?",Irreversible
42,Samiam3,Hell on Earth,7,6 December 2010,"After viewing Irreversible, one cannot help but ask who the film was intended for. It is quite possible that Irreversible was intended to please no one, not even art critics. Indeed, this nasty piece of work almost drowns in self-indulgence. Director Gaspar Noé is clearly not satisfied unless he can steal the title of 'most disturbing film' or something of that sort. Irreversible turns a world of decency and convention upside down, resulting in a film that might literally hurt to watch, but maybe that is why Irreversible deserves some credit...it has balls.I guess it counts for something when a movie decides to run backwards (obviously a decision influenced by Memento) with every scene done in single shots. It must also count for something when considering that few movies ask us to endure a ten minute rape scene which is as vulgar as anything in movie history. The style of cinematography is also unheard of, but effective and distinctive and strangely brilliant. Pieces of Irreversible, if isolated from the rest of the movie, look like something that was literally produced and shot in hell. The last shot is especially epic, and may actually have the capacity to actually cause brain damage to any frail person in the audience.There is no denying that Irreversible is a film that wants to hurt. It takes a crazy genius or a heartless fascist to do something like this. Only objective film-goers will be able to sit through this film and appreciated what it does well.",Irreversible
43,Seraphion,Great technicalities with a thrust to your morale,7,29 July 2015,"The movie is one of those hard jab on the stomach for viewers as it presents a very graphic and convincing imagery of brutality up close. It also presents us with a sublime sense of cinematography as the filmmakers take us in and out through the movie with the swirling camera trick, and executes the scenes in long sequences. The story flow may be a double edge for the movie, though. In one side, it helps to tone down the brutal scene through the careful placing of the scene ordering. But in one side, without any markers, this can also confuse less experienced viewers as to how the real chronology of the story takes place. The acting overall is quite good. Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel did great jobs in portraying their characters, especially for Bellucci.",Irreversible
44,EdgarST,Moral reflections,10,27 May 2007,"""Irreversible"" is a reflection on antagonistic positions. It's not that they clash per se, but the struggle worsens by today's state of affairs. On one side, white. On the other, black. On the white side, life, procreative act. On the other, death, sodomy. On the bright side, love. On the dark side, hate. Both ends are not reconciled in the middle: they are united by a red tunnel. Red is the color of passion, not love (rose is reserved for it.) Red is a color of low vibration, not recommended for concentration with colors, because of the ignoble vibrations it attracts, as ignoble as the act of violence –more than brutish sexuality- that explodes in the movie's red tunnel.It's not surprising that filmmaker Gaspar Noé has mentioned Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Salò or The 120 Days of Sodom"" as one of his influences for making ""Irreversible."" When Pasolini defended his movie –a masterwork still not reconciled with bourgeois morality, after more than 30 years of being made- he cited Marquis de Sade's words: the act of sodomy denies life; it is a laughable grimace of procreation. In the black and red points of ""Irreversible,"" there are acts of sodomy.In times of insolent incredulity, in which many of us laugh at abstract thought and meta-languages, and assert that there is nothing else to do but destroy, as in a manga Armageddon, Noé made a movie that, without renouncing to fashionable images and effects, faces us with these notions. What he tells us is known from year zero, but it is appropriate to reassess it today, with the retrospective analysis of the facts that led to the indescribable death of the first scenes.If you can stand the first 30 minutes of film, you will make a journey to the essential values of human coexistence. We can stand it or not for different reasons. Many cannot tolerate the fleeting male sex images in a disco, or the ""indescribable death."" Others, like myself, feel uncomfortable with the constant camera movement (as in a TV show that tries to be ""modern."") But we later discover that it is Noé's visual strategy, to express the frenzied emotions that move the characters. As Noé recedes and tells us the story in reverse, the camera becomes more stable and its movements turn more fluid.If you can pass through those endless minutes, you will be revealed an ethical proposition, a necessary proposal for our times of confusion in which almost nobody speaks of codes to live in harmony beyond guns and bombs. Few parents, priests, politicians or teachers seem to care. Ethics have been replaced by patronizing ""life styles"", in a state of things in decay that gives excellent returns to those who want to see us all gone, so they can distribute the profits among a few, thanks to the myths of globalization.A single movie cannot change the actual road the world is following, a road paved with war, murder, corruption, rape, etc. Neither these times are worse than others already experienced by humanity: sooner or later, people find better ways. But ""Irreversible"" is a warning. It warns us of what is happening outside the cinemas and our homes. And also inside, even inside our heads.""Irreversible"" will not change the world, but it will remain for the future as the intelligent intent of a man that learnt (the hard way, judging from his filmography) that the foundations of humanity are solidly rooted in love and creative sex, and that if we are healthy, the better. One can take the so-called ""via negativa,"" wandering through dark alleys (as the disco in the beginning), but in the end we will reach the same conclusion: that white, bright, intermittent light that almost blinds us in the movie's end.",Irreversible
45,rosscinema,A case of revenge,6,1 September 2005,"Though most viewers and critics found the graphic violence in this film to be (not only) excessive but the main source for their disliking this effort but I'm one of those who can understand the reason for it and my complaint comes at the overly used ""backward style"" that has become nearly cliché. Story starts with the last scene where we see two men in a gay S&M club called ""Rectum"" where they are frantically searching for Le Tenia (tapeworm) who has raped the girlfriend of one of the two but when they find him things go horribly wrong.*****SPOILER ALERT***** When Marcus (Vincent Cassel) and Pierre (Albert Dupontel) think they have found Le Tenia (Jo Prestia) in the bowels of that nightmarish club Marcus ends up with a broken arm while Pierre saves him (from rape) by bludgeoning the man with a fire extinguisher. While all this goes on the real Le Tenia is off to the side laughing at the events that have taken place! The story continues in reverse where we see how everything ended up so horribly from getting information from a she-male hooker to a couple of vigilante thugs who help in their search. Alex (Monica Bellucci) is the girlfriend of Marcus and the ex-wife of Pierre but the three of them get along and are at a party when she leaves suddenly and is attacked and anally raped. Before the party Marcus and Alex were in their apartment in bed but when he leaves to pick something up at the store Alex finds out that she is indeed pregnant.This is only the second film for director Gaspar Noe but even if your part of the demographic that hated this effort I think Noe makes it clear that he's a young filmmaker to watch. His first film was ""I stand Alone"" and if you look at both of his choices in directing than one might say that Noe's attracted to characters that have a difficult time controlling themselves. The graphic nature in which this story is told is easily going to put off certain portions of the audience but for those with stronger stomaches the skill in which this was made is clearly evident. I was one who at first wasn't sure if the wrong man was killed at the beginning of the film and I had to look on this website to be sure but for those of you who are still confused the wrong guy was killed. This is arguably the most important part of the story in which it shows the futility of revenge and a second rape was only seconds away from occurring! Still, I'm with most of the critics who are tired of the ""Memento"" style of storytelling and it's become passé in the world of cinema and you have to wonder just how effective this film would have been otherwise. I'm not saying that this is a terrific film because I really don't think it is but I did find it visually and audibly interesting and gives notice that Noe is a talent to watch in the future.",Irreversible
46,Galina_movie_fan,Will The Beauty Save The World?,8,9 February 2005,"The plot of the film is simple: a woman (Monica Belucci) is brutally raped by a stranger; and her boyfriend (Vincent Cassel) and ex-boyfriend (Albert Dupontel) who are best friends set out for revenge. What is crucial, the story is told backward. The most obvious success for this film is the directing by Noe. He has crafted a nightmare that is both original and horrifying. If the inferno exists somewhere, one of its circles definitely looks like the ""The Rectum"" bar, and the other - like the underpass where Alex (Monica Belucci) was brutally sodomized and beaten for long nine minutes that seemed as an eternity. The pulsing score that accompanies the film contains, for the first sixty minutes, a constant 27-hertz tone specifically designed by Noé to cause nausea in the audience. It felt like someone was constantly drilling the holes in my head. The director creates the scenes of such pain and violence that makes ""Natural Born Killers"" look and feel like a puppet show. One of these is a scene where a man gets his head bashed in with a fire extinguisher with the camera never turned away and the sound is amplified. The movie shocks you, and then it goes and shocks you even more when there is no violence on the screen. I broke in tears during the bedroom scene - so much love, tenderness and desire Monica and Vincent had for each other. They did not know what was ahead; I did. In the end, one cannot help questioning the very fragile, illusory nature of happiness, how easy it is to destroy everything. Is it a blessing or curse not to know what lies ahead and not be able to change the future? Dostoevsky said almost hundred and fifty years ago that the Beauty will save the world. I don't know. Not this world. Not during my time.'Irreversible' is a shocking anti-violence film; one has to decide whether he or she wants to see it. I personally think it is a must see but I would not be surprised if a lot of viewers refuse. It took me a very long time to see it. I am glad I did.",Irreversible
47,begob,Brilliant joke,10,13 September 2014,"A rapist comes up with the idea that time destroys everything, while in the basement a violent hunt is underway.Controversial, but there is a cosmic joke at the heart of this.Strange opening scene, with two characters from a previous film (prequel or sequel?), who end up commenting on the racket from a police raid on a buggery club down below, Rectum. Intriguing, but then the action kicks off with the spinning camera and woozy music, and only calms down after 25 mins - it felt like 5.A chase follows, and I finally twigged we were travelling back in time. The brutal scene in the underpass, the party, the love triangle, the giddy relationship, the desire for children, and spinning out into the universe.The photography and sound are unsettling, until we reverse back through the looking glass to the time before the event. The performances are spot on, with wonderful sympathy between the two lovers in what I think is one long take centred around their bedroom, but even then subsequent events are woven in.The only reservation I had was with the scene in the train, where the characters become typically talkie-talkie in the French way. And I'm not sure they followed up on the pill given to the lover. But still, it's a 10/10.The Joke? The irreversible was reversed. Entropy and time's arrow were sent back to where they came from.

48,Lady_Targaryen,Le temps détruit tout - Time destroys everything,7,8 October 2006,"'Irréversible' is considered to be one of the most controversial films of 2002, since it has strong scenes of rape and murder. Many people are saying about how the rape scene is violent and terrible, but in my opinion, the fire extinguisher scene is worse than the rape to watch.The beginning of the movie, where Pierre and Marcus are in the ''Rectum'', let me very uncomfortable to watch, but I discovered in the trivia section that the set was indeed'' very cavernous and confusing, and that many of the crew members, became claustrophobic in it.''The story is told backwards, what can make many people stay confuse about it.( I got confuse in the beginning of the movie,but nothing as watching the movie two times to understand it better)The director's point in this film is that time destroys everything. The story starts with happiness and a nice relationship, and in the end, everything falls apart.Alex, raped and in coma, probably lost her baby and her aggressor stays alive and intact.

Pierre is friend of both of them and Alex's ex boyfriend. One day, when the three of them are in a party,Alex stays angry with Marcus because he is using drugs.She then decides to go away from the party alone. Not finding any cab, she decides to enter in an underpass to go home. The rape takes place when Alex encounters Le Tenia beating a prostitute in the pedestrian underpass.

50,m-47826,"Good idea, tacky execution.",6,27 June 2020,"Gaspard Noé is a troubled soul. Or an upstart director who just wants to leave his print. Any means necessary. Either way, it lacks genuineness. The first part is just a cliché shock value with dirty men doing dirty things in a club called « rectum ». The camera work is so bad there, you don't even get into the action. And the death scene everyone was talking about back in 02, is so over the top it's ridiculous. Then the story unfurls in reverse, with the victim's husband being so extremely agressive and stupid, you have zero sympathy for him or his state of shock. The ex isn't better either, but we have proofs of it later. Off to the rape scene. It's very intense, great acting. But once again, the director just wants to force the issue, and loses in effectiveness. Of course it don't stop there, as we saw how badly beaten the woman's face was, a couple of minutes ago. So we get to see this too. I think that's the part that made me cringe the most. This, on top of that. I know it wasn't meant to be eased to me in any way, but still. Poor woman. Until I got to know her. I'm not saying she deserved that, nobody does. But her character fell short from the start. And was bound to have something bad happen to her, and not knowing how to defend herself. Which is pretty pathetic. So how can you feel for this tragedy? I think that's the best thing about this movie, how the reversed chronology makes you detach from anything bad happening, and you either feel bad or ok about it. The last part is just building up how such promising lives can be crushed in just one night. Another thing I loved about the movie. Movie that turns from peaceful to loud and disturbing right before the end credits. Time is irreversible, ok. Have a good life.",Irreversible
51,omendata,Sometimes the emperor truly does have no clothes!,2,8 June 2021,"This film illustrates quite well the current state of what we now call art!If all we have left to call art is shock value then it is not really art any more.I watched this due to the high rating on IMDB but cannot for the life of me fathom how it has this ridiculous rating.The first 20 minutes of crazy swirling visuals and white noise with camerawork performed by a whirling dervish was enough to give you a headache but i persevered.The dialogue was atrocious and felt like there was no logical flow and then I read that most of the script was actually just improvised which figures as it is mind numbingly boring and banal in the extreme.The death by fire extinguisher was indeed quite shocking and well done, it in reality did look real but this is the only part of the film that I can honestly give the director any credit for. The rape scene was quite a sickener but I don't give it any less for trying to portray how sick in the head men are and how much women have to put up with these days which seems to be what the director said he was trying to portray (although I have my doubts). What I do object to is the pretention that this is some sort of art piece when in done it was really quite a boring film; when you start thinking of fast forwarding then you know it is not going well and it is not often I find myself wanting to do this but it just illustrates how pointless watching any more of this after the initial 20 minutes was.It is sad to see so many reviewers pontificate about this being art when in fact it is just another director trying to use shock value, much like Tracy Emin and her ""spvnk tent"" describing it as art when in done it is just another flim-flam snake oil salesman.Sorry but some of us have a brain and are not hoodwinked into it i'm afraid.If you fancy a raging sore head and possible light induced epileptic fit or enjoy watching paint dry, then by all means watch this trash; just don't say you were not warned!",Irreversible
52,pyrocitor,Trauma and healing,10,4 November 2010,"If there were to be a single film determined as about as far from enjoyable as possible yet also profoundly important viewing, Gaspar Noé's Irreversible would end up a strong contender. Infamous for featuring two of the most harrowing and gruesome rape and murder scenes in cinema history as well as some nauseatingly stylized camera and sound work and a narrative told in reverse order through uncomfortably long takes, it is worth asserting off the bat that Noé's film is simply not one for viewers squeamish in any nature (Newsweek scathed that the film takes ""adolescent pride in its own ugliness""). Conversely, for a film with so much extreme content, none of it is included for any reasons of gratuitous shock value, but rather for the sake of reinforcing its own crucially important themes in an extreme enough fashion as to render them unforgettable and thereby continually resonant, making Irreversible, in spite of its ""ugliness"", one of the most perversely beautiful films in recent history. The key is in the line which both opens and closes the film, ""Time destroys everything"", and the statement's inherent ambiguity. At first, followed by a brutal, unflinchingly graphic murder, a sickeningly swirling camera and a maddening consistent low thrum, the line suggests nihilistic, fatalistic disdain. However, it is in this fashion that Noé's genius in telling his story in reverse order becomes apparent, as, rather than building into a crescendo of abhorrent content, Noé works backwards to make sense of the outcomes of his film through examining what transpired before them. As the film progresses past the infamous rape scene, the stylistics become steadily calmer, the content progressively more palatable, until finally closing on a note of such serene yet bittersweet grace that ""Time destroys everything"" has come to take on an entirely different meaning. Noé utilizes the cinematic form to not only allow the viewer a chance to trace the roots of the tragedy but to effectively ""undo"" the trauma, suggesting a spiritual healing and 'destruction' of the trauma – a bold and masterful approach.Nonetheless, Noé does not utilize such an approach to devalue or dismiss Irreversible's traumatic 'beginning/end' as the film grows steadily less unpleasant, planting pointed reminders throughout to assure that, while suggesting that the results of such atrocities can be overcome, they should never be forgotten or ignored. In particular, the narrative draws emotional blood through a climactic quasi-twist that, in light of the events of before/after, is simultaneously joyful and heartrending. In spite of this, the viewer still leaves the film shaken but ultimately filled with cautious optimism, elation at having 'survived' and a poignant perspective on trauma and linear time – no small feat indeed. Being caught in such a difficult film through extensive, unbroken takes could have felt gimmicky, yet Noé's performers keep the film appropriately claustrophobic without entirely alienating. Vincent Cassel delivers a masterfully manic performance, transitioning from devastation and rage to narcotic-addled insanity to heartwarming humanity without ever losing track of his character, stressing the sympathetic humanity of a questionable man subjected to unbearable circumstances throughout. Monica Belucci demonstrates unbelievable courage as well as crushing credibility through her challenging role, yet crucially also building to warmth and serenity. Finally, Albert Dupontel underplays to perfection as the ambiguous, emotionally stunted friend of the couple who undergoes a profound personal revelation. Seldom do the words 'sickening' and 'beauty' function so suitably in tandem, but Irreversible accomplishes such a fusion – a film that unflinchingly explores the disturbing underbelly of the human condition yet also makes sense of it and suggests the possibility of overcoming it. Beyond a powerful anti-rape film, Noé's work proves challenging and essential viewing for all those capable of stomaching it. -9.5/10",Irreversible
53,Maciste_Brother,Hitler would have loved it!,4,5 May 2007,"Definition of fascism: fascism is an authoritarian political ideology that considers individual and other societal interests inferior to the needs of the state.IRREVERSIBLE is a fascist film because every individual action taken by every main character in this film results in: tragedy, disaster, pure boneheaded actions. Though the director/writer probably would claim that this is just the side effect of the love and passion the main character has for his girlfriend and that he couldn't think things clearly because of the rage that erupted inside of him but the main character is not the only individual who makes these disastrous decisions. The film's message clearly shows, in extremely graphic details (just in case someone missed the point), that actions made by individuals cannot be trusted. Actions as simple as how to cross a street: from sidewalk to sidewalk, or by going through the underpass. This fascistic side of IRREVERSIBLE is undeniable. You cannot overlook it.It's also fascist because practically everything in it is shown to be quasi-evil or corrupt except for the couple, or to be more precise, a pregnant Monica Bellucci. I guess Gaspar Noé is a softy after all. Seriously, had the film NOT included the clichéd plot point of Monica being pregnant, I probably would have been a bit more appreciative of IRREVERSIBLE but because he showcased everything else in such a bad light, including that grimy gay S&M club, where the film starts off, which is basically shown as a horrific dead zone, a place where no life can be conceived (no matter how much they try there), and it ends with a colorful, glorious image of Monica Bellucci, who's lying on beautiful green grass and is surrounded by playing children. In other words, Monica represents life itself. Thematically, I hated almost everything about IRREVERSIBLE. Its ""soul"" is ugly through and through and the director revels in the ugliness of it all, from the first frame to nearly the last frame, only to end up pushing trite conservative idealism in a good light at the very last frame. You mean, we went through all of that pain and ugliness just to end-up with such a sappy image, which would be more suitable for a Pampers commercial?But even with all of these repellent qualities, I still appreciated the first two thirds of the film, mainly for the technical aspects and how it was filmed. IRREVERSIBLE is visually striking. I cannot deny that and it's the reason I rated this 5 stars.

55,stamper,Reversible,8,13 July 2003,"The three or four lines on the backside of the DVD package I brought home last week, were enough to give away the whole story of Irreversible. I read it and afterwards I felt that it was a shame that I knew the whole' story in advance so I advise you not to read anything containing the plot of this film. Why? Because I think it will be even better if you don't know anything about the story. I knew almost everything and I still thought this movie was good and I can only imagine what it would be like if I hadn't already known everything. I will not give away the contents of the film here, but I will point out some things for you. The first one is, that this film is very disturbing and certainly not for the faint of heart. I know that's what people say about many films, but those are usually horror or splatter films like The Evil Dead or Braindead. There are no flying limbs here, but there are some scenes of realistic and disturbing psychological and bodily damage that will certainly shock everyone (some of which might not be able to endure it). I therefore recommend everyone, who has a faint heart and is shocked or disturbed a great deal by realistically filmed trauma, to inform about the contents of this film.
The second (and last) thing I want to point out is something people who have watched the film might better understand than those who haven't (POSSIBLE SPOILERS). Contrary to the title of the film, I felt that the events was very reversible. I mean think about it. In most cases you leave the film feeling the way the main characters are feeling at that time. Was this not a feeling of happiness in this case? And was this feeling not contrary to the one you had in the beginning?  And wasn't it so that the film was portraying the events in reversed order? It was! Then in reversing the irreversible events, the director actually managed to reverse your feelings. Had the film been chronological, would you not have left it disturbed and frightened? But IN FACT, did you not leave it with a warm feeling inside, resembling one of happiness? (SPOILERS END) I know I did. Many of the disturbing events I had seen in the beginning of this film, had already faded away a bit in my mind by the time the film ended. That is what made this film so special to me. It was very disturbing and very real, but when the film ended it was almost as if I'd seen a heart-warming film. A very nice trick achieved by the director and very original. It kept the film in my mind for quite some time after it ended.

An Argentine-French director who to date has shot five controversial films.In this film, a novel idea is introduced. It is shot in reverse chronological order. The end credits at the beginning of the picture etc.
The camerawork at the beginning of the film made me slightly nauseous. It swirls around.
However I noticed this reduces as the film progresses. A ploy?
Another disgruntlement about the photography was a 30 second or so scene of flashing white light? I had to turn away being epileptic.
The soundtrack features a scene of classical music from Beethoven near the end in a nod to Stanley Kubrick perhaps especially as the picture pans onto a film poster for 2001: A Space Odyssey?It features some shocking scenes of violence including a near ten minute rape scene and a pimp/rapist suspect having his skull literally smashed in by a fire extinguisher about 20 times.The film is set in Paris. Hence the French language with subtitles.
The main 'event' of the film is the brutal rape scene in an underpass. Perhaps that is the wrong word.Three middle class Parisians make their way to a sort of house party. A couple Alex (Monica Belucci) and Marcus (Vincent Cassel) along with Alex's ex and Marcus friend Pierre (Albert Dupontel)?At the party Marcus gets high on cocaine and Alex leaves in a bit of a huff. Hence her being in the underpass alone and being raped by a pimp called Le Tenia which means Tapeworm apparently.The rest of the film concerns Marcus and Pierre in a macho pursuit of Le Tenia for revenge which culminates in a seedy gay glub called The Rectum.At The Rectum the pair hunt for Le Tenia not knowing his identity. They eventually find him standing with another man who they think is him. Physical violence ensues followed by Pierre defending Marcus who is about to be raped himself by crushing the man's skull with a fire extinguisher.Pierre is then seen in the next act to be arrested by police where it is revealed he killed the wrong man, not Le Tenia.
Straight away these scenes alone would normally endear the film to a one or two star rating. It is only the reverse chronology theme and the use of camerawork to show the transition from disorderly to serene that I have reluctantly awarded four stars.",Irreversible
58,Superunknovvn,Hits you in the guts,7,27 January 2009,"It's hard for me to put my feelings about ""Irréversible"" into words. Let's start off with the easy part: Director Gaspar Noé manages to combine three highly experimental elements in his movie without distracting from the story. ""Irréversible"" has dizzying cinematography (the camera is virtually spinning around in some parts, symbolizing the way the characters' world is spinning out of control), reverse storytelling, and long tracking shots in each of the ten sequences. All of that is executed perfectly, but what's even more admirable is the fact that none of the stylistic magic tricks is taking away from the story itself. Of course, the performances by the brave cast help, too.Now for the subject matter: This movie is about three lives changing drastically within one day because of a brutal rape. There's an excessive amount of violence, including, of course, the infamous explicit rape scene. The question is: Is it necessary, is it even allowed to show rape in such detail? I say yes. At no point is Noé presenting rape as something erotic. That scene isn't just put into the movie for shock value, either. In fact, I think the most effective way to show the horrors of rape is to shove it down people's throats the way the director does here. In real life the situation doesn't end with a discreet cut to the victim in a hospital bed, either. So why not put the crime into focus with all its ugly details for a change? This is art, after all, and art must also be allowed to show the sick sides of life.The weird thing, however, is, that I don't think the scene would work as well if Noé wouldn't use reverse storytelling. By making the rest of the movie ""conventional"", the rape scene would stand out much more, and then it would probably feel like a gimmick to attract an audience by adding shock value. Why? Because Noé's movie doesn't really have a whole lot to tell. There's no deeper meaning to the story of a girl getting raped and her boyfriend seeking revenge. Noé tries to add something by incorporating the line ""Time ruins everything"", but that really doesn't have much to do with what we're seeing.In the end, I'm undecided. I was intrigued by the movie. As I've said, technically it's perfect and its bold approach, to go into detail where no other movie would, is boundary pushing. Still, there is this weird sensation, that the movie is devoid of any message. I guess in the end ""Irréversible"" is supposed to get to your guts rather than make you think. The message is that you should be disgusted, and that the movie achieves. At the very least this is cinema as you don't see it everyday. And how many movies can that be said about anymore?",Irreversible
59,vostf,Irréversible deserves a lot more than censorship barkings,9,29 May 2002,"But it does not deserve all the media-fuss about a scandal. Perhaps marketing troops thought it would be better for publicity. Personally I think not. There's much more in Irréversible than just in-your-face violence.From Chaos backwards to dream lifeGaspar Noé wanted to use the same narrative structure as Memento for he thought it gives a very deep insight on some psychological disorder. So Irréversible starts with the darkest and you got to know it before because it is not like The little house on the prairie opening credits and therefore you know it will not end up with a nice Walt Disney sunset hand-in-hand walk of some 90 minute industry-packed entertainment. Memento, I found it was a mere pain in the head (only the idea of global backwards montage lives up to it) but in Irréversible the result is much more natural: from violence back to innocence. All the lines in the script makes the storytelling more traditionally linear: you increasingly get in the movie as the lines spoken while you go back in time get increasing depth with the benefit of hindsight. Memento failed to do so, just clever for the sake of being a clever torture.Weirdly enough I think of Irréversible as complementary with Amélie and it's revealing that in France the very same critics who reluctantly accepted Amélie's happiness (too cheap happiness for those guys) lambasted Irréversible with cruel words. I wonder what they might like between beautiful dreamlike tales and pertinent movies deep rooted in the ""humble reality"".Cassel Bellucci and Dupontel are simply fantastic and Noé makes you feel so close to them (long sequence shots) that it's not possible to behave as a stubborn narrow-minded censor not acclaiming these outstanding performances.Bottom line: Gaspar Noé succeeds here where Mathieu Kassovitz failed with Assassin(s): deal with screen violence on a larger perspective, leaving more room for audiences to make up their minds about what they've seen, about their lives... I think it's the main achievement: bring us near nausea then give us fresh air on condition that we bear all this in mind.",Irreversible
60,RJBurke1942,"Where you'll never look at cinema violence again, in the same way.",6,21 January 2011,"Here's the story: two men search Paris for a man who cruelly beats and rapes a woman, the girl friend of one of the searchers. They find the man and kill him, or so they think. That's it, in two sentences; how the story is told is what makes it almost unique.Technically, this film is well done: innovative cinematography, truly imaginative use of high and low, angular shots, editing the like of which I've never seen before, incredibly discordant sound, and lighting that makes the whole experience surreal. In fact, viewers with epileptic disorders are advised not to see this film. In the Extras section of the DVD I watched, I discovered that the whole film was shot using a mix of 16mm and 35mm – and then digitized, thus allowing for infinite manipulation of the imagery, sound and so on.So, it's a stunning experience in the art and craft of film-making, as much as it is one of the most repulsive – indeed disgusting – stories I've yet seen. Only Salo (1975) exceeds the excesses of human misery displayed in Irreversible. However, I'm glad I've seen it; yet, I'd not bother to see it again.In the tradition of films like Memento (2000), the story begins at the end, and works backwards in time. That also adds to the experimental nature of this production. So, again, it's interesting to watch to see how the director keeps the story in sync by telling it backwards. Interesting, yes; but not a technique for mainstream viewers, generally.So, why do it? Well, when starting at the horrific end, and then moving backwards in narrative flow, we know what's been; hence, we have a heightened sense of dread for the main characters, particularly the young woman who is brutally and viciously raped in an extended scene that must rank as the most gut-wrenching, horrific and voyeuristic piece of filming yet done. Violence is not just for bad guys, though. For example, Marcus (Cassel) as the hero searching for the rapist is seen beating up on various women to elicit information needed to find the rapist: hence, the rapist and Marcus are separated by degree only.The actors are without equal in this film; one wonders how they could have even performed so well – the violence looks and sounds so real, you want to close your eyes, but can't.Which brings out the even more horrific thought: maybe the director wants each viewer to find out just what sort of a person s/he is, by either turning off or turning on? You decide, if you want to see it.So, give it five for technical excellence, acting, and innovative narrative structure; give it a half for a run-of-the-mill-story; and another half for having the chutzpah to make it.Overall, I recommend this film only for students and professionals of film art and craft. It's not entertainment; and I don't think it was meant to be. But, of course, you can prove me wrong by seeing it.",Irreversible
61,skepticskeptical,Simulacrum of a Snuff Film,1,17 April 2020,"The cinematography of the first portion of this thing could be mimicked by strapping an iphone to a toddler´s back and letting him loose in an underground (and very violent and depraved) gay men´s club. Lots of spinning around, no picture quality, complete randomness. Artistic genius is not the first expression that comes to mind.Granted, I just finished a Michelangelo Antonioni bender and so am keenly sensitive to the aesthetic potential of film. Unfortunately, Irréversible is nothing but nonsense being fobbed off as avant-garde film-making. I feel sorry for the poor souls who were fooled and conferred a rating of (gasp) 10 upon this bunch of bunk.After thirty minutes, I realized that there was no hope for artistic merit, whether in form or content, so I decided just to turn it off. That´s because I believe the Aristotelian principle of moral psychology: You are what you eat. I do not want to become a person who has been through the experience of watching this piece of junk.As for the message? About as trite as they come (and announced in the opening minutes): ¨Truth ruins everything.¨ ¨There are no bad deeds, only deeds.¨ Ha, ha: very profound coming from the mouths of two ALREADY corrupt characters.In conclusion, I won´t be pursuing this director any further. What a joke.",Irreversible

63,Imdbidia,"Not easy to watch, but a good reflection on violence",8,8 February 2011,"Irreversible is a very confronting raw and violent French movie that tells the story, in reverse order, of a serious of violent events related to the rape of a woman when going back home from a party, and what his boyfriend and best friend do afterwards.Telling the story backwards makes the story not only more interesting and mentally engaging, but also the best way to explore the themes presented in the same. The viewer feels immediately repulsed by the behavior and actions of the two characters, firstly because we don't know anything about those people and they look mad, and secondly because their actions are repulsive. However, when the viewer sees the horrific and violent 9-minute rape scene, and compares it to those initial actions (which are at the end of the story), the viewer feels that the level of violence and brutality is similar, even though the events related to the initial scenes could be morally justified. The question posed is, does a moral back-up justifies any violence? The answer is no. And the reverse order of the scenes just makes that clearer to the viewer, who rejects that violence immediately, from an emotional point of view, from his/her guts, judging the acts for what they are, not for what motivated them. Violence is always repulsive no matter the reasons (or lack of them) behind.At another level, the movie is an exploration of Sexuality - Sex as mean of human communication and love, versus love as a mean of hatred and subjugation. Sex as pleasure versus sex as damage. The intimate scenes of Alex and Marcus are all sensuality, playfulness, joy and love. The conversations about sex between Alex, Marcus and Pierre explore the matter of pleasure and human connection, of what makes humans click in sex. The rape scene is an antithesis to all of that.Did the rape scene need to be so long and so brutal? Despite how hard was watching it, I think the answer is yes. Because many people out there consider rape a second-rate crime and somewhat blames the victim or excuses the perpetrator. There are judges around the world saying that the victim somewhat provoked the rapist with her sexy clothing or just for being sexy. There are brutal men raping women for more than 9 minutes. Because the effects of rape are very damaging, emotionally and mentally, not only physically. Because the porn and erotic industry somewhat glamorizes women being raped. Rape is always a brutal act, even if the rapist does not beat you, but there are rapists doing nasty things to women, degrading women in any possible way. If you think about it, the rape scene, despite how hard it is, is nothing compared to what happens every minute in any of our cities - every day.The messages embedded in the story are important and offer a glimpse of what is living a normal life full of hopes and joy, to found it completely ruined by violence in a matter of hours . It also shows how normal people can be as violent as violent people are in certain circumstances, and how violence is never justified. Most importantly, the movie reminds the viewer that there is nothing to forget or forgive about rape.The atmosphere of the movie is excellent, as well as the hues and music. The use of strobist images is sickening, but it helps to unsettle the viewer since the beginning. However, there wasn't any need to use so many strobist images and for so long as, by doing so, the movie becomes a little bit hallucinogen and the viewer loses focus; to be honest, I would used strobist images quite differently and with a different timing.I found Monica Belluci great as Alex both in the sweet and playful scenes, and it the harsh ones; she demonstrates here that she's not just a pretty face. Jo Prestia is superb as the disturbing disgusting rapist Le Tenia. Vincent Cassel is just OK as Alex's boyfriend Marcus, while Albert Dupontel is good as Alex's best friend Pierre.Among the downs of the movie, beyond the overuse of strobist effects, I'd mention the opening scene, which is irrelevant and doesn't add anything to the story. Moreover, the title of the gay pub is gross and also the depiction of gays as depraved perverted human beings. I mean, there are heterosexuals who would have similar sort of pubs. Certainly, there are gays who are like that and go to places like that, but there are too many stereotypes about them in the movie, especially because the story of the movie has nothing to do with gays. All the gay thing was really unnecessary as does not add anything to the story and is very negative.This is not an easy film to watch, and it really gets you upset. In that regard, it achieves what aimed, as it makes you think and react to violence through violence... if you can stand the whole ordeal and reach the last minutes of the movie when a relaxing bright day was full of promises.",Irreversible
64,PeterMitchell-506-564364,Irreversibly brilliant,9,15 November 2012,"Irreversible is a lot to take. A disturbing confronting movie with some hard to stomach scenes. It's more disturbing than Salo. What we have here is real life. Rape happens. And what happens to this woman in this movie is probably exaggerated in it's violence, but this s**t does happen. It could happen anywhere, some guys go out with their girls, whatever. The girls are left alone for only a minute, then some jealous guys go nuts, cause they just can't have her. Anyone who bashes a woman almost beyond recognition, like in this movie shown through a nine minute rape scene, that even for me, took it's toll, should be castrated in the slowest and cruelest manner possible. The hot looking french chick in this is a woman who just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, in this case, the place is an underpass, and alone, hot spunk that as she is, shouldn't of used in the first place. But Belluci, cheesed off with her partner, has left this party, a semi orgy, you could say, so she's not thinking rationally. This brutal pimp is knocking one of her girls around. Belluci, a witness, hesitant to make an escape, does, but in seconds, is ultimately tackled to the cement and is now in the clutches of this monster, who in this movie they never catch. Refer Deathwish. What this movie does, in it's storytelling, is sort of something Tarantino would do. The first scene leaves us quizzical. These two naked guys, middle aged, are having a bit of a crude discussion. Outside, there are a lot of sounds, noises, ambulances. They're coming from their neighboring nightclub. The boyfriend of the victim (Cassell) whose arm has just been broken, is being lifted into an ambulance while Belluci's older ex, has just been arrested for killing a guy in one of the most graphic scenes shot on film. The cops showing him great pathos here, it kind of got me angry. We go back in story. As the movie furthers on, we reach the part where we're in the wake of the girlfriends's attack, the two men, left to track this sonofabitch down in a sea of weirdos, transvestites, perverts, whatever, and will pay for info. The current lover, Cassell is fantastic in the way he demonstrates heartbreak, guilt, desperation, and especially RAGE! I've never seen an such emotion, so brilliantly displayed. Truly believable acting. Belluci doesn't have much to work with, concerning her business here, and the ex downplays it. The way the two male leads play off each other is interesting, especially in the wake of the rape, where the ex is trying to him talk out him of his unconstrained rage, you almost want to punch him, or tell him to shut the hell up. The first twenty minutes of Irreversible is in dizzying, circling shots, it almost passes itself of as garbage to the point of asking, ""Where the hell is the movie going?"", but you have to hang in there, as you the viewer, will be rewarded, like I knew would be. The story is told as if you started watching the last fifteen minutes of a video, you've just slipped into the VCR, then you rewind it, fifteen, twenty minutes before that, and watched that section, up to the point you first put the video in, and so forth, until you eventually wind up at the start and watch the first fifteen minutes. This works dynamically. So near the movie's closing, beautiful Belluci has just discovered she's pregnant, after taking a test, and this movie shows what can be lost in a heartbeat, from Cassell making just one stupid mistake, and the consequences of that mistake. Note: That graphic scene earlier mentioned, is the notorious one, a unforgettably disturbing scene of sickening violence, involving the ex, splitting half a guy's head open with a fire extinguisher. This shows the inner violence, us humans are capable of, when pushed. If anything, this scene could encourage a replica act of violence to those unsound minds. The last overhead, swirling shot of Belluci, stretched out across the grass, basking in the sun, looking beautiful, is somewhat haunting, as in the fact of the violent events that proceed. Footnote: An almost blinding, one minute of camera strobing follows. Weirdorama. Mystifying hey. Personally, I loooooved it, among a lot of other things this great drama offers. Ex-cellent.",Irreversible
65,asda-man,Hits you like a ton of fire extinguishers!,10,3 March 2014,"This isn't my first taste of Gaspar Noe as I have seen I Stand Alone, which I liked a lot. The directing was incredibly stylish and the violence brutally shocking, however I felt like it lacked potential. I thought it could've been something really great if it had a stronger plot, as it was basically a depraved butcher walking around and giving vile monologues on how much he hates life. I still liked it though, and I especially saw the potential in Gaspar Noe as a film maker. It's Irreversible where Noe shines beautifully.The film instantly grabbed me with its seriously unusual opening. The credits roll back up and sort of spin around to show the title card, ""Irreversible"" with some unsettling music playing in the background. The camera then spins in an incredibly disorientating manner to show a creepy shot of the butcher from I Stand Alone. The actors' names then all flash up on the screen in a super stylish manner which utterly gripped me. It's one of the best title sequences I've seen, but enough about titles. There's much more to Irreversible than that.Irreversible begins in the depths of hell and ends in some sort of stroboscopic utopia. It's a startling contrast and a brilliant one. The opening is incredibly intense as Marcus and Pierre enter a frightening gay club called, ""The Rectum"". Marcus is full of rage and we have no idea why. He marches through the club asking anyone and everyone where ""The Tape Worm"" is. The directing here is nothing short of masterful. The camera-work is like Darren Aronofsky on acid and his very own slimming pills. It's all done in one shot, making it incredibly intense as the camera hypnotically floats around in a chaotic and disorientating close-up. Not only that but there's a startling siren soundtrack which only serves to heighten the intense atmosphere.I was shocked to see that the much talked about fire extinguisher scene was in this early on. It very much feels like the climax of the film as it's full of such anger, rage and raw intensity. It's easy to see why the extinguisher scene is so talked about as it's unflinchingly graphic and extraordinarily brutal, however to say it's gratuitous is ridiculous as it doesn't feel like glamorised movie violence at all. It feels frighteningly real and is extremely relevant to the film's characters and themes.Just like Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, Memento the film is told in reverse. At first I wasn't sure if it worked entirely as all the horror and the madness was placed near the beginning which means the film becomes more and more soft, however then I realised that it was the perfect way to tell the story. Not only does it show that violent actions cannot be reversed, but it also allows us to feel sympathy for the characters and forces us to place ourselves in their shoes as we play detective.Now, you can't talk about Irreversible without talking about the infamous rape scene which occurs half-way through the film and is the most important scene in the film. It feels far too real as the camera shakily follows Alex down the underground tunnel and encounters a deranged sadist who brutally rapes her. This scene feels all the more harrowing as up until now the camera has been insanely mobile and hypnotically dreamlike. Here Noe keeps the camera deathly still like Haneke, as we're forced to endure Alex's ordeal. It almost feels like the audience is being raped too. It's shocking and shockingly realistic. The only time the camera moves during the 10 minutes is when the stranger picks up Alex's head and slams it on the floor. The camera moves in order for the audience to witness this brutality in unflinching detail.Some have called this scene gratuitous and even accused it of titillating the audience which I find ridiculous. Rape is something that happens all the time, yet most films are too scared to tackle it. Noe tackles the issue head on and shows us all what rape is really like. It isn't pretty and it isn't supposed to be either. Only a sadist would find the scene a turn on.The rest of the film is mainly concerned with showing us the relationship between Alex and Marcus. It's all the more tragic to watch as we know how the night is going to turn out, whilst the characters are utterly oblivious. The directing is still absolutely stunning. I loved the party sequence which follows Marcus, Alex and Pierre around all in one shot with deafening music. It feels like you're actually there! We're also treated to some detailed conversations about sex on a subway and a heart-breaking romantic scene between Alex and Marcus. These scenes have a layered and tragic quality about them as we know exactly what is going to happen next.The acting is extraordinary. Vincent Cassel is the best I've ever seen him be and the relationship between the characters is utterly believable. Although it does help that Vincent and Monica were actually in a relationship during the time of filming. Monica is also sensational, especially during the gruelling rape scene where I could've almost cried out for her. The end scene is unlike anything I've ever seen and will stay with me for a long time.Irreversible is a harrowing masterpiece. The scenes of violence and sexual violence are amongst the most shocking I've ever seen. It's a film which wants to show you the dark side of life. Time destroys everything as we do not know what the future has in store for us. It's a tragic and powerful piece of filmmaking with extraordinary directing and acting. Small-minded critics may mistake the film as a gratuitous piece of work, but it really isn't. Irreversible feels real and is an intense and powerful experience which I'd recommend with caution.",Irreversible
66,garethcrook,Devastating.,9,13 May 2021,"A film entirely in reverse. Starting with end credits with all the letters back to front, slowly twisting the perspective. This is exactly the sort of film school schtick that got me excited about cinema. It's more than clever execution of a simple device though. It takes art and wraps it in a mysterious dramatic nightmare. Unnerving from the start, with the camera restlessly shifting. Not so much hand held as just hung on a wire and left to swing around in a tornado. Marcus (Vincent Cassel) is lead away on a stretcher from a gay S&M club as Pierre (Albert Dupontel) is cuffed by the cops. There's no Tenet shenanigans thankfully, but what we witness is the conclusion to an event that we're waiting to happen. ""Time destroys all things"" a naked man says. You certainly have to be careful how you play with it in cinema. Too self indulgent and you'll lose the audience, but director Gaspar Noé keeps this together wonderfully. Marcus is out for revenge, chaotically looking for Le Tenia (Jo Prestia) in a red lit spawling sex dungeon. It's the first in a sequence of violent vignettes that lead us back in time to the brutal origins of this horrendous tale. As we pick up little details along the way, the bigger picture unfurls. It's dark, visceral nightmare fuel with Alex (Monica Belluci) in a catalytic rape scene that's probably one of the hardest things I've ever watched on screen. The frenetic camera work that signifies the chaos to come, now painfully locked static on the horror. It's the devastating first half (that's really the second) that makes the more conventional end (that's really the start) carry so much weight and pack such a punch.

From the ambulance ride and on, we learn, in reverse, the tale of Marcus and Vincent's quest for vengeance, which stemmed from a brutal and vicious act against Marcus's girlfriend (and Pierre's ex-girlfriend), Alex (the beautiful Monica Bellucci, of Passion of the Christ and Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions fame).Irréversible is the type of modern-day film that fans of the classic shock cinema and rape-revenge stories can enjoy. But, instead of playing out like a regular I Spit on Your Grave-esquire story, we're delivered a more original take on the classic tale. Sure the 'reverse story' idea isn't 100% new, and it's most commonly associated with the fantastic Memento, but that doesn't mean another film can't work wonders with the same tricks. The story here is great. It's a well known one, but it throws in a few curveballs to spice things up (like (for lack of a less-reportable term) all-men's S&M clubs). Watching the film, you'll see a fresh style from Noé and, while I dig the experimental cinematography of Noé and Debie, some of the camera-work got a little dizzying and distracting at times, especially at the beginning. Throbbing music, grinding beats, flashing lights, and spinning cameras can sometimes aid in intensifying any headache or nausea. But, when it comes down to it, these 'tricks' definitely helped spice up the brutality. Speaking of brutality, there isn't a whole lot, to be honest. . . but when you see it, boy does it hurt. It's a rare time when I'm actually holding my head in sympathy for a fictional character, but in here. . . I certainly was. By the end, Irréversible reveals itself as more than the typical revenge tale, and helps face, head on, a truly heartbreaking story of pain and desperation.Final verdict: 7/10.

70,Ali_John_Catterall,Off to The Rectum!,7,19 November 2009,"Irrevérsible concerns a brutal act of retribution: an innocent man has his skull repeatedly and graphically stoved in with a fire extinguisher as misapplied revenge for a nine-minute rape in real time - perversely, the most static segment of a nausea-inducing maelstrom of hand-held bravura and cacophonous aural affront.And yet for all the hysterical headlines and reports of mass walk-outs at Cannes, it's important to remember Gaspar Noé's film was passed entirely uncut by the BBFC. ""Censor's betrayal as he passes 'sick' rape movie"", as the good old 'Daily Mail' put it.It also distracts attention away from what this picture actually is: a thoughtful and audacious ensemble piece, which suggests our destinies are predetermined, or as JW Dunne (whose highly influential 1927 essay 'An Experiment With Time' is featured in the film) suggests, that past, present and future exist simultaneously.

72,Flagrant-Baronessa,An excellent harrowing portrayal of a bruised woman: engrossing to watch and impossible to forget,8,19 August 2006,"Irréversible is a frantic, dizzying and harrowing portrayal of something that never ceases being disturbing: a rape. I have it firmly stapled at the bottom of my top 20 films list for it is excellent, but it is nothing I'd like to sit through and watch again...The story centres only on this rape but is presented to us in reverse chronological order, just like Memento (2000). Confusing but effective, because then the film need not rely on foreshadowing and build-ups to a culmination (rape), but it starts with its climax and offers a safe, but bruised remaining hour. The rape scene breaks our hearts because it is so unforgettable and the rest of the film tries to amend it, but in vain, because the life of this woman is already ruined...in the beginning.Irréversible bluntly begins with a frenzied man racing through a gay sex club, madly searching for someone known only as Le Tenia. Only as the story develops - as we are taken ever further back in time - do we begin to understand what is going on: this young man, Marcus (Vincent Cassel), is seeking vengeance on the rapist who has brutally assaulted his pregnant girlfriend. As Marcus gets his revenge, it is a scene so violent and disturbing that its only rival is the actual rape scene.The latter comes right after the opening and is much eerily calmer than Marcus' maniacal state of epileptic confusion and spinning camera-work; it is a patient 10-minute long stead-camera take of Alex (Monica Bellucci) being raped in an underground alleyway. We do not know her now so it is not riveting, but as the story progresses (or, regresses) it becomes more heart-breaking. The rape part is of course relegated to a hype status, but in truth, I've seen worse in films. It is not unwatchable, people - but it is unforgettable.Gaspar Noé's Irréversible (2002) offers an ideal role for Monica Bellucci; she is a poor actress but brings a fresh charisma to her roles and Irréversible never sees her in emotional breakouts having to deal with the effects of the rape. It sees her before it, as an ordinary but high-spirited woman. Her beauty is, of course, greatly emphasized in love scenes. Cassel is more talented, capturing the emotional frenzy of his character well, because he DOES have to deal with the rape effect.8/10",Irreversible
73,Bogey Man,"Today I'm dirty, tomorrow just dirt - Time, deeds, man",10,28 June 2003,"Argentinian born French film maker Gaspar Noé is already one of the most important and powerful film makers of all time. His 1998 debut feature film Seul Contre Tous is an unforgettably merciless but also so uniquely rewarding depiction of rotten society with even more rotten human beings that inhabit it with their selfishness and potential to violence and revenge - those things that everyone feels sometimes, more or less often, and things that only create more of them when not kept inactive and off. The last 15 minutes of Seul Contre Tous include some of the most unimaginably brilliant editing and camerawork (including a body-mounted camera and clever communication/estranging with the unsuspecting audience) not to speak of the soundtrack, which force us to see the truth about ourselves and things around us. Those mentioned elements are also the same that stamp the work of Japanese film maker Shinya Tsukamoto (Tetsuo in 1988, Gemini in 1999) who is also a friend of Noé. These two directors do most of the important parts of their film making themselves (camera operating, editing, directing, writing..) and both have the talent to smash the viewer straight to the face and force him and her to think and even change towards something better. Now Noé has even surpassed his power and moment of total breathlessness of Seul Contre Tous with his 2002 film Irréversible, a masterpiece that has the same ability to change people's lives and attitudes towards a better world, but with the kind of power of imagery and soundtrack that only few, unfortunately, as films like these deserved more attention and respect, are willing to accept and understand.Alex (Monica Bellucci), Marcus (Vincent Cassel) and Pierre (Albert Dupontel) are three French friends who live peacefully and also in love, as Alex and Marcus are together and love each other genuinely. Alex has also been with Pierre but their thing didn't work and now they are only friends and all three get along more than well. Comes a weekend night and time to go to have some fun with more friends. Then, as some alcohol and drugs are involved, comes some arguing with the lovers and Alex decides to go home to sleep and leave her drunken boyfriend to dance alone. Unfortunately for all (but fortunately for the real ill world and audience for whom this film with its message is made for) she meets the most evil thing ever possible to live inside the flesh and bones of human being and a terrible rape takes place. How does man with his instincts react when he learns something terrible and violent has happened to his loved one and there's also a possibility to get to know who did it? Revenge is a human need has the mighty director said and the man's potential for mindless violence, lack of moral and willing to take revenge are the main themes of this important film and it all is told with so much genius and unique elements the film already belongs to the list of the unmatched and the films that managed to make and achieve something for the first time in the history.The film is told backwards so that we'd see even clearlier what results from what and then we are forced to ask ourselves why, which requires to look inside our own heads and souls and look into the mirror. The film begins with the most infernal 20 minutes of the whole movie history and culminates to the most graphically violent and mentally and physically shocking sequence ever created that leaves no questions for what is the real nature of violence, and thus revenge, like. The incredible colors, lights and darkness of the beginning are already something very powerful and unique, but are accompanied even further by truly incredible usage and movements of camera as it twists and shakes in agony of forthcoming and present terror for the whole beginning of the film. The film has only 19 or so parts/scenes as it's told without single edits inside the parts. The form is very convincing and unconventional and naturally makes it even more realistic and easy to connect to our own world. Those who blame the disturbingly strobing, pounding and restless (sonic) imagery of the beginning don't know how much camera is in cinema and how a talented maker can use it, depict and show with it. It is Hell we're witnessing at the beginning of Irréversible so why would've Noé made it look peaceful, calm and harmless as it's all really bad and wicked even and especially for those who support it as we soon learn at the Rectum finale. It is Hell that can be found anywhere where humans live, be and do deeds together and to one another.Noé's camerawork is definitely something very difficult to imagine to be created and the director has said in interviews that there were indeed some segments (mostly the party sequence) when he thought he'd become crazy as it all was so difficult to do and keep in control. The camera is not so wild and restless after the beginning as there isn't even a reason for that, again an example of what does camera mean in cinema and how it must be used without being gratuitous or meaningless. The crane shots of the beginning of the story but the ending of the film are also breathtaking and hypnotic and also show for one last time what is another key element of (the) film alongside the imagery: the soundtrack and music, sounds and voices of the film. The soundtrack consists of menacing, pounding and with one word infernal sounds and also electric music, but those waves are the ones that are not likely to be found from any other film. The sounds make the happenings of the screen look like how they are inside the film and how they would be if and when something like that happened in real life. Never have I experienced and heard the soundtrack strengtening the images as it does in Irréversible. I had one of the year 2002's greatest and unforgettable moments when I saw the film on big screen, which it demands, and I will never forget the feelings I had during the opening of the film, and after I had read about the elements and creating of the soundtrack, I understood even more about the uneasiness of myself and the audience as well as the genius of its creator. If one decides not to agree with Noé about the anti-violent message of the film, he will be smashed numb in front of the images and sounds whether he wanted it or not.The point of the unspeakable violence of the film is to make it look and feel as bad and irreversible as in real world too. When the revenge takes place and we experience something extremely ugly and both physically and mentally painful Noé forces us to see the things that the avenging minds don't see, at least in time, how violence always requires more of it as human beings are pretty much the same animal and we all share these instincts and potential which still could and can be fought against. The revenge and its destroying face comes clear when we ask ourselves who did, what did, to whom did and finally why did, and when the viewer admits those things and accepts the answers the message Noé meant has been delivered. In films violence can be harrowingly brutal, shocking and graphic without being gratuitous and just cheap exploitation shock, and that is the case with Noé's work as in any other important film that builds and gives, and never takes/exploits anything by raping the tool of cinema. After the Rectum finale, only a stupid and a weak mind can think that any wise decisions were made, after the fateful rape, by the characters, humans.
Also the infamous crime scene that started it all is so easy to be judged as ""unacceptable"" and, even more laughably, ""pornographic"", as now it is nothing less than effective and useful for its purpose, useful to show the nature of sexual violence and how it really is, ugly, nauseating, sadistic and without respect for human life. If someone asks why such a long scene of rape must be filmed as those kind of things happen in real world all the time, the answer is a new question: since those things happen around us all the time and other tools have not been able to stop them or other violence in our world, why couldn't an artist try his own extremely powerful tool (cinema, image and sound) to change and affect things and people? Can there be enough weapons to stop those things happening around us and why the attempts of cinema and a film maker so often are overlooked and not given the acceptance and importance they deserved? Perhaps because they show too much about our very selves and to admit it, that everyone of us is just a human, is too difficult for many.Another important theme of the film is that of its title, how things and deeds are and remain how they once get done, and the more serious and critical the deed is, the more we look and think about it afterwards, still never being able to change it once it's been done as time is so merciless. Beautiful, sunny and sweet things full of life can turn into destruction, darkness, agony, death and eternal loss especially if wrong and fast decisions are made and too much power for the animal instincts are given. Noé's phrase ""time destructs everything"" is more than true, but also, to some extent, possible to be affected by us who live this world and life so that no more destruction than there already is would take place. Too often precious things get killed because we didn't understand and see early enough, and that's why films like this are universal and eternally fresh in their themes. The film is not thoroughly pessimistic and hopeless due to certain images of beauty and possibility; the images of the beginning were destructed by a happening not possible to be prevented but the total death and Hell could have been prevented, and that's why we, the audience see it first.The actors all do incredible job as there wasn't a script for the film, only a few written pages about the main happenings and parts of the story so all the dialogue was improvised by Noé's instructions and the three do it very naturally and it is not possible to guess there wasn't a screenplay for them without knowing it. In any possible aspect this film is unique and like no other: it was made like no other, it includes images and sounds like no other, and it has a theme and message so strong like no other film (some getting close) in the whole history of movie making. Great art doesn't need to be conventional and like the other works of its kind, and possibly the greatest thing an artist can achieve is a new, powerful, view and way to present it. That Noé achieved and delivered. He did a masterpiece in 1998 and he did another, even more powerful masterpiece in 2002. Both films are perfect in my values and thus among the most important works ever made. Noé did these two and he's still young and full of ideas about themes and elements which he will use in his forthcoming projects. He must not be left outside the canon of the most important masters and philosophers of cinema like some other have, and the world doesn't even know how much it gets if the financers of his films would understand this too. It is like I and the other audience didn't know what was to come when the hypnotic credits of Irréversible started to roll on the silent screen. 10/10",Irreversible
74,rooee,"A conventional movie, masked by blood",5,24 May 2010,"So we begin with the end; with a climactic scene in which Marcus (Vincent Cassell) strides through a gay S&M club looking for the guy who raped his girlfriend. We know that's who he's looking for because Irreversible is now irreversibly associated with the sexual assault endured by Monica Bellucci's Alex. These represent the film's two scenes of almost unimaginable cruelty. And it really is unflinching. Literally – Noe's camera, otherwise caterwauling, settles to an eerie stillness as the violence erupts before our eyes. The film's reverse structure puts our assumptions through the mangler, whilst removing the potential for the build-'em-up, knock-'em-down schadenfreude of the Saw sequels. We're denied the hope of a happy ending. Instead, we get a phony ending: some giggling, softcore flirtation and a revelation designed to finish off our turning stomachs. Gaspar Noe's film is essentially a dozen single, long takes. This works occasionally. For instance, the rape scene is brutally relentless; fear and fearsomeness played with fearlessness for a full ten minutes. But the nightclub revenge sequence, in which Marcus descends the Circles of Hell, through increasingly exaggerated excesses of depravity, drags the film into near-farcical territory. It's like an Hieronymous Bosch exhibit with a Daft Punk soundtrack. So Irreversible is manipulative, nasty and contrived. It batters the senses, but doesn't run any deeper than that. With its dashing, spinning camera, we're a bewildered bystander. We see terrible things being inflicted on people, without ever stopping to see through their eyes. Elem Klimov's Come and See – a superior piece of manipulative celluloid mind-battering – achieved this very simply: by focusing the camera square on the victim's face. Klimov made us afraid of Man. Noe makes us afraid of what men might do, like an ill-tempered Daily Mail editor. Crucially, and cripplingly, it doesn't dare examine rape from a female perspective. (There's even a slightly dubious moment on a subway train when Alex seems to suggest that the key to her sexual pleasure is in the knowledge that the man feels pleasure – a tasteless piece of narrative irony.) This is a film about male rage. And there are truck-loads of such films around – so for all its boundary-breaking, Irreversible is deeply conventional, and not very deep.",Irreversible
75,room102,Shocking,7,13 December 2002,"I wasn't sure what to think of it, but a movie that makes me think about it so long after seeing it, usually holds something special.This French movie, which was written, directed, edited and co-photographed by Gaspar Noe, obviously tries to be shocking, daring and provoking. Reports claim that in its screening, people walked out of the theatre in disgust or got physically ill.At the top stand 2 scenes that you're not going to forget easily (minor spoilers next): The first one, which involves a man getting beaten to death, is probably the most shocking, violent and disgusting scene I've seen (and believe me, I'm not getting shocked easily) and could easily be described as ""snuff"". The second scene, although not nearly as shocking as the first one, involves a painfully-long brutal rape.The style of the movie is mesmerizing: It's almost entirely built of extremely long (up to 14 minute) and continuous shots and the scenes are partially improvised. For instance, one scene begins in an elevator, continues in a subway station and then in the moving subway itself, while people are coming in and out. This style gives a great deal of realism to the film and also contributes to the shock effect described above.In addition to being long and continuous, the photography itself tries to be unique. In the first third of the movie the camera continuously moves, jiggles and flips up to the point that you might get a headache.(Minor spoilers next) The plot itself is told backwards. The movie starts at the end credits, which go backwards, and ends at the beginning (if you've seen ""Memento (2000)"" or ""Following (1998)"" by Christopher Nolan, you won't find this to be very original). The purpose of it is two-fold: To give suspense to the plot, and to serve the main theme of the movie: ""Time destroys everything"". You get the full impact of this pessimistic (and very simple) theme by the end of the movie, when you run the scenes in your head in chronological order.(Minor spoilers next) The movie starts as hell-on-earth, both in terms of plot and technically (photography, music, lighting) and it ends very delicately, in a beautifully long love scene (between Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci, a couple in real life) and an innocent, almost surreal, scene of children playing and an obvious reference to Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)"", all to the sounds of Beethoven's 7th symphony.A Kubrick-Beethoven connection intuitively connects to ""A Clockwork Orange (1971)"", another movie that definitely had a great effect on the maker of this film, mainly in terms of ultra-violence in-your-face. I also felt an influence by Darrn Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream (2000)"", a fantastic movie that itself was obviously influenced by Kubrick's ""Clockwork Orange"".Whether this movie is special or just non-original, pretentious and meant to be shocking, provoking and controversial - you'll have to see to judge by yourself. The pessimistic theme/moral of the movie, ""Time destroys everything"" (and future events are already set), although extremely simple in concept and plot, turns out to be quite horrifying by the end of this movie. Great directors learn, in time, that hardcore sex and violence are sometimes more effective if left for the viewer's imagination, out of the camera. This movie takes the ""in-your-face"" method and doesn't hide anything from the viewer.Hate it or like it, from a ""technical"" point of view, Gaspar Noe seems to be a promising movie-maker. I'm certain it won't be long before we'll see him follow Luc Besson, making films in Hollywood. It will be interesting.Rating: 7/10",Irreversible
76,Prof-Hieronymos-Grost,Brutality personified,8,5 January 2006,"Irreversible is simply put a revenge tale, after the brutal rape of his girlfriend Alex{Monica Bellucci), Marcus(Vincent Cassel) sets out to find the culprit and deal out his own dose of vengeance. The structure of the film is that it is told in reverse, so we begin the tale, in a Gay Club, the appropriately named ""Rectum"" where Marcus and his friend Pierre are seeking out a man named Le Tenia who they believe is the Rapist, the film then flashes back in apportioned time frames which takes us through the brutal rape of Alex and beyond to the beginning of the tale. WellThis is indeed a film full of brutality that is told in a very unusual way, added to that the Director, Gaspar Noe inflicts on us,dizzying dancing camera-work and droning noise for the first 20 minutes or so of the film when we are in the Rectum gay club where pretty disgusting things go on ,so if you are in any way Homphobic the camera-work is probably a blessing in disguise as it somewhat hides some disturbing scenes of erect penises, fisting, buggery etc..,but the camera-work along with the droning noise was meant to make the viewer feel nauseous, and in that respect it succeeds.The revenge scene here is very brutal as Marcus and Pierre kill their prey with a fire extinguisher to the face ,the mans face disintegrating a little after each repeated blow( and believe me there are quite a number of blows) until the head just collapsesa truly sickening scene that leaves you somewhat thankful that it was only special effects and not a real killing. The other most effective scene in the film is the rape scene, Alex struggling to cross a very busy high street takes a short cut through a dimly lit underpass where she encounters a man La Tenia fighting with what seems to be a prostitute, The man stops Alex who is wearing a revealing party dress and holds a knife to her throat before forcing her to the ground where he inflicts on her the most savage anal rape that one could imagine.gone is the dancing lunging camera of before and in its place a fixed vision of Alex's plight...this scene is interminably long but there is no release for either Alex or the viewer as the camera holds its place forcing us to watch.her muffled squeals of pain are relentless,until finally Le Tenia finishes what he started and roles over in delight smirking like the cat that got the creamjuxtaposed against the animal cries of Alex, a bruised battered and bleeding wreck,Alex struggling to get to her feet grabs whats left of her party dress in a desperate but futile effort to cover whats left of her dignity La Tenia grabs her again smirking ""I'm not done with you yet""knocking Alex to the ground and beating and kicking her face to a pulp. On the subject of the format of the film its hard to tell if the film would be as powerful if it were told in its proper linear way,but if I were to hazard a guess I would say NO.Such things have been asked of Pulp Fiction and Memento and again I would have to say the power of these films too would also be somewhat diminished. So did I enjoy this film?...NO.its not a film to be enjoyed, but it certainly gave me a notion of how brutal humanity can be and its savageness will live long in my memory .I must admit to having a serious crush on Monica Bellucci ,she is extraordinarily beautiful almost doll-like, and I must say I was just a little intrigued to see her in a state of undress and perhaps in some sexually deviant scenes just for my own titilation you know,but as soon as I saw her characters plight in the film, I was filled with guilt and not a little embarrassment for having such thoughts,even though I watched the film on my own, there was absolutely nothing titilatling about the scene and at no time is nudity used to exploit the story and this is why Noe should be praised as it could so easily have been.",Irreversible
77,nobbytatoes,emotionally draining,9,9 December 2005,"Time destroys everything. The philosophy of Irreversible is time has written our future, that everything is set and can't be changed. Three people in one night meet their fate and what time has set for them. In the vein of Momento, Irreversible is told all in reverse, starting at the end and working back to the start. Two men talk about how time is destructive and our fate is set, then we are shot down to a underground gay club called the Rectum, where Pierre and Marcus are looking for a man called Tenia. The camera is all over the place, you cant make out the surroundings; the club is very darkly lit. Marcus is out for blood and isn't thinking straight, fighting a man who then violently breaks his arm. The man is then violently bludgeon to death by Pierre with a fire extinguisher. As we keep going back in time, Pierre's ex-wife and Marcus's current girlfriend Alex was attacked; raped and beaten into a coma by the man Tenia.Gaspar Noé's Irreversible is a dark, grotesquely violent look at fate that crushes you with heavy emotional impact. The crusade Marcus and Pierre go on is so full of hate and malice that its hard to cheer for them, especially on how it ends, though there is understanding behind them. The rape in question is the most grueling and emotionally draining sequence in a film. Lasting for about nine minutes, its a difficult watch. When the mans means behind the rape are revealed, it does hold true to all rapes; it is that emotion of superiority and degradation. When we reach the end, or beginning, it makes what went by even more unnerving, with a 'joyous' twist.Gaspar Noé's direction is a high light of Irreversible. The erratic camera work at the beginning reflects the situation perfectly, with Marcus and Pierre spiraling into hell in the club. When the camera is more restrained, it brings the love story between the three people to the fore front. The three leads all bring great performance. Vincent Cassel is emotionally charged as Marcus on a mission. Albert Dupontel as Pierre is the antithesis of Marcus, the more rational side. Monica Bellucci is wonderful as Alex, being stuck in the middle of these two men. She brought such beauty to Alex, that its so hard to watch the rape for it.Irreversible may not be for everyone, but it does deserve your attention. On the surface there is a lot of brutality and violence, but once you dig beneath it there is a truthful and honest love story between three people. You wont be as emotionally changed by any other movie.",Irreversible

While incredibly disturbing, ""Irreversible"" is a brilliant film in every regard. The sheer effect the film will have on every viewer is nothing short of incredible. I don't know if I've seen a movie that left such an impure and disgusting taste in my mouth.The acting is way above average, with the infamous rape scene standing out as one of the most believable things I have ever seen in a movie. I salute the two actors who pulled that off. Noe obviously wants the viewer to experience, partly anyway, what a victim goes through and experience it we do. I had to look away a few times during this one and my jaw was clenched the entire time. To say it was brutal would be the understatement of the century.I was impressed with the camera work and the way the movie flows from end to beginning. The obvious comparisons to ""Memento"" should be ignored; this film is way, way better in every regard.Pay no mind to the negative reviews, they are people who couldn't sit through this one. And I don't fault them; it is one of the most difficult films ever made. I've seen my share of disturbing stuff, read my other reviews...this one is not for the faint of heart.But it's message is important and ultra-real, something everyone should know about.

80,XxEthanHuntxX,Irréversible - 85,8,21 July 2020,"Irréversible is an extremely realistic study of the darkest corners in violence and humiliation. Human evil is portrayed with such honesty and clairvoyance that it really hurts, but there is art in destruction too. At the same time a brutal beating with a fire extinguisher takes place, and a terribly realistic rape betides. You cant deny it - so magnificent. The bold camera-work, the long takes, the riveting sound, the extraordinary acting and the amazing cinematography results in some spectacular scenes of world class cinema.The rape scene which last about 10 minutes is one of the best scenes I've seen, but also one of the most disgusting and disturbing, the cinematography to the red lighting, the dark filthy tunnel is absolutely breathtaking. And of course the acting is so extraordinary realistic. Completely mind-blowing the scene is in one take and stays in the same place the whole time.But the film also shows friendship, relationship drama and great joy. As well as love, eroticism and romance between a woman and a man. Irréversible show the picture of the complexity and multifacetedness of human emotions.Irréversible, like Memento for example, has its story in reversed chronicle order. Which was very affective, and you got an insight into what happened hours before the assault, and the second slap in the face that makes you understand that the cause of the assault is revenge. Revenge for a bestial, raw act.",Irreversible
81,bix171,An Insightful--Yet Harrowing--Character Study,9,3 October 2003,"Though it may strike some as exploitive (with some justification) and gimmicky (not only is it presented backwards in real time, each scene is shot in one take) and has perhaps the most astonishingly realistic portrayals of violence in cinema, Gaspar Noe's technically audacious film is, unexpectedly, also an insightful character study. The first half is a harrowing recreation of the lust for revenge after a brutal anal rape and beating that truly requires the viewer's ability to handle viewing these acts in remarkably explicit detail. But it's in the film's second half--where the events leading up to the tragedies devolve--that Noe's gifted direction of some very talented actors (including Monica Bellucci, from `The Matrix Reloaded', Vincent Cassel, the voice of Monsieur Hood in `Shrek' and Albert Dupontel in perhaps the film's most fascinating performance) is brought to the forefront and the superbly loose, semi-improvisational performances help define the characters in subtle ways that clarify the causes and effects of the events to follow. Noe has his flaws--he signifies a little too bluntly (Bellucci recounting a telling dream seems a little too prescient) and the opening scene takes so long a bit of the dread wears off--but he has far more affection for his main characters than his shock counterpart Michael Haneke does for his in `The Piano Teacher'. While Noe may have his aggressive, unpleasant side and mercilessly insists on pushing his audience's buttons, he also gives them an intimate portrayal of relationships constructed much more carefully than anticipated.",Irreversible
82,Dockelektro,Inoubliable,9,25 September 2003,"Many people will think of this movie as gratuitously explicit, using horror to shock its audiences. Many people will hate it, and will say that it is provokative and manipulative. I am not one of those people. Movies have a very specific art, a very specific way of doing things. And Gaspard Noé is very conscious of what mechanisms movies can offer, he is very aware that there are buttons you can push to inspire disconfort, as well as there are nervous centers that do the exact opposite. Edited backwards, this is no ""Memento"". It's a raw, visceral masterpiece, a monument to the tragic truth about our times, like a poem of violence and the way it can touch everyone who doesn't think their lives are at stake. It makes us think about our own times. Too lost for words to continue. Just one advice: see it in the dark, alone, with the stereo on full volume.",Irreversible
83,B24,Irredeemable,1,4 April 2005,"Depending on your level of vulnerability, you might be tempted to find something worthwhile in this film. There might be revealed to the inquisitive mind, for example, a sustained vision here that explores some new and exciting way of looking at life. That could be accomplished either by proving that the film simply demonstrates a vital essence or by observing more sophisticated aspects such as showing how good triumphs over evil, art transcends ugliness, technical virtuosity limns some heretofore recondite aspect of everyday behavior, or a truly magnificent and unique piece of acting conveys shades of meaning in a character or relationship.Alas! No such creature shows its face here. Instead the viewer is taken on a ride through the tunnel of sado-masochistic grotesquerie, beginning at the end and traveling with jolts and stops back to the start. The only frames that hold still long enough to form any impression are those containing violence and pornography aimed apparently at immature or obsessed members of the audience incapable of objective thinking.

84,barberoux,Intriguing and repugnant,8,31 January 2006,"""Irréversible"" is a fascinating movie. It is not for all audiences. The camera is all over the place, swooping and swerving as if it was attached to the back of a fly. The soundtrack has this like 20 Hz rumble that irritates and some of the scenes are shocking and, I think this word is appropriate, repugnant. The rape scene is hard to take. It is detailed and lengthy and Monica Bellucci has to be praised for her performance. The movie has a David Lynchian feel to it, maybe David Lynch off his medication. It is shocking. The reverse chronology doesn't allow you to get involved with the characters before the action bits but jumps right into it and then backs off and allows you to get to know the characters. This approach draws you into the movie looking for some explanation for the violence you've seen. The movie is very intriguing and I enjoyed it but it is not, not, not for everyone. It is vile, violent, repugnant and disorienting. I can understand why many walked out on its screening at Cannes. Any movie that features an establishment called the ""Rectum"" has to be approached with some trepidation.",Irreversible

THIS is your idea of disturbing? All I saw was a poorly done reverse told story (if you want to see how a cleanly told reverse story is done, watch a horror movie called, Hell is Full... masterpiece ) with extremely immature characters, and a Blair Witch-esque cinematography.Swirling camera pans, and irritating sound/music frequencies doesn't make a freaky movie...it makes for nauseating viewing. I've seen more disturbing rape scenes, more realistic rape scenes and certainly ones that werent so pretentious trying to pose as art, in soap operas.The flopping genitalia, the language, the characters...all of it seems like it was done for pure shock-in-guise-of-art and it failed. I did like the raw and gritty film style...I have a thing for alternate filters and sepia tones, I just wish the storyline hadn't been so confusingly presented and that it hadn't taken SO long to get the story told!I could have died from boredom had I not been so morbidly curious to see how it ended.",Irreversible
87,samxxxul,RAW!!!! BRUTAL!!! Masterpiece of World Cinema,8,15 February 2015,"By going backward in time, Irréversible stays very much true to its title.. The story line is told in reverse (similar to Memento) starting with the end and going back to the beginning. The first 15 minutes are a near-descent into Abyss, with twisting camera movements and 20 minutes into the film, Damn it left me shaking... The Camera angles suits the Atmosphere of IRREVERSIBLE. Grim,Nihilistic & Melancholic that's the tag for the Camera Angles.. and from then on there was no turning back.. there are handful of films that entertains and on the other hand there are few films which engages... Films that keeps us hooked on and unravel in our minds for a period of time.. Well IRREVERSIBLE did the latter for me.. Gaspar has Created a Raw Masterpiece, Which isn't Everybody's Cup of Tea/Coffee, Sure its Mine.. Proud that i own this Gut-wrenching Cinematic Art...",Irreversible
88,Thrashman88,"Tough, Brutal Revenge Story Told Backwards!",7,26 July 2005,"IRREVERSIBLE is th ""backwards"" story of 3 people and their dramatic fates. Shades of MEMENTO will obviously come to mind as IRREVERSIBLE unfolds in ""reverse"", with the first scene of the movie being the dark, dramatic end and the last scene being almost a love story. I have my doubts if the ""spoiler"" warning works for a movie like this, since we know right away what the ending is. Instead of focusing my review on the moral implications of revenge, sex and so forth, I'll tell you I what I thought of this movie at face value. For starters, IRREVERSIBLE can be a very tough movie to watch during the first 30 minutes or so. Not so much for its sheer brutal murder scene, but more because of its camera movements. This almost looks like some home-made video, with the camera shaking and panning left and right violently as we see the 2 main characters, Marcus and Pierre, desperately seeking low life pimp Le Ténie, who apparently beat the hell out of Alex, Marcus' girlfriend and former girlfriend of Pierre. Marcus and Pierre go inside a gay S&M club looking for this low life dirt bag and when they do find him, the way they dispatch him will go down in the annals of Cinema as one of the most hyper violent/gruesome deaths ever, as we see a man's head literally pounded to shreds. The scenes move backwards and we begin to know why are Marcus and Pierre so desperately looking for this guys. Alex (played by Monica Bellucci)was violently raped by this Le Tenie guy after she storms off a party. Through out the whole movie the viewer is subjected with shaky camera jolts and exaggerated colors, namely the color red. As the film progresses (or regresses???), the camera shots become more steady until we reach the very beginning of the story. There are some very hard sex scenes, without being too explicit. I've read other users comparing this to BAISE MOI, but IRREVERSIBLE does not have explicit sex. The Acting by Vincent Cassel as Marcus is formidable as well as Bellucci's. This is not the kind of movie made for family viewing but I think it shows what a man is capable of when someone destroys a close, loved one. A very good movie that's a bit tough to watch due to the unconventional camera style.",Irreversible
89,christian94,"Time, Life and the Universe",8,10 August 2007,"4:00AM on a weeknight. Just finished watching this fantastic french film. Philosophical with an outlook on time passage, destiny, the future and the past, this films is a series of relatively and seemingly long shots that tell a violent story in reverse order. Gaspar Noe is a revelation with flawless directing and fine flawed characters. His writing includes good dialogue, substance and many nuances and subtleties. The morning bedroom --> kitchen --> bedroom --> bathroom --> washroom --> living room scene with Bellucci and Cassel is full of little things that enhance the experience with realism, flair and freshness.The film uses a lot of spiraling camera motion, as well as some pulsating light (and sound) and can be pretty dizzying. The one thing that is easy on the eyes is Monica Bellucci. As beautiful as she is however, it is difficult to watch the vicious rape scene that takes place.Nore plays with our emotions, with our minds, with our senses. A great filmmaker and a great film. Expect a demanding film, but do yourself a favour and don't miss out.What is time? What is time to us humans? These are the main questions this film asks. The only answer I have right now is : this movie is time well spent.",Irreversible
90,ebossert,"Great Concept, Horrible Movie",2,1 December 2006,"After reading the plot synopsis, I was excited about the great concept, and waited in anticipation to see this film.The DVD menu popped up with the options written backwards  witty, I must say. It's too bad that a clever little menu format doesn't make up for poor film-making. After hitting ""Play"", I was then subjected to the most annoying opening credits in the history of cinema. The credits were in multiple colors, scrolling in reverse order, and swinging back and forth as well as up and down. Only 3 minutes into the film, and the filmmakers have already succeeded in pissing me off.The first 30 minutes have some of the worst camera work I've ever seen. It's way too chaotic and nearly impossible to tell what's happening most of the time. The director would twirl and spin the camera around in dimly lit hallways so the viewer only actually sees a few seconds of discernible action for every minute of actual film time. This is exactly the kind of cheap trick a filmmaker would pull in the absence of a good storyline.The apologists for this tripe will undoubtedly claim that the confusing camera work was meant to intentionally confuse and disorient the viewer, and that anyone who says otherwise simply doesn't understand the filmmaker's intentions. Well, if the intent of the filmmaker was to waste celluloid by crafting incomprehensible action, then he has succeeded. I'm apparently in the wrong business. I should have become a filmmaker. I could do an American remake of Irreversible. This time, however, I would black out the entire sequence in ""The Rectum"", showing only a black screen with lots of yelling and ambient sounds. I could then defend this nonsense as a perfect exposition of the lead character's ""blind"" rage, and explain away all criticisms by simply saying something like, ""You critics don't understand my intentions."" Of course, this is completely ridiculous position to hold. But that's essentially what we're doing here  rationalizing horrible camera work by having it act as a reflection of ""confusion."" Congratulations, fans of Irreversible. You have just lowered the standards of film-making to an almost indiscernible level.One of the worst parts of this film is the dialogue, which is particularly atrocious. First of all, the same short phrases are repeated over and over and over and over again. The entire revenge sequence is mostly nothing more than the male lead asking dozens of different people the same exact questions. Secondly, the narrative sounds like it was written by an immature, potty-mouthed, neo-Nazi. I challenge anyone to find me a film that uses more racial/discriminatory slurs than Irreversible. Thirdly, the dialogue used to supposedly build character development was almost exclusively explicit sex talk. All of these characteristics are exactly the kind of cheap tricks a filmmaker would pull in the absence of high quality narrative. Why bother putting some actual effort into writing a good script, when it's so much easier to insert garbage dialogue? With all the hoopla regarding the violence in this film, I did not think it was very graphic. The fire extinguisher scene was kinda cool, albeit obviously fake. The 10 minute rape scene was pretty brutal in a generic way, but it is not as devastating as it could have been, especially considering that it occurs in the complete absence of character development.And speaking of character development, it's pretty pathetic in Irreversible. As mentioned above, the dialogue doesn't help much at all. In addition, the lead male character was a real scumbag. He's a racist druggy who cheats on his girlfriend at every opportunity. I actually re-watched an earlier scene just to see his arm get broken again. If this is the best protagonist this film can offer, the writers deserve to be blacklisted from the movie industry forever. Bellucci is nothing more than an incredibly stupid, scantily clad whore. Seriously, anyone who would intentionally avoid the busy streets and taxis to take the ""safer"" route of a dimly-lit, nearly abandoned tunnel system should be a sure winner of the Idiot of the Year award. Then, a blatant ad hoc invocation is added. Faced with the sheer superficiality of their characters, it's as if the writers got together and said, ""Hey, let's take the easy way out and simply infer that Bellucci's character is pregnant."" Bravissimo fellas. It's too bad that developing a character takes much more effort than that.Needless to say, all of this mishandling of the characters really mitigated much of the rape and violence. This panoramic failure is what drives Irreversible down to trash film-making, plain and simple. Such an extended rape scene should have enraged me to no end, siding immediately with the boyfriend to help me understand the rage behind his acts of vengeance. Irreversible provides the exact opposite  no emotion whatsoever. I saw a generic dude beat another generic dude with an extinguisher, only to then see some generic woman get raped by another generic dude, only to then see our generic characters become slightly less generic in their culmination to unlikeability.I also need to mention the frequent shots of testicles and penises  one of which was attached to a transsexual. What on earth provoked the director to shoot this nonsense is beyond me, but it does put the icing on the cake. This film is classless, empty trash.Finally, some of the defenders of this film have actually claimed that Irreversible is intentionally confusing. They claim that Irreversible has repetitive dialogue, without a need for a script or even character development. When statements like this are being made in DEFENSE of a movie, they act as unintentional confessions that this film is truly horrible.",Irreversible
91,michaelradny,French Cinema Gem,7,27 July 2015,"Unlike most films, Irreversible leaves a pretty strong impression on you. The film is pretty graphic and the style of filming is experimentally effective, putting you in a mind bending, sick sensation. The story of revenge is clichéd, but freshly imagined in this film by adding the backwards telling of the story and the extremity of its climaxes. But after you experience the first half of the film, the intensity lessens ten fold into a more romantic bore fest with maybe too much metaphor than substance. But nonetheless, the film has more than enough redeeming qualities for you to forget the second act and focus on the disturbing themes of the first act. Truly a great, slightly flawed, film that will leave you feeling effectively empty and questioning your own values.",Irreversible
92,Jacques98,"Memento for adults. (Oops—well, that only describes the first half hour.)",5,11 November 2009,"When you ask most people the one major aspect that encompasses most children's fiction, most will tell you: ""A simplistic story; be it in black-and-white morality, or in an A to B plot structure."" Ironically, this definition also describes what critics and viewers both hail as one of the most disturbing movies ever made: Irreversible—and that's why I find the film lacking.If you know the film's title, then you also know it's one of the (handful) of movies that tells the story backwards. Though there were several lesser known films to do this long before the turn of the century, the one popular example is Memento. The one major difference here is, Memento was essentially just Happy Candy Land Rainforest Rainbow Ride, filled with trite, clean characters, and trite, safe, generic conflicts. When I first started viewing Irreversible, my only thought was: ""Dude, this is Memento for adults! Thank God SOMEONE used the telling-the-story-backwards idea with an actually good story."" And that's partly true . . .Irreversible does have some of the rawest, unexplained perverse human behavior every filmed—that is, in the first half hour. Because the movie is reversed, the characters brutal actions aren't explained until the midpoint of the movie, and, until that point, it's downright awesome. You're led to believe the characters are nihilists, causing this mayhem for no reason at all. The gritty environment (Rectum, the hotel, the tunnel) is genuinely gritty—not that cheap gangster shoot-'em-up atmosphere you see in generic crime movies. Then the bad storytelling ax falls and I felt cheated.After the over-hyped rape scene, the entire movie falls into predictable slasher-revenge-angst plot line; or just downright boring horror. The actions are explained as being revenge for rape (ala The Last House on the Left, I Spit on Your Grave, Straw Dogs, etc., etc.) and the awesomeness of nihilism ends and the cliché storytelling begins. Point blank: the original body of work we're led to believe the movies is, now is revealed as an unoriginal slasher flick. It's like ordering an expensive gourmet Italian pizza, eating a couple bites, and finding out it's really just frozen Save-A-Lot pizza from the local dollar store. And don't even get me started on the so-cliché-I-laughed-out-loud pregnancy test ending . . .Speaking of the rape scene: it's pretty generic. According to a quick IMDb.com search, there are more than 2,206 movies with a rape plot line, and if I were to do a more advanced search, that number would likely triple. Yes, kids, rape is a disturbing and terrible thing in real life, and I am in no means patronizing the real life event. But, folks, WE'VE SEEN IT IN MOVIES THOUSANDS OF TIMES. What's the big deal? You act as if Irreversible invented the scene or something. It's not any more disturbing or graphic or more weighted than any other rape scene ever filmed.The cinematography is cute. Spinning cameras, 2001: A Space Odyssey rip-off stylizing and music. I'm sure on a pretentious level this has a deep meaning (time and space and human insight—oh my!—as if we haven't heard that before!), but I'll just take it for face value and call it what it is. Cute cinematography that is both innovative and neat. But calling it ""deep"" is beyond melodramatic.So.Is Irreversible an enjoyable movie? Sure. I guess. It's okay. Watch it on Friday night, go to bed, and, unless you're a pretentious prick, I guarantee you won't remember when you wake up Saturday morning . . . but it killed some time, right? 5/10",Irreversible

94,mcjensen-05924,What an Idiotic Bunch of Slop,2,10 March 2021,"Please disregard all praise heaped upon this rubbish. If you can make it through the camera work at the beginning of the film, which looks like it was filmed by some poor soul having a seizure, you're doing pretty good. But you will be disappointed you didn't turn it off during that dizzying and needless bit of cinematic trickery (not artsy at all, by the way). Plot is just a simple rape/revenge drama, which could be endlessly entertaining with all the opportunities. All said opportunities were squandered here. Yes, it runs backwards. Whatever. That's not a distraction with this film. The characters personalities are developed just a bit later on into the movie is all, and believe me there's no treats when they are revealed. The main male character, Marcus I think, is incredibly annoying right out of the gate. As the film moves backwards, he only becomes less and less likeable. An immature selfish fool who somehow is with this amazingly stunning woman. Her character never really develops much, and is mainly here to show some skin and breasts. Gratuitous shots of her gorgeous body are thrown in needlessly and detract from the narrative. The whole shake camera thing and different angles only reminds the viewer that's it's only a movie and makes it impossible to get drawn in. The whole middle of the film is just filler and fluss and a complete waste of time. The only character worth anything is the male's friend and lead actress's ex. He shows decency and humanity throughout. The music is as pointless and inappropriate as what many people consider shocking scenes of violence. While they're graphic, they're also overkill to the point of absurdity. I actually liked the head smashing one better than the rape one. I have no issues with the scenes for content because done well it could add to the movie's power. The big rape scene to me completely ineffective, mainly because of the inane and stupid sexist comments by the perpetrator throughout the scene. He should have just said nothing. Never mind the fact that's it's a public tunnel where anyone could come by (one person actually did and of course ran away). The woman he was beating on before could of course give the rapist's name to the authorities, but that sort of thing is easy enough to overlook in genre films like this. The dialogue throughout is horrible! I haven't seen I Stand Alone, but after seeing this I have no desire to visit any of the director's work ever again. Dreadful......",Irreversible
95,tccandler,Time destroys everything...,10,11 April 2003,"Rape happens.  It happens to someone, somewhere in the world, every minute of every day.  To avert your eyes is to deny that it exists in your world. To turn away is to shirk responsibility.  This film is truthful in it's depiction of that horror and the feelings of vengeance that inevitably follow.  There will be those that are repulsed by this film, a film that can make 'Requiem for a Dream' seem like a little girl's fairytale.  If you are one of those who refuse to watch 'Irreversible' or one who watches and is offended... then you are living in a fake fairytale world of your own.  This great French film is as brutally truthful and poignant as any in recent memory.  It is one of the saddest films I have ever seen.  And yet, because of it's reverse chronology, the final scenes of blissful romanticism are some of the most beautiful and heartbreaking moments ever committed to the silver screen.  This is a courageous and magnificent artistic achievement!'Irreversible' unfolds backwards, much like 2001's 'Memento'.  It's not a gimmick...  far from it.  The film begins with the revenge beating of a suspected rapist.  It is a savage and relentless scene that will make many squirm.  It is as graphic and violent a scene as could be imagined, and at the end, you will feel like you were the one who had their skull crushed in. And because we have no real idea who these characters are, there is a sense that this is gratuitous and pointless violence.  Then we go back in time just a few minutes to the search for the rapist and watch as the frenzy of revenge consumes a man who is bent on justice for the rape of his girlfriend.  The next scene is the rape itself.  It is a soul-crushing scene of relentless intensity that seems to drag on forever.  It makes the earlier beating scene seem rather tame and almost justified.  And the film continues to track time in reverse to the beginning of a seemingly innocuous day filled with hope and love and tenderness.  But of course, unlike the characters, we are painfully aware of what awaits them as the day unfolds. It is tear-inducingly sad to watch these people drift toward an irreversible destiny.Monica Bellucci is astonishingly brave.  This performance is as courageous and accomplished as Diane Lane's role in last year's thriller 'Unfaithful'. She should be decorated with every award there is for her role as Alex.  She is terrifyingly scared and desperately sympathetic in the rape scene... but her best work comes later in the film (earlier in the day) as she shares some tender moments with her lover (Cassel) and some funny moments with an ex-boyfriend.  The final twenty minutes of the movie are all a showcase for her... a chance for her to show that she is capable of magnificent subtlety and tremendous range.  The bedroom scene with Bellucci and her real life husband, Vincent Cassel, is as realistic and honest as you will ever see. There is no need for added sentiment or melodrama... only truth.  Their interaction is spectacular in these moments.'Irreversible' is a film about many things: The Relentlessness of Time; The Cruelty of Karma; The Inevitability of Destiny; The Natural Tendency of Revenge; The Randomness of Luck; The Sadness of Truth.  I could go on and on.  This film doesn't give us convention.  It says that sometimes bad things happen to good people.  It shows that fortune sometimes smiles on evil (Try to remember every face you see!).  The movie doesn't perpetuate our need for fakery and fairytales.  Bad things happen... but time will destroy that too.As the film tells us over and over... ""Time destroys everything.""Director Gaspar Noé and his cast have created a great film... one that should be seen by everyone, especially those that don't want to!  This film has the ability to change you... and how many times can you say that about your typical fluffy Hollywood fairytale?  This is a masterpiece!I am sure that this film has reserved a place in my Top Ten list for 2003.",Irreversible
96,youngcollind,"A fully immersive experience, just not a pleasant one",9,18 October 2021,"Irréversible is a full on antagonistic assault against the viewer. The cinematography literally spins in disorienting, nausea inducing circles. The soundtrack is unnerving and contains frequencies designed to make you feel sick. The onscreen violence is some of the most graphic and disturbing I've ever seen. There's copious amounts of flagrant homophobia and racism strewn in every direction. The narrative is happening in reverse, because of course it is. This is all tremendously effective and makes for one of the most disorienting, anxiety inducing films ever made, simultaneously captivating and difficult to sit through.While it's bold defiance to convention is mostly admirable, it can be occasionally reminiscent of a teenage edge-lord, loudly hurling out obscenities with the aim to offend anyone in ear shot. This borders on problematic during the centrepiece rape sequence which gets stretched out over an uncomfortable amount of time to maximize shock value, but starts to feel gratuitously exploitative in the process.Once you strip away the smoke and mirrors, the plot follows a pretty pedestrian revenge narrative. However, seeing things unfold in reverse forces you to think differently about the catharsis of violence and the humanity of the victims.It is an undeniably unique, and fully realized vision with the capacity to perturb even the most calloused movie goers, and this impact cannot be overlooked, even though it's often hard to digest.",Irreversible
97,asifahsankhan,A film that can make Requiem for a Dream (2000 movie) seem like a little girl's fairy-tale!,9,27 June 2017,"First, above all, and crucially, the story is told backward. Two other films have famously used that chronology: Harold Pinter's ""Betrayal,"" the story of a love affair that ends (begins) in treachery, and Christopher Nolan's ""Memento (2000 movie)"", which begins with the solution to a murder and tracks backward to its origin. Now, consider this — Irreversible (2002) falls somewhere in between the two— The fact is, the reverse chronology makes ""Irreversible"" a film that structurally argues against rape and violence, while ordinary chronology would lead us down a seductive narrative path toward a shocking, exploitative payoff. By placing the ugliness at the beginning, Gaspar Noe forces us to think seriously about the sexual violence involved. The movie does not end with rape as its climax and send us out of the theatre as if something had been communicated. It starts with it, and asks us to sit there for another hour and process our thoughts. It is therefore moral – at a structural level.Unique & Weirdly Stylish, it begins with—well, in ""reverse""—Ending credits. Reversed. No first names. Only surnames. Various letters mirror-inverted. Slowly rolling down. Slowly sloping. Slowly moving across the screen. An image of a man sitting in a bed, tumbling.Then, a fanfare. Large drums. Names appear. Titles. Words. All glimmering. Red. White. Yellow.This is how it begins. Gaspar Noé's uncompromising ""Irréversible"", one of the most scandalous, most discussed European films of the last 20 years. Good? Bad? Masterpiece? Rubbish?

98,shadowman123,An exploration of human savagery and rage.,8,18 June 2008,"The signs were clear from everyone and that was be aware that Irreversble was not easy viewing for the faint hearted. That statement has been misused time and time again and although I kept my-self aware for the trip , Irreversble was a movie that took me on a ride and forced me to watch it in a helpless manner. From the start this movie had only one objective in mind and that was to confuse the person who was watching it, its use of camera angles, the way it was shot , it only had one goal in mind and that was to daze and confuse. This movie plays you out like a piano and one just sits there helpless watching. People tend to go on about the violence and one very extremely disturbing scene in it but this to make is a vision of the world and society that we live in. Now although the way it has been shot may be a bit gimmicky , it works well with seconds of intervals for you take on everything on board . The only thing that stops Irresversble from going the whole way is that the script might be a little dull but that it saved by a great performance by Vincent Cassell and a truly magnificent performance by Monica Bellicui , it truly is like watching husband and wife on screen , the violence that might seem over the top to some people and thusly this movie I WILL SAY IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART! However to conclude Irreversvle is a more like a study of the 2 most basic of human emotions brought to you in their true ugly shape and form , by the end of the movie it will leave you calm but nothing short of dazed and confused as it will have to settle in to you.

But what makes ""Irrevérsible"" more bitter but necessary, is its vision of ""Le temps détruit tout"".The story of ""Irrevérsible"" is about the destiny of three people in one day. And how the things that happen in just that day changes them for all their lives. With Monica Bellucci, Vincent Cassel and Albert Dupontel, who make the best in this movie of Gaspar Noé (Unknown director for me before). This movie is maybe strong -and for this is very talked for much- and much people going to think about sensationalism and be like all that movies that exaggerate all to create strong and even, disgusting situation without any reason for do it. Much times just for call attention. But ""Irrevérsible"" - in my point of view- has its reason for all the images that manage. The innovative narrative is the first and maybe most important thing to take account. The film is -among other things- about time -past, present and future- and its consequences. As we see the end, we know yet the facts and what already happen to the caharacters, in other words, we know now its future and what going to happen them -the most notably is when we know that the character of Monica Belucci, Alexandra, down in the tunnel. We feel awful, because we know that there is not any salvation for her-. As the movie go on, we found after some strong scenes a certain calm, that after all in the beginning of the the story -or the end of the movie- we found a surprise anyway that makes the things that we see more terrible. In its scenes, of course that the things that shows us are very strong and even traumatic for a while. The scenes of the assassination in the decadent gay bar,the search of revenge, the rape scene, the party, the sex talk, the room full of love and finally the early calm is the full content of this film (For that and next reason is that this comment has BIG spoilers). And although that there are yet movies that portrait the revenge for the damage of a beloved been (Take as example exactly as ""Irrevérsible"" do with the rape and the kill in the sense of revenge with ""Jungfrunkällan"" by Ingmar Bergman or ""The Last House on the left"" by Wes Craven) ""Irrevérsible"" do certain different effect, but still very effective.In spite of that i have not seen much movies about time -of course, few of different narrative ways like ""Rennt Lola"" , ""Amores Perros"" or even Griffith ""Intolerance""- but this movie brings it message with a big force. A message about don't waste your time, think in your future... NOW! As we see the premonition of Alexandra of her dream.

It's essentially focused on human perversion, promiscuity, the thirst for revenge and the power that hate have in our lives.It has one of the most impressive and shocking scenes I have ever watched in my life (starring Monica Bellucci), with such realism and both physical and emotional pain to the point that a lot of people in the audience walked out in Cannes, when the film premiered at the festival.",Irreversible
102,r-c-s,HAHAHAHAHA! The Toxic Avenger gets artsy,2,22 June 2007,"Well, has anyone seen ""the toxic avenger""? I mean the first one (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090190/). Has the ""postmodern avant-garde"" director from Argentina ever seen it? Or seen it but won't tell? Well...there is one iota of residual value...the spinning camera angles, which remind me of psychedelic, surreal experiences in strip clubs or discos; i guess he wants us to ""see"" as if we were the character going through the motions. I understand he wants to show the unbridled quest for revenge of two amateurs; ""revenge is a dish best served cold"", so the two amateurs basically quantum leap in the blind and miss the hit...the gay club scene is (hear me) R I D I C U L O U S, not because of the graphic content, but because any moron in Tromaville (see the Toxic Avenger) would know that one ought NOT to enter the ""love nest"" (ehm...) of a rapist sociopath he wants to kill shouting to everyone he's looking for him, especially when doesn't even know what the sociopath looks like. Ah, and when you are not Hulk Hogan you don't go around in such a nasty place slapping bare-butted men around to advertise your presence. The head smashed is a very bland and amateurish scene: in the toxic avenger they squeeze WITH A CAR the head of a boy, whom had previously been savagely run over. Oh, and when the forehead is smashed into pulp, the mouth still moves... The gay club fight is middle school grade. Honestly, does ANYONE (except postmodern directors from Argentina ) think ANYONE expects to settle the rape of his woman IN ONE NIGHT AND WITHOUT ADEQUATE PREPARATION? Come on...No Charles Bronson there. There is one iota of residual aesthetic (=purely formal) value in the rape scene. Forget skin & sex ( you get MUUUCH better stuff and more skin over the net for free ), but i see the inner city upper middle class cutie who- mistakenly, inadvertently, innocently - ""goes under"" (the underpass being a metaphor ), where conventions she is used to no longer hold valid. The sodomy choice adding to the disrespect for the ""spoiled brat"". But it takes too long to unfold...i've seen more violent and graphic rapes in 1970s Italian police movies, so no news there. Ah, and you do not let your beauty pageant woman scantily dressed walk home alone...and a scantily clad woman alone takes no underpass...her man calls a cab for her, and sees her in...or she does. So what do you expect...i see errors leading nowhere but hell.So a movie i wouldn't bother with, despite the toxic avenger is a cult for me, and Pialat's movies, and 1950s movies...but this is tripe with only residual value.",Irreversible
103,Atavisten,*Warning* Will not let you go unaffected,10,5 April 2006,"Irreversible unfolds reversely. It begins with the end and ends with the beginning. It has Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel. Miss Bellucci has a sequence lasting forever where she's raped by a by-passer in an underpass. The camera is fixed on this from a distance and makes it so distanced and cold that you are utterly sickened, disgusted and angry. The controversies around this are well known and people say don't believe the hype, but this stands so well on its own merits. Somehow by starting with the most brutal and dizzy going to explain what motivated that anger instead of numbing your senses, makes you more angry about tragedy. It's hard to describe this movie, it's been a while since I saw it, but you will never forget it. Bangalters music also is so fitting for the images and the feel of the movie, it's some of his best work IMO.",Irreversible

The camera must be from a supermarket and the lights from director's living room. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this in your entire life.",Irreversible
105,Afracious,Forceful,8,25 April 2004,"Irreversible begins with an old man sat in a room (Philippe Nahon of Seul Contre Tous) telling another man that ""time destroys all things"" and that he slept with his daughter, while outside we can hear a commotion. This is the start of the back-to-front story, which goes from frenzy, chaos, violence, then finally concludes with peace and tranquillity. The main three characters are Marcus (Vincent Cassel), his partner, Alex (Monica Bellucci), and her ex, Pierre (Albert Dupontel). The first time we see Marcus and Pierre they are frantically searching a gay club called The Rectum for a man called Le Tenia, who they believe raped and badly beat Alex. They come across two men in a doorway in the club, one of whom Marcus thinks is Le Tenia. He fights one of the men, who then breaks Marcus' arm and is about to rape him. The next sequence is an amazing attack, and one of the most realistic killings I have ever seen in a film. Pierre intervenes with a fire-extinguisher and proceeds to the ram the butt of the object into the man's face no less than twenty-three times. It is very effective. What is also ironic is the man who is killed isn't the man who raped Alex - it was the other man in the doorway.  But the most controversial scene is the vicious rape and assault of Alex. She is trying to cross the road and is ironically told by a woman to use the underpass because it's safer. It is a distressing scene and it is more traumatic for the spectator than the ones in Straw Dogs and I Spit on Your Grave because the camera never moves. It is perched very low on a tripod and stays there. We can't escape the ordeal on screen. After this we witness the events leading up to a party, sexual talk between the trio, and the love between Marcus and Alex. It is a skillfully made film. I also liked the music. I'm glad I watched it.",Irreversible
106,mrcaw1,"Obscene, sadistic junk.",1,8 August 2005,"What can I say? The movie is garbage. I cannot imagine anyone with a well adjusted, healthy mind wanting to watch this movie as a form of entertainment. The violence is presented as so realistic that it makes you cringe and wonder why you're exposing yourself to these images. I would think, perhaps it might be useful in law enforcement to show police and military what a brutal rape looks like or what it looks like to see a man's head bashed in by a fire extinguisher but other than that I can't imagine why one would sit through this this film. If you're mind is so devoid of imagination that you need to see this film to understand what real life violence can be, than I truly feel sorry for that viewer. I cannot stress enough that this film is not entertainment in any meaning of the word. It is almost akin to a snuff film and to try to imply that simply because the film says that violence is bad is nowhere near enough to justify this as a piece of drama. 99% of the people who see this movie will walk out on it. Unfortunately, there will be that 1% who will get some vicarious thrill from it, though they will cloak their enjoyment in intellectual babble. After sitting thorough some horrific violence and soulless sex, I fast forwarded to other scenes on the DVD, just too see what the director's idea of dramatic set-up was. It was uninspired, trite, and amateurish.There have been plenty of movies that have dealt with both violence and sex that manage to do it in creative and truly inspiring and profound ways. Simply showing a woman being raped in hyper-realistic fashion or again, filming a man getting being murdered by having his head bashed over and over again by a fire extinguisher is not daring. It is pathologically immature, crude and the antithesis of what art is.I feel sorry for the director because something must have happened in the director's life that the director is trying to expunge by making this in affect a reanactment. At least I can only hope that was the reason this movie was made. Otherwise it truly is a disturbed fetish being enacted.",Irreversible

During the infamous rape scene I even cried out at one point, I remember.All in all, I wouldn't call the film brilliant exactly, but it certainly does a good job of dropping you straight into hell, and then pulling backwards to show people who are at peace only a few hours before they will be dropped into that hell themselves.And let me just say that Monica Bellucci deserves 3 Oscars just for ATTEMPTING to do what she has to do in this movie.

109,imbluzclooby,Beyond Belief!,8,22 December 2005,"I watched ""Irreversible"" last night and I have to admit that it is not my favorite foreign film. My sole reason for watching this was to view the ever so lovely, Monica Bellucci, who I admit puts in a very believable and natural performance. I was responding to all the other reviews on this board and heard all the muck about the shocking brutality, two scenes of which are quite unsettling. Along with everyone else, I believe the ten minute rape scene was upsetting and hard to take. The man getting his head bludgeoned with the fire extinguisher was equally as gruesome. But ""Irreversible"" is not about gratuitous sex and violence. It's a very symbolic work of art that is very daunting and electrifying. The plot is done retrospective which I did not find hard to follow at all. The artsy camera movements in the beginning along with the pulsating background score was quite effective for an opener. A bit dizzying as well, but it sure sets a mood. Marcus (Vincent Cassel) is understandably on a rampage to hunt down his girlfriend, Alex's (Monica Bellucci) assailant. With the aide of his friend and her ex-husband (Pierre) they scout the town vehemently. This town is beyond decadence, loaded with prostitution, drugs, gays and all types of dregs. They had just left a party where Alex left early and Marcus and Pierre find out later while roaming the boulevard. Marcus sees Alex's bloody body being hauled out in a gurney is all too real and heartbreaking. Thus, the frenzied hunt for retribution follows. The scenes where Alex, Marcus and Pierre are walking around and riding on the bus were very amusing as they shamelessly discuss Alex's sexual drives, libido and their inability to satisfy her. The casting is right on and this is where Bellucci and Cassel really shine as a couple and acting partners. The scenes of Alex and Marcus just lounging in bed and goofing around are cute and charming as well. The movie takes a beautiful turn as it symbolically shows their dreams of her being pregnant and the life they could have had. Unfortunately, the degenerate creep who raped Alex wasn't the man they killed and that is one major problem I had. I needed to see poetic justice.The violence is heavy to be sure and only the tough minded and emotionally stalwart should watch this. But, while you are watching, to keep yourself from fainting. Repeat this line to yourself, ""IT'S ONLY A MOVIE, IT'S ONLY A MOVIE.""",Irreversible

Very interesting to see what led up to the events and a bit disturbing at times but very well done. It is not bad as people make it out to be, it can be disturbing at times, but it's mostly due to the duration of the event than the intensity.

111,tapio_hietamaki,"Controversial and powerful, difficult to watch but a very rewarding experience",9,23 March 2017,"When I came to the IMDb page for this movie, the first review that was featured was a one-star review from 2009 that posed the question: 'is there a part of you that gets off on the sex and violence of this movie?' Well, not the violence. I did get off on naked Monica Bellucci, willing and moaning, lying in her bed peacefully at home, and I find no fault in my reaction.The ending of the movie felt really powerful, not just because of the eroticism of the nude female body, but because the movie advances anti-chronologically, beginning from the end and ending in the beginning just like 'Memento', and we thus know everything that is going to happen to the characters after this time of bliss. The 'pseudo-philosophical' message at the end, 'time destroys everything', is very relevant to this movie. We see the characters utterly destroyed, and after witnessing it we are better able to appreciate their brief happiness.The movie is sensory fireworks. The ending made me afraid of a seizure and I would never ever in a million years recommend the movie to anybody (unless it were someone who I knew appreciated Noe's other movies) because of all the flashing lights and spinning cameras that make it quite difficult to watch.Then there is the infamous rape scene. Certainly controversial, but a great piece of acting. Not for the squeamish or the faint of heart.",Irreversible
112,noizyme,"Great direction, cinematography, and style...but rape scene",7,23 September 2004,"Ha, wow...um, this movie was indeed a spectacle of directing and camera-work.I have never seen a movie (almost) completely in reverse order of occurrences and even though this plot might have been shallow or somewhat predictable, the originality of this movie beats all other modern pieces out by showing brutality in ways we (in the US) haven't really seen in most of the releases out right now.::PLOT SPOILER::The movie essentially is about a couple, whose female side is battling the truth of her pregnancy to her spouse and his unwillingness to quit partying nonstop. Meanwhile she's trying to keep a friendly hand out for her paranoid ex whose actions are not seen until her unspeakable, violent rape scene in a downtown tunnel as she is trying to get home. Vowing revenge, 2 men offer their information to the two men closest to her for a price, and they head on their way through the backroads through prostitute-land and gay clubs in search of the rapist/killer (?). The woman's ex violently snaps and bludgeons the (wrong) man into death as the real rapist looks on and chuckles. If that doesn't spoil it, I don't know what will...But even though I told the plot, the way that this director chooses to reveal what's going on is very creative and unique and deserves at least one viewing. Harsh as the beating and raping scenes might be (excessive, maybe), I think the movie was trying to show the grittiest points in the most drawn-out ways to get you to have a heart for these characters and their emotions behind their actions. The man/spouse of the woman, for example, is quite gentle in the beginning of the movie whereas his character slowly unravels throughout the film, starting with the beginning (violent, crass, racist) to the end (romantic, sweet, sensitive). A great way to see the world of this director.I gave it a 7/10 (it has a weighted score of 7.2 at this time of commenting) just like a lot of people. You can't rent this one at too many stores so anytime you have an extra $20, through it down on this DVD because the special features make an additional point or so on that 7 stars.",Irreversible

The technique used to show this works well - of the many films to date that use a gimmick (such as Memento, and Donnie Darkko) this one is the most direct and successful. You do not have to watch it twice to 'get it'. You effectively get to judge scenes with more information than normal, not less.

115,silverauk,This movie is a realistic horror-movie.,1,8 July 2002,"This movie learns us about the nightclubs, secret bars for homosexuals and the whores in a big French (supposedly Paris) city. Those are all subjects not worth making a movie of it (a TV-documentary could be interesting as a curiosity). Marcus (Vincent Cassel) is at the pursuit of the author of the violent rape (Mourad Khima) of his girl-friend Alex (Monica Bellucci). He is apparently hiding in the closed circles of underground-bars for homosexuals. The problem is that the time-order of the movie is turned around so you see the beginning of the movie at the end, which is the only originality of the movie.  Not only you see the end at the beginning but it is filmed in such an awful way that your eyes cannot follow the movement and in the night-bar for homosexuals you cannot distinguish what is happening.  Above all Marcus is on drugs and the movie pours out such a violent atmosphere that you think your are in a nightmare.  If this is one of the hells of Dante's Inferno, than it is well described.  The movie is only interesting as a charge against drugs, prostitution and rape.  The theme of the movie that time destroys everything is not the correct one; I would suggest that crime destroys everything.  As an illustration of the horror of such crimes this movie has a merit: is an indication that real life can be more horrific than the most frightening horror-movie.",Irreversible
116,NateManD,"Once something horrible has been done, there is no going back.",10,15 August 2005,"French director Casper Noe's ""Irreversible"" may be one of the most unsettling rape revenge films ever made. The story is told backwards like the film ""Momento"". The film may cause viewers to get motion sickness from the crazy non stop movement of the camera. The main characters Alex, Marcus and Pierre are 3 friends whose story is told over the period of one day. Her ex boyfriend Pierre is sort of the voice of reason, although violent if put in the right situation. The brutal revenge takes place at a gay S&M club. After Marcus is in danger, shy Pierre steps in beating the wrong man to death with a fire extinguisher. This scene is disgusting and realistic showing every detail of the skull crush. Before this happened 2 gang members offer Marcus a chance for revenge, saying they can track down the guy who raped his girlfriend Alex. Then the film continues to work its way back to the beginning. The most unsettling part of ""Irreversible"" is when Alex (Monica Belluci) gets brutally anal raped. This seen goes on for about 8 minutes. She goes out alone after a party wearing a sexy outfit, not knowing what fate awaits her. During the rape scene the camera stays in one place and focuses mostly on Alex's face and screams. It's sad, brutal and hard to watch. You want to look away, but you can't. It seems Casper Noe wanted the viewer to feel the Traumatic pain that Belluici's character felt. After that, the film becomes normal going back in time to the beginning of a peaceful day. The only other 2 films that I can think of with rape scenes as horrific are the cult classics ""I Spit on your Grave"" and the Hong Kong film ""Red to Kill"". The only problem is that these 2 films are too exploitative so the message is lost in the execution. What I like about ""Irreversible"" is it shows how ugly violence and rape are. It doesn't exploit women or glamorize brutality. If the film were to be told in a regular order, it might of made revenge a justifiable act. But by Noe showing the revenge first, it shows the animal like rage of the human condition. If put in the right situation who knows what horrible things we're capable of? ""Irreversible"" is very graphic in its sexual and violent content. It is very challenging to get through the whole film. It's very sad and devastating as it grabs your emotions and beats you relentlessly in the back of the skull.",Irreversible
117,Perception_de_Ambiguity,Irréversible explained in the words of Stephen Hawking,8,10 June 2011,"Stephen Hawking explaining Gaspar Noé's film Irréversible and its main theme ""Time destroys everything."".>>>There is a big difference between the forward and backward directions of real time in ordinary life. Imagine a cup of water falling off a table and breaking into pieces on the floor. If you take a film of this, you can easily tell whether it is being run forward or backward. If you run it backward you will see the pieces suddenly gather themselves together off the floor and jump back to form a whole cup on the table. You can tell that the film is being run backward because this kind of behavior is never observed in ordinary life. If it were, crockery manufacturers would go out of business.The explanation that is usually given as to why we don't see broken cups gathering themselves together off the floor and jumping back onto the table is that it is forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics. This says that in any closed system disorder, or entropy, always increases with time. In other words, it is a form of Murphy's law: things always tend to go wrong! An intact cup on the table is a state of high order, but a broken cup on the floor is a disordered state. One can go readily from the cup on the table in the past to the broken cup on the floor in the future, but not the other way round.<<< >>>The second law of thermodynamics results from the fact that there are always many more disordered states than there are ordered ones. For example, consider the pieces of a jigsaw in a box. There is one, and. only one, arrangement in which the pieces make a complete picture. On the other hand, there are a very large number of arrangements in which the pieces are disordered and don't make a picture.Suppose a system starts out in one of the small number of ordered states. As time goes by, the system will evolve according to the laws of science and its state will change. At a later time, it is more probable that the system will be in a disordered state than in an ordered one because there are more disordered states. Thus disorder will tend to increase with time if the system obeys an initial condition of high order.Suppose the pieces of the jigsaw start off in a box in the ordered arrangement in which they form a picture. If you shake the box, the pieces will take up another arrangement. This will probably be a disordered arrangement in which the pieces don't form a proper picture, simply because there are so many more disordered arrangements. Some groups of pieces may still form parts of the picture, but the more you shake the box, the more likely it is that these groups will get broken up and the pieces will be in a completely jumbled state in which they don't form any sort of picture. So the disorder of the pieces will probably increase with time if the pieces obey the initial condition that they start off in a condition of high order.<<< Ergo: Time destroys everything.Stephen Hawking on the narrative structure of Irréversible:>>>Suppose, however, that God (Gaspar Noé in this case) decided that the universe should finish up in a state of high order but that it didn't matter what state it started in. At early times the universe would probably be in a disordered state. This would mean that disorder would decrease with time. You would see broken cups gathering themselves together and jumping back onto the table. However, any human beings who were observing the cups would be living in a universe in which disorder decreased with time. I shall argue that such beings would have a psychological arrow of time that was backward. That is, they would remember events in the future, and not remember events in their past. When the cup was broken, they would remember it being on the table, but when it was on the table, they would not remember it being on the floor.<<< That's basically it, in a nutshell.",Irreversible
118,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Train Coming Round The Bend,7,23 December 2013,"I really enjoyed Irreversible, but I had no idea I was watching the film from back to front until quite a way into the film, which made me wish I'd paid more attention to the start of the film.Watching a film in which you know what's going to happen because it's already happened is pretty strange. I guess the beginning, I mean the end, of the film is supposed to make us deplore the rape scene in the middle of the film even more, getting us thinking, over time, about the depravity of people who understand nothing other than seeking out personal thrills. It certainly got me thinking and here I am typing out this review, but it didn't shock me in the way I'd hoped or expected.On a positive note, the rape scene itself was more graphic than I had anticipated, especially as the film had incorporated so much blurry camera work beforehand. Here it seemed to steady down and just focus on this intense, pivotal point of the film. I'm thankful for that detail because I had expected the director to skip over this scene. There was also quite a lot of nudity which was another sordid surprise from a person seeking gory kicks, but besides the obviously alluring beauty of Monica Belluci, the film failed to really bind me to the characters. If you don't really feel for the protagonists, why should you care about their ultimate plight, regardless of how gruesome it is?I didn't find the film as shocking or harrowing as I was expecting. I enjoyed it and I'll no doubt watch it again if I get the chance, maybe upgrading my review by a star over time, but for now it hits a steady seven as solid, interesting, inventive entertainment, but not quite as disturbing or gripping as I'd hoped.",Irreversible
119,KingM21,"It's irreversible, my friend. Time destroys everything.",9,4 September 2003,"Gaspar Noé's Irréversible (2002), a French film, has just recently been released on DVD here in America after a short, limited theatrical release earlier in the year. I had read much about the allegedly strong, disturbing content of the film and thought to myself, 'sounds like another modern exploitation film with a few shocking scenes, like Baise Moi (also French). I'll have to check it out sometime to see for myself.' Well, no theaters around me screened it and I just happened on the DVD when looking for some movies to buy. I said what the hay and threw it in my cart. Not only did it truly fulfill its notorious reputation but it was also one of the best films I've seen so far this year!(*Basic Plot Spoilers*)Irréversible tells the rather simple story of a few people whose lives change drastically with the choices they make, the basic plot of many films, really. The main characters are Alex (played by the beautiful Monica Bellucci), her boyfriend Marcus, and her ex-boyfriend Pierre. Alex still cares about Pierre (and vice-versa) and since Marcus doesn't mind too much, they all decide to go to an evening party together. During the party, Alex gets upset with Marcus's immature behavior and decides to just go home. On the way to the subway, she gets severely raped and beaten. Soon after, Pierre convinces Marcus to go home as well and on the way, they find out what just happened. A mad chase starts, ending up in a very depraved gay bar, to find the man who did this and serve up a very cold dish of graphic revenge. Twenty three ironic times...whew! Like I said though, this is just the basic plot.(*End Basic Plot Spoilers*)There is a big catch to the structure of Irréversible. Similar to Memento, Irréversible plays the last scene first, with each following scene showing the events that took place immediately before the one you just watched. This format works extremely well here (much better than Memento in my opinion) and turns this simple story into a harrowing nightmare of cinematic emotion. In essence, you know the fate of these characters before you know why they are in their current situation. So, while you may not initially 'care' about the characters and the horrible positions they are put in, when you do, it will be all too late. Since the climaxes of the film are shown during the first half hour or so, it would be fair to ask if the rest holds the viewer's interest. It does. Many points, both important and not, occur throughout the remainder of the film which relate back to the opening tragedies and therefore, in a sense, you end up reliving the terrible events several times over. Noé's direction is upsetting, both physically and mentally. The camera spins and turns wildly as it floats from place to place and scene to scene, so much so that many viewers will feel a bit ill, which I believe was partially the intent. This shows a world of dark chaos but as we go on, Noé turns it into a feeling of light peace. It would be impossible to not mention the visuals he creates. Many are actually subtle yet full of meaning but two in particular are incredibly potent. One of them is undoubtedly one of the most realistically brutal and disturbing scenes of violence ever captured on film! The other is a truly painful and distressing rape. Both scenes greatly add to the cogency of this film, especially when you put all the pieces together. The ending is also of note, as it assaults the viewer with a final moment of reflection on what they have just been witness to for the last 97 minutes of their life. Anyway, another interesting thing Noé does (or doesn't do, as it would be) involves the cutting of the film. Each section of the story is seemingly one long take. There are no cuts in them (or very few), making for a realistic, effective presentation. The acting is quite good too, especially considering that most of it was improvised. In a few scenes, it is downright powerful.Irréversible is really a two part story, with the first half exploring the dark natures of human beings and the second showing common, everyday life. Together, they cast a light upon the tragedies that occur daily in this world and how suddenly they can happen. Some choices we make are irreversible. Some events are irreversible. What will tomorrow bring? You will find out, all too soon.Bonus: While the initial DVD release was missing The Making of the SFX featurette, I believe you can now send it to Lion's Gate for replacement. However, this featurette can also be downloaded for free from their site!",Irreversible
120,scarletminded,The violence seems a necessary part of this film,10,30 May 2012,"I didn't view this film for a long time. I was curious about the sound and editing techniques, but didn't want to watch the scenes of violence.But the violence of this film seems necessary to its narrative. It's rape in its reality. There is nowhere to run. It's an act that destroys a woman, then ends up destroying the men who want to commit revenge. I feel the director must have known someone who went through this or something similar. When Alex is talking about her dream, where the tunnel splits in two, it is clear she has a premonition of how her life will never be the same. That there is a before and after to her now. Two parts. I don't think this film would have the same amount of impact if it wasn't as violent as it is. Or as pretty as it is at the end of it. It is the parts of Alex, being shown on the screen, before and after.The way this film is presented is complete genius. I didn't even think I would like a film like this, but the pure chaos of sound and intriguing dizzying camera work creates the world where the characters, who were once peaceful and happy people, become frenzied, frantically searching for the rapist in a labyrinth nightmare of a SM gay club. The fact it is presented backwards and since the name, Irreversible, is a bold move. It ends on a happy ending. Of the woman, Alex, reading a book in a park where happy children run around her and an almost painful bombardment of 2001 type white flashes. It makes it even the more sad, that she thought her life and family were just beginning. Then the viewer has to think now, even if she wakes up from a coma, what life will she have? Her boyfriend's in jail for killing someone that wasn't even her rapist, due to his taste of revenge. Yet the end of the film is beautiful. It's all classical music and lightness...and hope. But there is no hope. Their lives are ruined, yet the view delights in the prettiness of us, that the horror is far away. Yet it isn't. This is what makes it amazing to me. I am not sure why people walked out of this film. Rapes and murders happen in real life. People's lives get ruined in a matter of minutes everyday. This isn't a film for entertainment, though I have never thought torture type films were entertaining, but this is a film that makes you think and feel, even if it is disgust in the beginning. The parallels between what the characters say at the end of the film and what they say at the beginning is interesting too.I probably won't view this film a second time, but it is the best film I'll most likely never see again. It's very intense and creates a mood which is hard to stomach on so many levels. But that is what I feel true cinema is. It takes risks, it has people walk out on it, it says something. It isn't like a cheap horror film that uses violence to titillate, it's a landmark in filmmaking that tells it like it is and has no qualms about it and doesn't apologize. I wish more films were like this, even non-violent ones.",Irreversible

Suffice it to say, I found watching this movie a harrowing and disturbing experience. There´s no doubt it´s a display of subtle technical wizardy. But the question that plagues is: is it art...Everyone will have their own opinion. It is certainly a very distasteful movie. Or some may say thought-provoking.It´s great to see a movie wrench so many vastly different emotions and opinions from an audience. However, all its deepness can´t disguise a lack of plot and a fairly poor script.Without being told in reverse, without the fine filming, and the disturbing anal rape sequence and violent scenes, I imagine ""Irreversible"" would be little more than your average made-for-TV American (albeit in French) movie.1 - 10 / 10 Who knows.

122,horizon2008,Egareva Eivom,6,29 July 2013,"Well, it's taken me ten years to get round to watching this movie, and before posting my review I read the other ones here just to see what the movie going consensus was when it first came out. I actually hadn't bothered to see what the films storyline was before watching it, yes I'd heard it was controversial, but that's really all. But then... I like controversial.I find it a little laughable really, all the big, deep, meanings being drawn from the flick which seem to pervade every review before mine. Don't you all think that maybe, sometimes, you might be giving a film more credit than its due? I see this often on IMDb, maybe it gives the impression that the poster is more arty, and intellectual than the rest of us by declaring they saw all this depth herein, but to be honest, human life just ain't so multilayered.The story of the movie is, boy meets girl, they go out to a party, boy acts a bit of an arse while on drugs, girl leaves party, gets attacked and raped, and boy hunts down assailant to dish out revenge. Not really that original really then eh? But run it all in reverse, and it adds a slightly less obvious slant to things. There are two scenes which brought all the controversy, the rape, and the squishing of a head with a fire extinguisher. That's it. Now it's true the rape is pretty rough (although The Accused with Jody Foster many years ago left a worst taste for me to be honest) but the fire extinguisher head crush is obviously CGI and since 2003, when this was made, there have been much worse things put to celluloid. If this movie ran forwards, it would be said to be dumb and pointless, yet here we are with it getting all this art-house applause. Don't get me wrong, I thought the film was good, and I suppose quite memorable, but so many thin plot flicks could easily have done the same thing after this release and ran in reverse to gain some points. To end, I didn't think it was all that shocking. I would have liked the guy who actually did the rape to have come to a brutal end, rather than some mistaken identity. But that's just me. Guess it gave it a much darker vibe though with the assailant getting away unpunished. I must admit too, that the English subs on my copy were pretty bad. And I don't know if it was intentional or not, but there were a few places I laughed at the comedic dialogue around the name of the gay club. I don't think so many would be shocked at this now. Or maybe I've just seen too many violent flicks like Torched, Grotesque, A Serbian Film, Human Centipede 2 (although that was a comedy), and Martyrs etc. I wouldn't watch a movie like Cannibal Holocaust again though, due to the animal death scenes, but then that's real, and this isn't. So some old movies do still shock I guess.",Irreversible

124,Boggman,Gets in your head and stays there......,10,10 August 2005,"Everything you've read about ""Irreversible"" is true. This is a shocker of a movie. It's also a fantastic piece of work that dares you to ignore it once the credits have finished rolling.This movie blew me away. Yes, the imagery can be a bit much; which is mostly due to the fact that during it's most disturbing scenes- director Gasper Noe does not take the camera off the victims for one single second! Watching somebody get their head violently smashed in or watching Alex (Monica Bellucci ) get raped from beginning to horrific end can be hard to stomach for most viewers, which is exactly why Gasper does not cut corners in his depiction of the brutality of murder and rape.This movie is about as close as you could (or would want to ) get to actually witnessing a real-life murder or rape without physically being there. Although, when watching ""Irreversible"" you cant help but feel as though you ARE there....and as the movie continues to play out you will no doubt sympathize with Marcus's (Vincent Cassel) anger, Pierre's (Albert Dupontel) sensibility, fear, and rage; and Alex's ultimate violation.""Irreversible"" is a mesmorizing and unforgettable trip into the depravity of a sick world. It's also a beautifully fleshed out character drama that unwinds nicely as the film plays itself out in reverse. In short, I loved this movie, and recommended it highly to only the most mature and intelligent audiences.""Irreversible"" becomes such a personal experience for the viewer, that watching it alone is best recommended for a first time viewing. I wouldn't recommend this movie to be watched with most friends and family- but a solo viewing will no doubt leave a lasting unforgettable/irreversible impression! Recommended!",Irreversible
125,SimonHeide,"The horror, the horror...",10,16 April 2018,"The story is told in reverse....This is not just some artistic pseudo aspiration but something that makes a very interesting difference. Because of the reverse order you already know some of the consequences for what is going on. So instead of trying to figure out what will happen you wonder about what has already happened. I found that refreshing - it gave me a feeling of watching it more intensely.The violence and sexual aberration brakes every filmic scale....Was it necessary to depict the horror that can be involved with sexuality in such an extreme way...? How to judge this? I have always thought that showing scenes with intense violent content could be done very effectively in a subtle manner if you have to do with a very skillful director. But not this time. The part of the story that takes place in the nightclub ""Rectum"" is absolutely brilliant. The dominant red colour that blends with the shadows and erases every idiosyncratic feature of the faces and only lets the lust and perversion shine through building up to a repulsive climax. It´s like taking the trip down to the perverted Freudian ""id"" where no morality or known norms seems to exist. The super-ego has been cleaved. Scary and strangely fascination at the same time.Then the rape scene....Was it to be endured because there was actually something new about the dangerous mix of sexlust and aggression that could be learned? Or was it just a director who wanted to provoke? I had to mute the sound and go further away from the screen in order to see it. If you have the slightest experience with somebody who got too ""close"" to you at a certain time in your life don´t watch this scene...! Don´t!The first half part of the story....Here the atmosphere is permeated with joy, harmony and humour with the couple, that later will go through the living hell, teasing each other. These scenes delivers a sense of tragedy as they are watched with negative sign.I wish I could rate this movie on another scale than good/bad. I am not through thinking about it and still watches different scenes.Regards SimonPs. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review.

127,Kashmirgrey,Why?,2,23 December 2006,"This film reminded me that time is irreversible, and that once your eyes take sights in, the images remain permanently seared in your mind. So it only makes sense that we take care what sights we expose ourselves to.Irreversible is an exploitation film. Those that praise the film seem to believe that anything of a realistic violent and/or sexual nature that successfully unnerves them must therefore be art. That is frightening. What's next? Mainstream snuff films?I was unable to discern even an inkling of purpose or message that this film was attempting to demonstrate. When the Marcus character (Vincent Cassel) and the Pierre character (Albert Dupontel) savagely assault and graphically mutilate the perceived ""bad guy"" in a gay porno parlor, was I supposed to cheer or throw up? I felt nothing for either of these characters, and because the film works itself backwards, the event offers no finality or redeeming factors that, had it been presented after the rape scene, might have been somewhat of a benefit.Director Gaspar Noé made this film to make money, not art. He did so by casting Monica Bellucci as a woman who is brutally sodomized and beaten to near death. Bellucci being a beautiful woman, Noé knew that the buzz of the rape scene would draw folks in. Add in extreme and realistic violence, and the controversy surrounding the film would act as a lariat.But the absolute most irritating part of this film was the constant camera spins. I guess that was art too?",Irreversible
128,AbhiMathews,Life: The Weirdest Dream,7,15 July 2015,"This movie is intense. No doubt about it. The performances are not only great, but it's the brutality of everything that's so unsettling. Although there are scenes that linger and others that simply cause a headache, this was certainly a bizarre and reflective sequence of events. Irreversible is certainly quite different--whether that's good or bad is undecided, but it's still welcome nonetheless. Beyond the particularly strong scenes of power abuse, it's the thought of vulnerability in any capacity being targeted that strike's one's heart. Whether it's yourself or a loved one, we've all been in those dark places. We hope it will just be fine. And it usually is. This film represents the rare (yet duly noted) case of when things don't go so smoothly.To say this movie is revolutionary would be contentious. Regardless, it was hard to watch. With that being said, blissful ignorance never solved a problem, it only ignored it. To some that may be equivalent, but to others, it's an important lesson to never forget.",Irreversible
129,Pingo-2,Intense!,9,14 June 2005,"Gaspar Noe's IRREVERSIBLE is not super-violent all the time, as one might get the feeling when reading some comments on it. Only two scenes are disturbing, but the length of them, the graphic and the theme makes them intense and a bit tough for those who are not used to these kinds of pictures.But what makes this movie most hard to watch is the fact that it is told backwards and that the ending is such an extreme contrast to the beginning. This makes the movie so very sad, bleak and cynical.The film itself is technically perfectly made. I can't compare it to anything - it is just such an awesome accomplishment. The scenes are very very long with no cuts, and the actors (and actress!) are very good.It is a disturbing film to see. It might not be an important film to watch, but at least it gives some very good insights in modern life and shows how fragile things around us really are.I was very impressed by this movie.

130,Pedro-37,No scandal. Just a bad film.,1,18 November 2002,"A little ""Eyes Wide Shut"", a little ""Last House on the Left"", an extremely tough rape scene, an extremely ugly head-splitting-scene. And a big dose of arthouse pretentiousness. Voilà ""Irréversible"", a movie with the ability to shock you three times: In the amazingly raw head splicing scene, in the equally raw anal rape scene - and in all the emptiness in between.This is no more than an arthouse-shocker. All the messages Noé wants to bring across are lost on the exhausting way to the boring ending. Man is an animal? Well, yeah, how insightful. And it's not even brought across convincingly. There would be so much to deconstruct in this nihilist film, but I won't waste too much energy. I too have to say, that there is a technical interest in the film, that I admired the rawness, that I was fascinated by the length of the scenes (for example the one-take-rape. Really tough) - but the showing off amounts to a big nothing. It's an empty film, it's arthouse exploitation. And a dishonest, actually uptight film for intellectual revenge freaks.One might think that there's something interesting behind all the technical wizardry, behind the atrocities ... but no. There's not. Just watch closely and you might see it too. Rating 1/10PS: I was reminded of ""Trouble Every Day"", another film that tries to take a geekish shock-genre (Vampire-Horror with lots of blood) and give it an artsy fartsy touch. And it also fails miserably.",Irreversible
131,badgrrlkane,GROSS!!!!! I feel so gross after watching this travesty of a movie!,4,26 November 2005,"I love horror films & after sitting through horrific exploitation films like I Spit ON Your Grave (which i watched after renting it from a local video store at the age of 9) & Ms.45, I figured I could handle most films dealing with rape. However, this was a little too much. Why, for shock value would you let a rape scene go on this long? Too shock your audience into either loving this film or hating it? Too get rapists out there turned on enough by giving them their own form of pornography to get turned on & go out & anally rape a woman? The fact that the rapist was a bi-sexual pervert was gross enough, as she probably got AIDS, if she even survived. And, even though the gay S/m bathhouse-like club appropriately named ""The Rectum""the scene where upon finding the person known as (in English) ""The Tapeworm"",the fact that they kill the wrong guy by brutally bashing in his head, (which I enjoyed as a gore-hound, but not that they didn't get the right guy)really ticked me off. Even though Vincent Cassel's friend saved him from being savagely raped by a man while the queers egged it on.was also cool. But,i hate the fact that the rapist gets a way with it. And in the rape scene the dialouge really left me feeling sad & disgusted. Granted,i knew there was a gross long rape scene from word of mouth, but did he have to have said the dialouge he said? It truly made me want to puke,having been a survivor of a rape attack in my own life. So if you goal Mr Noe was to shock & gross out people with the worst rape scene ever in film history, then your a winner. If it was placing 2 of Europe's best actors, Vincent Cassel & Monica Belucci in a sick exploitation film,that wouldn't have been interesting at all without them,then you succeeded as well. This is not for the squeamish & not for people who already want to censor film & TV. This sorta film is what's getting those types riled up day in & day out. I personally could've gone without seeing this film. Had I known, how it really was. i would have.If you like a film with an actual storyline,& are a fan of Mr Cassel & Ms Belluci's check out Brotherhood Of The WOlf, instead. Kudos to ms Belucci's performance however during the rape scene. Very powerful & very believable. I felt sorry for you. That you signed up to do this film & that a movie-man felt a need to film a movie about how awful not only rape is,but dry anal-rape. The writer needs therapy,in my opinion.** out of *****",Irreversible
132,whatdoes1know,Ignore the warning labels.,10,17 March 2003,"Good: The movie was cathartic, thanks to Monica Belluci who was in a brave role, Vincent Cassel who transforms well from lover to pothead to victim to avenger, and Albert Dupontel whose whimpering yet unstopping violence is the sad conclusion of his friends' advice to ""let go."" Furthermore, the rapist has a demonic face reminiscent of the vampire make-up in the Buffy series, and I'm wondering if his face has been altered of if he's really got a face that pisses you off just looking at it smirk.The special effects are gruesomely convincing, and much more appreciated for their unglamorous depiction of violence. The camera work is fascinating, I was expecting hand-held video from the descriptions of nausea. The movie is rightfully unglamorous in violence, but gorgeous in fluid cinematography.
This movie came packaged with so many layers of warnings that even if those were ultimately what made me want to see the movie, I was nervous myself of getting physically sick at least during the first ten minutes of the film. Then I forgot and immersed myself in the world of Gaspar Noe. Memento is often referred to when speaking of this movie's narrative order, but the movie starring Guy Pearce had a certain level of redundancy by always ending with a previously seen shot, and some scenes just drew yawns. Whether it's because this film establishes itself upon the groundwork of the previous film, or because of the consistency in the character's change in this story, each scene back in time didn't need to establish a dead obvious link to the one before to convey it was further back in time. It's a better editorial choice.",Irreversible
133,DVR_Brale,Irreversible gets more and more disturbing as it gets more and more pleasant,7,3 August 2016,"There are a couple of reasons why this movies plays backwards. First, it keeps you ignorant about what had happened to provoke all the mayhem. Second, it puts you in the position of knowing what is eventually going to happen. That way viewer always remains a step ahead of protagonists. We see them weighing ways they might go with, knowing what way they're eventually going to choose. Third, you can't initially sympathize with characters since you don't know them. Fourth, as you continue to delve more into past, you become more and more horrified at the fate protagonists are ignorant about which you just know to well.Look at the notorious rape scene. I didn't watch it completely - it was to obnoxious. What makes Irreversible so great is that it somehow makes the rape scene even more obnoxious as it comes to past (from viewers standpoint). It's initially disgusting and violent but it later becomes more frightening; it keeps carving deeper into your heart and memory as you get to know Alex.A substantial amount of the movie we watch Alex' boyfriend, Marcus, going for a revenge. He goes through a very disturbing milieu where sex is enjoyed more than anything else. Very soon we get to know that revenge plan didn't go as planned. Marcus shouldn't have gone with it in the first place. But nevertheless, movie keeps playing backwards and we keep seeing Marcus desperately taking all the necessary action to find rapist and take revenge. It's very hard to watch someone's life going down the spiral as he takes wrong road which we doubtlessly know is wrong. That night in Paris everything went wrong.In conclusion, this is not a movie I could recommend. If you can take dark and very depressing tone with some extremely brutal violence you might be able to go under the surface and think more deeply about the lesson Irreversible delivers. If not, you'll probably be stuck with burdensome feelings as you see time destroying even the most beautiful things.",Irreversible
134,evilmatt-3,It's good . . . but YIKES,9,29 March 2003,"From the country of Jean Francois Lyotard comes this nasty little postmodern fairy tale about the human perception of time and random acts of violence (which as it turns out are not so random after all).  Hindsight is 20/20; we all know this.  It's quite another thing to be shown it in such a graphic manner.  ""Time destroys all things,"" Noe tells us.  If you can make it to the end of this film, it's difficult not to agree.  For creatures so perilously shortsighted as humans, a linear perception of reality can be a deadly thing indeed.It's impossible to describe this film or do it justice in print.  Like any example of true cinema, it needs to be experienced directly.  That said, this film is definitely *NOT* recommended if you are squeamish or easily outraged by the actions of make-believe people on a movie screen.  It is *NOT* recommended if you must have characters who do not have deeply rooted and nonsensical prejudices or tendencies.  It is *NOT* recommended unless you commit to watching the ENTIRE film, regardless of how repulsed you might be by what you see on screen.It *IS* recommended if you want an original, thoughtful, and ultimately well-made meditation on the human condition.  Regardless of what its critics may think, _Irreversible_ is fine bit of fictional cinema.  The sting of it is that perhaps it strikes a little too close to the horrors of our own lives.",Irreversible
135,Blackace,"Head Spinning, Eyes Hurting Vulgar Film",5,6 July 2013,"This movie is a serious head trip. Most people won't even get to see the whole thing because of the dizzying vertigo camera work. Seriously, about 15-20 mins of the film is showing the sky, room, or something else with the camera constantly spinning. There's like 8-10mins of this at the very end of the film with flashing lights. I literally just fast forwarded through it. If you have Epilepsy or are prone to seizures, do not watch this film. Seriously.There is a story here. It's about a couple Alex & Marcus, who go to a high society party with their friend Pierre who was once Alex's boyfriend. He still has strong feelings for her, but is very happy that his friend Marcus is with her now. Marcus gets drunk at the party and Alex decides to leave, even though Pierre begs her to stay. He also tells Marcus to go after her, but he refuses. Alex decides to take an underground tunnel that passes under the street to get to the other side. She runs into a man (we find out earlier that his name is Le Tenia) who's talking to a woman. The woman he's talking to breaks free from his grip and escapes. Tenia approaches Alex and after a few harsh words, he throws her to the ground and brutal rapes her. The rape is somewhat graphic. There is some nudity, but the belittling and verbal abuse Tenia does to Alex is over the top. Very graphic and cruel. The beating is even worse. Of course Marcus & Pierre later find out and seek revenge on Tenia.What's interesting about the film is it's told in reverse (hence the name 'Irreversable'). The film actually starts with Marcus and Pierre running through a gay orgy house called ""The Rectum"" looking for Tenia. You'll have to see for yourself what happens when they finally find him. Then the next chapter shows how they got the info to find him. Eventually the film will end at the very beginning of the story, which is a happy and sad moment.The best scenes in this whole film are ""the train ride to the party"" and ""Alex & Marcus at their apartment before the party talking."" You can truly see and feel how much love they have for one another in these scenes (Monica & Vincent are married in real life you know). The train scene is interesting because you learn more about Alex & Pierre's relationship and nothing is held back. Every secret is brought out to the opening. It's a little hard watching it in subtitles because they talk so fast. The acting is very well done in these scenes. Vincent Cassel, Albert D. and Monica B. are all very good here. Even Jo Prestia is good as the vicious bad guy.What kills this film is the crazy camera work and some obnoxious scenes that are a bit over the top. The trip through the Rectum club was just torture for me. I wanted them to hurry up and find Tenia and get the hell out of there. The fact that there is a real bar called Rectum is just disgusting to me. I would never set foot in a place like that. I can understand why people walked out of the theater. The first 20mins is hard to stomach. I understand why they played it in reverse, but the crazy camera scenes seem to be there to make you nauseated and extend the film. The film is only about 75-80mins long really. If you must see this, Netflix is the place to watch it. It's currently streaming right now.I gave this 5/10.",Irreversible

These are your average horror and ""slice 'n' dice"" movies that may scare us or make us laugh for their incompetence. But should a competent film maker show us the worse just because they can? There are four films that go beyond what movies should do. They are ""I Spit On Your Grave"", ""SALÒ o le 120 giornate di Sodoma"", ""The Last House On The Left"" and ""Irreversible"". Each depicts torture and rape in an all too realistic manner. The question is not why we would watch such films as why they would make them. They may simply want to test the limits of the art of film making. Perhaps they foster serious discussions of difficult subject.

It had an early sequence which earned the prestigious title of ''the first experience whilst watching a film where I felt at risk of being physically ill'' (gold star), then a midway sequence where I just felt quite sad and then rather bored. I don't really care about the debate between art and sensationalism, this picture just drew a blank for me and a rather negative one.Sure, we cannot control where our lives will lead and all such but do we really need any optimism we might have dampened to such an extent by a director/poseur just out to make an impression and offend somebody....'anybody' .Nothing personal, I actually find Gaspar N. quite an appealing male as appearances go and I've actually enjoyed a lot of his other films but not this screeching obliteration.Still I guess we all have to start somewhere.What I did find more entertaining however at one stage, was watching the Cannes footage at the time, of the morally outraged and violent reactions of the French Bourgeoisie as they fled the opening premier.....can't say I really blame them.",Irreversible

This is not one of them.The word ""gratuitous"" is terribly overused, but here it applies. Even if one tries to watch this as ""art for art's sake"", there is little redemption for the movie. The shots alternately leave people out of frame who should be in, and then go wide enough to make me ask myself if the director was drunk or just bad, or both.Why this film exists is a mystery.

141,varundelpiero,Disturbingly unforgettable...,9,6 December 2008,"IRREVERSIBLE is the kind of unflinching and uncompromising film that examines the concept of violence in an industry that has, for the most part, become desensitised to it. The acts of violence depicted in this film will serve to offend and disturb over half the audience, and walk-outs are not uncommon. That's not to say the movie is riddled with violence; in fact there are only two scenes worth mentioning, and they do not exceed 15 minutes total (out of an approximate run-time of 90 minutes). However these acts serve not as focal points of the story, but as a reminder of what distinguishes reality from fiction, as these are two of the most shocking scenes viewers will likely see in a Motion Picture.In Gaspar Noe's IRREVERSIBLE, the story follows a reverse chronological order, filmed in segments, reminiscent of the brilliant MEMENTO. But that's where the similarity stops. In MEMENTO, the ending of the movie (or rather beginning) was meant to be a tremendous plot exposition, and the story in that film was a convoluted and complex one that relied heavily on the narrative. In IRREVERSIBLE, the plot/story is a relatively simple one by today's standards, and I will not be surprised if viewers watching this film without the English subtitles still understand the gist of the story. The ending (or beginning) of IRREVERSIBLE will seem to be a pleasant and happy one, but upon realising exactly what will happen in the future (i.e. the events that preceded it in the film), one will understand the true nature of the tragedy, and that within 24 hours the lives of these individuals will be irreversibly altered, and that the ending is of no real consequence. This is where Gaspar Noe, armed with the tag-line 'Time destroys everything' transforms this movie from a brutal uncompromising study of violence into a more cerebral and intelligent film, examining the notion of time. There is no such thing as a true ending, as there is always something yet to come. Alex's quote in the film, ""It says that the future is already written. It's all there. And the proof lies in premonitory dreams"", in which she discusses a book she is reading, is the most potent and poignant one.Viewers who are able to make it through the film will begin to appreciate the messages and the undertones portrayed in this movie. Additionally, while MEMENTO relied on the narrative, IRREVERSIBLE doesn't need to, but is instead infused with a style that no viewer is likely to forget. Noe begins with unsteady, uneven, nauseating shots, and as the film progresses (or rewinds/unwinds), the camera-work becomes more calm and placid, right up until the ending, which is beautifully shot, showing more vibrant colours than the rest of the film combined. Noe then ends the film with a reminder that things are not all sunshine and paradise, by employing a rather upsetting film technique, which I will not divulge here for the sake of the potential viewer.The acting in IRREVERSIBLE is solid and engaging. Monica Bellucci's portrayal of the female lead is as powerful and believable as one will see. Vincent Cassell and Albert Dupontel also do incredibly well in a movie that is not character-based, but more reliant on the manner and style in which the story is told (or untold).IRREVERSIBLE is a brutal, unflinching, and uncompromising film. It will shock, sicken, offend, and disturb. But unlike many of these modern films that try to sensitise violence (inexplicably by infusing themselves with as MUCH violence as possible), it is a film that should not be missed. It will challenge you greatly. During the first 20 or 30 minutes you will ask yourself repeatedly, ""What am I watching?"", but after the plot begins to unfold you will become engrossed.8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Will just about enter my Top 100 at #100 or so. Highly recommended.",Irreversible
142,rcraig62,"Flawed, but with real impact",6,6 June 2004,"The structure of ""Irreversible"" reminded me of the infamous Seinfeld Backward Episode, and at the time I watched that I deduced that probably the only reason they did it was because the script didn't play funny forward. Irreversible is actually helped and hurt by its structure, and after much thought, I think Gaspar Noe did right by telling this story in reverse; it has the net effect of being poignant rather than exploitative, which it would have been if played forward (it would have had all the depth of Walking Tall, or thereabouts).  The rape of Alex and subsequent revenge killing (or vice versa) instead drive home the point of the movie, which is that each moment of our lives is so fragile, each incident so fraught with significance, that the consequences are truly irreversible.  In the (more or less) final sequence, where Alex realizes she is pregnant, that moment has as much impact as the violence because we know what's going to happen to her later.
       On the negative side, I have to admit to a real sense of dislocation in the sequence of events, then, after watching it, I had to re-watch certain bits of it to get it clearer in my mind what took place after what, and then I couldn't find the scenes on my DVD skip button because I didn't have even a fuzzy picture of where certain scenes had come in.  And, finally, the way it was photographed in the rollicking camera style that Noe imposes on the audience, is in the tradition of this cutesy MTV-generation visual style that some people seem to think is So Cutting Edge, but I just find it annoying (although it works rather well in the scene where the guys ride in the taxi while heckling the Chinese driver).  Fortunately, the camera is stock-still for the extended rape scene and the fire-extinguisher head-bashing affair, and the freeze of camera motion really adds to the intensity of both scenes tremendously (not for the leery, by the way).
       I think ""Irreversible"" is a good movie, but not a great one.  I probably wouldn't seek it out again, but I'm glad I saw it once.  Well worth watching.  3*** out of 4",Irreversible
143,AlexanderFitzmeyer,Irreversibel 2002,10,31 March 2020,"Noé's film is dramatically interesting and consistently brilliantly played. He also gives an approach to predestination, fate and supposed security. Together with an incredible camera and a soundtrack that stays in your memory, Caspar Noe manages to not only look but also see.",Irreversible
144,PaulLondon,devestating,10,8 June 2003,"Noe's bleak study of the events leading up to a revenge killing and a brutal rape makes for a harrowing but compelling 90 mins.  Much has been made of the horrifying rape and murder scenes but it is the tragic feeling of the inescapable pre-ordained nature of fate that permeates every frame of the film. Noe brilliantly creates an atmosphere of dread whether it be in the hellish oranges and sickening yellows of the beginning of the film or through the brilliant performances which capture the despair seeping through into daily life. Not to all tastes but, like Baise Moi, it demonstrates French cinemas willingness to unflinchingly look at the dark side of human nature and evil. Grimly fascinating, quite depressing but essential viewing",Irreversible
145,cwarne_uk,Death Wish With Pretensions,5,1 August 2008,"First off this is a very well shot and presented film, Noe has genuine cinematic gifts - camera movement being used for once to disturb and disorientate not just show how clever the director is. Like ""Memento"" the story is presented backwards and the question of why this is so has to be asked. Christopher Nolan's film used the technique to gradually reveal the full horror of the protagonists fate - despite seeing the film several times the ending is still devastating. By extreme contrast Noe seems to have realised how trite and banal the story actually presented here is. Yes folks this is a bog standard revenge story as per ""Death Wish"" and a hundred others. Noe though thinks he is very clever and his story has a great philosophical point to make. It is that time destroys everything! Truly a life changing insight. In order to hammer the point home we have to watch an extended face bashing and a nice long rape scene. Why do these have to be shown? Well for one thing, and a point not often commented on, Noe is a professional filmmaker in the commercial film industry, not as some seem to think a struggling avant-garde artist. He knows, and the attention paid to this film proves, that people will pay to watch this stuff. I believe another reason may be down to Noe's adulation of Stanley Kubrick - a filmmaker of similar cinematic flair and simplicity of mind. Why did Kubrick have a rape scene set to music in ""Clockwork Orange"" - I suspect because he thought it looked good and was funny. Similarly I think Noe is amused by his own conceits, and possibly he thinks rape makes good viewing. Watching this film made me long for the honesty of real exploitation cinema, Wes Craven's ""Last House On The Left"" covers much the same ground, it is amateurish in the extreme but has an energy and a sense that what is happening is real entirely missing in ""Irreversible"".",Irreversible
146,bulleetz37235,Beware...,9,12 March 2006,"An undiluted look at humans out for revenge. An unsparing look into what atrocities humans are capable of. An unflinching sick and perverse insight into the horrors of rape, assault, murder and love as we follow three people on a downward spiral, that is twisting and writhing in all directions... Alex (Monica Belucci) is sadistically raped on the way home from a party. Marcus (Vincent Cassel) her boyfriend tormented by this horrid event has sworn to find the one responsible. Pierre (Albert Dupontel) is the witness watching over his uncontrollable friend as he walks a path of destruction to the perpetrator... With Gaspar Noe directing with eye-aching camera twists, vibrant colours and shocking imagery this film tells it's story in unhinged ways. Proceeding backwards like 'Memento' but not in the same clear cut manner. With parts seeming to be in places where you didn't think they should be, this film makes you seriously consider what processes were undertaken to make it, as it moves in an unpredictable way, towards it's end/or is it the beginning? It is unlike anything you will ever see, and it is certainly not for those with weak dispositions. It surely is a masterful film for those strong enough to see it. But beware its intrigue, beware its anguish, beware its lure for it is certain that you will think about it. And once you've thought about it, it cannot be unthought, it will stay with you in mind, possibly haunting you on some lonely occasions, as the title suggests it is a film of events and effects that are truly - IRREVERSIBLE...",Irreversible
147,Rooster99,"Boring, pretentious, typically French.....",2,31 May 2003,"Try as they might, the French cannot make an ""artistic"" film without making the subject matter too sick for human consumption.  In this blatant ripoff of the unique storytelling method born in ""Memento"", the film is told in 5 minute sequences in reverse order.  It includes an incredibly annoying revolving camera as an opening, in a not-so-subtle attempt to demonstrate how badly things have spun out of control.  Needless to say that when you get to the end of the film which is of course the beginning of the story, it is in vibrant colour and perfectly steady.  Had the director not insisted on prolonging the agony, perhaps he would have gotten away with it.  Instead, he goes on for 20 minutes spinning his camera in a very improbably gay leather bar, trying to shock the audience into appreciating his work.  He also faded all the colours, leaving only a hazy red washout, ostensibly depicting the depravity occurring around the central character.  It doesn't work.As pointed out by every reviewer on IMDB, there is a very brutal rape scene that just goes on and on.  The point was made, there was no need to make the audience physically ill.  I understand it was the director's intent to try to explain the horror of rape, however the sheer brutality presented to the viewer is totally gratuitous.  I have endured years of Palme d'Or films since moving to Paris, and most are so pretentious and unwatchable that it makes me laugh to read ""art"" critics speak of the ""pioneering spirit of new-age filmmakers"".  In all honesty, most French films vying for top honours at Cannes are trite, non-sensical, and shocking exposes each attempting to outdo the other in terms of ""artistic vision"".  The prevailing attitude amongst those who buy into this idea is that if you do not understand the films, you are obviously a peasant.  Irreversible fits nicely into this category.  It is nothing more than a different take on ""Romance X"", ""Baise Moi"", and ""The Pornographe"".  Each tries valiantly to shock the audience, showing as much flesh as possible in the most demeaning way possible.  BORING!  OBVIOUS!  If the directors had any talent they wouldn't have to make movies that only rely on their shock value for any sort of commercial or critical success.This film is brutal, vicious, and utterly without restraint.  The characters are wooden, you couldn't care less about them, they are carefree partiers, annoying, irresponsible, and without any direction in life.  What a travesty, this film belongs on the Cannes trash heap.2/10",Irreversible
148,Akira-36,This is a movie made to shock.,4,12 June 2003,"IRREVERSIBLEThis is a movie made to shock. Like any movies, one can see Irreversible as many things. The critics are divided into: love it or hate it, my opinion on the other hand goes in between. I have not seen any movies made by Gasper Noe before, nor have I seen French movies where Belucci starred.I came into the cinema with an open-mind and tried to ignore all the hype and praises that this movie had received prior to its opening at the Beck's Incredible Film Fest 2003, in Auckland.--POSSIBLE SPOILERS--[The Gimmicks] The first 1/3 of the movie is filled with awkward camera angles, tilting, rotations and dizzy lightings. From the epileptic credit openings till the white flashes at the end of the movie, I get the impression that the movie was made not only to shock audience, but also to make them feel sick literally. As such, all of those fancy camera tricks and lighting settings were just cheap gimmicks. There is a difference between being smart about conveying the feelings of the characters/situations/messages in a movie, and punching someone in the solar plexus to get your message across. In which case, Irreversible definitely falls into the latter category.I mean, Noe himself repeatedly stated that he wanted to shock people when he was interviewed by the French media about this film. On a more recent article in our local newsletter, Noe was noted to say that he'd be happy to have Irreversible played along side B-grade movies like 'The Cannibal Holocaust' and had no quarry about it being played along side trash movies either. I rest my case.So, for those of you who wants to see this movie out of curiosity or wants to get the 'message' of the film, look the other way when Noe starts to swing his camera in the film. If you want to get dizzy and vomit, eat lots of pizza and take a roller coaster in a theme park instead. Film critics who praised this movie for its 'positive' message, should just ask Noe what the movie is really meant to do, instead of theorizing on things that are not there to begin with.[The Rape Scene] The core event of this movie is the notorious 10-minute of rape scene. Some critics say that this is the most powerful anti-violence movie, anti-rape and so on. Rape is wrong. But this movie is not about anti-rape nor anti-violence. It's just a shock extravaganza. There are more brutal rape scenes in other movies, and they happened to nicer people. The 2 main characters in this movie, Alex and her boyfriend Marcus, are far from nice/innocent either. Both Alex and Marcus seem to be the kind of people who frequented rave scenes. We see Marcus freely flirts with other women, takes drugs and when push comes to shove, you see how violent and racist he is. Alex on the other hand, for someone who is supposed to be a 'sophisticated' upperclass woman, should have known better not to go through an underground passage way, at night time in a dodgy part of the city and dressed so provocatively. Simply put they are not the best of the human flocks; nevertheless they did not deserve the fates they receive in the film.[The Flashback] Well, I have to say Memento does it better and within context too. Reversing the movie from the end to the beginning firstly contradicts the movie title's Irreversible. Although the title implies that what happens to the characters at the beginning of the movie will make them unable to go back to their 'innocent' days, it undermines the characterizations of the people. Specially when it comes down to the character of Alex.
We see her getting violated first before we learn who she is. Therefore one can't symphatize more with her character or understand the implications of rape, to the baby she's carrying (which we didn't know until almost at the end of the movie). I think the long rape scene would've been excruciatingly painful for the audience if we had gotten to know Alex better.The only character I pity most is Pierre, because he had to take the burden of killing the wrong person when Marcus almost got raped in the gay club.",Irreversible
149,dfwforeignbuff,A sad drepressingly horrific violent film which I LOVED,10,23 March 2014,"ebert ""this film defies a coherent defense"" Irreversible 2002 Several reviewers declared it one of the most disturbing and controversial films of 2002. The film employs non-linear narrative. .Gaspar Noe tells us the story about love and revenge-a pregnant young woman(outstanding Monica Bellucci)is violently raped and tortured in the underground passage.Her boyfriend(Vincent Cassel) desperately tries to find her rapist to kill him.The infamous Monica Bellucci's anal rape scene is truly brutal and sickening,but at least the film can't be accused of trivializing or glamorizing rape or trying to make violent rape erotic,something many mainstream are guilty of. Interesting movie. Powerful Move. This movie is an assault on your senses. There is a lot of violence and there are are very graphic shocking scenes in this move. The first 15-20 minutes of the film with the spinning camera was a bore. I did not care for the story told backwards. I enjoyed a lot a similar told movie Memento, it was very inventive. This film did not do much for me first time around.. Too much violence and homophobia. This film contains nudity, raw language, extreme violence and a graphic depiction of rape, and male frontal nudity. I applaud the director and producers braveness, it is a powerful movie but I did not particularly care for it. This film strikes a particularly homophobic pose. I agree with another critic ""this film defies a coherent defense"" Watch this film at your own risk. I have since seen this movie a couple times and have changed my opinion from not recommended to recommended. if you can get past the dizzy handle held camera work and you have a open mind about film you might should watch. everyone else stay away after 3 viewings I think I now understand the film makers point of view and its very f**ke*d u** this film is a shocker and really set some new boundaries about what can be in a film and how a film should be constructed. When people were streaming from the theaters 20 minutes into the film I think Noe knew he had succeed for what he wanted to do. I have watched very film he has made. 4 stars.",Irreversible

151,christophaskell,Needs to be viewed more than once,9,14 September 2003,"This is a solid film. Borderline fantastic. Once the hype has died down and future generations watch this movie, they will, hopefully, be able to see this film for what it is and not what it's become. Noe presents us with the idea that time destroys all things. Even though the word destroy is tossed casually around in conversation, the definition of the word is very powerful. If the phrase had been time humbly defeats all things, we would have had a different film. But time destroys all things, and it destroys these people. The graphic content was not the point of the film, and I did not find it pretentious. We watched two people who loved each other and found comfort with each other, and then we watched as they were destroyed, except in reverse. Watching the film in reverse was, I think, the only way this story could have been told. Witnessing their destruction before we got emotionally attached to them, and then becoming emotionally attached to them knowing what they did not had a powerful effect on the viewer. Look past the rape scene and you will see an amazing film by a relatively new director. The future couldn't be brighter for this young talent. Rating: 35/40",Irreversible

153,hikerhetav,This is a film 'not to' enjoy...,7,22 February 2016,"Way beyond three years, when I started my journey into the films my all time urge was to see a film that disturbs me. I have seen pretty decent films which create chaotic, heart breaking, and brain tearing thoughts in our minds. But I was always in search of a film which returns a terrific message as a gift. Irreversible, as the name stares in front of us, it really becomes gloomy and more soul wrenching while it helps us dissolve into it. Gaspar Noe, is a director who can capture the moments which stays with a viewer even after a long time of finishing of the film. The cinematography, camera work, frame settling and each other technical aspect handled by director are well driven. All these moments help the patrons build up their nervous veins more tense and more shivering to welcome each delivered scene. This was the film where with all naked mind, I couldn't find any flaws or technical mistakes. The characters are well equipped with their techniques and an art to act. Their chemistry is too strong and the relation they maintain is top notch. The greatest viewpoint of the film is how much can a moviegoer accept whatever the director attempts to display. The film tries to show all of the raw materials around from which any spectator tries to learn deep message it delivers. But certainly, the message rests still with soul, while this is a film not to enjoy!",Irreversible
154,missraze,Meh,6,19 November 2016,"First thing I see in the user reviews is: ""One of the most disturbing and confronting movies ever made.""Nope. Not even close, get out more. Let me just say to get this out the way that I sought this type of movie out because I want to see depraved stuff. However depraved it was, putting that aside, how well was the movie made? Not well, to be honest.For starters, this film is shot to show reverse sequence, showing the ending first, and then the next to last scene, and then its prior scene, and so on, till the ""beginning"" of the film is shown at the end of our viewing. Backwards. Which is...interesting, if there were plot twists where this retroactive method would be necessary. However all this film did was spoil itself by putting the juicy parts first. It's like watching a porn. How many people do you think would (want to) stay to watch the final acting scene if all the XXX stuff just showed already??? Putting being wowed (disturbed and confused) and slightly aroused aside, I'm sure there are many people who feel this way. It's almost as if whoever came up with this idea knew that the content of the film is generic at best and its performances as well; so they decided to make it seem much deeper and creative than it truly is by simply editing the scenes in reverse order like ""that should do it, that should win them over!"" (slow clap). But if that impresses you then OK.But even in the reverse order do many viewers including myself not care or understand the purpose of any of the deviance mentioned and shown. It's not the deviance that's upsetting, it's the pointlessness of it due to the hollow and vapid plot and script, and the contrived backwards-scenario method, which is clearly damage control for total boredom, that annoys me. The film in a nutshell is: stupid racist homophobic man searches in a rage for the man who raped his girlfriend after she left a party mad at him for being a cokehead. That is literally it. But not only do the opening scenes of him saying racist stuff and doing violent things on a rampage looking for the rapist before the rape was even shown not make me feel bad for him at all, but the scene of him crying when he discovers his battered girlfriend for some reason being shown afterwards, with me remembering the kind of jackal he was just shown to be beforehand, fail to compel me. So the movie becomes more and more pointless no matter which bloody direction it goes in. Either way he's a jackal. Sure his slue of racist and violent attacks while shown first happened after the rape, but still. Perhaps he's an anti-hero because he no matter which order the film goes in is against people who frivolously commit sexual bestiality. I would applaud the director for putting forth that potential message if it weren't for he himself frivolously showing sexual bestiality. Now I don't know what to do with this film. I don't mind violence and I'm starting to think I don't mind sexual bestiality either, but when you toss it in a film hoping to make it better like croutons in a salad with no chicken and any other toppings, it doesn't wash.The main credit to this film is the order in which it was shown, and the seedy, cutting edge nature and nocturnal landscape of Parisian slums, but its empty plot and script, and terrible people played by okay actors spoil the cinematographic technique to waste. So for that I'll never be watching this again. Once the hopefully above 18 yr old viewer catches on how the film is being shot after 20 minutes, and then after the rape literally lasts 10 more minutes, it doesn't take a wild guess to know you're gonna sit through the remaining 45 minutes of less exciting scenes. There was no mystery. The filming technique only made the baseless plot a mystery. Never mind how pointless and anti-climactic everything was. It's almost as if the suddenly tamed direction the film took after the gay club and rape was an apology for it.A film is exciting because of what exciting thing is about to probably happen, and when and how will the movie get to it...not because of what already happened with only boring things to come. It's like driving backwards down your garage driveway without a seatbelt and your sideview mirrors closed: it was exciting in the beginning but now it's just plain stupid. But if that's your kinda thrill go for it.I would have liked to know how the main actor found his girlfriend's rapist, if he did. Not knowing immediately that he did find him. However, watching this film I felt lost in this demented, trippy nightmare (which isn't bad, that's my thing). But it's not nightmarish because of the gay sex and violent rapes. It's because the director keeps spinning the damn camera while it's pointed at the ceiling. Sure make me dizzy, meanwhile in the 1st 5 minutes I'm forced to wonder who the guy in the underground sex club even is, what his problem is, who is this La Tenia he's looking for, why he's looking for him/her, and why the hell is he where he is while he's looking, and when the freak is Monica Belluci gonna show up.",Irreversible

The end of each scene is followed by the beginning of the scene before till we reach what would normally be the first scene.This film is disturbing there is no doubt about it, two scenes are shocking and highly uneasy to watch and I admit I fast forwarded the rape scene when she started getting beaten up and I was slightly disturbed by the scene in the gay club.Despite the shocking scenes this films was very well shot and used interesting cinematic techniques.

156,dixxjamm,Soulless and pointless cinematic experiment,3,31 March 2010,"I know that it is a faux-pas to ask an artist to justify or explain his works, but I think this one makes you wonder if maybe Gaspar Noe doesn't have some explaining to do.The events shown in the movie as such are not over the top.Rape does happen,retaliation does happen,lunacy does happen,extreme cruelty and urban filth sceneries like in the movie do exist.Nothing wrong with that.Comparisons with other cringe-inducing movies are inevitable,Straw Dogs,Deliverence,Cruising come to mind.However,none of those were...well...so damn ""artsy"".Those movies and others like it had a human and real vibe to them, regardless how twisted they were.In this one, you get the feeling that you're dealing with a humorless Quentin Tarantino. You realize that you're dealing with a twisted artistic experiment, but to what purpose ? To gross you out ? Check. To induce nausea ? Check. To feel horror ? Check. Well, I could achieve all that by smashing my face against a wall and then look in the mirror.Judging by the amount of gore in the movie, you may ask yourself if maybe this isn't Gaspar Noe's way to let us experience his fictional self-mutilation. Leaving one scene in the middle of the movie and the very last one aside, there is non-stop violence that would probably be more appropriate for a snuff movie. What the hell is the point of scenes where a man's face and skull are crushed like a melon with a fire hydrant or one of an extremely long depiction of a brutal rape and beating ? Where is the point ? If I'm going to stand being grossed out by a movie, I want a reason. I want to know where the director's feelings are. Irreversible doesn't seem to shed light on any of that, it just purposely shocks you. The reverse chronological order, the sound effects and the hand-held camera stuff may be interesting but so are my hangovers in the morning. In the end (actually the beginning), you find out that all was great and all is lost now. Not really a discovery and not really food for thought, not to mention feeling kinda numb.In conclusion, this may be a unique and interesting line in Gaspar Noe's, Cassel's and Belucci's resume, but so is a certain underpaid and back-breaking employment in mine. I'd rather deal with my own demons rather than some artist's experimental gore and fetish, if that's all there is to it.And as far as I'm concerned, it is just that. Unless of course you're pervert enough to want to watch Monica Belucci being raped for 11 minutes, which, when I come to think of it, may have purposely been just the right thing to promote this pretentious and artsy flick.",Irreversible

Beneath the endless violence and rape, there is actually a strong anti-violence message; you just have to have a strong enough stomach to sit the whole way through it and try to understand it. Despite what many of its critics say, the violence is not gratuitous or pornographic. Why is it that when a filmmaker shows the hard reality of what violence really is, they are demonized, but when brainless PG-13 action movies dumb it down to make it look ""cool"", nobody has any problem with it? Irreversible is simply showing violence that happens every day, and the lives it destroys. It is something that hardly anybody wants to think about, but it's something this film makes us think about strongly. This film is hard to forget, and if you have a strong stomach and an open mind, I give it my highest recommendation.",Irreversible

161,fred3f,At times brilliant and at times sophomoric but always depressing,1,5 February 2005,"The film and its plot have been described and extolled by other readers. Most of what is said is true, but I would attach a different view to many of the things this director does. The director is obviously trying to be innovative, and in many ways what he does works. Probably his best innovation (well, it has been done before, but not often)is to tell the story backwards. This has the effect of making you think about the things that led up to the rather horrible ending (which you see in the beginning). If he had told it in the usual way you would have been shocked by the ending and walked out wondering why it is such a downer but not considered the causes. There are other effects, such as moving the camera around in a very jerky way. This does give a disorienting and confused effect which is probably what the director wanted, but it also makes you feel a bit sea sick and there are times it is very difficult to follow what is happening on the screen, which is not what the director wanted.All and all, the theme of the movie is a depressing one. It is on a par with ""life sucks and then you die"" or more like ""life may be good for a bit but eventually the evil comes out in all of us and it destroys us."" Some people like depressing things and if you are one of those people, then I recommend this movie. I am not one of those people and I sincerely disagree with this view of life, so I didn't like it.",Irreversible
162,Strider_1978,The Horror,10,16 February 2011,"There are films out there that attempt notoriety with a big 'unrated' stamp on the front of the sleeve. There are films with infamous reps such as the 'Saw' and 'Hostel' franchise. There are critics who view these films of notorious infamy and rattle on about obscenity and controversy and all things nasty. When those films have had milk and cookies and gone out for some winks, Irriversable comes out to play. The difference between Irriversable and other theatrical films is quite simply that it has an utterly 'real' feel. As dizzying and mind bending as it is through Director Gasper Noe's miraculous camera work as it is, this feature length picture does not clean, polish, tweak or enhance. What we have, is a gritty, nasty, dark, sweaty, vile, and yet utterly authentic work of art. Lee Daniels 'Precious' taps into a similar aesthetic, not compromising or holding back, not shying away from what we all like to pretend does not exist. After the rape and beating of his woman - Belluci, Marcus- Cassell goes on the rampage. There is no over acting, suspension of disbelief or melodrama. The pulse is pounding as chaos and insanity rain down upon the viewer. The camera rotates and turns, sometimes mercifully blurring the screen, sometimes exposing closed door debauchery. I have seen few films out there that expose, but not exploit this level of violence and human madness. The first twenty minutes are grim and terrible, also nauseating and horrifying, yet they bear a significance that can only be realised as the film takes us back in time, quite literally as the story unfolds from end to beginning. In truth I cannot recommend Irriversable to anyone, as I would 'Precious' that uplifts in between grueling intervals of domestic abuse. One thing is certain and IMPORTANT. We all consider revenge and retribution in return for acts of disrespect, large and small and in our minds eye we act out these dark fantasies. Irriversable is here to tell us, and in fact show us just how acts of vengeance can tear the soul apart.Be warned. Unlike Kubric's masterful 'Clockwork' Orange that knows when to stop, or take us away from the 'ultra violence', Noe's 'Irriversable' keeps us there. In the dark red room where developing photographs appear before us in the liquid, shocking and terrible.. and keeps them in that water, taking them away only to give us the next one.One of the most important films in cinematic history.",Irreversible

Which is something to be thankful for for a change.This film is great. Its not the most original idea to run the narrative in reverse. Even though some people think it is (even an episode of Seinfeld did it). But its how its pulled off. There's still a twist at the end or the beginning.This film is powerful and shocking and brilliant. With moments of sheer ultra violence. Hopefully Hollywood don't try and remake this.Absolutely brilliant. I do have to wonder though, would it be so great if it wasn't in reverse order...",Irreversible
164,GrigoryGirl,"Overrated shock value, devoid of any real art, and not a particularly good film...",3,9 March 2008,"This film is ugly, brutal, depressing, visceral, and hopeless. The first time I saw it, I was devastated. I reeled for days afterwards. But seeing it a 2nd time, I didn't care for it as much, in fact, I feel I've been had. Its impact is really felt the first time you see it, because seeing it the 2nd time, you realise a lot of things about it that aren't particularly good. Most of the dialogue is poor (most of it was improvised, and not very well), the violence of the film is purposely over the top, and Noe the director seems to delight in showing nasty stuff without really bringing a sense of art to it. He enjoys rubbing your face in the sleazy, horrific violence, but has no purpose other than saying ""life is brutal"". I can't deny that the film did have a great impact upon first viewing, but too often when one's sense are assaulted (like they are here), you can mistake that for great, artistic film-making. Technically, the film is astounding. It was shot mostly in long takes, but edited together with CGI effects (the smashing of the head in the gay bar at the beginning was done digitally, as part of the rape scene). It's definitely a curiosity, but realise what you're getting into. It's really not for the squeamish. The opening scene in the gay bar is dizzying and brutal, and the rape scene is beyond brutal. Noe films the rape scene in one take, which makes it even more difficult to watch. Is the film art? No, it isn't. Simply because the film polarized audiences doesn't make it art (a common assumption by people). Noe's films (he's only complete 2 features) aren't really deep or anything, just pessimistic and brutal.A telling episode about Noe happened a year or so ago. The IFC Theater in NYC has a feature they do occasionally. They bring in a filmmaker to introduce a film they admire. Noe showed his first film, I Stand Alone, and Pasolini's Salo. After Noe's film concluded, he talked to the audience on why he wanted to show Salo. All he talked about was the coprophilia scenes (aka the s**t eating scenes). He didn't talk about anything else that Salo had to offer (in terms of its message on fascism, sexual perversion, the cinematography, the production design). Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom is actually an excellent film. It's incredibly depressing and brutal, but has a real sense of art and is a genuinely controversial film, even to this day. Noe's films (he's made only 2) are not like this at all. Both I Stand Alone and Irreversible hit you in the face the first time you see them, but you shake it off, and Noe has nothing more to give you. This film has no resonance at all. It's just for shock value.",Irreversible
165,Felonious-Punk,"One of the most revolutionary movies, in technique and in intent",5,26 April 2010,"Marcus and Alex are a French couple. Marcus often enjoys trying new things. Alex is outgoing and likes to dance and talk with her girlfriends. One night, the couple teams up with Alex's ex for a night of conversation and partying that, unfortunately, ends up hellishly life-changing for all three.A simple enough story, but what makes the film genius is the combined vision of script, direction, acting, editing and soundtrack. Cinematic magnificence abounds as the story line moves backwards, the score throbs with inescapable doom, the camera moves like a mosquito, or a ghost, or like the sight of someone who is nauseous and on the verge of fainting.Yes, some viewers may wish Noé had chosen subjects not so displeasing as assault and battery, rape, murder, infidelity, and revenge. I know I had that wish while watching. ""Why couldn't Noé have used the same technique to tell a sweet, life-affirming love story, or something with elves and sprites and a magical forest? Anything but this gruesomeness?!"" But Noé seems to be in a bleak place, spiritually, and his only way out, is to search for meaning and to portray it on film, which he does masterfully. What is commendable about this movie is that he didn't flinch from portraying his nightmare, he didn't stop and say, ""Well, maybe this is too much for viewers. This hasn't been done before, so maybe I shouldn't do it either."" You see, we have movies coming out everyday which are made for us to escape into so that we can feel good about ourselves. And thus life stays fairly status quo, never with hopes of progressing. But with his intention for making this movie, Noe is at his most interesting. It is as if he is trying to destroy cinema as a means of escape. To wrest cinema from ""feel good"" ""popcorn flicks"", and to reclaim it as a means to wake us up. To use it to hold up a mirror to our bleakest, most hopeless side. And show us the dead-end that self-centeredness leads to. That's why it's so good and should be seen or at least attempted to be seen, because he uses his novel, disorienting techniques for a cause higher than just a momentary thrill. He uses it to appeal to elevate the human conversation. He shares with us his hard-earned philosophy. He shows us his desperation. And he shares with us his truth, without ever once preaching at us, without ever once spelling out a particular action to take, or a particular way to be. In fact, there may not be one definitive moral to take from it, but after such a harrowing journey as the writer- director takes us on, we are left scrambling to find or make one that will free us from the movie's infernal grasp.",Irreversible

After having seen ""Memento"", which is in fact new and full of meanings, ""Irreversible""seems to be only an unsuccessful effort to give something interesting to a very banal and uninteresting story. Lighting is rather flat, long-take shots are often boring, especially if you have seen such films as ""Khrustalev,mashinu!""(A.German)or ""The days of eclipse""(A.Sokurov).

I suppose there's some people out there in screen land who think it's revolutionary and cutting edge, but it isn't.

Where did they vanish to? Why did they bother? The unconvincing Brazilian trans hooker showing the meat and two veg under threat of a slashing. Quel surprise! Tres avant garde mon cher.The supposedly horrific violence is tame in comparison to the more graphic Asian gangster and horror movies, and anyone familiar with Takashi Miike would know that Yakuza bad guys anally rape everyone, male or female, as a form of friendly greeting.Irreversible is a relentless parade of tired clichés, ham acting, and effete direction. Shame I couldn't un-watch it. That's 100 minutes of my life I'll never get back.

168,johnnysugar,Horrifically beautiful,10,14 April 2003,"(WARNING: This review contains plot spoilers necessary for a thorough and even analysis, although given the structure of the film, what a spoiler is defined as becomes murky.)A shocking, bewildering and horrifically beautiful movie, Gaspar Noe's ""Irreversible"" is a meditation on humanity, evil, and the all-consuming forces of time and primal desire.  While the film has received much publicity for its depiction of sex and violence, it overshadows a brave and profound film headed by some of France's most potent actors.After having a fight with her boyfriend Marcus (Vincent Cassel), the beautiful Alex (Monica Bellucci) leaves a party, taking a short cut through an underground tunnel.  In the tunnel she is brutally raped and beaten into a coma by a man called Le Tenia (Jo Prestia).  Marcus and Alex's ex-lover Pierre (Albert Dupontel) track down her assailant to punish him, eventually coming across a gay sex club, where they beat a man's face into a smashed and bloody pulp.The film is told in reverse.  We first see Marcus and Pierre's revenge, Marcus overtaken with violent rage and Pierre resisting the feeling.  The film goes backwards in time, showing more pleasant scenes that give a grave foreshadowing and a deep inevitablity to events that will take place, events the audience has already been privy to.  Even the camera calms down as the film goes backwards.  In the sex club, the camera refuses to focus on any scene for more than a few seconds, spinning chaotically.  By the last scenes, the camera is languid and calm.Bellucci gives an amazingly brave performance as Alex, a woman unaware of the depths of human nature until she is faced with them head-on.  Cassel is also wonderful as a man who is equally unaware but all too eager to descend into bestial urge.  The dialogue seems almost entirely improvised, and it lends the film a realistic quality that it may otherwise have lacked.  Music and set are used judiciously, with neither aspect distracting us from the performances of the actors or adding unnecessary flourishes.This film is not for everyone.  Rape and its aftermath, including revenge fantasies that accompany it, have become stylized and glorified in cinema, especially in America.  Alex's assault and the retaliation in the club are not something out of a made-for-TV movie: they are brutally honest, shockingly real depictions not for the feint of heart.  Those with delicate sensibilities will find little to enjoy there.  However, anyone brave enough to attend this film (and to sit through the minute of strobe light that accompanies the end), will be rewarded with a searingly visionary depiction of the darkness found in the human soul and the destructive power of the base forces that govern the world.  10 out of 10.",Irreversible
169,kidwltm,Over Hyped,7,9 August 2003,"Seriously, the rape scene and nightclub beating aren't that shocking.  There has been worse in movies before.  Not much worse, but it's not like violence is a new thing to movies.  My problem is with Noe's blatant shock tactics. I understand he uses it to present us with a clear message of how horrible rape is, but it is my opinion that shock tactics is the last resort of a filmmaker.  A film's message shouldn't have to be shoved in our face.  It should come from your characters and its effects on their life.  Noe doesn't know how to transcend his message in such an artful matter, so he puts in some graphic violence instead.  There is nothing wrong with ultra violence per say, but with it's use, and I think here it is a result of Noe not knowing how else to get his point across.  Also, the novelty effect of doing it backwards is pointless.  If anything, it makes the movie worse.  It makes us hate Marcus instead of feel sorry for him, and it makes the rape scene much less powerful.  Would have been better to just do it chronologically, so we might care that Alex gets raped.  That said, the dramatic scenes were alright.  Don't look for amazing dialogue, but the acting and directing are enough to make you feel sad, knowing what will happen to them (still think those emotions would have been amplified with events in sequence).  Vincent Cassel was the performance that really impressed me.  Just raw and uninhibited, but handles the more dramatic stuff nicely as well.  As big of a fan as I am of Ms. Bellucci, so doesn't really have much to do here.   The camerawork is solid in the second half.  It goes the typical `indie' route, doing the hand held style to make it more realistic, and as cliché as that is, Noe does express talent with the camera.  It does get annoying for the first 30 minutes when he can't keep it still for more than 2 seconds, but he thankfully rectifies this.  Ultimately, Noe simply didn't have the talent to get his point across without resorting to gratuitous violence.   It does make the movie interesting, and at the very least entertaining.  Cassel gives a great performance, and there is some good cinematography in the second half, but it's just not written well enough to be the great movie some claim.6.5/10* * ½ / * * * *",Irreversible

But by definition the beginning is the climax, so I was left wondering ""is that all?"" at the end. Alex and Marcus are the typical urban youth busy consuming life. I wish more effort had been spent on developing the character of Pierre. The director seems anal-obsessed, literally speaking.Too much of the reel is consumed in sexual display.

What's with the rating then? It's not because this is an intense drama, it's supposed to be good. Irreversible is a movie about a rape occasion that's starts a whole mess. The main message of the movie is to show us that sometimes that's nothing else than vengeance for a solution. But this movie is very uninteresting.Since the movie is told backwards, we feel really bothered by it after a couple of scenes. What was supposed to be a story told normally, developing the climax of the movie to the end, is actually a story which shows us the climax in the beginning and then shows us what really happened before that. There's simply nothing wrong with that at all, but the main problem with Irreversible is that there are not much interesting things to find out, after you realize what is it about.Examples: the only actually good information we can come up with is that Alex and Pierre were once together. Their sex wasn't really good, or at least not as it should be, Marcus taking drugs and at the very end of the movie, Alex's pregnancy. Not much else.This was really well directed. Performances by Belluci and Cassel are simply terrific. But if this movie really intended to keep us in the edge of our seat the whole duration of it, the rating would definitely be a little higher.

Noe's camerawork is some of the best I've ever seen in a feature. Noe brings you straight into the action. The first half hour is shown at such a frantic, obsessive pace. The music is filled with anger and an impending sense of doom. As anyone who followed this movie knows, half the crowd at Cannes walked out after the screening started. I was further intrigued when I saw Monica Belucci defending the film while doing press for Tears of the Sun, saying ""It is a difficult film to watch, but its important."" The film really isn't all too violent, you're just assaulted with such graphic brutality at the beginning. If you can get past all the violence in the beginning, you should be fine. There is an amazing flow to this movie. A lot of the scenes are all one-take, one shot. Dialogue is entirely improvised. There was no shooting script. It's refreshing to see a film where you don't have a cut everytime a different character speaks. In other films, jumping coverage shots of each character in scene can take you out of the movie. The segues from scene-to-scene are ingenious. Noe keeps the music going throught the segues. This helps the film flow so well, it feels as if you're watching it almost in real-time. Great performances are turned on by Belluci and Cassels. You feel more empathetic for them as the movie goes on. A strong soundtrack also helps drive the narrative. The end shot is one of the most beautiful I've seen in a film in a long time. A must-see for all movie fans. A landmark in innovation and a gem of cinema.",Irreversible

177,kmberger,More than just shock value.,8,22 February 2005,"Most people who seek out this movie do so for its legendary nine-minute, brutal, graphic rape scene. They're either drawn to it by some need to see this infamous scene, or repulsed by the fact that it even exists. If that's all you see here, you're missing a finely crafted, very challenging film that has a lot to say about fate, destiny, and the course of our everyday lives.Irreversible is a story told backwards, using this gimmick as a path to its ultimate theme: if you knew the future was bleak and horrible, would you still want to see it? After a brief prologue that sets up this theme (""Les temps detoured tout"" - Time destroys everything), we see nothing but chaos. The camera-work is dizzying and disorienting, the dialogue is shouted and overlapping, the cuts quick and blinding. Ten minutes later, a vicious act of retribution on a rapist occurs. Shortly after that, the actual crime is seen - the rape of Alex (Monica Bellucci) at the hands of a total stranger. Both of these heinous acts are filmed without the jump-cuts and off-kilter perspectives - we see them with sickening clarity.That's the future (or the present). The rest of the film establishes the three main characters - Alex, her boyfriend Marcus (Vincent Cassel) and her ex-lover Pierre (Albert Dupontel) in happier times as they head to town for a party. Each scene takes a step back - not only in chronological time, but in thematic distance from the chaos and violence of the early part of the film. We see these three tease and joke about sex and relationships, even with that dark shadow of the known future echoing behind every simple touch or every spoken word.But the film is brightening as it goes backwards, reinforcing the theme that time does destroy everything (as the future becomes the past), but also that even the worst horrors can never truly overshadow a happy past. Bellucci and Cassell (real life husband and wife) have a perfect on-screen chemistry, one that's shown with more than dialogue or action; it's evident in their comfort with one another.By the time the film ends, director Gaspar Noe has shown you the depths of human depravity, but he's also rewarded you with a sense of optimism that you may never have guessed was coming. He carefully constructs a film built on horrible realities and open-ended possibilities. He's clever enough to unfold his story in such a way that we know the ending, but still can feel good about the beginnings.For those who think this is a film intended for shock alone, they might be surprised at its depth. It's definitely not for everyone - not by a longshot - but there's more here than meets the eye.",Irreversible

Looks more like a mild porno film to me, with conspicuous efforts to flash out human genitals (Think we saw those of about 10 people throughout the 1.5 hour?). Telling the story in a complacent effort of a reversed chronology does not help at all. Instead, this has led to one very major anti-climax in movie history and as the story unfolded itself to tell what happened before and before, I got more and more bored and less and less eager to know, thanks to the prior confession of it all right in the beginning and the middle of the movie that has sucked up pretty much all the mystery and hype.",Irreversible
179,BloedEnMelk,"A true piece of art. Daring, controversial and confrontational.",10,13 April 2011,"Irréversible is not an easy movie. This movie is (in)famous for it's violence. The rape scene is truly unforgettable in it's horror, and also the scene in the gay bar is far from pleasant to watch. But it is not the sensational type of movie violence, it definitely serves a purpose.First of all, the gruesome rape scene. Rape is one of the most horrible things a person can experience. Watching the ten minutes Noe uses to show the real face of rape is still nothing compared to the real thing. But Noe does an admirable job in shocking us all, confronting the viewer on a brutal way with the horrors Alex has to go through. Not only that, he makes completely clear how she is dehumanized by her attacker, who ventilates his anger and frustrations towards 'beautiful women' by destroying both her soul and body. But honestly, I think that he is not the only one treating her as an object. Even though both Marcus and Pierre do mean well, they both have a selfish streak when it comes to Alex. The highlight in this, how diabolic this may sound, is the revenge Marcus wants to take. From the moment he sees his girlfriend being carried away in an ambulance, comatose, he focuses on his own emotions, and thus revenge. We can't really blame the guy, but if you look a bit deeper than the surface, what is he really doing for his girlfriend? While his friend Pierre constantly tries to drag him to Alex in the hospital, he doesn't want to hear about anything else than his revenge. When we go a bit further down the story, on the party, Marcus is also totally busy with himself. He never cares about Alex there either, instead he is focused on snorting coke and other women. Pierre again tries to come up for Alex, and asks Marcus to stop being so selfish. After all, why did he take her to a party when all he wants to do is focusing on the attention other women give him? Pierre, at the same time, has his own reasons for being so nice to Alex. Yes, he still loves his ex, but he is also still frustrated by the fact that he couldn't satisfy her sexual needs in the past. There is a long scene in which he tries to find out what Marcus has that he doesn't have. At one point, Alex says: 'It's not the woman who can not come, its the guy who can not f__k' But Pierre hardly listens to her explanation, he is still too much focused on his own frustration.At the party, the main thing Pierre wants to do is watching Alex dance. He is protective towards her, and keeps on calling Marcus 'a primate'. Obviously, he considers himself to be much more than that. But personally, I wonder if he is that much different. Yes, he is protective, yes, he wants to be the savior and yes he wants to go to the hospital. All seemingly very nice things. But at the same time, he doesn't really listen to what she has to say, and he wants her to dance purely for his own pleasure. Now, nothing is wrong with the latter, but in a movie like this, for me it enhances the feeling that Noe keeps on pointing towards the objectification of Alex (women). Like in the opening sequence, the old guy tells about his time in prison for the abuse of his daughter. He sees nothing wrong with it himself, as she was so cute. His friend tells him: 'There are no bad deeds. Only deeds.'Alex tells Marcus at one point. 'I am not an object.'Personally, I think this is the message that Gaspar Noe tries to give to us. I think Irreversible is an incredibly strong movie. The use of violence, the way the camera works, the symbols being used in many small parts of the movie make this film to a true piece of art. No, it's definitely not an easy movie to watch. But for the ones who are strong enough to handle the subject, it is more than worth it.",Irreversible

184,cathcacr,"More interesting to reflect on, than to watch",7,28 March 2004,"-Irreversible- is not a movie that likes to be watched; the director deliberately repulses the audience for 90 minutes, before capping it off with a beautiful avant-garde-style end to accentuate the contrast between ""before"" and ""after.""  And so, it has an odd effect: it is repulsive to the sense, but more satisfying on a reflective level.  That said, I don't intend on watching it again.  As everyone knows, the technical style is as off-putting and hard to stomach as the content.  If this is really as brilliant as all the supporters claim it is, maybe Gaspar can put his brilliance to work creating a work of an integrated beauty, that invites repeat viewings.  With all the presumed hommages to Kubrick therein, maybe he can take some cues from -Barry Lyndon- (or Tarkovsky, if he wants to stick with a more avant-garde approach) . . . .",Irreversible
185,mariammansuryan,A MasterPiece of Cinema,9,25 August 2018,"Wow! I gotta say, there is a hack lot to learn from Gaspar Noe. And I mean this in all aspects of his cinematography. As a young filmmaker, it was very necessary for me to discover Noe, his style, his play with time, his use of color... Except one thing I did not particularly love was the story. Not a bad one, but since he used the time-going-backwards-format, I wished the beginning and the end (or the end and the beginning for that matter) would have a stronger connection.In the beginning, the camera flies around, circles a jailroom where two men are having a conversation about why they are there, and comforting each other on one of them having sex with his own daughter. I mean, you UNDERSTAND not to expect anything moral from this film in the first two minutes after the titles practically. And then suddenly the camera leaves the cell from the window and men are being driven out of a club called Rectus in a devastated state by the ambulance cars. Later it is revealed that the quarrel in Rectus began because the protagonist's girlfriend Alex was raped by someone and he was searching for this man in the club.What happens at the end, is that Alex is laying in the grass, reading a book, as the camera rotates around her and ends up in the sky, showing the irreversibility of the time and how it destroys everything even the purest of creatures. This is connected with the beginning actually, when I think about it now because in the beginning, the two men are sitting in the cell. The time has already destroyed them, and those two men could easily be the protagonists. The film actually rolls from negative to positive I would say because in the beginning everything was nice and dandy. But you don't feel nice and dandy when you see a group of women reading their books tanning under the sun. You know Alex's fate at this point, and the shot, just the fullness of the shot suggests that those other women are also going to be destroyed by the time. Later camera shifts to a group of children and you realize the children's fates are also going to be destroyed by the time. Not to forget - it all starts with a man raping his young daughter...Gaspar Noe's tone: his attitude towards people is very negative. Why show the rape scene in its entirety? It heightens the effect, as though Noe wants to highlight all the disgusting things in life. This is the reason why this review is not 10 star. I love seeing the harsh reality of rape, especially since the camera angle makes you see it from the girl's point of view. I don't really know what's the problem with this... honestly it may just be the taboo in my head, which says dude this is too much! At the same time there are positive moments too in the movie, like when the three people are walking in the metro and talking, discussing life. But even this is about sex. And in life I don't think it's all about sex, I think there are some other more subtle ways to show two people are in love. However I also do realize it's a matter of style whether you want to be as exposing as Noe (I mean, he doesn't even cut the camera! That's highest level of exposing) or as subtle as some other directors where love is shows through details... like in a movie I recently watched - One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.One way or another, there is still a hack LOT to learn from Noe. His camerawork is fascinating. How it flies around time and space without stopping through the entire film. I mean it does cut obviously, but in a highly stylized way that people may not even notice. I always wanted to shoot a film like this, because I think in a way such camera captures the reality of life - we don't experience life in cuts, do we? I'm not saying I don't love montage for example, but this is just something else to try.And the last thing I'll mention in this review which is maybe too long, is Noe's use of color. It's awesome, amazing, killer. I mean he is not afraid. He is a brave director to make the entire underground rape scene all red. And this contrasts with the normal lifelike colors of the metro or the vibrant green of the last scene where women lie on the grass. He is brave to show anything, at times I think though Noe would feel extremely restricted without sex in his movie. But who cares, so would Tarantino without blood, Pasolini without Greek Tragedies, or von Trier without Charlotte Gottesberg. That is not a criterion to evaluate by.",Irreversible

How a beautiful woman like Monica Bellucci was ever involved in this travesty is beyond me, but sure there are (and were) far better roles for her. The rape scene is brutal and really unpleasant to watch, as probably was expected. The backwards story plot works better in Memento and that was a better film on many levels.

188,Elain-ee,Not a strong female lead,7,5 June 2010,"I think it's a pretty cool movie but as a female, I have to say that the rape scene seemed unrealistic and even slightly eroticized - though everything that happens immediately afterwards is very clearly NOT. What's with that? This is the thing that always bugs me about rape in movies: the act itself is not depicted as being as physically and emotionally violent as being kicked or punched in the head. And yet any woman who's been through it would tell you different. Without giving any spoilers away I also want to say that the kind of sexual assault that is depicted in this film is far more consistent with a date rape, so the only thing I felt while watching was frustration with the men who wrote and directed the film. Did they REALLY think that women can be that passive when facing stranger-violence? Experience tells me that we are not. But I will let you, the female viewer, watch it and decide for herself.That's the only comment I think I need to add here, as the movie is very well reviewed by all the other people who have written something about it. If you're a woman, don't be afraid of watching this: you won't be as shocked and horrified as male viewers expect you to be. the Accused is a far more graphic and upsetting film by a factor of 10. Far from being the physical violence, it was the emotional violence and stress in this film which really left an impression on me, and hopefully this is what will stick in your mind long after the opening credits roll (i.e. the end), as it is far more realistic and revealing than any of the action.",Irreversible

190,secretagent_007,"So Irreversible, You Don't Ever Watch It Again",7,30 January 2008,"Gore in movies doesn't bother me. As a fan of horror movies, one knows it's all fake and starts to enjoy the ingenuity behind some of the effects. There is an effect early on in this movie (or near the end, depending on your perspective) that I would have gone back to inspect more closely if only I wasn't so shocked and grossed out by it. It involves a fire extinguisher, a guy's head, and the floor. And I couldn't see where reality ended and film-making began. Starting a movie with that casts a shadow over the rest of it, so you can never tell if you're watching some type of twisted snuff film or not. (IMDB now tells me that the movie includes many digital effects - including Mr. Cave-in-Head. I don't know whether to congratulate the digital artists for their seamless work or scold the director for making it look TOO real.) Irreversible starts at the end of its story and each scene unfolds in reverse order. We start with an act of vengeance, go back to see what inspired that vengeance, and then continue even further back into the characters' lives together. At the beginning, the camera sweeps around wildly, like a garden hose run amok. We're seeing the end of a spiral and the movie moves backwards to show us the point where that spiral began - the camera behaves less frantically with each scene. The fascinating thing is that the point where it all begins is not notable. The catastrophe that occurs at the movie's midpoint, a rape, was not born out of anything except the random meanderings of people on this earth.Before we see the rape happen (in a single, unmoving camera shot that lasts probably 15 minutes) we can piece together what has led the two main characters, Marcus and Pierre, to seek revenge. We see the violence and are shocked. We hear why the violence was committed and we decide that is was just. Then we see the rape. And we realize Marcus and Pierre didn't assault the right man. The director, Gaspar Noe, seems to be saying with this movie that the world is a crazy place where the most outrageous things can happen to a person literally depending on which way they turn at the street corner. One's life can change based on things people have no control over in the first place. I guess it's true, which is depressing. I just really wish Monica Bellucci had been packing pepper spray that night. This movie, infamous for driving people out of the theater, is an experience not meant for the faint-hearted.

193,Tubular_Bell,How much does a movie depend on *how* it's told?,10,15 November 2006,"Whoa, and I thought a creative story was essential in a good movie. Gaspar Noé arrives and proves me wrong, by building this heck of a movie around a simple story we've all heard many times before, in one way or another, but not in the way Irréversible tells us. The most important aspect of the movie is that the camera work that's like the point-of-view of a dizzy insect and the reversed storytelling are not there just to turn a movie into ""arthouse"" with simple gimmicks.Noé puts the movie in a completely inside-out perspective, which is really what makes this movie stand out so much. It's not all about the murder scene or the rape scene: they definitely strike the viewer with full force, but are they REALLY all this movie has to offer? In my humble opinion, judging this movie by how graphic its two highly uncomfortable scenes are doesn't make sense. There's so much more behind it. Of course, there might be nothing, as some reviewers have implied by calling the movie ""pointless"". But just the fact that it has polarised opinions so heavily already shows that, maybe, just maybe, there *is* a point after all, and whatever it is, the movie hit the nail on the head.Technically, the movie is also impressive. With basically no cuts at all (as far as the human eye can see), the movie sucks you into its own world. But the point isn't ""realism"", as you can see how the low-frequency noise was used to manipulate its viewers. The movie proudly proclaims how its there to turn you into its toy, so whether you shut off the movie in disgust or let yourself go depends on you, and no one else. But if you do let go, you ought to give Noé kudos for achieving such a direct, brutal effect by not ""assembling"" the movie out of little pieces, but putting the whole thing right there, before your eyes, so that if you reach out your hand, you might even touch it.I'm highly impressed by the movie, so go ahead: call me an elitist, or a futile snob. Praise the movie, bash the movie, any day I'd rather hear you talk than read the opinions of those who quote the magnificent ""philosophy"" of John Kramer, from the Saw series, that ""those who don't appreciate life don't deserve life"". I tell you, no matter what your opinion is, Irréversible could be a powerful tool in smacking some sense into people like that. It's a necessary movie.",Irreversible
194,Poptart_Psycho,Amazingly Disturbing,7,6 November 2015,"As a fan of the New French Extremity movement with films like Martyrs and Frontiers I thought id give Irreversible a viewing. I wasn't disappointed and Gasper Noe did an amazing job.As a pre warning I can see how this movie at times can be difficult to watch, a 10 minute rape scene involving lead Monica Bellucci was very horrific one of the worst in film history, but this scene is what the film is based around.The movie is great cinematography with the events being told in reverse chronological order So the film begins with a man named Pierre being arrested after he and friend Marcus are seen bashing a 'Le Tenia' head in with a fire extinguisher. With great lighting and intense filming we see these men show erratic behaviour for a while until we hit that scene... The brutal 10 minute rape scene that will shock everyone. From that moment we realise the movie is a bout Marcus wanting revenge for his partner Alex brutal assault and her Ex Pierre citing revenge. From that moment on we see the events leading up to that night including a part scene and regular young group of friend scenes...The ending has a moving scene when we realise Alex that morning had found out she was pregnant.Gasper Noe cleverly showed how time can change a whole lifetime, Alex woke up a happy free young woman with love all around and how over the course of that night everything changed Defiantly hard to watch but great directing",Irreversible
195,bliss66,Remarkable,10,11 October 2002,"This film is full-on in every way imaginable. Without a doubt, this is first and foremost a work of art--not without its failings--that takes the viewer on a sensory journey most will not have thought possible in the medium of film.Irreversible is made up of only twelve scenes that play in reverse chronological order--beginning with an almost incomprehensible scene in an underground gay sex club where the boyfriend of a rape victim (and their mutual friend) seek revenge on the rapist. As the director Gaspar Noe admitted during the Q&A after a screening I attended at London's NFT this evening (where Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel were also in attendance), the style of this opening sequence is such that he could've shown a kitten drinking from a bowl of milk and the viewer would've been equally disturbed.It is, perhaps, the most disorienting sequence I've ever seen in a film and I can only laugh at friends who said the shaky camera work in Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives made them nauseous--most audiences will be very put off by this but it will be their loss.From there the film recounts the previous events of that night and backwards into the day--Noe stated that he made the film in reverse order because it's boring that the majority of films are edited in a linear fashion. He also implied that he felt employing a linear narrative with this subject matter would've been exploitative and overtly manipulative and he's certainly right about that. The first sequence is so harrowing that the viewer dreads the thought of the controversial rape scene. The first shot of Bellucci--bloodied on a stretcher--made my jaw drop to my chest. And still, more dread.Noe is to be admired for his unflinching depiction of rape--as he said, it was the major reason he wanted to make the film, so that people could see. It's clear from the first few minutes of Irreversible that he's not going to pull his punches so at least the viewers can prepare themselves somewhat. I've never had the guts to see Pasolini's Salo but I find it hard to imagine it being more difficult than this.And yet what amazes about Irreversible is Noe's ability to take this very personal narrative and expand it in very subtle ways to take in our larger, equally inhumane society. There are moments in this film, aside from the obvious, that will chill you to the bone. As the film says, ""There are no good or bad deeds. There are just deeds,"" in effect acknowledging that our propensity for both good and evil is what makes us human.Though the rape scene has been written about the most, all of the scenes hold their surprises; my personal favourite was the one on the Metro where Bellucci holds forth on the nature of sex and gender. All of the players in Irreversible risk everything, all the time--in this scene, perhaps, Bellucci risks even more.Though Noe claims that it was not his intention to make a life-affirming film, it seems to be what he was aiming for with the mild contrivances of his conclusion. Given the blister of the opening sequence, it's somewhat unsatisfying that we don't see more of the two men in Alex's (Bellucci) life. I would say it was a minor quibble but it feels very much like a place this film needed to go.Cassel said that he had seen the film twice and that was enough for him, for at least the next ten years. Bellucci said, ""This film...this film...it is about life--and ecstasy! I hope you enjoy it."" I say it's a must see--at least once.",Irreversible
196,naaarfDE,A narrative palindrome,7,3 February 2019,"Gaspar Noé understands like very few other contemporary filmmakers how to create a very uncomfortable pull with his films. In IRRÉVERSIBLE Noé uses a simple technique to create a pseudo-complex feel. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Because using that technique also creates a feeling of ""the worst is behind us"" - even though it is not. It produces the narrative equivalent of a palindrome: IRRÉVERSIBLE always seems to be showing a development getting worse and worse - no matter if you look into the future or the past.While this is an impressive move to pull off, IRRÉVERSIBLE is also cynical af and features unchallenged racism, misogyny, toxic maculinity as well as anti-LGBTQ rhetoric while failing to redeem its victims.

You all know what this is about, but I'd like to add a personal view: This made me think about the time when filmmakers did landmarkfilms they actually wanted to make, and not what the moronic suitsat Fox or Columbia want them to. Remember when Scorsese did Taxi Driver? Or Sam P. did StrawDogs? Even though violence is mentioned in most entertainmentforums, the violence of modern movies is just tame compared towhat Fellini did on Saló or Scorsese did on Driver. And it's notviolence for the sake of it, but for the purpose to explore our soul. Irreversible does that with a hammer, and I love Noé and hismovie for being so human and honest and not pulling the plug.Best regards from Mexico City",Irreversible
198,afdiazr,A brave step in film-making,9,9 November 2004,"Why do people bother to do such disturbing movies? Isn't movies made for the purpose of entertainment? I think that would be a stupid statement to make. Books aren't edited just for entertainment, paintings aren't done for the sole purpose of entertainment, then... why would movies be filmed looking for that goal? I think we can never get used to violence, but movies make it look cool and unrealistic-realistic if that makes sense. Even movie's fake blood will look real to us compared to real blood, which is more like red paint mixed with water. But we would be terrorized if someone would aim a gun at us. We're not getting used to it.Irreversible is a bold statement against rape, but also a great study on primal conduct in an age when things are so calculated and 'civilized'. The fact that the most brain-driven of the two guys (Pierre) is the one that smashes the 'killer's' head, is a clear example of the path that Noé wants to show us. We are violent, even when there's no need for it. Our world is violent, and that violence is not only waiting for us around the corner, but waiting for us from the inside, waiting to burst with all of it's hatred like we never even thought. A dream can be turned into a nightmare in a matter of seconds, due to the most stupid thing we can think of.La Tenia didn't attack Alex because she was so damn sexual and beautiful, but because he hated her and what she represented, and that's the reason behind most crimes. Not money, not sex, but pure hate and a feeling of superiority.Most movies will portray violence as a poetic thing, even the most intelligent ones. Think about Taxi Driver, one of the most crude films ever. It's violence has style and looks cool, although it's not, and it's very real. The same goes for American History X. In Irreversible, violence is not a camera looking for a cool angle in a fight, a la Fight Club, but a smell, a scream, a glimpse of something horrible that is still there when you're so stupid to dare to open your eyes. There's no escape once hell breaks loose, and you can't go to hide under your mother's skirt and wait until it's gone. Nooo, it will go after you like a rabid dog, and you will suffer.Yeah, Irreversible's got two of the most horrific scenes ever depicted in a film, but also one of the most beautiful love moments Alex and Marcus in the bed, sharing spit and words of love, as most of us do when we truly love someone. This movie, for all it's cruel and merciless punches, never makes you say: ""Man, that was cool."" It will leave you feeling ashamed of having the same nature inside you. It's a beautiful film for all the bravery it took to make it.",Irreversible

So, it's up to you if you want to waste your money on that. What a lot of people seem to forget is that Noé has chosen to tell a nightmare. And if you want to approach reality and make an audience feel the pain the main characters are going through, you can't leave out the nasty bits (at least if you want to be convincing). So forget about the hype and don't walk out until the end. Because Irreversible is a haunting story that leaves you shocked, but also challenges you to take a stand and have an own opinion.

201,Dr_Kruger,Irreversible = Incredible,10,5 June 2008,"The first 45 minutes of this film were a movie trip unlike anything I think I've ever witnessed before. It was such a relentless whirl of darkness and rage conveyed superbly by Noe. The no holes barred approach needed for films like this was employed, no half measures can be taken in a film like this and I applaud everyone involved for it's gritty realism. The sound effects and nightmarish camera spinning really make this first part special.It's by far the best I've seen Cassell, he was made to play this angry, vengeful, if slightly unlikeable character of Marcus. I feel the fact that he plays a fairly unlikeable guy works, as you can't help but brush it aside in sympathy for the guy. A goody goody character wouldn't have been as effective if you know what I mean.Because I knew of THAT scene in the film (which I'm sure everyone knows about before they watch it) and due to the structure of the film and the first scene in ""The Rectum"", I was not looking forward to it one bit. When Alex left the club and was told to take the subway my heart was going like the clappers.I was brought down with a sickening bump with what followed.Perhaps the second half of the film will not everyone's cup of tea. After all, this is traditionally what should be in the first half, and some may think ""I know what's going to happen, this is irrelevant"". I think it's very clever indeed and what sets it apart from the similarly structured 'Memento'. To go through all the character introduction knowing and more importantly having seen what 'fate' is going to be handed to them is heart breaking and adds an extra dimension compared to if the film was put chronologically. I'm also glad that Noe used a fairly traditional directorial style for this part. It contrasted from the nightmare we know is ahead and really makes the characters more real.Put simply, Irreversible is Incredible.

202,wittkecmission,"""Le temps détruit tout""",8,2 May 2016,"""Time destroys everything"". So begins and ends Gaspar Noe's scandalous film Irreversible, a film so dark and cruel that most people will find themselves either in tears, rage, or their own vomit when they watch it. Not only is it dark and cruel, it's traumatize, tragic, and shattering all at the same time, not to mention nauseating. And when I say nauseating, I'm referring to the cinematography, particularly in the beginning of the film. The camera swoops around all sorts of Paris streets and buildings in an incoherent and gratuitous manner, as if it were on a roller coaster. Add to that brutal violence, which includes a scene of someone's head getting obliterated with a fire extinguisher and top it all off with a scene in which a women gets pinned down, raped, and beaten for ten minutes while the stationary camera looks on, unflinching. That is the most unwatchable part of the movie. Nobody deserves to suffer like that. It was Monica Bellucci's screaming that made the scene unwatchable. But take away all the unnecessary violence and camera work, and you have a well-crafted, thought-provoking piece of art. I don't think there is any other film that captures the true horror of rape so well. I mentioned in a post before that I cannot recommend this film to most people, especially the faint of heart, due to its extreme content. I would give this film a very high rating if it weren't for its gratuitous violence and nauseating camera work. Because of that, I have to cut it down to an 8/10 RATING.",Irreversible

It is a shocking portrayal of the thin strand which separates us all from normalcy and absolute, utter horror. No one with even a slightly uneasy stomach should even think about seeing this film. It makes Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer, look like a walk in the park with Fido. That said, and I can't believe I am even thinking this, it is a terribly well made look at what passes both for happiness and torture around human existence. It is not gratuitous in the sense that we begin with ruin, and pass, albeit forever changed, to innocence. It is shocking in the depiction of truly terrible violence, toward men, and especially toward women. It is time in reverse. It is damage, it is regret, it is jealousy. It is as well a very clever allowance paid to us, the viewer, to appreciate what we hold in our hands, our hearts, and our lives. It is also undeniably sick and messed up.",Irreversible
204,grindhouse74,This ain't no date movie!,8,24 December 2007,"A lot has been said about this controversial film, some people where shocked and offended, others did not know what to make of it. The bottom line is that it is an experimental film, it uses a basic plot of revenge told backwards, and if you can manage to watch it twice (which i did) it works. It's a raw brutal and challenging film to watch, some people will be put of by the very ugly rape scene, i think that scene upset a lot of viewers, and if people get upset by an extreme act of violence then they will dismiss the movie as trash,(don't listen to them) its a thought provoking film that will shake you to the core, and will linger in your mind, and thats what makes it a stand out from the other so called controversial films. The direction and performances are fine, although you may get a little dizzy with some of the camera work at the start of the movie, its all part of the chaos in which the main characters go through, a true descent of the depravity of human nature in which a random act of violence can change peoples lives and there behaviour forever. If your looking for something with a dark edge and if you can handle extreme cinema then look no further, a difficult film to watch YES but well worth the journey.",Irreversible
205,akuma634,Apparently if a movie is horrible you can play it backwards and everyone loves it,1,9 February 2007,"There just so much hype about how different and artistic this movie is and I ended up buying it. This movie beyond garbage, it doesn't even deserve one star. What you have is a generic rape/revenge movie that does nothing different from movies like Last House On The Left or I Spit On Your Grave. The filmmakers must have watched the finished movie and realized what a pile of crap it was so they decided to start it at the end and then have it end at the beginning of the story so that way it would have a gimmick to please the artsy crowd.It really isn't as brutal as people make it out to be, there is some blood effects and some sound effects but anyone with a camera and some actors can do a better job with it. 95% of the movie is dialogue, there are two scenes that have major impacts on the story, one is early on and the other is later on. So you'll be sitting through a really weak story with characters that you don't have any reason to give a damn about. If you can stay awake through the movie you'll see a very gratuitous rape scene that goes on for what felt like at least 10 minutes, it was nothing more than shock for the sake of shock.In the end there is no message, no meaning, and not a single redeemable quality. I can't think of one positive thing I can say about this movie, the nicest thing I can say is that it isn't the single worst movie I've ever seen, but it still would make my top five. It would be right down there with trash like I Spit On Your Corpse I P**s On Your Grave, May, Night Beast, and Hostel. Even if you found this movie for one dollar I wouldn't suggest buying it, after seeing this movie you'll want your time back. I wouldn't urinate on this movie even if it was on fire.",Irreversible
206,Gigantoscula,Very underwhelming,3,10 December 2020,"This movie couldn't deliver when it comes to the premise. The whole timeline in reverse sketch was done a few times and this one isn't one of the better ones. Trying to put the story together doesn't feel like a puzzle, more like a drag and the characters are annoying. The shock value doesn't even make this movie on par with ""A Serbian film"", which was also mediocre. This felt like an attempt to shock the viewer but failed miserably trying to.

208,mikec32001,Gasper the friendly...?,8,2 February 2003,"There's a tiny scene in this movie that is more chilling than the rape or the murder. During the rape, in the background at the end of the subway, a silhouetted figure appears - an ordinary Pierre on his way from A to B. He pauses, momentarily mesmerised by the scene unfolding before him, then slopes off into the shadows.He'll take the Overpass.This is your choice with this movie. Avoid it but all means (most will), walk out if you must, but consider your options because this is film that forces you to confront your reaction to on-screen violence like no other I have seen. Bar one: At the end of Noe's ""I Stand Alone"", shortly before a scene of shocking violence between father and daughter, a flashing caption appears warning the audience that time is counting down to the impending violence and they really should leave the theatre if they can't handle it. In other words time is about to destroy everything but, if you know the score, you have the choice. You can turn away and take the overpass or you can confront ""it"". It won't be pretty but life is not pretty. At the beginning of ""Irreversible"" an old man confesses to a stranger that he slept with his daughter: ""I can't stop thinking about it...she was so cute..."". The stranger muses on this and attempts to comfort the old man: ""There are no bad deeds, only deeds"".That's right, this film will take you to a very dark place indeed.Gasper Noe is a great film maker and ""Irreversible""  could be his defining work. Outside of all the hype over his confrontational style, the man clearly wants us to walk out of the cinema (at the end of the film, if at all possible) and have an intelligent debate about real violence and our response to it. This is the polar opposite to ""gratuitous"". These are Big Ideas folks! Stick that ""2001"" poster right slap bang in shot one more time Gasper - you and I are on the same wavelength.Yes it's true, the gritty nightmare of the opening scenes are darker and more sweat-inducing than any I have witnessed in contemporary cinema. Really, they are. The breakneck chaos of the mens' search for the Rectum club, the (inky) black humour of the ""she-male"" scene in the alley, the shattering of the (wrong!) head in the gay club (not a big fan of those establishments I gather, Gasper?) and of course the rape of Belluchi - all contrive to nail you to your seat. Unless your're my friend Ben, of course, who shot the hell out of his seat about six minutes into the rape never to be seen again.Yes, these sequences may shock even the most jaded and disensitised 21st Century film-jock out of his torpor. The acting is superb and the camerawork typically (for Noe) unhinged. The ending, like that of ""I Stand Alone"" leaves the audience in some doubt as to whether the nastiness all happened at all. Sometimes we need a mental get-out clause, Gasper obviously does as he's done this ending two films in a row. The final flourish of strobing cuts the movie dead without end credits (we had those at the beginning, of course) and you may, as I did, find yourself stunned, exhausted and rather impressed. Now, whatever your response, try discussing your immediate reaction with your fellow shell-shocked audience member - it often helps to share the experience of being run over by a train.Before he disappeared into his own personal Rectum Club, David Cronenberg had the potential to make a movie like this. Ah, no matter...I wouldn't compel anyone to see this movie but I'd certainly remind them of their choice. I've pitched my flag - I think it's a great movie.",Irreversible
209,kos-27,life is a path from Heaven to Hell,9,14 November 2009,"Irreversible is a movie I have to comment after the difficult Antichrist, because they are often compared to one another due to their level of violence. It makes us wonder how much graphic violence a film needs and whether it is justified or even necessary.For me Irreversible was even more difficult to watch and to endure than Antichrist. Maybe because the violence was so meticulously lifelike. But the movie is exceptionally well conceived and composed - I can almost say that its level of violence is justified.The story line is told in reverse (similar to Memento) starting with the end and going back to the beginning. Irreversible - The title condemns it to alarming finality: you can't undo it, can't change anything anymore because it already happened.The movie begins with an extreme event which is portrayed in an almost unbearable and infernal way. The suspense is increased by every scene leading backwards in the chain of events in order to see what caused it. Sometimes it's more interesting to know the cause of something than the event itself. This cause-and-effect chain is shown like a vicious cycle of violence in reverse: the scenes become calmer and more positive as the movie goes back in time.The strong impression of this movie is amplified by the general knowledge that we are watching something that already happened and not something that has the hope of an uncertain future.It ends with a beginning that is so beautiful and peaceful like Heaven. Like all beginnings or blank canvases: everything is possible. But for those who saw the movie it's clear that it's an illusion because we know what will happen. The movie ends with the sentence: Time destroys everything. We're left alone with this sentence to reflect on what it means in the movie and in general. How can something good lead to something bad? Are all our lives leading from Heaven to Hell?",Irreversible
210,terrazygotes-30881,Brutal Realism,8,18 September 2020,"For me, the importance of this film, is that it shows the sickening reality of violence. So many movies, especially American ones, have people being killed left and right, but the violence is very unrealistic, with little consequence to the characters. The violence here is gritty, brutal and sickening just like my experience of real, close-up and personal violence. There is no concern for the feelings or well-being of others just a savage, out of control bloodlust and desire for destruction. The seedy sexual situations, make the brutality all the more repulsive.",Irreversible
211,Carl_Tait,Worthwhile but too often tedious,7,9 September 2006,"Why did so many people have trouble following this movie? Once you realize that the scenes are in reverse order -- which should become apparent early in the film -- the narrative is quite simple. And this is actually one of the film's weaknesses.In ""Memento,"" for example, the labyrinthine reversed narrative continually forces the viewer to reinterpret everything seen earlier (later) in the movie. ""5x2"" provides increasing psychological depth and poignance as the story of the two lovers moves towards its conclusion (beginning). But with ""Irreversible,"" it's just ... well, backwards. The relatively peaceful scenes following the rape are, for the most part, tedious and dull and overlong. The big ""surprise"" near the end is a wet firecracker compared to several of the powerful scenes in the first part of the film.It is these earlier scenes from which ""Irreversible"" has surely gained its accolades, and much of this praise is well deserved. Both the rape and (especially) the attack with the fire extinguisher are truly horrifying -- and that's a good thing. Rarely has the repellence of brutal acts like these been caught so vividly on film.The spinning, meandering camera-work and monotonous thudding soundtrack are less successful, however. The techniques themselves are interesting and effective at first, but the viewer's initial sense of disorientation and unease soon turns to simple irritation as the sight and sound gimmicks overstay their welcome.""Irreversible"" contains a number of powerful scenes and is well worth seeing for those who can stomach the violence. Just don't come in expecting a brilliant narrative, depth of characterization, or psychological complexity.",Irreversible

Something that happens in very few occasions but something that I chase frequently. Then there are the movies that leave me lukewarm, which are the majority. Then there is Irreversible, which provoked in me something resembling an anti-catharsis. I would never have imagined such a rejection for a movie, such a feeling of dirt. Did the movie want to explore the limits of cinema? He succeeded but at the expense of cinematography. I would encourage anyone to ignore such a bad taste movie. The end is not justified. The means are not such. There is controversy and morbid about this film but it has nothing to do with art, I think.",Irreversible
213,CinemaPat,Brilliant attack on the audience by one of France's most skilled Director,9,20 January 2011,"One of my favorite directors of all time and one of my favorite movies. ""Irreversible"" is an experience unlike any other. Gaspar Noe uses reverse-chronological story telling to give us one of the most visceral and frightening encounters you are ever likely to have in the Cinema. The film is beautifully shot and intensely acted. ""Irreversible"" is Noe's first use of the floating camera technique that he also used in the 2009 film ""Enter The Void"", another roller-coaster of a film. Not surprisingly, this film is not for everyone. It is widely known as one of the most difficult movies to watch due to the graphic violence and long rape scene so be warned. But it is not just a shock film, it has an important message about relationships and how the decisions we make ultimately decide our fate.The story involves a couple played by Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel who after a heated argument split ways for the evening. Alex, played by Bellucci, gets fed up with her boyfriend Marcus (Cassel) and leaves the safety of her friends to go home. A decision we eventually find out is a near fatal one. Marcus finds out that his love has been brutally raped and beaten on her way home. This sends him into a rage of revenge and he will not stop until he finds the one responsible. Along the way Marcus' best friend and Alex's former lover tries to convince him to leave it be so he won't do something he will regret. As you can imagine, he is unsuccessful.""Irreversible"" starts at the end of the story and ends at the beginning, much like the movie ""Memento"" by Christopher Nolan. A decision that could have gone either way. Most people like the reverse story telling, I think it could have gone either way. Gaspar Noe is known to push the limits and make his audience as uncomfortable as he can by graphically presenting topics that are hard to witness and think about. In this outing he decides to hit you with the heaviest scenes in the beginning and middle of the movie then ending with the character development. Thankfully, the third act was designed to slowly bring the audience back from the horror they have just seen. By the end you have (slightly) come to terms with the earlier terror and you are left with an array of emotions.The production team Noe surrounds himself with are some of the best in the business. ""Irreversible"" is a marvel of film making using dreary soundtracks and showcasing the seedy underbelly of France. As mentioned before the use of the floating camera is outstanding; a major challenge since it was filmed using cables suspended in the air. It's as if you are on a ride, one that you want to get off but can't; the ultimate ""fly on the wall"" experience.""Irreversible"" was filmed with a loose script and literally no dialogue. In fact, the infamous rape scene was essentially free-form by Bellucci and La Tenia, the antagonist played by Jo Prestia. Gaspar used one long take from a fixed camera to film this scene which made a huge impact. It caused the viewer to believe they are witnessing an actual rape on camera. It truly is the most difficult scene I have ever witnessed. Many people walked out due to this scene during the premier, cursing the director. Noe, however, loves to get these reactions as it shows his goal to push the boundaries was successful. Cassel and Bellucci have amazing chemistry (it helps they are actually married). Bellucci is as beautiful as ever and Cassel presents an intensity rarely seen from actors. I think having his wife presented with such a horrific experience pushed him further. Pretty much all of the other characters were cast with unknowns or people that haven't acted at all which pushed the realism.It has been over a year since my first viewing of this film and I still think about it. ""Irreversible"" is not a film that can easily be watched over and over and probably shouldn't be. Afterward you feel drained, angry, sad and confused. Confused because you aren't sure whether you just watched one of the worst or best films ever made. If you are up for the challenge, I highly recommend giving this a shot, but be warned it's not for the faint of heart.",Irreversible

215,lawfella,"Shocking and graphic, but not much else",6,29 January 2006,"Some minor spoilers in this review. But the power of this technique-heavy French film, wasted power if you ask me, is in the way it is shot, not in the story.We start with a murder, and proceed backwards in time. Got that? The first scene in the film shows you the end of the story, the next scene shows what happened just before the end, and so on, until the end of the film, when you reach the beginning of the story. Why this odd technique? Who knows.The murder is terrifically violent, brutal and graphic, accompanied by teeth-grating sound effects that truly put the viewer on edge. I guess being able to pull off this kind of emotional manipulation is an accomplishment of sorts, though not one I find especially valuable. In addition to the murder, there is an extraordinarily brutal, and completely unerotic, rape sequence. However politically incorrect it may be to say so, I have found some rapes I have scene in movies to be exciting and erotically charged; this one was just gruesome and cruel, and also way overlong.Underlying all of this is a prosaic tale of a romantic triangle, involving three rather uninteresting people. The girl has thrown over the intelligent, sensitive guy for the animalistic fellow with whom she has more satisfying sex. There is a little bit of exploration of this dynamic, but nothing noteworthy. The rape and murder, which are the film's centerpiece and reason for being, come upon these people strictly by chance, and have nothing at all to do with their interrelationships. The story, in short, lacks coherence. What we have here are segments of shocking violence grafted onto a really dull love story, for no apparent reason.A couple of entertaining touches -- the murder occurs at a gay bar hilariously called ""The Rectum"", for which our protagonists have feverishly searched by screaming out ""Where is the Rectum? Take me to the Rectum!"" to anyone passing by. In the same scene, there is a shamelessly racist but still-hysterical exchange between an Oriental cab driver and his passenger. See this film if you want to feel emotionally brutalized. Don't see much point in seeing it otherwise.",Irreversible
216,nixar55,"Unsettling, to put it mildly",9,29 December 2003,"This is not an easy movie to watch. It is as gritty as they come and will cause a gut reaction in most people. I felt ill and panicked watching the first twenty or so minutes, like I was trapped in another person's nightmare. The swirling camera. The low frequency thrumming. The red. As the story unfolds backwards, it becomes easier to watch physically, but harder to watch emotionally. As the film suggests, time destroys everything, and here it destroys something truly beautiful. This is an emotionally draining film, far from perfect (most of the dialog was improvised) and not completely original. This is a rape-revenge story, with a barebones philosophical statement, but emotionally and visually, it is worth multiple viewings. Life is horrible sometimes, this everyone knows, but maybe sometimes we need to see just how horrible things can get in order to appreciate the life and time we have. This film is also about the futility of revenge, as, if you watch closely in the beginning - Marcus never gets his man. I felt drained after watching this. I also feel this was one of the best movies of 2003. Some people criticize the portrayal of homosexuals in this movie, but I don't think it's some kind of anti-gay agenda. The men in the nightclub, and even the rapist, are gay, but their sex is not about love, it is about power. Rape is not sex, it is violence and a need for power over another living thing. These disgusting aspects of life can reside in anyone regardless of sexual preference, color, or gender. The film in no way suggests that all gay men are like this, just this group of gay men.

There are many elements of this film to consider, style, plot, characters, violence, sex; but the overwhelming theme is love and the lengths man will go to revenge or satisfy his thirst.Irreversible is disturbingly violent and pornographic at times, no doubt shocking American audiences who have never seen such a raw unabashed peek into the acts so brutally depicted by both the protagonist and villain on screen.  It seemed as if the director wanted to first de-synthesize you to the point of numbness, daring you to look away and then taking you on a personal journey through the lives of three individuals as they put their flaws aside and cope with each other and their environment the best they can.  Like a trip to the dentist, the director dispenses with the Novocain and starting drilling!  This film is nothing but original and takes a fairly simple story line and depicts in a very stylish way.  I found myself wanting more at the end of the film but feeling satisfied that I had experienced what was intended.  Recommending Memento as a comparison is not fair to this work  Like Haute Tension, of the horror genre, the director has taken a common plot theme and added his version to include a few shocks and insight along the way.Emotionally draining and ultimately satisfying meal to be savored and discussed but probable seen only once for fear of giving into our own hidden weaknesses.Maddis 8/10.",Irreversible

The only issue is that I now have a movie to review that causes such anger and disgust in me that I can't even bring myself to begin justifying it by describing the plot and discussing the acting. I just want to tell you that I hate it.Irreversible is a film that exploits irrational anger and fear to try and stir it's viewers' emotions. By showing the downfall of two men and a woman from good people to soulless monsters and a victim, Irreversible tries to show how a beast lives in each of us. By telling this story backwards, writer/director Gaspar Noe thinks he makes the film artsy and provocative. It's really just confusing, infuriating, and pointless.And there I go, delving deeper than I want to. This film doesn't deserve an intelligent review. It deserves to be launched to the center of the sun, and quickly forgotten. The same should happen to Gaspar Noe, for only a perverted and twisted mind could invent such a disgusting pile of filth, and we don't need people like that here on Earth. We're fighting to get rid of them every day at home and abroad. Forget about bombing Iraq, we need to invade France and take out Noe.""Irreversible"" is a homophobe's delight of a movie. Basically it suggests that gays will rape our women and, therefore, we must kill them. Of course, since the movie is backwards, we don't learn of this so-called ""justification"" until after we've watched a man be brutally beaten about the head until his skull liquefies. At the end of the day, it makes no sense, and should get the perpetrators executed. Rape is not a justification for murder. It justifies jail time and psychotherapy. But this man has no brain left to have analyzed. And that's perfectly OK with Gaspar Noe.Well screw him.I hate Gaspar Noe. I hate his film. I hate the people who acted in it. I hate that some people are calling this a masterpiece or a work of art. Even I can take a dump and call it art. Irreversible is the cinematic equivalent of that.That right there is 381 words. I still have at least 119 to go. Let's see...If you want to watch a skull-rape of a movie that will leave you 50 IQ points dumber, than watch this film.If you have an irrational fear of gays, than this is right up your alley.If you prefer a film that makes sense, isn't hateful, and doesn't pose as something it isn't (I.E. art) than you can join me in watching, oh, anything else.This review is not informative, I know. But the best information I can give you is this: stay away from ""Irreversible"". Stay away from any other movie this one touches on the store shelf, for it may well have infected them. Do not think about this movie. Do not breathe on this movie. Do not even look at it from across the room. Don't even touch it with a thirty-nine-and-one-half pole. Go punch yourself in the face. You'll learn more from that, and it's way more fun than watching ""Irrversible"".That's 560 words. 560 more than it deserves, and 560 words I'll never get back.

219,mindsclay,Too sicko for me,1,5 September 2009,"I could not make it past the rape scene. That was was way too much to tell a story. It was one shot for what seemed like an eternity of a woman being violently raped in the rectum. This scene comes after a few sequences of a guy looking for a club called the Rectum... obvious in the first bit to be a homosexual club, of which the main character is trying to find because his woman was violently murdered. (and subsequently he also is violently murdered, at the beginning) I am not against any homosexual persons whatsoever, and I gave this movie a chance, but the seen with the woman being anally raped was just way too much. I had to actually shut it off and delete it from my hard drive (it was a purchased download). I am not weak of heart, weak of stomach, prudish or even religious, but that scene just really turned me off for the chance of seeing an actual story. Perhaps something happened later to redeem the movie, but I just couldn't keep watching it. Way too disturbing and violently gratuitous. Besides the ""unsteady camera technique"".

I watched it because of the IMDb rating, I knew nothing about the movie other than it was foreign (and very often they're very good:sadly this one wasn't). The producers and directors have experimented with an approach that has failed miserably. Dizzying/unstable camera-work that makes you nauseous (so I fast- forwarded it to 40 mins) and a story told backwards for no apparent reason other than to appeal to the arty farty and entice people to go and see it. Of course this isn't really the case, because when they show a scene it actually runs forwards, a bit like writing an essay with 10 paragraphs and then ordering them in descending sequence, thus: paragraph 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, however the words and sentences of each paragraph are not reversed otherwise they'd be playing the movie in reverse, though I guess if they did that it wouldn't make any difference for this movie.

Life does suck a lot of the time and no matter what we go through it just may amount to nothing in the end. For the world anyway.  Noe impressed me when I saw I Stand Alone at the TIFF a few years ago and with this follow up he has shot up my list of directors to look out for.  I look forward to seeing his next film.

Monica Belluci's fearless performance should be especially commended; her soon-to-be-infamous rape scene will never be cleansed from my mind's eye, and neither will the matter of fact murder of her rapist, two of the most unflinchingly brutal scenes to which I have ever been witness. These are not spoilers, because they are the beginning of the actual film, though the end, chronologically, of the story. And anyway, there is no way to ""spoil"" this film.

I own the collectors edition of this on DVD and easily recommend it to anyone really into hard hitting films with serious directing and character development the acting is supreme and watching the movie that starts at the end and finishes at the beginning is an incredible journey with Irreversible that keeps you hooked, guessing and shocked at the same time. Great movie a solid 9 from me!",Irreversible
226,Galicius,Spare yourself,2,7 November 2010,"If the film was made in chronological order I would have turned it off when the rape scene started getting long as a something beyond disturbing and why do I have to watch this crap. But the scenes are in reverse order and it's easy enough to figure this out after about twenty minutes. I don't know how I lasted the first twenty minutes of wild camera work and trashy sounds. I suppose we were curious what happens next. What happened next was gory violence beyond limit. Then the rape scene and I should have ended it there but at this point it was with an attitude of ""what the hell, it's only a film"". So we got to the beginning at the end and the only redeeming part of the film the beautiful Monica Bellucci. Would have turned it off if wasn't so upside down. Definitely not recommended. See the last fifteen minutes of the film or so if you must. Spare yourself the rest.",Irreversible
227,jubsdu,"Distorting your thought about films , cinematography and lots of things",7,13 December 2017,"After watching it, I asked myself why I watched it. Because it was full of mental torture with my favorite actress Monica Belucci to be raped and beaten ,even before the movie started. It challenges my viewership thoughts on movies. It distorts my ego of watching good entertaining movies all the time. If you watch this movie , you will know why Monica is considered a great actress from Europe. Graphic violence was the most challenging thing to keep eyes on the movie. Once you have finished watching, you will know the philosophy behind life and time- where one simple luck-denying incident can break all the fortunes into pieces. The movie has nothing about 'art' or 'entertainment'. But, it will give you a new sense of watching movies.",Irreversible

229,BennyM,"No, it is not.",2,14 February 2009,"Masterpiece? Don't make me laugh (though I could use it after seeing this shambolic mess).The good: acting performances. The bad: everything else. Shoddy editing, lousy storytelling, inconsistent style... as an example, the use of the twirling camera sometimes indicates the (unnecessary) reverse-time jump, sometimes (especially in the first half hour) it's just (over)used, ostensibly to disorient the viewer. A grand purpose indeed.Also, with a view to the storyline, there is no way Marcus would even have found out about Alex until the police showed up at his apartment. First, the rape happens a quarter of a mile away from where the party is being held - and in any event closer to the other end of the tunnel, so that's where the paramedics would pick her up. Why would the ambulance be parked right outside? Second, Marcus recognizing Alex is just ridiculous. She's on a stretcher with her clothes covered by a blanket, her face is a bloody balloon that looks nothing like Alex, and he's just snorted God knows how many lines of cocaine. Thus, the whole premise of the ensuing chase goes down the toilet.And no, the reverse storytelling adds absolutely nothing to the story, as opposed to e.g. Pulp Fiction and Memento. This film's sole redeeming feature is the fact that it presents 15 minutes of prime material for rape-fetishists to post and download in their forums.",Irreversible
230,Aaron_West,"Well, where to start?",9,31 May 2014,"Irreversible is a tormenting and brutal reality with absolutely incredible directing, editing and camera-work. The film's events are played in reverse chronological order, with each ""event"" each being one single shot, strung together with a fluid and inventive, if dizzying motion, making the film a continuous stream of visual grunge. The violence in Irreversible is called by many ""too extreme"" or ""unnecessary"", but I believe that it is important that some films delve as deep as Irreversible does into the dark recesses of society, unexplored by ""serious films""; Irreversible is certainly not a snuff film as many may say, like 'Cannibal Holocaust' or 'A Serbian Film'. This is especially the case as 'Irreversible' is in fact a very good film for those who can stomach it; featuring thematic insight and even haunting dissonance as a result of the reverse chronological order. This film does not promote rape or violence, the extremity of the depictions deplore rape and violence if anything, Irreverisible's greatest flaw would be that the signature scene is so well done and is so difficult to sit through that most people will only concentrate on that, and ignore the film as a whole. Also ironically, due to Irreversible's inventive and unconventional structure, repeated viewings would likely be rewarding, even though few would ever dare to do so.",Irreversible
231,benbhodgson,Love or hate?,10,27 April 2021,"For me this film was brilliant. The rawness of French cinema is still undefeated. Yes the tunnel scene is savage and I did mute and look away after awhile as it is ten minutes long.The shots, the juxtaposing camera movements
Dishevelled the audience from the offset, almost to the point of nausea! The colours used and the concept of the reverse is just brilliant. Loved the film and no it isn't for the faint hearted!But sometimes I think we are too used to ""safe cinema""",Irreversible
232,shammuk,Creative and Realistic,10,3 September 2003,"This has been one of the most creative films I've seen recently. The camera movement gave the film a sense of time turning backwards. I think the film definitely didn't want to leave the audience in despair thats why the scenes were shown in reverse order. The ending was beautiful and sad in a sense if you think back to the beginning of the film. I liked the fact that Alex's ex-boyfriend killed the wrong person, because otherwise it would have been a film about revenge, and I don't think that's what it is trying to say, but to portray a reality in the act of all the violence and sex.The conversation in the subway about sex was very ironic to the rape scene. Alex was saying men should concentrate more on thier own desires instead of concentrating on the girls desire. That is pretty much what rape is all about. This film dealt with the idea of human desires. It showed human beings at its rawest animalistic form. Our actions driven entirely by our emotions without contemplation. Anger leading to vengeance. Even Alex and her boyfriend's relationship seem to be driven by sex instead of a spiritual connection. Since her ex-boyfriend wasn't as well skilled in bed she prefers her boyfriend who seems to be cheating on her constantly at times.I think the ending can also mean the beginning. Since life still goes on even after all that has happened. Maybe one day it will go back to the beautiful scenery in the end of the film.",Irreversible
233,olethrosdc,Nothing new,6,15 August 2002,"I sat down to watch this movie, expecting it to be a thought-provoking and simultaneously shocking experience. Unfortunately it has only partially succeeded.There are two things that set this movie apart from a technical point of view. It features uninterrupted, long, uncut, shots and the sequence of shots is shown in reverse cronological order. However, the uncut shots results in perhaps a bit too much camera movement (which is supposed to portray the psychology of the characters, I imagine) - also, the uncut nature of the shots means that you have to watch prolonged sequence of either inane or disturbing action. As for the reverse chronological order... interesting, but it does not serve as a plot device. It is merely a gimmick. In Memento, a movie there was a purpose behind showing the shots in reverse.. here... it is pointless, as is much of the violence and wandering around..What this movie does succeed in, however, is to portray the psychological state of its characters, quite vividly. And in the end, this is what makes the movie shocking and not any graphic violence that is being displayed. (Although the violence itself is spicing things up quite a bit).All in all, a flawed movie, but one that succeeds brilliantly in bringing out the characters' feelings and causing a reaction to the audience, despite the inanity of the plot itself. Prepare to be horrified, amazed and feeling light-headed.",Irreversible
234,sackleywhistle,"Stick with it - not enjoyable, but admirable",9,2 September 2003,"After notorious walkouts at Cannes and the controversy around the difficult, long, unrelenting rape scene, this was high on my must-see list of the last year. Not for voyeuristic reasons, but because, like A Clockwork Orange before it, the most controversial films are often those with the most to say.This is not a date movie. Nor is it a pleasant, enjoyable experience. It is, however, pure cinema from a director working at the highest technical level, with the camera, with lighting, with makeup, with scripting and with performance. Irreversible is that rare beast, a self-contained experience which goes beyond the cinematic and aesthetic to show something real, both touching and frightening, beautiful and horrific, simple and innovative. The first twenty minutes are among the toughest you will encounter on the screen. The sound whines and hums, the camera spins in all directions, disorientating and showing glimpses of the scene. Dialogue is sparse, the same lines being repeated over and over again. The subject matter is unpleasant, taking place in a seedy gay club, the protagonists (Dupontel and Cassel) searching for someone called the Tenia (named after a tape-worm). And when they find him, there is a sequence which lasts maybe two minutes which is incredibly difficult to watch, yet difficult not to watch. Almost in disbelief, you cannot believe what you are watching is happening, yet marvel at how real it is, both technically and in terms of human character.Beyond that, the film does not let up for about another half an hour, as the backwards-played story begins to piece itself together, leading to an act of provocation unrivalled in cinema history. My second viewing of the film was with a 21-year-old female who found it the hardest scene she had ever watched. It is the details of the rape that make it so shocking - her constant crying and squirming, his inherent joy at her discomfort, his pinning of her arms and gagging her mouth, the passer-by who sees the scene and walks away, unbeknownst to either of them. And when the long, unsettling scene is over, the greatest act of destruction occurs - the destruction of purity and beauty. Yet, as the film is told backwards, when the rape is over, we know there is more to come as we have already seen the aftermath. The brilliance is in naively praying it won't happen, resigned to the knowledge that it will.My co-viewer demanded that we stop the film there but i had to insist that she finish the film. Without following the film through to the end(or the beginning), we would not know the reason that the director put these scenes in front of us. For me the greatest scenes are those that follow - the party scene, the subway journey of the three main characters, the post-dream awakening of the central couple - because they lift the film out of enfant terrible provocation and into a place of simultaneous beauty and pessimism, making sense of the journey all three characters are about to embark on. In particular the significance of dreams is a key theme, along with the linear, destructive power of time which the whole film is playing around with.The film ends with the most difficult sequence to watch, the spinning beautiful image of Monica Bellucci prior to any of the events of the film followed by a strobe light effect which is physically difficult to watch, burning images and words into the brain.Clearly Noe is a director intent on provoking a reaction and - thank God - it is impossible not to react to this film. You may hate it, you may admire it or you may be disgusted by it. All of these are perfect reactions to it. You cannot be indifferent to it. While it is undoubtedly a hard film to sit through, if you put in the effort it rewards in dividends. And it not only deserves but really requires multiple viewings, if you can stomach it. There is far more than can be taken in on the first visit, much to decipher and interpret that I will not spoil here.While it does seem to reference the controversy of the aforementioned Kubrick classic - taking the violence and sexual abuse aspects to new levels, updating for a new generation - and even directly tips its hat to Kubrick - panning down from a poster of 2001 as classical music swells, before going into a psychadelic head-trip - this is a much harder, yet more humane film than Kubrick ever achieved. There is unpleasantness here, do not be fooled, but there is also insightful comment on the nature of humanity, instinct, violence, even love and relationships which alone makes the film worthy of appreciation. It is not a film all will be able to sit through - for a start, its subtitled! - but it is a film which deserves to be seen at least once by anyone with an appreciation of cinema. It is among the finest examples of modern French cinema available and one of the most intelligent and original films from anywhere in the last five years.Finally, it wouldn't be right to hail the film without mentioning the performers. Monica Bellucci is outstanding in an undoubtedly difficult part, conveying the beauty, intelligence, womanliness, emotion and despair of Alex in a way that never screams ""Moviestar!"" and is always believable. Dupontel is wonderful in perhaps the film's most interesting role, a complex intellectual who, it is often overlooked, gives in to his most primal urges. He is sad, smart, witty and ultimately disturbed. But highest praise goes to Cassel, one of the most interesting actors working, who carries most of the film, emitting charm, energy, fear, shock, humour and weakness. It is hard not to focus on him in any given scene and impossible to catch him acting, high praise indeed given the other subjects which often fill the screen (not least the stunning Bellucci). Together, they are prime examples of true actors giving themselves over completely to their characters in a way that the likes of Nicole Kidman simply can't. They may be stars, but they are first and foremost brilliant performers.Take caution, but do not miss if you get the chance.",Irreversible
235,rbloom333,"Interesting, despite the violence",6,29 November 2008,"Some have called this movie stupid, arrogant, pretentious, and brutal. Others swear by its greatness.Gaspar Noe has offered a film which tops his I Stand Alone in its sheer ability to manipulate and horrify the viewer. Like Memento (although far more engaging), the film unfolds in reverse chronological order, and interesting technique which transforms a would-be-average revenge fantasy into a provocative meditation on the destructive nature of time.The film begins with distracting camera movements and overwhelming violence as several men avenge the rape of a young woman (a 10 minute scene that drove many critics from the theater at Cannes), and then descends into the realm of these people in their normal lives.The second half of the film is undoubtedly superior to the first because it dares to draw the viewer in whereas the first half merely smacks you in the face.The young actress Monica Bellucci, who is the recipient of appalling violence, is particularly exceptional in the final act. This film is difficult to place and will clearly be the subject of much discussion in the years to come.",Irreversible
236,noilie,One question,10,8 August 2003,"Would all the prudes and last Luddites (with a soft spot for gays and women, it seems!) like to answer one little question: Would there be as much slamming of this film (i.e. it is a pretentious, hollow, utterly bombastic effort devoid of any real insight into the tragic human condition  which it claims to have 'revealed'; a banal tract serving only to highlight Noe's 'artful' obsession with wrangling in sicko's and putting everyone else off; a pretentious, violent pseudo-'meditation' on the intricacacies of the division between life and art, the worst film of the year etc etc etc etc.) See it is as easy, if not easier to slander a film that it is to moderate opinion.... the above took me under a minute to type out.
My continued question: Would there be as much slamming of this film (by those wonderful little worms at 'Rotten Tomatoes') if it did not contain any 'nasty scenes'...... their shallow vitriol shows glaringly.
Many of those same critics rate 'The Hours' as one of the best films of the year..... just a little 'insight' into the institutionalized  view of all-things-cinematic 'art' and Caucasian 'reality' which they find acceptable to the delicate 'p.c.' palate. Talk about 'featured on Oprah' status quo tugging.All things critical considered, Noe probably gets the last laugh anyway---- on the way to the bank!",Irreversible

238,m-vinteuil,It seems time doesn't destroy everything,10,6 November 2008,"I have only seen this film once, when it premiered many years ago. However, I have not forgotten a single frame. Irréversible is the ultimate act of cinematic masochism. Gaspar Noé acting as both provocateur, and calculating sadist. Running the sequence of events backwards is far from novelty, as the first half of the film is uncompromisingly brutal, and the latter half melancholic.The camera-work is tailored to induce seasickness, on a cinema screen it can give you a migraine. The one scene in which the camera is static will make you wish that it wasn't. A incredibly brutal, prolonged rape. The graphic way both the rape, and the misguided revenge, are shown is immeasurably painful to witness. The undulating noise on the soundtrack and constant motion of the camera simply will not let you become comfortable, or ponder. Once the fate of the protagonists is sealed, we are introduced to them as characters, and discover all which is lost.The overall theme of wretched destruction will stay with you. A simple misunderstanding can lead to an irreversible turn of events. What's done can not be undone. What is seen can not be unseen. Once seen, never forgotten.",Irreversible

240,gaeanprayer,Awful...,3,8 June 2006,"Unlike most of the pompous around here, I'm going to get right to the point.Irreversible attempts to make a bold statement further emphasized by the music and camera effects rampant throughout the movie. In my opinion, it fails.Hard as I tried to enjoy this movie, and understand what it all meant, I found myself bored. Gore fanatics will be mildly entertained by some of the movie's scenes, mostly because the camera stays (for the most part) focused upon the happenings, rather than the typical Hollywood horror trash of today (camera looks away, only screaming to let you know what's going on...pfft), but will eventually end up frustrated as, not only is the movie extremely dark, but by the time the camera stops moving enough for you to focus on what is going on, you're not that interested anymore. Those looking for a deeper yet just-the-same disturbing meaning and peek into the workings of the depraved are better off with movies like Salo or May.And for those interested in an off-the-wall movie with homosexual/homophobic themes should stick to Skin Flick. Don't lie to yourself, you know that's what you were ~really~ looking forward too...Now with all that said, I will say that this movie wasn't a total waste of my time. Though I think it tried too hard, I did find myself immersed in the story following certain points in the movie. Unfortunately, just as quickly as I became interested, I began wishing I had something else to watch.",Irreversible
241,DocEmmettBrown,Left me shaking,8,12 January 2005,"I am writing this review more to exorcise the demons this film has left me with more than anything else. I watched it last night and have been distracted all day thinking about it.I was unfamiliar with the work of Gaspar Noe before this but couldn't ignore the tremor this film had caused forever. Having browsed the web I can see that there is a definite polarized opinion on Irreversible. People either seem in shocked awe or have dismissed it as exploitation trash. I'm in the first camp.SpoilersThe film details a brutal rape and the equally brutal revenge meted out by the victims partner and ex-partner, however it is told in reverse, starting with the revenge and ending with everyone involved blissfully unaware of the horrors that are about to befall them. Many have dismissed this technique as nothing more than a pretentious gimmick but I feel they're missing the point. Having the film close with the happy characters not knowing the horrors that we have just witnessed left me sick and sad. I actually pitied their future which is a very bleak feeling indeed.Now I have seen a lot of nasty films. Just check my other reviews. I've sat through I Spit On Your Grave and Last House On The Left yet the rape scene in Irreversible was on another level. Through most of the film Noe adopts a swirling camera style. The scenes in the gay club are dizzying, the camera swooping and diving through rooms letting you catch glimpses of all sorts of unwholesome acts. Yet from the moment the rape begins the camera remains static throughout. Forcing us to watch, daring us to look away. There are no cuts, this is realtime and we are there for the grim distance. Monica Bellucci's performance is heart breaking and painful and the moment when the rapist kicks her in the face I actually involuntarily shut my eyes. I have NEVER done that. Possibly the most painful part of the whole scene is when a figure appears at the end of the tunnel then turns and walks away again. Noe is forcing us to ask ourselves 'what would I have done if that were me?'. Would you have come to the rescue or would you turn back through fear for your own safety? It is a moment of salvation that is quickly snatched away.Also of note is Cassel's performance. He is truly a man possessed. Until the events unfold he appears a mere thug but by the end I almost wanted to go back to the start and root for him.If you think you can handle it I urge you to see Irreversible and make up your own mind. It is an unforgettable experience.I promise you two things; You'll never look at a fire extinguisher again without wincing and you will definitely think twice about taking the subway.",Irreversible
242,lankyalun,"Hate this film, it makes me vomit!",3,20 November 2010,Gasper Noe is great at making me feel sick but useless at making me interested in his films. Irreversible is no exception and I don't understand why he always feels the need to show the most shocking disgusting scenes. It would be a lot more watchable if he left the horrible stuff to the imagination because when you show a film where a man gets his head crushed with a fire extinguisher it is only going to be remembered for that and all people are going to say is how disgusting it is. I have never met a person who liked or enjoyed this film. One thing is certain I will never watch this film again and would never recommend anyone watch it! Gasper Noe is a sadist and why his films find an audience I will never know!!!,Irreversible
243,loumiles-25568,found hard to watch - but also rewarding,7,2 June 2016,"the start of this movie hits hard and its ugly, if i had of walked away or turned off, i would have missed out, i must admit the length of rape scene is extremely hard to sit through. but the most amazing thing in the film, is that we as the viewer know what is going to happen, and have to make the decision if we are going to go to the rape, and i found that was done brilliant... before the rape scene even happens..... i was watching just going no no no, don't go down there. maybe because it was subtitled i thought the language that was used in the scene so disturbing(to be honest i might have made a cup of tea about 3 mins in)the scene is unrelenting and goes for an eternity....but for me the second half is what makes irreversible a winner. it is really beautiful, some people mention clockwork orange, but to me it is almost a love letter to 2001 a space odyssey. i don't like graphic violent films...but this film, it has context and works... I've heard cassell & bellucci say this film will be talked about in film schools for years to come. i agree. its also one of those frustrating films in that i would hate for it to be put with exploitation & genre films because of the first half. i will leave my review at that, i'm waiting for gasper noe to make another great film..... as ENTER THE VOID.....was a movie i had been hanging out to see. and i rate it a 1.....one of the most boring movies i have ever seen.",Irreversible
244,oslane,"like 'Funny Games', it makes a comment uses its audience as guinnea pigs",5,25 May 2008,"I, for one, have no idea what the point of movies like this or 'Funny Games' is, aside to make a viewer think about something that the viewer probably has dealt with and moved on.The movie's sequences are placed in reversed order (like 'Memento'), clever title right? Yes, every technical aspect about this movie is really good, particularly the seamless editing during the (unfortunately) limited conversational segments.So I don't think it constitutes a spoiler to reveal that this movie has two of the most grisly, violent acts committed to the DV it was shot on. At least the grotesqueness of one is removed since it's been made public that a dummy was being hit with a fire extinguisher, but the other is just vicious and cruel. To whom is this movie making a statement to? Like Michael Haneke, Gaspar Noe feels his film isn't to entertain but to make the audience guinea pigs to his sick experiment on what we view as entertainment. Most people who see this movie already know rape is wrong and most don't delight in it when it's in other movies. So again, my question is, what's the point of this movie?",Irreversible
245,Capt_comicbook,Full of primal emotions,7,15 August 2003,"7 out of 10.Artful cinema or shocking trash....  this film is hard to watch and will leave its mark on you for quite a while. In my opinion, the film is very artistic in its approach to showing the gambit of emotions and reactions the characters experience before and after a violent sex crime.  Unfortunately this film is probably a realistic portrayal of a crime that happens with far to much frequency in the world. Yes, the night club scene is brutal, and yes the rape scene is loathsome.... but what I think really bothers people is that they have to think about them andvalidate them, because they havn't seen what motivated the situation yet. This is what the director was going for, I think.  If the film was instead shown front to back, instead of in reverse like Memento, I think I would have empathized with Marcus, and revealed in the beating at the nightclub....  never really stopping to acknowledge that, it was as brutal a crime.I also liked the cinematography....to  a point....   After a while I started to feel ill, yet another real emotion that the directory pulled out of me.  It does get a little bit old however.  As a closing comment to the people that will watch this film: Great films are always great because the create an emotional reaction with in the audience...  usually the 'Greats' bring out happiness or love, or and end to loneliness.....   This film does the same, only it concentrates on negativeemotions....  Fear, hate, loathing, repulsion....    Everyone tries to hide these emotions....  just dont hide the fact that this film made you 'feel'",Irreversible
246,davidlmarks,Yikes! Perhaps one of the most violent movies I've ever seen-- at least realistic looking violence. It has two famous scenes.,9,15 February 2012,"Yikes! Perhaps one of the most violent movies I've ever seen-- at least realistic looking violence. It has two famous scenes. One scene occurs in a gay underground nightclub, where a guy gets his arm snapped in two and then his head and face literally smashed flat by a guy with a fire extinguisher (it is done so seamlessly that I re- watched it to to see where they managed to (insert fake head here) to smash to a pulp. And the head is so realistic that as it is getting pulverized, the face is still making expressions, his mouth is moving-- teeth are getting bashed in... I hope you're not eating... That scene runs for a full minute-- non-stop. The camera-work is this crazy swooping- twisting (not the shaky-cam)-- it gives the film a real sense of the insanity that's going on. Awesome bare-bones 80 techno and synths are the sound track-- which gives it an even more bizarre feeling.The other famous scene is an ultra-violent rape scene that goes on for over 10 minutes.It's done Memento-style-- essentially playing these crazy violent scenes near the beginning of the movie, and then hops back and back, scene by scene-- so you see how it all started (at the end of the film).Incredibly hard to watch. I'm not sure if the name ""Irreversible"" applies to the the backward story-telling style, or to the last piece of innocence inside me that it killed-- irreversibly.

I personally rated it 5/10 stars, but would have rated it higher if not for the camera work in the first 25 minutes.The story is told in reverse-chronological order. It starts at the very end of the story. The first 16 minutes are almost unbearable. Not only do you not know what's going on, but it's made worse by the camera turning and twisting every which way, making the viewer nauseous at times.Once you make it through that part, you'll have to hang on just a little bit longer. Each scene gets better, both with comprehension and a steadier camera. At about 41 minutes, you get to the heart of the story. From there, the camera is pretty much steady until the end of the movie.But be warned, at the 44 minute mark, you'll be witness to a gut-wrenching scene that lasts a horrifying 12 minutes.

The simple revenge plot and somewhat banal dialogue aside, this movie hurt me. The two central sequences, the murder by extinguisher in the gay club, and the horrible, prolonged rape scene, are some of the most gruesome images I've ever seen. I like horror/gore movies, but these are simply more disturbing because they look extremely real, and you feel kind of voyeuristic and sick that you're actually watching them. Perhaps this was intended by the director, I don't know. Frontloading the movie with the most horrific parts means the movie kind of dwindles down by the end/beginning, but after the wringer the audience has gone through, they are not doubt relieved.

Rarely we get to watch and experience a film that challenges us to stay inside the theater in the hope we will be rewarded. Perhaps since Fassbinder.

The camera then swings through a window into a small room with two scantily clad men philosophising and reminiscing about days passed. The camera is never still, to the extent of causing nausea to some, and swings again to cover the entrance to a club called ""Rectum"" with an ambulance and Frenchmen screaming profanities. What is this??In any case, I was intrigued. Any film which experiments with form in such a way must be worth watching, so I tracked it down.Beforehand, I was ""warned"" about certain content in it that could possibly be disturbing. I braced myself but it didn't prevent particular scenes being deeply harrowing. The rawness in which it was done left an impact on me, I had to have time to take in what I had just seen.The film follows Marcus and his mission to avenge his violated girlfriend (Bellucci) but told in reverse chronological order. This way, the climax of the film, as it were, comes pretty early on. It's such a surprise that you can't help but be affected in some way by it. The violence is far from gratuitous or manipulative, it's raw and it's realistic. In fact, this accurately describes all of the content, plot devices and acting; the issue most people have is with the narrative style. I however, believe it is due to this that the film has such an effect on people; causing huge discomfort and confusion. You feel almost as Marcus does, utterly out of control with rage. I'll personally give you £500 if you can watch this without having some sort of emotional reaction to it.It's not for everyone, that much is clear. I believe 'Irreversible' is one of the few 18 rated films which truly deserves that rating. This is light years apart from a teen horror flick that will give you a good thrill and some gore perhaps. This will truly disturb you, in the best way possible.Gaspar Noe has balls. He forces you to face up to some of the most horrendous things that you could possibly experience, showing it to you straight with no way of escape. You must not (and probably won't) stop watching. This is truly bold film making and that deserves immense credit.",Irreversible

The only difference between that state and watching this film is that when you reach land and recover from the sea-sickness, you feel great. After finishing with this film, you feel even worse because it pollutes you permanently. You disgust yourself for having watched it. Actually, I watched it twice, in a desperate attempt to find out why it had been made. There was no answer. I managed to partially erase it from memory after a couple of years, and only now write these comments because a friend of mine said she wanted to see it. So I'm sending it off to her, and glad to be rid of it. No doubt there will be others who want to see it for the reason it's so horrible. Prepare to feel a sense of mental and emotional damage for the rest of your life. It's not bad, like Saving Private Ryan; it's not good, like Alfredo Garcia.

253,comfortablynumb_1,Nightmare,3,3 August 2005,"Nightmare- the only way to summarize this film. To some people this is a well made and innovative film. I am not one of these people. I, although must give this film credit for truly disturbing me, which is quite an achievement, considering that The Exorcist had little effect on me when I was 13. But this film is completely different because it is so realistic.In reality this film is a true story and the events occur frequently in modern society. So it is fictional characters acting out a film which could be based on thousands of real events.I'm surprised I watched the whole film. It is in reverse-chronological order and the first 10 minutes or so is a swirling camera with disturbing sounds which ends up at a nightclub called ""The Rectum"" a nauseating start which I hope to forget soon. But some scenes are far more toxic than the introduction.Try to avoid. Especially females. But much can be learn't from watching this film, but learn't from seeing the shocking consequences of poor decisions made by the characters. Hence the title.",Irreversible

I did not really need to watch this stinker to get enlightened on this point.I guess there could be an interesting way to explore the meaning and implications of fate. Not for the deconstructionists though, whose mantra ""Life is crap"" blinds them from any meaningful artistic endeavour. This movie only delivers gratuitous gore and violence and an endless rape scene to..well..to drive home the point that life can be very bad indeed.Remember, art tells us more about the artist than at what is being depicted...Frankly, IMDb must be visited by a lot of sour souls for this piece of trash to receive such high marks.",Irreversible

The camera was all over the place and it makes you want to vomit in many ways. I liked the foreshadowing aspect, especially when it comes to the opening scene as the follow up was not yet made but I had seen it a couple days before which made it all the better.This movie gets its disturbing point across. It is not for the faint of heart and I would not recommend it to my mother.

258,ceidt,The Main Emotion Here is Anger,7,26 October 2010,"The camera spins as if out of control, but that's exactly where we are in the story. It has lost almost all control. Almost.Most likely inspired by ""Memento,"" the story is told in backwards chronology. The end credits are at the beginning of the film, the death of the villain is at the beginning of the film, but no worries, as this is not really a spoiler, it is merely what you are initially told. This is also a selling point, as horror fanatics will appreciate the brutality. The setting of this scene is meant to be, surely, upsetting as well.As the film progresses, the characters become less and less anxious, and the camera becomes stiller. Time moves on, the climax has already happened. The arch of the film is what everybody would talk about. We are already introduced to the idea of what is about to happen, and we are told these things, not so much. We discover, as an audience.Moments...prolonged takes (no cuts in the editing room)...puts us in the hyper-realism of the story.Your worst fears are realized...and one of the most amazing actresses in one of her best scenes comes into play...and it's no play. It's not fun. It's not ""everything"" you wanted, because it's hardly acting.This may be the scene that has me writing about the film. However, it is only because it really angered me. I've read that many audience members react in different ways. At the Cannes festival, 200 people walked out. I imagine people becoming sick over this. I was just angry.I was expecting a similar feel in ""The Human Centipede,"" however the badguy is quite the performer in that one, and its the idea that gets all the attention. That one was more Hitchcock, a psychologically demanding movie. This one was more Kubrick. A psychologically demanding emotional film. The main emotion here is anger.Due to the subject matter, I gave this a 7. As upsetting as it was, due to the prolonged rape scene, it is one of the few films...in fact, the only movie I can remember repeating to myself ""It's only a movie, it's only a movie..."" A phrase you could see on the original ""Last House on the Left"" poster...quite an effective tagline for a film, however, I hated ""Last House on the Left,"" and I hate the remake without even seeing it.""Irreversible,"" however, is beautiful. Monica Bellucci is beautiful. Vincent Cassel is just as powerful. This can be classified under ""art horror,"" as the director really tells the story as much as the events do...especially for a film with 10/15 minute scenes without editing, its hard for a director to do so much. He does, he does.Gaspar Noe may be one of the greatest directors. I'm basing this on one film of his I have seen. An awfully predictable film, I imagined the story once the story got going. Here's the spoiler...a happy ending.Satisfying? We'll get to that...The meaning of the ending is as important as where the characters go after this one awful night. The commentary on rape and revenge is strong, and watching this with someone (it may be hard to find someone who wants to watch this, and it should be difficult) may surely spark some conversation. That's the draw of the film. The obsession.People may watch again and again, looking for the similarities in the rape scene and the intimate love scene later in the movie. It's all predictable, but as I've always said: movies are especially predictable the second viewing.The polarizing effect this film has had on audiences is where satisfaction. It's all about what you're telling yourself. This is the psychological effect that creates something to obsess over. Let me spoil the ending for you, because if you interpret it yourself, you might ruin it for yourself. The film is about what time does to us, and perhaps how memories should last a lifetime. What happens to everyone after this tragic night? Perhaps it is the last two moments of the film, but in the last moment of all, it's meant to make you sick...when it's really just a blank white screen becoming a strobe effect with a terrible sound effect. This is art......and it's only a movie...it's only a movie.Hard to say I enjoyed it, though it calms down in the ""end,"" and becomes enjoyable, and an intimate love story. Hard to say I'm going to watch it again. So does that merit a 10? 9? 8? 7 sounds good to me.",Irreversible
259,Barry Lyndon-3,Even Kubrick never pushed these limits,8,8 March 2003,"This film was like a bad acid trip.  Disturbing, dark, surreal, sad and altogether shocking.  You can't prepare yourself for what you are about to see.  I have seen dark movies and this dares past all the rest.  There isn't much of a story, it's a slice of life, a really bad day in the life of these characters, but it's the way the filmmakers and actors tell you this story that's amazing.Forget the comparisons to ""Memento"" -- yes it's a story told in reverse, but the comparisons end there.Monica Bellucci may be one of the bravest actresses working today.  If you thought ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""The Accused"" or ""Boys Don't Cry"" depicted sexual assault against women in a disturbing fashion...  this film goes past that.  And then some.DO NOT SEE THIS FILM if you are the least bit sensitive.  Where I saw it in Los Angeles the theatre put up a sign saying ""the 1st 20 minutes may be disturbing to some viewers"" -- It should have read the first ""hour"" could be.This is a very cryptic comment, but...  it's that kind of movie.",Irreversible
260,Patuquitos,Heartbreaking and difficult to endure.,9,10 January 2005,"I looked forward to watching this movie since its theatrical release, but it's been today when I've finally been able to experience it. Yes, I mean 'experience'. Because the vast majority of the film is an experience, not just a story.I was attracted to it by the hugely polarized critical reactions arisen. Nobody showed a mild response to the flick: that's always exciting to me and, sometimes, the sign of a great movie. But even though I was prepared for some sickening stuff, I admit this one caught me off the guard. And this comes from someone who loves gore and stands violence almost impassively (I remark I'm talking about movies, just in case).'Irreversible' is a movie that feeds on all those aspects of life we shun even talking about, and it's just that, and nothing else (I mean it's not the infamous fire extinguisher / rape scenes, although they are two of the most horrifying images I've seen on a screen) what make the film so incredibly disturbing.To be quick and to the point: 'Irreversible' is telling you 'this is life, this is tragedy, it could strike you anytime, and there is NOTHING you can do about it, just pray it will never be your turn'. 'Irreversible' triggers feelings of loss, sadness, anger, hate, fear... plain depression, and all multiplied by 100 via camera-work. If an event makes you angry, Mr. Noe will get the camera moving in order to make you angrier; if an event is tragic, the director will make it insufferable. Believe me, this movie goes for the gut, and succeeds.But that's not the only trick: throughout the movie, we get to see a lot of moments where everything could have been avoided. As spectators, we can do nothing but feel sorry for the characters, and for ourselves too, wondering how much little decisions may affect our fate.On the technical level, this movie is nothing short of wonderful. The actors are superb, the camera work is sublime (ignore the critics: it may seem gratuitous at first, but once the movie goes on, you definitely see a purpose, and a very justified one), and the script, despite of endless cursing, works fantastically, making it all feel very real. Some scenes are clockwork of calculated chaos: four people arguing aloud at the same time, but giving their lines at the very right moment, adding it all up to the most realistic scenes of confusion I've seen in a long time.In regards to violence, I've tried to avoid any commentary in order to focus on what I feel it's important about this movie, but it's nearly impossible, so here are my two cents: I find hilarious the accusations of exploitation. As I understand, exploitation is the inclusion of gratuitous scenes of sex / violence in a movie for the enjoyment of the audience. Well, what we see in 'Irreversible' might be considered gratuitous to some (not at all for me, but I understand the debate), but what it isn't definitely is enjoyable. Anyone accusing 'Irreversible' of being exploitative is saying that scenes of rape and brutal murder are enjoyable, when they are devoid of all humor or satire. Well, I think that speaks for itself...So, if your stomach is strong and your emotional endurance is high, I recommend you this movie without any reservation. You will have an awful time, but it will be worth it from a cinematographic point of view.RATING: 8.9",Irreversible
261,PoochJD,Chronic piece of shock cinema!,4,13 February 2003,"So numerous people walked out in Cannes. And, the film has courted controversy everywhere it has played. Such a shame then, that the man behind ""Carne"" and ""Seul Contre Tous"" has created the most chronically vacuous piece of cinema I've seen in a long time.Yes, the film is controversial, but there are films already in existence much worse than this one.I won't bother with the plot, as most of you will already know about it. The film is told in reverse, ala ""Memento"", but it's a depressing, vapid and totally butt-numbing movie, that you really couldn't care less.The main problem, is not the scene of rape, or the man having his face bashed in with a fire-extinguisher. It's the fact that throughout the entire ordeal, you never care about any of the characters! Not once, do you feel sympathy or empathy with them! As such, the nine-minute rape of Monica Belluci's character ""Alex"", is neither titillating, erotic or even painful to watch. It's just dull and exhausting. At no point do you think ""Is this what a rape might look like in real-life? Oh god, that's awful!"". You actually think: ""Poor Monica Belluci having to act out such garbage, for the sake of shocking the audience. Come on, get a move on, please!""The scene of extreme violence in the nightclub, involving a man's face being beaten to a bloody pulp, is filmed in such dark and unviewable surroundings, that what little gore you do get to see, is practically no worse than in any Peter Jackson horror flick. The only horrors in the entire film, are the sound effects of a man's arm being broken, and his nose breaking under the fire-extinguisher.Other than that, the acting is below par for all concerned. The story is pointless. The dialogue is banal, and the highlight is the ending piece of music - a piece of Beethoven, to be exact. For me, the most offensive thing about this film, is not the rape, but the unrepentant and blatantly outrageous homophobia. The entire 20 minute opening, is just full of inflammatory and offensive anti-gay language. As such, I can only think that Noe is doing to gays, what Tarantino does to blacks. Both Belluci and Cassel are wasted in this yawn-inducing film, and it's a shame that the two who appeared in the superb ""Brotherhood Of The Wolf"" (aka ""Le Pacte Des Loups"") have to meet again, in this septic-tank of a movie!If anything, I'd rather the British Board Of Film Classification banned or censored this film, than the far more intelligent, controversial and thought-provoking film ""Baise-Moi"". Sadly, it has not been the case. Don't bother with this movie, as it's all to do with hype! Watch Noe's other works instead! If you see this film, make sure you don't mind wasting 95 minutes of your life!",Irreversible
262,dfusion,Unbelievably realistic,7,15 December 2002,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. Let me point out that through it's portrayal of the graphic and disgusting nine minute rape scene and the stuff going on in the gay bar, this movie has learned me two things: One - never let your girlfriend walk home alone (never!)Two - I'm not going to a gay bar(never ever!)The movie is well made (you get used to the weird camera techniques after a while) and it presents a hellish nightmare that I have never ever experienced in any other film. The only thing I don't understand is why did the movie start at the end? I mean it's original (sort of) but it totally destroys the plot which would have been great if the story were told in a linear way.Verdict: High impact film that could have been much better if the plot was linear. Still a must see because of its life lessons. Score: 6.8 out of 10",Irreversible
263,saltsan,The most homophobic film of our time,3,1 January 2004,"People like to excuse ""Irréversible's"" undeniable sense of homophobia by saying, ""well, gay sex clubs do exist"" and ""the film is an anti-violence film and the homosexual stuff is just atmosphere."" But what these kinds of comments ignore is that writing and directing are all about making choices. Gaspar Noë CHOSE, to make the film's central rape scene an ANAL rape (if, as Roger Ebert seems to think, it's just an anti-rape film, why did Noë make such a point of having it be an anal rape?), he CHOSE to have the film begin/end in a gay sex club, and he CHOSE to have the club be named ""The Rectum"". This all adds up to a classic expression of homophobia, which can be best understood, if your interested, by reading the famous essay about the hatred of gay sex by Leo Bersani (in the book by Douglas Crimp, ""AIDS: Cultural Analysis, Cultural Activism"") called ""Is the Rectum a Grave?""An accurate interpretation of the film must acknowledge that Noë clearly thinks that the most wonderful thing in the world is vaginal intercourse, since it can lead to conception, birth, and the future of the species, and that the worst thing in the world is anal sex since (to him and other homophobes) it's all about dirty anuses filled with rotting excrement. The theme of the film is built upon the dualistic belief that vaginal intercourse leads to life and therefore anal intercourse leads to death. The theme, finally, is the polar opposite of Kubrick's ""2001"", which Noë clumsily references at the end/beginning of the film. He's saying that mankind is devolving toward destruction and death, and homosexuality is the key metaphor for, and a primary symptom of, our destruction.Sorry, folks, I like an envelope-pushing shocker--like ""Salò"", ""In the Realm of the Senses"", or ""In a Glass Cage""--as much as anyone, and many of the films considered homophobic (like ""Cruising"") have been, I think, misunderstood, but ""Irréversible"" is truly a textbook example of homophobia in the cinema.",Irreversible

Spin the camera again! No please I don't want to see! Both starting and ending with a selection of visual tricks that are both frustrating and upon reflection perhaps necessary, Irreversible is a powerful study in the lengths to which people will go to enjoy themselves, and then how far their guilt will take them to make up for their mistakes. The set piece crux of the film, taking place just shy of an hour into the movie and shot with a transfixing, excruciatingly static camera, signals a change of pace for the movie that is revelatory. Indeed, once the visual horrors stop, the characterization is allowed to move center stage, giving context for what you've just seen. It also allows for opening up more questions about what has happened for which the movie has no easy answers. Indeed, I'm off to watch the subtitled director and cast commentary to see if I can get any answers from the director himself - or maybe, as in my initial instincts, I just don't want to know what the horrific answers might be.",Irreversible
265,Creepy-Suzie,"Not a horror film, but a jarring punch in the face.",10,28 April 2015,"This is not a horror film, but a jarring punch in the face and is rightfully credited as the ""most walked out of movie of 2002″ by Newsweek. This one's not for everyone, to say the least, but those that can appreciate such exploitation tend to love it.Bellucci's Alex character is sublime in her vulnerability and the primary sequence that is the film's focal point is acted more realistically than any other dramatization I've seen before. (Even if the ahem ""tool"" used was entirely C.G.I.!)There are fringe conversations and scenes that seem almost normal at first until you really pay attention and then you step back and wonder ""Did that old man really just utter ?"" or ""Did that guy at the club really just ??!!"" Disturbing! (By the way- the club's called ""The Rectum"" and the name pretty much says it all.)There's plenty of action to say the least and the story is told entirely in reverse, which of course plays on the title. It makes you want to solve the mystery of sorts as the viewer, so it was an interesting way to present the film. It also gave more of a sense of urgency and ultimately disappointment toward the whole revenge aspect. Of course, other films have used the sequencing trick or something similar, but it doesn't ever give an air of being cliché. In fact, I would go so far as to call it innovative in certain ways.I didn't care for lighting in the club. Yes, I realize clubs are dark, but I wonder if Noé's transfer of 16mm to 35mm diminished any of the picture quality to the extent that the lighting was affected. The soundtrack is bizarre and uncomfortable, yet fitting to the movie. Movement is continuous and kept my attention completely. To be blunt, the CAT III version of this movie is tamer than the French release. You've been warned. Of course- all subs and no dubs if you watch it. This is one of my favorite films, but then again my tastes are not generally that of the average girl.",Irreversible

Noé's unconventional approach to cinema, coupled with some very high concept dialogue add real credence to one of the decade's most disturbing films, making it much more than just another Last House on the Left.A strange masterpiece that's gripping from start to finish (or from finish to start depending on how you look at it) Irreversible is at once unwatchable and unmissible.",Irreversible
267,lefkiosvanrooy,Irrevrsible is about human's powerlessness to stop or alter the events set in motion,7,28 March 2016,"Some may say that it is a well told story about seeking revenge and the implications that it has, but to me Irreversible is more than that. It is about the inevitability of things and human's powerlessness to stop or alter the events set in motion. It's about the theory that whatever will happen will happen and that humans are left with the option of observing as things occur in their lives, as it is out of their control to change these events. In the film the female protagonist has a dream that in a way predicts what is about to happen to her later on that day (same goes for the guy who wakes up with his hand feeling numb). The director tells the story in reverse order, in a way not justifying the act of vengeance, and begins the movie with the camera completely spiraling out of control with the subjects rarely being in frame or filmed in a coherent viewpoint. As the film continues to go back in time from scene to scene the camera becomes steadier and steadier with the frame view being more and more centered on the character's profiles. Using this, the director wants to show the unraveling of the fury and madness of the human mind that increases towards the end of the story and the beginning of the movie, with even the most rational character in the film descending into actions of extreme violence after being affected by previous events. This craziness disappears in the happier lighter parts of the characters' day and the spinning returns at the very end of the film, in a way emphasizing again our fate; to be completely helpless and option-less in a world that keeps spinning madly around us. Time ruins everything – the director proclaims. Indeed as seen through the characters of this story, time brings with it a realisation of the many things that will occur in a person's life that will destroy his psyche.",Irreversible

270,butchcorum1950,"Bold, brash and brave!",10,31 January 2007,"Irreversible opens with the credits running backward. A strange man (Philippe Nahon) states, ""Time destroys everything."" We are then thrust into a scene of revenge. Alex's lover, Marcus (Vincent Cassel), and her ex-boyfriend Pierre (Albert Dupontel) enter a gay S&M club looking for the rapist and end up -- as the camera swirls among writhing bodies and hard-ons - bashing in the head of the wrong man with a fire extinguisher, a moment so brutal as to prompt walkouts even before the rape that follows.You can't see Gaspar Noe's Irreversible without starting a heated discussion with someone else who saw it, or part of it. Many viewers walk out midway through, during the nine-minute scene in which Alex, played by the beautiful Monica Bellucci, is beaten and anally raped in the lurid red light of a Paris underpass as Noé stations his camera and watches. It would be easy and convenient to dismiss Irreversible as blatant sensationalism. But Noe's bruising film is too artfully crafted to write off as exploitation. To see it is to absorb it, even against your will. Noe, the acclaimed French director of Carne and I Stand Alone, tells his story backward, as in Memento, but offers nothing as comforting as amnesia.It's the last third of the film that eases up. We watch Alex, Marcus and Pierre at a party where Alex and Pierre quarrel and she leaves, heading for the underpass. Noe then tracks further back to Alex and Marcus in bed, naked and tender with each other. Bellucci and Cassel, married in real life, give these scenes an erotic charge laced with affection and delicacy. It's this harmony that time destroys, except, of course, in Noe's film, where time is at the mercy of the filmmaker.

He literally goes to each and every person and asks them, just like real life. The ""fist me"" person needs to be put out of his misery... And the broken arm, the face smashed in, then the transvestite prostitute... Everything about this movie is disturbing. I read it was one of the most disturbing films ever made, it was the ""most walked out on"" of 2003... and I just had to see it to see what it was all about. To be honest, I will never watch it again. The rape scene is awful, but not as awful as what he does to her after he is done. You know, in American films, they show a man approach a woman, or a man on top for a few seconds, then they change the angle or the scene. This is a true to life - brutal portrayal of rape. Which makes me feel more compassionate for the women who have had to go thru this, or anything even close. The way he was talking to her, degrading her... And then he beats her to a pulp... It truly is sick. The fire extinguisher part, I honestly had to turn my head after the third or fourth time he smashes him with it, but then he keeps going and going and going... You see pieces of his skull fly... It may be computer generated, but boy does it make you sick! My advice, read about it... Don't see it unless you have to for yourself. But be warned.. This movie has THE MOST SHOCKING SCENES I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! And I go for the sick and twisted films...",Irreversible
274,Moviebuff2019,Movies like this don't come along everyday,8,22 September 2003,"After hearing all the hype about this flick I bought the DVD and was not disappointed. The first 45 minutes of the film are very disturbing and the rape scene is pretty much unwatchable, it is so cruel. I found the DVD special feature on the special effects very cool. In fact, they showed how they bashed that guy's head in with the fire extinguisher and after seeing that I'm sure I won't have nightmares because that scene is the most disturbing violence I've ever seen on film and it looks extremely realistic. The last part of the film tailed off a bit, but overall it was worth watching this unique movie.",Irreversible
275,LamontSmith,The best and the worst thing to happen to film in a while.,9,23 May 2003,"I had the unfortunate, and fortunate, opportunity to see Irreversible with my girlfriend recently.While we can talk all we want about Noe's use of color and abstract plot structure, what is really controversial about this film are 2 scenes.  The opening scenes that are the epitome of violence and the much-discussed rape scene.It rattles my nerves and tells me just how powerful this medium of film truly is that it can evoke emotions of love, longing, desire, passion, pain, introspection, hate, and just about every emotion quantifiable.  And when it wants to it can grab you by the hair and make you see something that you never wanted to see, feel things that you never were comfortable feeling. What this film did was an example of film flexing its muscle.  The medium itself standing up and saying ""I will make you sick.  I will make you revolted in your seat.  I have that power""The rape scene was important because there has never been a depiction of this crime on film like it.  It happens thousands of times a day all over the country, all over the world and we've become desensitized to it.  You see that a girl has been raped on the evening news and in between sips of coffee or turning to Sportscenter, you go ""awww, that's a shame"".
Irreversible holds your hands to the fire and shows you, doesn't 'tell' you or 'leave it to your imagination', but SHOWS YOU how brutal, demoralizing, demeaning, and barbaric this act truly is and does not let you file it away aimlessly in the back of your mind so that the very next time you hear about someone being raped or a woman saying how this is the most horrible thing a human being can experience, you KNOW what she is talking about...you feel it...you don't file it away...It almost makes us all rape victims for a while because that scene is so invasive that most people have nightmares afterward.  I know I did and I know that I called almost every woman in my family the next day and just talked to her.  Not about rape or about this film, but just talked to her and made sure everything was fine.I gave this film a 10 based on its power and thought-provoking nature alone.",Irreversible
276,pixiesrule77,Reverse is worse.,9,3 July 2009,"Difficult viewing to say the least, those with a strong constitution will appreciate this brutal but compelling study of vigilante violence.Borrowing Memento's trick of playing in reverse we observe two friends, Marcus and Pierre, commit violent retribution against a (believed) rapist, and then watch as the story unfolds backward to uncover the real truth. Monica Belluchi is the girl who is raped and this film does not shy away from showing the horrific event in its entirety – it's not a pleasant watch. As we travel adversely from darkness into light the film refuses to make judgements for us. The viewer is left to make up their own mind to whether the actions of the characters within are ever justifiable. It's hard uncompromising viewing, but at least it is cinema that gets a reaction from its audience - even it is one of shock and revulsion.",Irreversible
277,vishvakarman,An Irreversible Experience,9,26 May 2004,"The title sequence shouts the pretense of 'Irreversible' right in my face: This is new, this is brutal, this is art. Expect an experience. Then the camera-work picks up, and up until the closing sequence (history of the universe traced back to the big bang), this movie sticks to its pretense. It definitely IS an irreversible experience. Time destroys everything because it is irreversible. We cannot make a horrible event undone. A single act can destroy a whole life. The epilogue (which breaks the narrative frame of time-reverse scene order) however shows that horrible events can, if not undone, at least be redeemed by time (i.e. by following events, in this case birth). ***SPOILER AHAD*** Story summary: Alex and Marcus are a happy couple. Alex learns that she is pregnant. They go to a party with their friend Pierre, who used to be Alex' boyfriend. Marcus is doing drugs. Alex is p***ed off by Marcus and leaves the party. On her way home, she gets brutally raped and beaten up by a pimp. Marcus and Pierre see her when she is taken away by an ambulance. They are offered help in finding the rapist by two local gangsters. They lead them to a gay club and tell them the name of the guy who raped Alex: Le Tenia (The Tapeworm). At the club, Pierre ends up killing another man, with The Tapeworm standing by watching. Marcus and Pierre are arrested by the police.Later Alex is shown at home highly pregnant and in a park playing with children. The very simple story deals entails the whole scope of human drama: Love; Hate; Evil; Senseless Sadism; Innocence Lost; Helplessness; Revenge; Fury; Death; Resumption of Life (Resurrection, Birth). ***END SPOILER***Avantgarde movie in the truest sense. Very fine, innovative camera-work. Highly Recommended.8/10",Irreversible
278,alycejunker,"Difficult to watch, even if you take the most difficult scenes out",7,1 February 2021,"A warning to start with...
To my LGBTQ friends, beware of derogatory language and depictions of our lifestyle. I think this is my biggest complaint about this movie. It paints a bad picture and I personally think it takes away from the film. If you can just try to ignore that part of the film (granted, it is about half the film) its easier to get throughNow, most reviews on here are tackling the plot and subject matter that makes the film difficult. I'm going to talk about the aesthetics of the film and how that actually also makes things difficult to watch. Not in a bad way, but if you don't like this style you wont like this film. By the way, if you want to skip the worst scene, it starts around 44 min and ends at about 56 min. Also, quick bit of movie history: the French were considered a little pretentious with their films, this was a response to the hoity toity movies. It has a very snuff-film feel1. Camera movement: The camera is basically a character of it's own. At first, I hated it. I just kept thinking ""this is what it would be like if someone strapped a GoPro to a fly"". However, there IS a reason for the erratic and constant camera movement that becomes more clear as the movie progresses. Basically, after the incident, everything turns chaotic and the camera is just as chaotic.2. The movie starts at the end and ends at the beginning: You get about 20 minute chunks, given to you in reverse order. I personally still can't decide why that decision was made. Especially since a new version was just released that puts it in order...which tells me the reverse order wasn't necessary. When devices like this are used, I expect a purpose (i.e. Momento), since there is no clear purpose in doing this, it annoyed me a little.3. Music: Camera that is constantly moving and erratic goes well with constant and erratic music. Music goes with the scenes the way the camera does, like it is a character itself. Becomes fully erratic and aggressive after the incident, but before the incident its more mellow.4. Marcus SUCKS! Team Pierre. Movie has lots to say about masculinity.",Irreversible
279,wheatdog,"Visceral, shocking, groundbreaking genius",10,23 March 2005,"I have seen this film only once. It needs multiple viewings, I feel, to fully appreciate it's merit. This is something that will come in time but I felt it was only right to comment after my first impression. I instantly gave the film 10 out of 10, not because I overly enjoyed it (nigh on impossible) but because it shook me, at times, to my very core and affected me in a way that I cannot easily or fully describe. I can honestly say Irreversible is the most devastating piece of cinema I've ever witnessed. This isn't solely due to it's shocking content but more so the production as a whole and how it has been constructed and packaged. It truly is a work of art. Camera-work, lighting, colour (primarily gaudy, striking tones of red and orange) all combine in an unforgettable amalgam of brilliance. Featuring towering performances from Cassel, Belluci and Dupontel the film lurches backward in time depicting the events of a truly tragic night in the lives of three friends. Alex (Belluci) is brutally raped on her way home from a party and Marcus (Cassel) and Pierre (Dupontel) set off determined to wreak vengeance on the perpetrator. However, that is merely the plot. Admittedly quite a simple premise but the way it is played out is unforgettable. This is a film that everyone should and arguably needs to see as it is, for me, a milestone of modern cinema. Raw and unflinching, can you stomach it?",Irreversible
280,jimamilstead,The only film to make me dry-heave!,8,29 March 2005,"If you're looking through these reviews, chances are that you've heard something about Irreversible, otherwise you wouldn't be here. Gasper Noe's vision is gut-wrenching, dizzying, sickening and disturbing. Time destroys everything - so the tagline goes. The first line of dialogue in the movie also states it: Time destroys all things. Irreversible narrative is told in reverse, so time cannot destroy everything, since it begins with destruction and shows you what was destroyed.***SPOILERS>>> The opening twenty minutes are the most disturbing I have ever seen, with swirling, dizzying camera movements through a seedy gay club where all sorts are going on, the music is pounding as our protagonist searches the hallways and dance floors for the man he is looking for, a man we only know as The Tenia... If you can hold onto your lunch when this man is found, you're a better man than I am... If you couldn't watch anymore, you should have disciplined yourself to sit through it further. With a beginning so violent and sickening, it can only get better can't it?? On my initial viewing, I had to stop watching during the ""fire extinguisher"" scene, I knew it was gonna be powerful stuff that followed and prepared myself for the worst...But the following scenes were nowhere near as violent, just a mad hunt through the streets of Paris, trying to find the man responsible...for what? Only time will tell what this man did.We find out soon enough, when Alex (Monica Bellucci) leaves a party early and enters a subway to get to the other side of the street. When will women learn?? Did she deserve to get raped? Of course not! But this kind of crime happens EVERY SINGLE DAY somewhere in the world, and it sickens me. Gasper Noe forces us to watch the most brutal rape and the unflinching camera captures every moment of Alex's pain. Why does this happen? Why? Why? Why?The movie ends with Alex's relationship with Pierre, romantic scenes of love, intimate conversations, the creation of a life. Why can't the world be like this?I implore all women to watch Irreversible... If only so they know (repeat: KNOW) the dangers that lurk around the corners of our life. Such perils cannot be erased, but we can prepare for them...""Hindsight is always 20/20""Time destroys everything, but should it?",Irreversible
281,jason_parallel,"Pure exploitation ""entertainment""!",7,7 March 2006,"It's been a long time since I've been creeped out by a movie, but Irreversible made my skin crawl. I sat in numb silence for about ten minutes after the movie was finished. As far as exploitation movies go, this one was possibly the most extreme I've ever seen.That said, I was impressed with the way this flick made me feel completely uncomfortable throughout the entire running time. The sounds, music, and especially the camera-work gave it a very claustrophobic feel. If it weren't for the porno/head smash/anal rape scenes, I could almost consider this an art-house movie, but the level of predatory sex and violence that run throughout 'Irreversible' throw it directly into the same pot as 'I Spit On Your Grave' and 'Devil's Experiment'. The director obviously tried to make the subject matter less ""mainstream"" by using various techniques, but in the end it's just a showcase for aberrant human behavior.By the way, I didn't watch this movie to be entertained; anybody who gets off on this kind of material obviously has mental problems. And to those of you who complain that this flick is misogynistic are missing the point. These types of movies are supposed to make us uncomfortable with our little lives, and 'Irreversible' does just that! All in all, this is a very well done movie. If you're gonna watch exploitation movies, you might as well watch something that's going to make you think a little bit...",Irreversible

As soon as the first ""strong"" sequence comes to the screen you'll notice at which level the director's vision is so realistic. Some scenes seem like a snuff movie. I don't understand why people who are so scared and emotionally touched by the movie are giving bad reviews; the movie is not a masterpiece but it really reach its goal: nobody walks outside the movie theater like before.Irreversible is dark & dirty like Hell... it could be a piece of normal life: the violence we watch on tv sometimes is worse and more scary. It remembers me when ""John Carpenter's The Thing"" opened in 1982: critics were talking bad about the movie because its realistic and scary effects. What happened 20 years later?

No, I don't like some of the subject matter, but this movie was really well done.  That kind of graphic violence can be either laughable or extremely realistic.  In the case of Irreversible, I have never seen it so accurate looking.  What I mean is that the violent scenes looked so real, it appeared that someone set a camera down and actually caught the real act on tape by accident.As someone previously said, I don't think this movie is for the faint of heart.

285,gilgeoIII,Tells the truth about terrible things.,10,21 January 2004,"This film has inspired emotions in audiences ranging from indignation to outrage to near violence in film festivals around the world. It offers elements similiar to a recent Hollywood product -- ""21 Grams""-- the annihilation of blameless victims by fate or a malevolent person, and the need for retribution and vengeance. These films represent to me the difference between Hollywood s*** and genuine art. Both offer superb leading actors. ""21 Grams"" is a ludicrous melodrama, confusing obfuscation and trickery with art. It's a ludicrous melodrama, gussied up with fancy cutting. Without it, the picture, by rights, would be laughed out of the theaters. On the other hand, ""Irreversible,"" is to film as Goya and his representation of Napoleon's invasion of Spain is to great art. It tells the truth about terrible things, and the truth, it seems, is the last thing audiences want these days",Irreversible
286,UniqueName76,Lies somewhere between art and perversion.,5,5 April 2005,"Unfortunately for my tastes it lies much closer to perversion than to art. To some viewers they will try to mask the gratuitous amounts of violence and sexual perversions contained in this movie as a sort of 'tool'. Yes it will leave you desolate, alone, the director practically rapes your eyes and mind, however as for me, I did NOT think it was necessary to see Monica Belucci get anally pounded for 12 minutes on screen. Also the homosexual club was truly hellish, and the guy who they kill (wrong guy OOPS) death scene was not ""awesome"" it was hellish, I actually half turned my face in horror it was so well done, and that's saying something since there's very few scenes in movies that scare me.However when the whole movie unwinds, there is no momentous twist, or grand revelation, or big understanding or underlying themes that come together. The movie is very straightforward, 3 people obsessed with sex go to a party, where one of them does cocaine, the other obviously still has feelings for the girl. She's pregnant. The two walk out of the party to cool off (mainly Vincent) at this time Monica Belucci is raped and beaten for 12 minutes in an under passage. When Vincent hears of this he goes on a rampage through France's seedy underbelly of hookers, she-males, and gay S&M clubs until they reach the wrong guy and kill him. That's it. It's this momentous let down that I score this movie a 5. It felt like low grade porn with some mild action at the end. The interesting lighting and camera work elevate this movie beyond porn.",Irreversible
287,filmaniacist,"Honest, vivid, brilliant, outrageous and unpleasant",10,14 December 2016,"In many movies, the tension and the impact on the audience is built from scratch. Usually, you are set to prepare for the crisis and it gives you comfort, knowing that you are adapted to the story. ""Irreversible"" is another work of reverse chronological storytelling (similar to Memento) and it takes you off guard, it makes you sick, it makes you want to reconsider leaving and most of all it's disgusting at times. But there's a delicacy in the disgust, the horror and the trauma you feel after witnessing an incredibly vivid scene as a guy's head and brain becomes mashed potato. If you're at home you'll be forced to pause and fast-forward it or simply click away VLC. If you're at the cinemas you'll be forced to close your eyes and cover your ears to the infrasound that surely will make you sick any second. Or, leave the cinema as it's one of the most walked-out-of-cinema movie of our time. The delicacy is that it's messing with your mind. You don't want to watch a brutal murder and raping scene but at the same time it's the reality of our world. People get away with rape and people murder in such way (not that we learn that through media). If it's happening to our fellow human, why should we turn away from it? It is obvious that Gaspar Noé wants to create an anxious, atrocious and adrenaline-filled state of mind, not only the visual experience but also the raw, brutal and 'honest' French dialogue that many have stated as sexist and homophobic during the scenes at the French gay club. The anger Marcus (Vincent Cassel) possesses is hard to flash by without notice, what's harder is to understand him. What happened for him to act aggressively violent and homophobic? Or Pierre (Albert Dupontel), who is the one bashing the innocent man's head in, remains one of the calmest characters in this play. Disturbingly exciting. Marcus and his pal Pierre is set to revenge Marcus girlfriend Alex's (Monica Bellucci) perpetrator who raped her for ten minutes of the movie, therefor the explanation of the violence in the first scene. The display is viewing an innocent woman being raped from behind by a drug influenced middle-aged man, and a bit in the act we witness a man in distant, entering the tunnel and walking away. The criticism I've heard after watching the movie was that the raping scene was too graphic and too long, basically a really hard scene to watch. This is an incredible movie because there's no sugar-coating therefor the reality of the story, it's true to women that have gone through the same nightmare, the craving for vengeance of her closest and the consequences of every step of the way. How come we watch blockbusters and adore them, award directors for their mainstream work (don't get me wrong there's a lot of good ones out there) but at the same time neglect the movies that mirrors everyday life? As with racism, poverty and other differences in the world, sexual violence only affect those who are/have been affected by it. That concludes why the man walking in and out of the tunnel during the raping scene left many wondering. The acting, heartfelt and true, by the three main characters is exceptional throughout the movie. Bellucci speaks French with aplomb and confidence, and endures one of the most raw raping scenes in movie history. Perhaps Gaspar Noé wants to indicate how the act of revenge is pointless; by showing Pierre killing the wrong guy (although the guy is still a rapist, for attempting to rape Marcus) while Alex's rapist was standing feet away inspecting the murder. It depends on the perspective, what you chose to believe but it might as well be one of the many messages Noé wants to convey in this movie.Or, another message as to why the rapist didn't get caught. I don't know how many but I can guess a lot of women who are victims of such sick, disgusting and horrible crime don't get the end result of their 'revenge' – the rapist is never convicted while the women remain scarred for the rest of their lives.",Irreversible
288,accercel,Interesting film technique without much substance,5,18 July 2005,"Yes, the film technique is prodigious and inventive, but that's about all this film has to show. In his tentative to make out of Irreversible a subtle meditation about relationships, love, violence and destiny, the director succeeds only in having a juvenile, therefore superficial, glimpse at all these themes. Irreversible lacks substance and unfortunately this lack of substance is not compensated by the visual spectacle: the Dantesque homosexual bar called Rectum or the infamous rape scene, probably the longest in the history of cinema are images/scenes one can't easily forget. Characters aren't veridical - and that's a flaw in a movie that tends to talk about life and destiny. The script, the lines have the same shortcomings and only the fact that the movie runs from the end to the beginning makes it a little bit more interesting. But I'm afraid this couldn't be enough to make it worth viewing.",Irreversible

There is no middle ground; this film can only inspire love or hate. No one will find it merely ""okay."" Ultimately, I decided to award a perfect rating just because of the visceral reaction I had. I appreciated Irreversible, but that doesn't mean I always enjoyed watching it. There were times I wanted to shut off my television, the pictures on screen becoming too graphic and upsetting, but I didn't. When I finally reached the end (or is it the beginning of this twisty narrative?) I felt like I had accomplished something great just by absorbing the frames of this film.

That way, I'm absolutely sure I'm going to view it at least twice. However, I bought this movie without hesitation because all the awards the packaging flaunted. Well... that'll learn me. ;o) I can't say the technique (movie going backwards in time) was so original because we saw it in Memento. Who knows, it was probably done before that as well. What I can say for sure is that it was way too violent. It does hit you like a tone of bricks. If you want to be shocked, this is your movie. Speaking for myself only, I don't mind being shocked as long as the movie has a purpose. Apparently, the director's purpose was to show that ""rape"" is a horrible thing. Well, I already knew that. I didn't need such a long and brutally graphic scene to tell me that. I had to fast forward through that scene since I developed a headache halfway through it. Pros: I do believe the way the camera flips around giving you the sense of a chaotic state of mind was very effective. If that was original, then it was a brilliant technique. The lighting, camera angles and editing were superb.Cons: The gratuitous violence ruined it for me. It was hard to relate to the characters.

293,Nymphocat,The Guiltiest of Cinematic Pleasures,7,2 May 2021,"Gaspar Noé is a sick nihilist, and the fact that he definitely embraces that fact with pride makes the delivery of his work all the more sensual in its inadequacy. Anything he does is a one-viewing guilty pleasure, and Irreversible is the guiltiest of them all (on account of it being his most (in)famous film).I'm always a weakling for films that challenge the constructs of the cinematic experience. Not talking about plots or characters, although they can definitely be mutual. No. It's the films that take you for a ride, that break the boundaries of the orthodox way of presenting an idea or a plot, something Gaspar Noé has proven to always try, seasoning it with a generous spoonful of nihilism and human despair. At the center of his weird cinematic universe (the movie opens with a monologue from a character from another Gaspar film, The Butcher) lies Irreversible, a tragedy told in reverse.It is unfortunate that its fame as the raw depiction of the brutal r*pe of its main character has unfortunately tainted its perception in the public eye, in what it's otherwise one of the most fascinating and unique depictions of the concepts of revenge and inevitability, as we see the actions first and the consequences later, supported by its maddening sense of nausea provided by a camera manned by a heavily dosed Gaspar, as we descend into the silent madness of the late streets of France. There were genuinely surprising sequences within Irreversible that display a mastery of cinematography, as I kinda was expecting it to be more ratchet, what with its independent status and all that, but instead melodically puts you in the position that you need to be into, in every given scene. It is, even a respectful portrayal of a r*pe scene in such a way. Unfaced, unerotic, raw and harrowing, static, as if time itself was stopped in its horror, never stepping away for gratuitousness. There were definitely moments where the spoken plot and the later scenes feel unimportant and boring, but I guess it makes sense, since we see the climax of the story right at the beginning. It's functional in its purpose, but it sometimes comes off as ""too alternative"", making some of its steps in uniqueness hurdle its rewatchability.(I would be lying if I said that it isn't an unpleasant film. I doubt I'll give it a second viewing, and I advise anyone (especially those suffering from vertigo and epilepsy) to thread on this film with care. It's not an adventure for the uninitiated/nonconsenting, and watching it it's definitely equivalent to consenting to getting punched in the face, so if you decide to watch it, you can't really complain, as you've been warned). I It is recommendable for anyone deeply interested in cinema, as it is a trip from start to end, and it's an example of audiovisual arts taking themselves seriously as the means of human creativity.Speaking of audiovisual, the big surprise is definitely Thomas Bangalter, who delivers a unique, Oscar worthy soundtrack, unveiling a record both analogous to the catchy commercial style of his role as one half of Daft Punk, and posing as a subversive, ear melting symphony of sensory nausea that compliments the already unwatchable visuals. Some of the songs from the soundtrack are some of my personal favorite works from him, and that's saying something considering Homework exists...Le temps detruit tout. It really does.",Irreversible
294,TheWylde,"Desperate, Manipulative Nonsense",1,28 May 2009,"What happens when a no talent film maker covers up his lack of creativity with attention grabbing violence? From the high rating on here, apparently idiots rejoice! I guess when a film maker makes the pretentious and terrible decision to keep a camera moving constantly we're supposed to applaud his creativity. We're not talking Tony Scott style camera moves, we're talking unapologetic messy camera movement with ZERO redeeming quality. Yes, the scenes are blocked well and it's obvious the camera man was told to hit ""point A"" at ""beat 1"" and ""point B"" at ""beat 2"" but between these beats we have constant rocking of the camera that simulates nothing but the rocking of a camera. It doesn't feel like we're on a boat or falling or much of anything at all. Just a rocking camera. Bravo, jackass.The soundtrack. Just annoying, nothing more (it didn't nauseate me). Its just bad... obtrusive and bad.Okay, so now we get to the violence that is allegedly ""brave"" or to be commended. I'm a fan of genre films and violent movies but don't insult my intelligence. It seems to me that it is only there to shock and detract from a boring movie. It reminds me of when someone is mad and they want to make you mad so they go out of their way to insult you. You're trying too hard and I'm not blind to the pile of s**t you're feeding me. You wanna impress me? Make a movie where that kind of s**t is necessary to the story. Make a movie where you can actually defend the violence. It takes no talent or creativity to put violence in a movie. Zero... the talent lies in giving it REAL purpose beyond its own presence.This movie only gets noticed because simulating rape in porn is illegal and this is the closest people can get for now. There is a taboo about rape and rebellious people like to embrace taboos to show how truly against the grain they really are. Don't mistake your stroke material for good film making. You're just embarrassing yourself when you do.Lastly, those of you that liked this pile are defending it in your head saying ""He missed the point... its supposed to make you uncomfortable.

295,DeltaParadox,a shocking tragic masterpiece,8,20 December 2007,"this movie will disturb you as it shows some really graphic content-sexual images in a gay sex club, a brutal murder with a fire hydrant, a sustained rape and beating and other scenes. but yet when you watch it you feel a shocking sense of realism and tragedy about how someone's life in a regular night can be destroyed in a tragic moment it shows you the consequences of anger, violence, hate and revenge. it is told in a superb way backwards because it starts of dark and ends in a beautiful peace which in fact makes it more tragic. watch it if you think you can handle it for it is quite good but not necessarily enjoyable and the moment between Alex and Marcus at the end is quite touching. THIS FILM IS NOT RATED BY THE MPAA BUT THIS IS HOW I WOULD RATE IT - NC-17 for - brutal graphic violence, degenerate images of perverse sexuality and graphic nudity, a sustained intense brutal rape sequence, language and sexual dialogue, and drug use.",Irreversible
296,zmarc,Tough to watch but successful film experiment,8,26 March 2003,"This is the controversial French film some critics are calling ""unwatchable"" because of the extreme violence and sex. It's definitely an experimental film, but it worked for me. The story is a simple one: a girl is raped and her boyfriend kills the rapist. But Noe tells the story in reverse, which makes the entire movie far more complicated. We watch as this guy tracks down another in a gay sex nightclub. When he finds him, he smashes his head with a fire extinguisher again and again until it's flattened into a bloody mess. The camera does not break away from this violent scene and it's quite brutal, though not that long. Then we jump back in time to see how the guy found out about the nightclub, then how he found out about the rape (he sees his girlfriend being dragged away on a stretcher, her face covered in blood, and he's told she's in a coma). Then we see the rape itself -- an amazingly frank piece of cinema. It's long, ten or fifteen minutes, and the camera doesn't move. It just goes on and on, and when it's finally over, the guy totally beats the girl's face into a bloody pulpy mess. This is definitely not an enjoyable film up to this point. As the ""narrative"" continues, we move to the party where the girlfriend and boyfriend are before she leaves early, and then before that on the way to the party. The final scene is the two alone at home, in bed, showing the playful and loving sides of their relationships, and making sex seem delightfully innocent.As I said, a simple tale, but told in reverse. Here's the effect of that reversal, however. First, when we see the guy seeking revenge against the rapist, we have no idea what he is doing or why. He seems like an insane person. Later, of course, we understand, but by showing his revenge first, we're far more shocked and horrified by his violence than we would be otherwise. Second, when we experience the rape (and I do mean experience), we haven't yet met the girl. She's faceless at that point (emphasized by Noe by not showing us her face until later). This has the effect of both dehumanizing her (she's faceless) and making her an everywoman (she could be anyone). Those are important because we don't form judgements about her. Later, when we ""meet"" her for the first time, our perceptions of her change. We get to know her after the rape instead of before, and while you might think that knowing her first would make the rape more powerful, it works even better in reverse, since we have no opinion of her at all before the rape. That enhances the trauma of the rape, making it seem even more barbaric and unfair. For example, once we meet the girl we might see how provocatively she dresses and judge her, saying she asked for the rape. But Noe avoids us thinking that way by having the movie in reverse.
The other thing about the reverse gimmick that makes it so powerful is that we go from brutal, cruel, and ugly images to beautiful and innocent images (the reverse of real life which tends toward destruction not creation). The final shots of laughing children running through a lawn sprinkler is all the more heart-breaking because we know that that innocence is already (or will be) lost. The tragedy of lost innocence is expressed far more powerfully in this technique. The whole film is an exercise to show us this, as Noe emphasizes with two techniques: color and camera movement. The first fifteen minutes of the film is positively headache inducing as the camera is never still and never at any normal angle. It's as though they mounted the camera on the back of a dog chasing his tail: the image spins and whirls and rarely do we see anything recognizable (which, while they're in the gay nightclub, is a good thing ;-). But gradually, as the film continues, the camera becomes more and more passive, leading to total stillness during the rape. The colors at the beginning of the film (the end of the story) are all dark, bleak, and there's a lot of red. By the time we get to the end (the beginning) there's brightness, sunlight, happiness, and wonderfully green grass. While this makes the beginning of the film tougher to endure (wild camera and dark, ugly images), it makes sense storywise. As the boyfriend seeks revenge, he gets more and more angry and agitated, and so does the camera. Logically, the landscape gets bleaker as well.Noe's script uses what we might call reverse foreshadowing: in the normal direction there are hints of the dire future so that when it comes it subconsciously feels expected. But foreshadowing is such a subtle thing that few notice it. In reverse, however, foreshadowing is far more powerful. For instance, after we've seen the rape, we hear (before that) someone say, ""Be safe"" to the girl, and that takes on a terrible irony since we know she won't be. In another scene, the girl talks about a book she's reading where people dream of their future, and later (at the end of the film) we see that happen to her. Since we already know her future, her premonition is even more dramatic and there's no suspense of ""Is she crazy or do we believe her?"" We know she's right and that's scary. The reverse technique is fascinating when used properly.As many have said, this film is tough to watch. The violence is brutal and shown in an unflinching fashion. While difficult, that's real life. I personally prefer this kind of realistic violence than Hollywoodized versions that glorify it. This absolutely does not glorify violence or rape at all: it presents it in horrible reality. Other films have tried to show realistic violence, especially rape (think Jodie Foster in The Accused), but this film, by getting rid of camera tricks and just showing us the brutal reality straight on without blinking, does a more credible job of expressing the horror and obscenity of such acts. Some critics have said that this film is obscene itself, but that's not true: the rape and violence it shows is obscene, but not the film itself. The film is the messenger, not the message; the vehicle, not the passenger. The film makes an incredibly powerful statement about destiny, reality, violence, and sex, and provokes us to think about our attitudes toward those things. If you can bear it, it's worth seeing.",Irreversible
297,turbo_torben,One has to decide for him/herself...,8,16 June 2004,"In Denmark this movie gave the critics quite a problem; Almost everyone thought the movie was great, however they just couldn't recommend it to anyone, because of it's violence. - After seeing I couldn't agree more with this viewpoint.The major point that critics has argued about regarding this move is of course the violence, or rather; is the violence just a plain gimmick, to give the movie more public attention? I would say ""No"". The violence is perfectly integrated into the story. Some critics says the violence is too much. I would say; how in the world would anyway be able to describe a violent rape, without making it extremely painfully to look at? Not many movies (especially Hollywood movies) would have the guts to show the ugly nature of a rape (with exceptions such as Monster and Straw Dogs).Irreversible is the kind of movie that one has to decide whether he or she wants to see. Luckily one will know about 15 minutes from the beginning of the movie whether one has the stomach for this violent and ugly masterpiece. Consider it a relief.",Irreversible
298,italbarenow,The most homophobic film in every way - barely a spoiler - just gay bashing,1,11 October 2013,"There is a hatred of gay men in virtually every frame of this film. Some of it is on the top layer, but the majority of it lies just underneath. It's clearly written by a heterosexual bully, and deals with outdated film stereotypes, but creates new ones, disgusting ones. The movie plot is also full of sh*t regarding gay men, and none of it is even close to reality. Not only would the centerpiece of the film (a rape) hinge on a machismo guy trading one hooker for our whore heroine, we are supposed to believe he is primarily a gay anal rapist. This makes the entire plot point simply a lazy excuse to start the film off (end up) in a gay S&M sex club to make it as shocking as possible.I have been to every type of sex club there is, first hand, and although I do not partake in S&M I believe everyone has a right to their sexual freedom as long as no one gets hurt. There is a constant barrage of false imagery as they go through this club, gay men do not even remotely ever behave in this way, regarding real violence, although sex club behavior and general piggishness would still be shocking to most people. It's not the sex or the dress, it's the brazen witnessing of real true violence and no one even appearing the least bit phased by it, and even masturbating to it. Stereotypes of the ""gay man bottom"" running around screaming for anyone to please put their fist or anything into their ""rectum"" in exchange for information is an insult. Yes Virginia, gay S&M clubs exist, but readers please understand, this is not simply an exaggerated look - this is complete and utter nonsense meant only to shock you and to use the mock-depravity of gay male sodomy to disgust you down to the last thought. Rape wasn't enough. Bisexual psychopaths who anal rape both sexes equally? It's barely evident in real crime.And to add the final insult - the director himself was afraid of being accused of being homophobic - he is - he returned to the S&M club to film HIMSELF as the masturbating man witnessing one of the most violent deaths (discussion point) filmed.It's lighting is too dark to often see important information, and the opening soundtrack is deliberately culled from vibration sounds meant to trigger nausea and vertigo in the viewer. So he arrogantly wanted to insure people would walk out of the theater, so he basically ""drugs"" the audience into getting sick with the soundtrack, Between that and himself masturbating in his own film, it isn't worth it. Full disclosure: I am a film fan of controversial films and I seek them out to see when the intersection of story, cinematography, and shock make for a truly adrenaline experience.

300,Hashimuri,cruel and unusual,5,17 March 2004,"If the editing in this film actually ordered the scenes sequentially as opposed to adopting the Memento-style the-end-as-beginning approach, I would advise anyone renting the DVD to pause the movie two-thirds through (up to when Alex tells Marcus that she's leaving the party and says good-bye to Pierre), before carefully considering the cost of continuing: i.e. are you willing to subject yourself to the visually and psychologically gruelling and nauseating disintegration of what has otherwise been a subtly engaging, flawlessly-acted story? (And when I say disintegration, I mean in terms of narrative, dialogue, character development, cinematography, camerawork, the whole shebang - annihilation would be a more accurate term.) But because of the Memento-style chronology, you are subjected to this final third first, and I can assure you it's not very pleasant. You pray for it to get better. It does, of course, but it subsequently renders what you've already witnessed all the more horrendous. Director Gaspar Noé is gratuitously and excessively cruel, to both his characters and the audience. The theme seems to be the force of impulse-driven revenge, among other things - but what a painful execution it is! Furthermore, I took issue with the portrayal of homosexual males in this film, for it was very one-dimensional if not outright demeaning.I will admit that once you've actually sat through it, an intrinsic but irrational curiosity will beg you to rewatch the final third of the story (which is to say, the movie's beginning) in order to place the events within a larger context. I still have not satisfied this curiosity, because like I say, my gut feeling tells me it's completely irrational and I will very much regret it afterwards.",Irreversible

302,mavisheh,"Good in style, over use of violence loses the point",5,8 April 2003,"The thing that I don't understand is that so many critics have compared Irreversible to Memento. I find that a simple comparison as all the two films have in common is the fact that the sequence of scenes is backward, which makes it not enough for comparing two films to each other.The movie is very well done in style, the cinematography is good, and Vicent Cassel is a good actor as usual (Belluci is not good at all), altough he doesn't bring anything new to his performance.The rest of the film fails. One can debate that we are saying this because we are closing our eyes to the violence that is so existing in our environment and that is one reason why people get raped and get killed more and more every year, because we are in denial of the graveness of violence.
I am a strong advocate of 'not closing your eyes to the truth and reality no matter how ugly and hard it is', but I think Irreversible exaggerates.The very long scene of rape starts so tense and painful for the audience that it can have the strongest effect and can work best as an anti-violence message (if that is anything near what Noe tried to get to) but towards the end of the scene, you are not as touched as before anymore, simply because of the repetition factor. You can see through the scene, you can see that this is a ""film"", that they are ""acting"". It also makes you think of the motives of the director to include this scene in that length. Is it for testing the audience's tolerance, is it a test of going to extremes, or is it just pure masochism and perverseness? You wonder whether you are betrayed by the director and he is indeed the rapist and not the raped?!That is where the movie fails and loses the point. If Noe had kept the violent scenes shorter and more subtle and had worked on the very weak and bad conversations, the film would have touched many more people on a different level (this holds for the cab scene and for the murder in the night club scene as well).It is a big responsibility to recommend it to others, so be careful who you are recommending it to.",Irreversible
303,thanatonaute,more than merely provoking,10,8 June 2002,"everybody talks about this film; how shocking it is, the rape scene etc. (by the way the rape is only the second most disturbing scene in the film)but there is so much more in this film.in the beginning you think, 'jesus, what the hell is this, haven't they heard what a bloody steady-cam is?', but after the rape scene you understand that the camera movements give back the state of mind of the characters; particularly of marcus and pierre.then all the separate scenes have been shot in one take, and they all last from 8 up to 15 minutes or so. quite some work you can imagine...the story-telling is then not really new, you will find yourself thinking 'ok, I have seen memento too...', but nevertheless, as in memento this has a reason (even though it is not the same). here the title explains why telling the story backwards: 'irréversible' means which can't be undone (literally which can't be turned back), and that's why we begin with the end, so we know, that whatever the characters do, the end will be the same.quite an experience this film is; but you need to have strong nerves and a strong stomach...",Irreversible
304,BackFire83,Traumatic,8,11 August 2003,"SPOILER ALERT When i first heard about this movie, i was immediately intrigued.  It was a movie that supposedly had people throwing up in theaters and walking out because of its horrific images and truthfull portrayal of rape and revenge...  it sounded right up my ally.  Now, i was expecting a pretty bad movie with some pretty gruesome scenes.  the plot seemed generic enough; woman gets raped, friends of rape victim go for revenge.  the movie is told backwards like memento.. sounded kinda lame, but any movie that had an impact on audiences like this movie did needed to be seen as far as im concerned.  When i finally got a chance to see the movie, i was absolutely astonished by the assualt on the senses that this movie is...  and whether you are intrigued by this movie as i was, or whether it sounds like a piece of garbage to you,  i guarantee that this movie, no matter who you are or what you've seen, will haunt you unrelentlessly for days, and will stay inbedded in your mind for years to come.The movie as i said, is about a woman who gets raped and beaten to the point of being put into a coma.  The friends of the woman then go out for revenge, but the twist is its told in reverse, so we actually begin with the vengeful act, and work out way bacwards to the rape scene that occurs at about the halfway point...then after we witness the rape scene, we see the hours leading up to it.  now you may be asking why the movie is told in reverse. Definately a credible question, since at first thought it sounds like a gimmick and nothing more.  I will attempt to explain why this is done. First, it gives us a gods eye view of these events, its almost like we're seeing into the future and seeing the events before the characters in the movie technically experience them.  this make the whole movie, extremely eerie and sad.  it makes every event seem tragic, no matter how trivial or happy, because it is in the shadow of this horrible tragedy that we know is just hours away from happening to this woman.  Something else the movie achieves by telling the story backwards is that it does not lead up to violence and sex as a finale or a pay off.  instead we see the events first, and are forced to deal with them for the remainder of the movie.  and again, every scene after the tragedy is haunted by the rape.
I personally was very impressed with this movie, it is very effective and masterfully done.  Never before has rape been shown so truthfully and tragically.  There are no quick cuts to make the rape seem more exciting, there is no dramatic close ups or heavy music playing to enhance the drama. It is surreal, it is sickening, it is slow and painful for the viewer, just as it would be for the victim, it is not glorified in any way, and is shown as the pure tragedy that rape is.  I am not ashamed to say that i was brought to tears by this scene, it is extremely sad.  The acting by both the victim and the attacker is so convincing that if you saw the actor of the attacker on the street you would want to attack him.  its truley amazing and should be applauded for its honesty towards rape.  Also the opening scene where we see the two friends of the victim hunting down the bad guy in an underground S&M club for demented men, is also very disturbing and really gives the movie a proper dark and horrific start that shows the audience exactly what they're in for, and if they cant handle this, then they should leave because it only gets worse...Something else i noticed about this movie is its attempt to show both the horrors of the world and the beauty in the world.  The tempo of the movie changes so dramatically from beginning to end that you wouldnt even know it was the same movie.  It begins with dark madening camera shots seemingly out of control and spinning around to convey a sense of insanity, while showing horrific images for the first 40 minutes.  towards the end however, we are greeted with beautiful scenes of pure love and tenderness as we see the future rape victim with her boyfriend in bed, obviously madly in love, and we realize was a fine line we walk between happiness and tragedy.  this is a very unique touch to teh film, because what would normally be considered a happy ending to a movie, is absolutely heart breaking with it being shown in the shadow of the tragedy that is only hours away.Irreversible is a great movie, but that isnt to say that everyone wll like it or respect it.  But it is a movie that is undeniably honest with its portrayal of rape and loss, and will give a face to every faceless woman we hear about who was raped on the news.  Definately a powerful movie that no one will ever forget after watching.9 - 10",Irreversible

Not to mention the fact the films ends with a long dose of strobe lighting that gave me a headache.Everything about this film was done better in I stand alone. Noe has let his nihilism get the better of him here. How are we supposed to care about the characters when he doesn't- and anyone inclined to try and form a connection with the characters would be too put off by the violence. The pointlessly angry racism, shown here in the cab scene was done much better in I stand alone too- it was cold, irreversible is pointless.And we move onto the violence. And heres a problem- it's been hyped to the extent that that everyone going in imagined it was worse than it was, and strangely therefore, I was left thinking ""so what, Salo was worse"" when I came out, hey maybe Noe's nihilism is spreading! This is not helpful. Only 2 of the 150 or so crowd walked out, (which was less than did during a murder scene in the unhyped My little Eye BTW) so I think this was a common problem. And where's Noe gonna go for his next film? It can't really get any darker.I quite liked the fact that each scene was 1 shot, and the concept time destroys everything was interesting if underdeveloped, and I get the point that movies should be like real life, but that is no excuse for this film.

As well as the lengthy rape and graphic violence, the film is shot in such a way as to bring on sea-sickness or an epileptic fit.Using the backwards narrative technique from MEMENTO, a simple rape and revenge story is told in reverse, meaning that we see the revenge, then the rape, and then the characters getting on with their lives before the whole thing happened. The revenge section of the film is largely unspectacular but at least manages to keep the viewers interest as the story unfolds.After the rape scene, the story (such as it is) has been told but the film is not over. There are lengthy scenes of the characters at a party, etc that get more and more tedious. A laughably contrived sub-plot about real events being predicted in our dreams is added, as is a revelation about the rape victim that is presumably intended to make the rape scene seem even more shocking.The film contains an excellent special effect (the face smashing scene) and the rape scene is not filmed in a titillating way (apart from the woman's near-see-through dress). But really, there is nothing here to make the film worth watching. Noe ends the film in a way that confirmed to me that this is nothing more than an exercise in inducing nausea.

309,uncertainwonder-1,viciously beautiful,8,19 July 2013,"Even though he's only made three feature films, director Gaspar Noe has made a name for himself, especially as connected to the New French Extremity movement in cinema. His movies are dark, unsettling, and follow the theme that time destroys everything.That theme is explicitly stated in ""Irreversible"", Noe's second film. The plot of this movie is simple: a woman is raped and her boyfriend teams up with her ex-boyfriend to get revenge. What makes this movie unique is that the sequence of events is shown in reverse order. If you don't recognize that's what's going on, the movie will make absolutely no sense.We begin at the ending of the story (actually, the movie starts with the end credits), and the final scene is where the story starts. By doing this, the entire theme of the revenge genre is turned on it's head. What would normally be seen as a movie about consequences now becomes a movie more about predestination. You get the impression that the events in the movie had to happen that way - nobody had any choice in the matter. Events and conversations that don't make sense when you see them become all too clear later in the movie, when it's earlier in time. In addition, showing the revenge before the crime forces the audience to consider the morality of the situation from a different perspective - you literally see how revenge doesn't change anything.The movie is quite controversial for its two violent scenes - the rape and the revenge. Those two scenes are extremely hard to watch.Noe is also known for loopy camera work, strobe lighting, and low-frequency noises.

311,mzmorpheus09,One Flaw,7,19 October 2010,"As a fan of alternative, indie and foreign films, I wanted to see this. The way the filmmaker plays with the time line, bouncing forward and backward, is excellent and achieves the desired effect of upping the suspense and making the audience want to continue watching.Vincent Cassel is always good as a physical, visceral French actor in a league full of bloated, overly intellectual performances. His cohort, Albert Dupontel's Pierre, is a calm counterpoint to Cassel's Marcus who is an emotional loose cannon.BUT, I just had one problem. As usual, a glowingly beautiful model (Monica Bellucci) plays the lead, Alex. Most French filmmakers cast women who are photogenic above all else. Who cares if they can even say their lines? Just as long as they look stunning in wide-angle shots.Bellucci's Alex is dead flat and predictable. She's a prop shoved up against Marcus, the live wire. She even has trouble delivering some of the key lines in the film, like when she mentions a premonitory dream she has or stumbles when talking about a philosophy book she's reading (ya know, that's all French model/actresses do? lay in parks all day in skimpy dresses while reading philosophy). They may as well had her say no lines and instead just walk around with a big sign on her forehead (or ass) that says FEMALE VICTIM.My biggest problem with the rape scene isn't the length or graphic violence, but the flaccid, helpless behavior of Alex. She doesn't run, she doesn't kick, doesn't bite, punch -- or really DO anything most rape victims do when attacked. Several minutes go by before the evil rapist even bothers to pull out his modest pocket knife but does Alex try and knee him in the groin? No. She whimpers, avoids making eye contact with the camera and then cowers for 9 long minutes while he sodomizes her and then beats her into a coma.I can't help but wonder what my favorite French filmmaker, Patrice Chéreau, would have done with this umpteenth re-telling of the stock Revenge Fantasy.",Irreversible

Even the sex scenes suck, the plot is inexistent, the way of thinking the movie was creative (starting with the end, finishing with the beginning), but lamentably put on the screen.Every guy who honestly thinks about seeing this movie should get an attorney to sue the director afterwards. Waste of time which is life & money. Typical for a french movie.PS : My deepest Condolences to those who've had their time killed.",Irreversible
313,landry22,A film as horrible and beautiful as life itself,9,14 June 2002,"Although not a masterpiece, this movie comes close to being brilliant. The simplicity of the story makes it all the more difficult to bear, which might explain why so many people misunderstood its purpose.This movie isn't for everyone. It is troubling, disturbing and demands a lot of emotional commitment from its viewers. But ""Irreversible"" is not pure violence. True, it is violent both morally and physically but none of it is gratuitous or unmotivated.Anyone saying that ""By the end of the movie, my eyes were aching, I could no longer bear to watch any more painful scenes"" obviously hasn't watched it until the end and probably left after 30 minutes or so. The beauty of Irreversible resides in the equilibrium between violence and beauty. The fact that Belluci plays the victim isn't innocent. The impact wouldn't be the same with a less godly looking actress. But to understand the whole project you have to see it all. By the time the movie is over, the last half hour is what I remembered most. All the hope, the beautiful people in love, the nice home etc. Then the memory of what I had just seen an hour before started to come back.With a simple story, which could easily have been cliche and conventional, Noé manages to make a film as horrible and as beautiful as life itself.",Irreversible
314,praagsigaar,"Definately a very, very disturbing and thus good movie",10,30 January 2003,"It is seldom that a movie is able to make one think twice about it(certainly if you see many) Irreversable is one of those movies. If you've seen la Haine andliked it, or ""C'est arrive pres de chez vous', I would recommend thisone for sure (rating it even higher). It is, for instance, shocking without that many shocking images. It'sin the way the camera moves, it's in the editing, the story and themusic. The acting is sublime. The director succeeded in creating an atmosphere that eventuallygrasps you by the throat and drags you deeper down into themovie's gore reality. Such is life, this could happen to you! Yet, it'sgruesome and unimaginable. Although a bit like Memento in it's reverse mode, this movie keepsyou in the simple story where it's very easy to get lost in Memento'smany clever tricks. The irreversibility of life become painfully clearas the movie unfolds. It is very easy to dismiss a piece of work like this as a cheapchocker just because the message is too painful and the imagesare in your face. After the first 10 too boring minutes this moviemakes you angry, sad and impressed. See this movie!",Irreversible
315,DJ-Chojin,wow what a pointless movie,4,3 June 2006,"well what can i say? What was the point? This movie is just an excuse to show naked men and gay sex.This is an anti woman film with a pointless overlong anal female rape. There was no need for the gay porn at the rectum club or the male masturbation. the best part of the movie is in the rectum club where the rapist gets his brains smashed over the floor with a fire extinguisher. Also the film leaves unanswered questions such as did she die? what happened to the gangsters after they jumped in the taxi with the two main men after questioning the transvestite hooker? you see them get in the taxi. All in all this movie is a tasteless piece of female hate and gay exploitation. one more thing how on earth did the b.b.f.c (british board of film censers) pass this uncut when they still refuse to pass last house on the left, maniac, and new york ripper uncut.",Irreversible
316,aimtomisbehave,I can't decide if I liked it or not,6,21 March 2008,"I, as a jury, am still out. The rape and beating scene of Alex and the brutal scene in the Rectum notwithstanding, it just made me so sad.As an exercise in film-making it's jarring, nauseating and confusing and I had to frequently fast forward just to not get sick, but that's due to Noe's swirly camera-work and the soundtrack.As an acting piece, it's phenomenal, from Jo Prestia's Tenia's glee in causing someone pain to Vincent Cassel's blind rage in his quest for revenge and Albert Dupontel's seemingly helpless desperation to help somehow -- it's all first rate. I don't care what anyone says -- Monica Bellucci's Alex is brave and heartbreaking.When the story is examined, I can't help but think how sad it is that they got the wrong guy and how the boyfriend won't be there when (if) she wakes up and how the baby most certainly is lost.It just made me so sad, ultimately, at how fragile life is and how fleeting happiness can be.",Irreversible

Love the way it was handled better than I liked Memento, I think the acting - considering it was mostly done improv - was amazing and very real. Very high respect for Monica Belucci, she's amazing.Very raw and shocking at a couple points. I didn't like the spinning camera, though, and the flashes of space pictures at the end?

Its well acted and well shot (at times) and you get a feel for the characters before all hell breaks loose........Then we get to the crux of the problem, can someone explain to me why ANY film needs such a graphic (not always seen) rape scene, that seems to go on and on and on and on? Seriously, I can understand why there was a rape scene in the first place, but why does it have to carry on seemingly forever? This is an unpleasant well made film. The director and all the people who have commented (50 pages full for a film most movie goers have never heard of.....) can preach all they want about art etc, but this film has gotten so many replies on IMDb because it has a horrific (if not always seen) unending rape scene.Some of the people here disgust me.",Irreversible
320,zombiedeathbot77,"Dark, grim, disorienting, and unflinching filmmaking. Will surely scare away most, but will reward the brave with a challenging experience.",8,30 August 2013,"Brutal, realistic, and disorienting. ""Irreversible"" is told via the effective reverse expository method of Memento. When the viewer finally figures out exactly what is going on, he/she will feel a sense of vertigo as the previous events fall into place, and the brutality committed at the films beginning/end becomes something that the viewer can sympathize with. The film does not shy away from showing just how inhuman and terrifying the act of rape can be. The extraordinarily beautiful Monica Bellucci is the ideal actress to portray a woman who is unfortunately caught in the wrong place at the wrong time and falls victim to a depraved pervert who lacks empathy and morality. Her character makes a poor decision, and unfortunately thats all it takes in this world. Director Gaspar Noe has a brave unflinching artistic yet realistic directorial style, and this movie is his best since ""Mysterious Skin"". He creates effective visual tension and mood. The acting is all top notch. This film is a low-budget french film, so don't go in expecting glossy Hollywood style filmmaking. Rape is a subject that is usually shied away from as the central idea for a movie, and for good reason. Nobody likes to see such a terrible thing being done to women(aside from rapists themselves), so don't expect to enjoy this film. What the film does offer is a journey into the very heart of those whose lives are destroyed by this kind of horror. The films ending/beginning is as brutal and unflinching as the rape itself, so be prepared for lots of explicit violence, language, and nudity. Watch this film, and allow yourself to feel the rage of Cassells character, as his whole world is destroyed. His character is quickly overcome by his desire for revenge and becomes more and more unhinged as the film progresses/regresses so too does the camera-work and visual style of the film. All in all ""Irreversible"" is a dark and grim film of love, terror, tragedy and revenge. Not for the faint of heart, but rewarding for viewers looking for something challenging.",Irreversible
321,Pa007,Nothing but compliments,10,28 June 2003,"Irreversible is, quite simply, a work of genius. Although relatively short at 90 minutes, the whirlwind of emotions you are subjected to are incredible.Incredible seems too nice a word to use. Of course, i'm talking about the sickening level of violence in this film.Sitting down to watch this will be an experience you won't soon forget. It elects to portray the story it tells backwards, that is you see the final scene and then view the precursor to that scene, and so on. Some people may think that this removes the whole point of a film: You don't ask the question 'What happens next?'. However, while watching this film, you find that the stronger question is 'What happened before?'.Excellent acting and fantastic imagery top it off to leave you with an hour and a half you won't soon forget.Just a final note: Don't watch this if you have epilepsy.",Irreversible
322,WhatsYourPoint,"Time cannot be reversed, time cannot be changed.",8,16 February 2006,"""Time destroys everything."" This is the second line spoken in the film Irreversible, and it sets the theme, and the tone, for this disturbing, harrowing journey into the dark reaches of humanity.Irreversible begins with twisting camera work reminiscent of a roller-coaster ride from hell. The vomit-inducing cinematography matches well with the mind-set of the main character Marcus, who is obsessed with finding the man who brutally raped his girlfriend. Since the film is told in a backwards chronological order, we are thrown into the climax of the film, which includes the ferocious murder of a man with a fire extinguisher; however, the man who is killed is not the one who raped Marcus's girlfriend, Alex.This begins the next theme of the film: revenge is not the best course of action. From the scene where Marcus searches vehemently in the gay club, the Rectum, the story is then whisked back in time to an earlier scene. Here the protagonist, and his friend Pierre, ask around for the location of the club, where the rapist, called Le Tenia, is bound to be.During each consecutive scene, the spinning camera slows down, as to reflect the falling action. Eventually when the pivotal rape scene occurs, the camera no longer moves, but is stationary for most of the ten-minute long scene. The scene, which is notorious and infamous now, is disturbing and one of the most gut-wrenching scenes I've witnessed; yet, I was not injected with nightmares, but that is because I've become so desensitized to violence (quite sad right?). If you are sensitive to violence, however, then be extremely cautious when viewing Irreversible.After, or before, the rape scene the story almost completely halts and show us the lives of Marcus, Alex, and Pierre before tragedy decided to inflict itself upon their lives. The movie does suffer some because of this as the scenes can become tedious at times, especially one of the last scenes where Alex and Marcus lie in bed for an extended period of time. Much of the film's dialogue was ad-libbed, which shows as the scenes meander, along with the camera, which provides long takes in the scenes. I can say I am a fan of long shots, yet because of these shots the movie can not be edited, for each scene must be shot in one take to keep with the precedent previous scenes have set.If you are still wondering whether or not you should subject yourself to this agonizing visual experience, I suggest you do. The film will be imprinted into your cerebrum for a long time to come, and will actually make you think. As watching the film, I wondered whether the story was being told in reverse as a gimmick, or whether there was a deeper meaning to it all. Was time actually reversing, amending what had happened and returning the lives to the broken souls of the film? If this is the case, then the title itself presents another sense of irony, one that springs from the audiences desire that all of this could be changed, and everything could be returned back to normal.",Irreversible
323,benthelazar,"Nasty, brutish and utterly pointless",2,14 October 2017,"Say you were reading a novel. The reputation of this novel preceded it, it had been called one of the most intense ever written. The novel is 11 chapters long, and those chapters are only one or two long protracted sentences each. The second to last chapter is beautiful and brilliant. It recontextualizes the chapters that preceded it, and is so perfectly written that it feels like a privilege that you get to read it. But the remaining ten chapters ranged from pointless to artistically and morally inexcusable. Would you still read the novel?Gaspar Noe's Irreversible consists of 11 scenes, many of them seemingly filmed in one take. It is one of the most self indulgent films I've seen. It fails to make any point or to have any meaningful aesthetic; instead it simply exists to show that Noe could make a film like this. This is the greatest sin a film can commit. It's fine to make bold visionary films, it's fine to make films as unpleasant as this. But to make them for ego, and not for characters, ideas, stories or images is reprehensible.Irreversible is a vigilante movie at it's core. The success of this genre hinges on the audience knowing what is being avenged. We don't learn what is being avenged until scene 10, and it is beautiful, and we are forced to think ""was the previous hour worth it?"" I don't think it was. By structuring the film the way he has, Noe has robbed us of any characterization or motivation-we are left with ugly senseless violence that has the emotional impact of watching pigeons squabble on the street. And the movie still has the gall to think this will hurt us. Obviously a ten minute rape scene will be shocking. It does not take skill to make this.Maybe the pointlessness is Noe's point. Maybe this is an anti reactionary, anti violence movie. The racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia and violence shown here ultimately are so useless one could draw the conclusion that the movie is telling us to stay away from these modes in times where we crave revenge. But honestly, I just have no reason to care. I have no reason to think about this movie any more.",Irreversible
324,goacher,Almost A Masterpiece.But Not Quite,8,24 March 2005,"Irreversible is of the violent vigilantism genre. I think to elaborate on the storyline further would spoil the film, because it is not knowing what is happening that makes the film what it is.It is a very good film, but not quite a great one. Why not? Firstly, because the film is effectively played in reverse, you spend parts of the viewing time wondering what on earth is going on - and in a frustrating ""lost"" way rather than a captivated ""held in suspense"" way. It is not until near the end that you realise why the characters have been behaving as they have. Also, characters pop up out of nowhere - this has the effect of, at times, going beyond curiosity to create sheer frustration. (Personally, I thought Tarantino's concept of starting the movie in the middle (Reservoir Dogs) was more effective - it created two intriguing questions: what happened before and what happened after? You then got to see the beginning, followed by the end. THAT worked perfectly.) Secondly, rather like I Stand Alone (another Gaspar Noe effort) the violence is gratuitous and excessive. I am not easily shocked or prudish but was it really necessary for the graphic rape scene to last several minutes? There are other violent scenes that also go on for an unrealistically long time - the beatings dished out would, in reality, kill people long before they die in this film. What is the purpose of this? However, I am emphasising the negatives. Don't let this put you off. While frustrating at times, the film being played in reverse is what makes it so brilliantly thought-provoking and thrilling - it's a real brain teaser working it out. Overall, this is a riveting, brilliantly acted and original production. It's a worthy additional to anyone's collection. It's also a great display of how we can jump to the wrong conclusions about people by making snap judgements. The victims aren't victims, and the bad guys aren't bad at all! (Watch the film - then you'll understand.)",Irreversible
325,sacredmonk,Backwards Roller-coaster,6,15 May 2007,"This film uses a technique of going in reverse chronological order simply to add shock value to discoveries later throughout the film. You begin with what would actually be the end of the films story line, and then proceed to the beginning of the story line. The film wouldn't be as shocking were it in normal chronological order, and therefore, I believe, would not have received as many good ratings as other users have given it. Aside from being backwards merely to attract more attention to itself, the camera angles will remind you of a strange roller-coaster, often going up, down, left and right. The movie is filmed in a way that the camera is not steady, perhaps also to add to the shock value, and keep viewers in suspense. The keys to the suspense in this film lie not in the story line, but in the filming techniques and order of presentation. Remove those two key features, and you are left with a film that is mediocre at best. The story is of a man who seeks revenge, as you discover at the beginning of the film, and then proceeds to show the viewer the events leading up to this moment. The summary is not as jaw dropping, or shocking as others may make it seem, and to classify this movie as one of the most shocking films in history would be a huge overstatement. Don't get me wrong, the film is ""watchable"", however I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it. It's like one of those, if you've nothing better to be doing, why not.

BAD. the movement of the camera is so beyond annoying that after 20 min I couldn't watch more. Came back later to see the rest of the movie. So the camera it shakes moves and rotate so much with no reason than to look smarter and more original than other movies. The gay club atmosphere which is supposed to be a junk underground is simple stupid you can see a dick rubbed then the camera rotate and move around the walls then an ass and again camera rotate, some clubbing music with some vibrations and most of all dark. the director really believe that he build something very smart but actually is just trash, movie trash. Effects done for their selves not for the good of the movie. Scene done for their effects not serving the whole as a unit. Is like a school boy is making a movie and trying to show as his muscles. That was really a wasted time. I was always afraid of the average French movies. They always play smarter than they are.

327,voumeguy,Brutally heartbreaking,9,12 October 2006,"I checked the spoiler box just to be safe, but I will not venture too far from the film's opening chapter in this review. The ideal way to see this film, for the first time, would be to have no knowledge of its story (which is simplistic, but effective). First, this film regresses; that is, the story unfolds in reverse chronology, but do not confuse the narrative structure with ""Memento."" The film begins (ends?) with a scene involving the butcher from ""I Stand Alone,"" (Philippe Nahon) but soon moves to a Paris gay bar called ""Rectum."" Two men search the club for a man known only as 'Le Tenia,' the tapeworm. After the tapeworm is discovered, (perhaps)one of the most uncompromisingly brutal scenes in cinema follows. Viewers with no prior knowledge of the film's story have little context in which to place, justify, or condemn the scene they have just witnessed. Noe's decision to present the film in reverse chronological order serves a higher purpose than the obvious irony the title suggests; it is not merely a gimmick, but a technique that forces viewers to hang-on and discover why the two men do what they do at ""Rectum,"" and also questions free will, fate/destiny on a deeper level. Technically, this film amazed me. The camera is not a voyeur, or even a fly-on-the-wall; but, more accurately, an objective correlative demonstrating the inner turmoil of the characters through its outward movement and perspective. The editor achieves the highest purpose of editing: viewers are not aware of edits (cuts) in scenes, where the narrative may become compromised; the finished product seamlessly assembles a story that is presented backwards, yet maintains technical continuity. The SFX are too awe-inspiring to go into detail about in this review. The opening chapter (about 15 mins. in) demonstrates a coming together of CGI, live action, latex prop dummy, matte painting, lighting and editing in unison, leaving the viewer oblivious to any artifice. ""Irreversible"" is not an easy film to watch, but difficult not to appreciate.",Irreversible
328,Warbull99,Why Monica Why?,1,27 May 2002,"A rape scene to provoke emotion from its viewer shows little or no creative ability. A 10 minute rape scene shows a disturbing perversion that only can be classified as evil. I am ashamed that Monica Bellucci  even agreed to take this role, not-to-mention appear at Cannes to promote this abomination of a film. Monica was on quite a role of performance gems (Malena, Les Pacte Des Loups) earning respect and creating demand for herself. This just may backslide her to the roles like Dobermann and such, which corrupted the acclaim she received for L'appartement. Why Monica Why?",Irreversible
329,andizapatagj,terrible stunning,9,4 February 2008,"this movie was just great in many levels. Is by far the strongest and most horrible filmed i have ever seen but it made me think a lot and it shacked my world and mi mind. No t many films have this power. The scenes in the gay bar while the guy was killing the other one and was so graphic and the very commented scene of the rape are the two parts of this movie that took my breath away without counting with the violent move of the camera and the colors that were so dark and disturbing. Something very interesting is that it starts telling the story backwards and that is also a very important element because at the end of the movie you feel terrible to know that is just the beginning for a series of awful events that will come later. The message is strong but powerful and this director had the best way to show us this so we can understand and sure its to painful to watch but necessary to make us react and realize how terrible is the situation of the characters how are they feelings in every moment, why raping is so bad and should be punished in every way and how violence and revenge affects or lives. How destiny can influence our worlds because what got me more impressed about this movie was that the characters were just happy people trying to live normal lives and then everything falls apart and its so unfair, so awful. Only people that are really interested in good movies that will make them think a lot and are very strong emotionally must watch this film because as good and necessary it is it must certainly give you a very unpleasant feeling after you end watching it and its possible that it disturbs your mind and feelings in unsuspected ways.",Irreversible
330,Windtoker,A Quick Review,9,21 November 2003,"French film with subtitles. I saw it last night and loved it, it would easily be in my top 20.It was so dark, and very very disturbing. If I hear somebody tell me that Taxi Driver or something like that is violent, I will scream. This film was so graphic, about everything. The graphic nature of the entire film held me right from the start, it seems really weird and the swaying camera angle almost makes you feel seasick.It contains the most sickening rape scene I have ever witnessed, exactly how traumatic I have always imagined rape would be on a woman. Monica Bellucci (Matrix Revolutions) acted that scene with tremendously grim realism. Anyone who says the rape scenes in 'I Spit on your Grave' are disturbing needs to see this film, it makes 'I Spit on your Grave' look like a 'Carry on....' film. There is also a fight scene at the beginning which would make even the most ardent fan of violence feel sick.The film runs in chronological reverse order (The start is the end, then the scenes are run End to Beginning, making the end the beginning), which makes the film even more powerful because you are fully aware of the fate of the characters before they are.There is also very graphic sexual acts shown in full view on the camera shots; close ups of oral sex, and erect penis, even a guy fisting himself. You can buy this film in HMV or Virgin Megastore. Exactly how a film should be, if you want censorship, don't watch the film, when you get the realism, you feel you can relate to the film more because it is not sanitised.
Anyone seen this film and would like to share their opinions with me? If you haven't seen it, I would recommend it to anyone, but don't watch it with your Nan!",Irreversible
331,keng5,If we only new what lies around the corner.,7,28 May 2005,"About half way through this film we are made to watch the most loathsome scene imaginable, lasting about nine gruesome minutes, during which the lovely female lead of the film played by Monica Bellucci is raped and then has her lovely face savagely smashed by the rapist's boot, his fists and the concrete pavement. When her boyfriend sees the red pulp that her lovely face has become he is convulsed with anger and goes on the rampage to wreak vengeance on the animal who has done this. And when he finds him he behaves like an animal himself and smashes the rapist face in with a fire extinguisher. And can we really blame him?The film is shot in reverse, so we are then taken back to before any of this happened, to a time when she was happy and looking forward to a bright future. The last shot of the film shows her on a bright, sunny summers day lying on the grass in the park reading a book in perfect contentment, quite unaware what the future holds in store for her, and surrounded by a group of happy children playing at dodge the grass sprinkler to the music of the last movement of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony.It's painful to see any kind of beauty destroyed, but when it's the fragile beauty of a lovely young woman, it becomes almost unbearable. Having her face defaced must be a woman's worst fear, though in the course of time all beauty is destroyed, in the course of time her beauty would have been lost to wrinkles and sagging flesh. But to have it destroyed with such brute force and so senselessly is what made the scene so horrific. And all because the thug hated her for being rich!",Irreversible
332,SJ_1,Not much substance,5,16 October 2005,"Irreversible is pretty infamous by now because of its content, it would always be one of the first to come up whenever I read about disturbing films on the internet, and three words: fire, extinguisher, and rape, are always mentioned in the same sentence as the film's title.It pains me to say it, but beyond the controversial and shocking scenes, this film really doesn't have much to offer. The film is not in chronological order, it goes backwards, but I'm not sure this was such a good idea. A similar thing was done in ""Memento"". In that film it was done for two main reasons: to make us see it from the main character's perspective, and also to emphasise the twists and turns in the plot. Irreversible does neither of these things. The reason for it is to make us see how their lives were ruined, before these things actually happen to them, but I think it's there more for style reasons and to make the film stand out.Once you strip away the style, there is very little substance to this film. The all-over-the-place camera along with the strange noise in the background during the ""Rectum"" scene, was genuinely unsettling. Add in one of the most brutally violent attacks I've seen in a film and you have a disturbing scene. The rape scene is also disturbing, but overall this is a very thin idea stretched out over 90 minutes. This can be seen in the final 40 or so minutes. Once the rape scene is over, that seems to be almost all the film has to offer, and the rest of the film is just a lot of improvised acting from the actors, which must have been fun to make, but is not terribly exciting or compelling.Every scene in this film goes on way too long, the rape scene is too long, and every single scene after it also goes on too long. One of the few things I did like was the end scene, but that couldn't redeem the whole film.The whole concept behind the film is that this girl is raped, and her boyfriend takes revenge on the attacker. This isn't enough to make a 90 minute film out of, and while it's well acted by everyone, it amounts to little more than its controversial scenes overall.",Irreversible
333,savannahlynnhill,Unsettling as hell,9,16 June 2018,"This movie was very well-written and well directed (although the camera work began as very disorienting -which I suppose is the point- I got used to it and it added to the overall storytelling) The story was told in reverse very deliberately, to give small, well-crafted tidbits of the big picture and make the viewer feel the intensity of each scene on a much deeper level. The character building was fantastic, which gave a little more of an emotional punch to the tragedy. I usually don't like hard-to-watch movies, but this one was very smartly executed. It was extremely dirty and gritty on a realistic, yet almost psychedelic level. As much as I hate the injustice shown in the plot, I was riveted the entire time.",Irreversible
334,pallurameg,This movie is not worth the sea-sickness in the first 20 min,1,28 March 2015,"I gave this movie a fair shake. I knew the basic premise without reading many reviews. If you're looking for a pseudo graphic rape scene, it's in there. There are parts of the film that are even slightly touching. There were unresolved questions about the fate of the baby (unless I missed something, though I assumed) and the fate of the mother. The cinematography made me nauseated early on and it was unnecessary for it to be that choppy. It could have been a decent film, but the writing didn't support a plot told in reverse, and neither did the actors. Overall, I think the film Would have been more compelling with a well thought out plot - whether in reverse or in chronological order. Also, I personally like all ends of a story tied up - that includes the fate of Alex and her baby.",Irreversible

These events transpire in the squalid, dungeon like atmosphere of an establishment called 'The Rectum'. (Reminds me of real establishments I have heard about like 'The Mine Shaft'.) This should give you a general idea about the feel of this movie. It touches on many of the more exotic aspects of human sexuality. 'Touches' is probably not the right word here.The story is told in reverse with the end of the story appearing at the beginning of the movie. This just makes what is already a very backwards oriented movie even more bizarre. It reminds me that when people become possessed by demons they start talking backwards.Monica Bellucci treads into uncharted territory in this horrific movie. What a woman.A guy on amazon.com wrote a review for this movie and said he wishes time was reversible so he could go back and not watch it. But alas I guess time is not reversible.Not me though. It's one of my all time favorites.Also interesting for me was I found a poster I was looking for with Captain Marvel. It's on the wall in the guy's bedroom. I couldn't remember the name of this poster that I had many years ago but now I have found it.I guess only the French could come out with a movie like this.Jeff Marzano",Irreversible

337,naughtypixie13,"Well-written, badly directed.",3,15 June 2003,"I had built this film up in my mind. I was prepared for a shocking film that broke a million taboos and would leave me shocked and reeling. I didn't get any of this.Yes, the rape scene and the very brutal murder scene were jarring and at times disturbing but I didn't feel that any lines were crossed with these scenes. In fact, I found the murder scene much more grotesque than the rape scene.I did enjoy the film, the scenes towards the end (or beginning?) really showcased how well Cassell and Belluci work together and how well written the film actually was. But the very bizarre (and sea-sick inducing) camera work at the start of the film detracted from the story completely and it was only after this hand-held movement calmed down that I was able to enjoy the story.I would recommend it, but fast-forward the first twenty minutes or take some Dramamine first.",Irreversible
338,zamani,Confused movie with good actors and some good moments,6,3 June 2006,"I see this movie and could not relate to it. I could not find the basic point of the movie. First of all this is a movie that tries to show that only human can treat other humans like animal and in the process himself became an animal. The rape scene is designed to be repulsive and totally is. But the problem is that the rapist is an animal even before he begins his savage act. Another below to the movie and its message comes from unfolding of the story which is in reverse order. this is a major below because it puts the rape scene near the beginning of the movie . The revenge scene before the rape, so the viewer does not have any antipathy to the rapist and just watches a pointless act of violence(till that time in the movie) and the movie ends with a paradise like scene, which is contrary to the main point of the movie. But I think the rape scene is one of the most effective and hopeful of that kind and in this respect even surpass the similar scenes in Salo. Film has a good message but it is delivered by only one scene and not the whole movie, and because of this its effect has been diluted",Irreversible
339,7daysPerWeekend,wow!!!,7,6 February 2021,"Watching 'Irreversible' makes you question why you watch movies. If you just want movies to be entertainment and nothing more then obviously this is not something you will EVER want to see in your life. But if you think that film, like literature, is capable of many things, including looking at horrible and disturbing subject matter that you would prefer not to deal with, then 'Irreversible' is highly recommended. But beware, I feel I have the ability to stand all kinds of extreme material, but even I found it extremely difficult to watch. Writer/director Gaspar Noe previously made the brilliant and confrontational 'I Stand Alone', a movie that unfortunately never reached a wide audience. He manages to top himself with this one. Both movies make a mockery of supposedly ""difficult"" Hollywood fare like 'American Psycho', 'Fight Club', 'Boys Don't Cry' and 'Requiem For A Dream', which are pure Disney compared to Noe's work! 'Irreversible' has a similar structure popularized (but not originated) in Christopher Nolan's 'Memento'. The plot is told in reverse chronological order.",Irreversible
340,Anasazie,The raping of the senses,1,28 April 2005,"I think Gasper Noe should refund the price of my admission ticket.........what a load of rubbish!This film is such an aggressive, tacky exploration of the notion of consequence, that i could never possibly recommend it to anyone. Noe's work is far too self-important, his bombardment of the senses leaves no room for objective viewer contemplation of anything they've witnessed, in the same vain as horrid A-merican action films. But his main fault is a lack of anything interesting to say.All I felt after this experience was ashame at being part of the male species, I will never think about sex in the same way again. Noe has an extraordinary problem with his own masculinity, almost an embarrassment. I feel it's wrong to 'force' that onto others with wildly overblown scenarios.I'm reluctant to even post any comments about a film that's been spoken of too much already and I find myself having to finish by saying that this is one of the worst films ever made.",Irreversible

The ""spinning camera"" and the ""backwards-to-forwards"" gimmick just isn't cool enough to save the film. I'm not sure why a lot of folks rate this movie so high. Perhaps it's something to do with aesthetics or shock value? Hard to say. The acting is good and some of the leads are attractive.

343,pacifist_parsi,My Big Gay Heart of Darkness,8,6 August 2011,"I'm going to go ahead and declare the 2000's as the decade of the French. Well, at least in terms of horror movies that is. One may argue that Irreversible is not a horror film or that it straddles that line from time to time without completely venturing into the realm. But once you see it, you'll rank it high on the list of notoriously 'classic' rape/revenge films.Playing much like Memento, the film is shown in a backwards chronology of events leading up to a confrontation between a pair of buddies and a man who raped their female friend. Both men have a current relationship with their victimized female counterpart: one as current boyfriend and another as ex; a good friend but obviously clinging to the off chance that she will dump her current beau and get back with him. The film shockingly starts as both men track down the assailant at a gay club (appropriately called Rectum) where they exact their revenge in a brutalized fashion. With the current boyfriend momentarily disabled, the more awkward and unassuming ex repeatedly beats the man with a fire extinguisher with such fervor and reckless abandonment that to start the film off in such away, immediately and emotionally connects the viewer.'Oh great', you say. 'Thanks Cortez, now why should I watch the rest of this?' Interestingly enough, it keeps you on pins and needles as you want to know why these two men are hellbent on exacting their revenge. From the trek through town in search of the club, to their wild and crazy party leading up to the rape, and the rape itself, its an interesting weaving of a tale that asks the all too important question thats necessary in a film like this: 'What would you do?' The unfolding of the relationship between all three friends gives such depth and gut wrenching weight to what was viewed at the beginning. And the most shocking element that I found was not the rape itself (although it was incredibly disturbing), it was the unassuming, self-deprecating, still sticking around in the hopes of getting back together ex who actually ended up being the more malicious and relentless of the two.A hard one to recommend for sure but ultimately, I do. As mentioned, the rape scene is entirely disturbing (its about 20 minutes long and rivals that of I Spit on Your Grave AKA Day of the Woman). But if you can get through that, there is a lot more going on with this film. And the surrealist way in which some of the scenes were shot adds another level of depth. Almost like you were inside the minds of the characters as they went through a sort of uncontrollable, completely out of their mind, experience.An incredible movie it will stay with you long after the credits roll. I'm still trying to figure out if they killed the right guy or not.Ed. Note: I've re-watched the film and in fact, the wrong guy was killed. This leads me to believe that overall, the director is making a direct statement about revenge and how it lacks any merit. ALI KOHAN FOROTAGHE",Irreversible

345,rrclimber,Difficult but interesting film,7,12 December 2005,"I am a sucker for films that make people walk out of the cinema because of a particular scene. I am drawn to this kind of hype like a moth to the flame. I just can't help it. I have had this film in on my ""have to see list"" for awhile now and recently grabbed it off of netflix. This film definitely lived up to the hype. It is the type of film that leaves you thinking about it for days after you see it. The violence is the kind of thing that makes you cringe. The scenes of violence are agonizingly long (do you really need to hit him with the extinguisher again? yep, I guess you do!) especially the rape scene. The thing that left me wondering after watching it was, would this be a good film if not for the violence and tricky camera work? The answer is no. It's a pretty lame story. But film is not about the story alone. That is what makes the medium great. It is immersive. It requires that pay attention to sight and sound. On this level the the film is amazing. It grabs hold of you and doesn't let go. The tricky camera work and music in the first 30 minutes of the film made me feel more ill at ease then I have ever felt watching a film. The bottom line is that this an interesting and original piece of cinema. Not every movie needs to make you feel good about life at the end. The good guys don't always need to win. This movie is a fine example of what can be done when someone tries to break out of the mold. Well done.",Irreversible

I can't tell you how disappointed I was after seeing it on a ""Most Disturbing"" list and then watching it. There are only two ""shocking"" scenes and they are not that shocking to be honest. People talk about the realism and sure it looks fairly realistic, but that isn't hard to do when you don't show much or the scene is so dark that you can barely make out more than silhouettes. If you want to be ""shocked"", then pass on this film. It isn't really a bad film per se- just not what it is advertised as. Wow, I need two more lines- fine. 99.9% of the movie is about an idiotic, annoying protagonist- partying, acting the fool, or on a mission for ""revenge"". The whole situation occurs because he is a selfish oaf and then his actions following (or in the manner the film is shot, preceding) the situation.",Irreversible

It's truly a rarely style of camera action. It whirling for twenty minutes at least at very beginning. My eyes are dizzy a lot until I saw the fire extinguisher appearing. Wow, I still feel unbelievable when the extinguisher hitting the face. How mad his rage is! At the end of the movie, I see something like ""2001 SPACE ODYSSEY"" and lots of traces from ""CLOCKWORK ORANGE"" in whole film. I didn't get the point of the flashing in the end, does it just imitate 2001 or has any other meanings? I have no idea.",Irreversible

A movie that challenges you to watch it again to get more and more out of it each time, but knowing the actual watching of it will still be a pretty torturous experience. My first Gaspar Noe film and I'm blown away by all the usual sentiments his movies get. The flowing camera work is dizzying, beautiful and so effective. The booming sound design is also really chilling. Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel are so natural too it's like you're just peeking into real people's lives.

If you are prone to motion sickness, you would be well-served to take a Dramamine before watching it. It was difficult to watch the scene in the club when the man is beaten with a fire hydrant. I felt like I was watching a snuff film. It was too intense and I had to avert my eyes. The sounds were horrible enough. The story line drew me in, though, and I had to continue watching. Some people have commented that the rape scene was too long, but I believe that was necessary for the realism. As the movie continues the scenes backwards, I felt that style of filming worked perfectly. It was easy enough to follow as all the scenes were connected completely. The ending was filled with surreal images. This movie is not for the faint of heart and definitely for mature audiences only.",Irreversible

However, this is the most disturbing film I have ever seen. This film of course contains the most brutal rape scene in the history of world cinema. The scene goes on for what feels like 10 to 15 minutes and leaves you breathless, stunned, scared, and sick. Monica Bellucci is one of the most beautiful women in the world and to see her violated like this makes it that much more disturbing. Not only does she get raped anally but she gets the crap beat out of her after the act. This happens somewhere in the middle of the film. Just like Memento this film is done completely backwards. At the Beginning of the film, which is actually the end of the story. Takes the viewer on a disturbing tour of an underground gay asylum. This was particularly disturbing for the fact that Noe did not shy away from male genitalia, phallacio, male masturbation or anal sex. This is followed by a scene where Vincent Cassal fights with a man that he thinks is the man responsible for his wife's rape. We see his arm get broken, when suddenly Vincent's friend knocks the man with a fire extinguisher until the man's head is nothing but a bloody pulp. Definitely not for everyone and consider yourself warned.",Irreversible
354,Romas_ETHZ,"Don't dare to know what will happen in the future, you'll be shocked!",8,27 May 2002,"This movie is not about the rape of a girl, not really. It's about the violence in general and the absurdity and vulgarity of its logic. And it shows that it's just when you're shocked and can't realize what's happening around, that you succumb to the blind power of violence and revenge.Another point, which makes the movie particularly interesting. It's filmed backwards: from the final scene of revenge to the ""happy-end"". With the only difference that the beginning of the story, that is the end of the movie, doesn't look so happy in the light of what would happen afterwards, in the light of what you've just seen. And the real shock comes not from the scenes of violence, but from the fact of knowing what is going to happen. Maybe it's one of the most important messages of the movie: DON'T DARE TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN FUTURE, BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE SHOCKED!!!",Irreversible
355,graeme32,Recommended - if you are in the right mood,9,2 August 2006,"This is definitely a film to watch by yourself. Don't even consider taking someone on a date to watch it unless you already know them really well. Don't watch it with friends unless you don't mind sitting with them in silence for 90 minutes at a time.This film is as far from light entertainment as its possible to get. The camera technique and story telling (in reverse order) leave you disorientated due to the lack of a normal narrative flow. Individual scenes contain sequences of violent, shocking, disturbing, and in some cases distressing events that appear to be totally unprovoked, random, and which continue long after you would expect or want them to stop. This is one of the few films that have made me physically flinch.Only as the film nears its end (the beginning of the story) do things start to make sense and fall into place.What did I take from this film? That the acts of evil people are matched by the acts of normal people put in impossible situations and transformed into people that they themselves would not recognise; That sometimes there are no happy endings, although there are happy ""starts"". This is a film that will leave you silent and contemplatative after watching it. I thoroughly recommend watching it - but watch it when you are in the right mood, rather than because you had planned to watch it a certain time",Irreversible
356,Rehmeiers-Moviebox,Powerful stuff - but not a film for everyone,8,4 September 2015,"Irreversible is a puzzle for the mind. Told in backwards chronology it tells the story of a young, beautiful woman who becomes the victim of a terrible crime. While walking home from a night out, Alex is attacked and raped by a homosexual man in a tunnel, which leads her boyfriend to look for revenge on a bloody rampage through the dark underworld of Paris. The cinematography is stunning although it could make some people dizzy because of the use of spinning cameras and the extensive use of the color red. After the premiere, the movies reception pulverized the critics and audience and alike. The film is well told and thought provoking, beautifully composed and well acted but the long and very graphic scene showing the extreme violence and cruelty of the assault and rape made a lot of people sick.Its hard to sit through but in the end, the film does make sense in a wonderful and weird way that only Caspar Noe can seem to achieve. Not the ultimate masterpiece but a truly special and philosophical film.",Irreversible
357,halfrocentric1975,Shock and Awe,10,24 May 2009,"This movie I have to say is difficult to classify as a great film or as a horrible film. It surely can not be classified as run of the mill or middle ground at all. Its hard to find words to classify it because while it evokes an emotional response for sure, you feel guilty for having viewed it. Its borderline snuff porn with A+ actors and Director. I like films that elicit some sort of emotional response. Irreversible definitely did that. One of the most disturbing things about the movie besides the obvious 2 most violent scenes in it was the actual wet sound effect of each time The Tapeworm penetrated Alex. To top it off when he roles off of her, the actor actually had an erection. People talk about this being an unflinching look at reality, that may be true. I ask who's reality is it? It seems to me Irreversible used the backwards story telling to give two different morals to the story. Watching it from end to beginning gives us the impression that this movie is about revenge and consequences for bad actions. However, it the scenes were played in reverse and it went from beginning to end you would see that there is an underlying implication of misogyny beneath the obvious view of a misogynist act of violence.Played backwards it can be seen that the director and writer may harbor some misogynistic views of females as inferior objects for men to manipulate as they desire. That the rape scene seemed to me to be a punishment of independent female sexuality rather then showing the rapist as a despicable person. If the film were in typical chronological order we would see that ""The Tapeworm"" never has any sort of consequence for his crime against Alex and that the only people who suffered were people around the situation, besides Alex.What really sealed the deal for my opinion was when I re-watched it recently and was able to put everything in order for myself. The end shows 2 men talking about their lives. One man says he went to jail for having sex with his daughter. The second man says to him, ""There are no crimes just actions."" Now if that's not an indicator of someone who does not view rape and child molestation as criminal then I don't know what else would be.Irreversible has to be studied for sure. So this is why I can't bring myself to say its an excellent film. I will say that all matters of opinion and situations should have the chance to be explored on film. I like an emotional challenge and I was surely given that here.",Irreversible

I can not disagree more with the overall score on this film. Just because it has a strong message DOESN'T MAKE IT A GOOD FILM ! almost like taking a black and white picture don't make you an artiest. After what felt like 15 minutes forwarding through the opening credits ans camera spinning( not giving to much away ) their was a man getting his face bashed-in which is the sole reason for the 3 star rating , not because of the gore but because it was real time hitting blows with amazing effects. Pass this point the movie gets bad and I MEAN REAL BAD. Scenes in this film get dragged on for WAAAAYYY to long 7 minutes of not saying anything relevant to the movie too several minutes of a person just brushing hair AND the WORST PART several minutes of flashing lights.

359,stubhall,Unwatchable,1,8 August 2004,"Where to begin with Irreversible.... I know from having read other user comments that a number of people out there like Gaspar Noe's style with short sharp cuts and whirling perspective's.  To the uninitiated (I include myself in this) this can be hard to watch and can leave you with a nauseating feeling.  This however seems apt for the subject matter of this piece.  Stylistically I think the movie is well done, but that would be seriously overlooking the content of the film.I'm not the type of person who has a weak disposition or feels squeamish at the sight of blood.  I've sat through and enjoyed ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" and although disturbing in the exploration of violence, and the psychology of the criminal mind, I never felt that there was a gratuitous nature to the presentation of this subject matter.  However I couldn't help but feel that the two scenes that define this film were unnecessarily violent and amounted to little more than a dressed up snuff movie.The suggestion that by telling the story in reverse that somehow the movie ends on a pleasant note doesn't hold water for me.  I was so shell shocked that even the sight of Monica Belucci frolicking naked made me feel a little uneasy, after witnessing her humiliation earlier in the movie.I think it's a disappointment that such an artistically shot movie should gratuitously present such horrific subject matter.  I'd suggest that Gaspar Noe should turn his attention to something more worthy of his ability.

360,edtorelli,Great film - but only from a technical point of view,6,23 January 2008,"SOME SPOILERSToday there is a ""movement"" of filmmakers with incredible skills on filming and editing, but with nothing to say. Perhaps Gaspar Noé is one of those filmmakers. His ability to visually tells a story is clear  but would be better if he was less pretentious and more conscious of his limitations. His claim that ""we are savages, more than civilized beings"" sounds like the statement of a naive and angry teenager, what he probably is in his essence (and perhaps he doesn't know that). In ""Irreversible"", he shows us the fate of three people that, in a tragic night, ""looses everything"". The woman, Alex, is raped in a subterranean passage  and her boyfriend and a couple's close friend hunt down the rapist and find themselves in trouble with all freaks available in Paris, reunited in a hellish gay night club on the city. The story is told backwards, because, you see, this is an art movie  at least is what they say. Is this film disturbing and incredibly well made? Oh, yeah  it is. Is the rape scene so disgusting and hard to see that you'll be sick in it's first five minutes (it plays during 10 minutes)? For sure. In resume, is this film worth seeing? Absolutely  from a technical point of view. But there is no sociological or humanistic message in this well-disguised horror movie, that is even ironic on it's irresponsible approach of sensitive themes. It's a myth that all men have a secret pleasure watching rape scenes  only the crazy ones have it. But I would watch it with no complains if I could learn anything really valid about human condition, or discover why this kind of thing happens. Or even if the film could help me to deal with this terrible situation, if a person that I love would hurt as Alex was in the movie. I didn't learn nothing. I just watched a woman suffering  and sometimes I had the impression that the movie was mocking her and the whole situation. For example: the name of the rapist is ""La Tenia"" (english translation: ""the worm"") and he conveniently rapes Alex from behind, doing comments about her tight ""ring"" (her anus), or how anal sex is ""goooood"" and so on. Later, when Alex' boyfriend finds the rapist, we see ""the worm"" in a nightclub called ""The Rectum"" (did you notice the subtle irony?). It looks more a film about Noe's fixation on anus than a movie about rape, and more important: about the consequences of rape. Noe concludes his ""important"" film with a message: ""Time Destroys Everything""  in the sense that the rape and the events of that night destroyed the happiness of Alex and the happiness of her friends, completely. You see, there's no hope  there's no tomorrow. Noe tells us that there's no point on falling in love, have children, make a family and dreams about better days,because your girlfriend can be raped, beaten and humiliated for a jerk, and no one can survive that. Is that, really? I never had a chance to check it out. You see, after torture me with the rape scene and make me watch a graphic murder occurred in the ""Rectum"", Noe just gave up the story  he doesn't have anything more to say. Did Alex survive to the attack? We'll never know. Did the child that she was carrying died, as a consequence of the rape? Who cares? After all, the ""point"" was the rape, the murder, the blood, the head in peaces... In real life women are raped and mistreated since the beginning of time  and a lot of them survived, had their children and were able to find happiness again, in spite of the trauma and the horrific memories. But Gaspar Noé doesn't know that. He only wants to express his pessimistic (and simple minded) point of view of life  that's is much more complex than this well-made (and pointless) exploitation art movie.",Irreversible
361,6slick7,Too real for me. I didn't care for it.,2,7 October 2007,"This film tells the story of a fateful night when a man an his friend seek revenge on the man who rapes his lover. The friend turns out to be a former lover of the woman who still has feelings for her. The events unfold in a less than 24 hour period from afternoon to evening and the scenes are played in reverse order (night to previous afternoon). The Idea to play the scenes this way has potential cinematically and artistically. But after seeing the subject matter and the graphic realism in which it is portrayed, I don't see this film as artistic or cinematic. But I'm not supposed to take pleasure from watching violence and rape and I feel I shouldn't be watching this, but it's like when you come across the scene of eg. a fire or a car crash, something drives your curiosity and you cannot help but look. Maybe the film works on this level. But I can question why the actors do what the script asks of them so realistically and why would they do such a film in the first place. The almost never ending rape scene is a perfect example of this. Why does an actress allow people put her in this situation for the sake of a paycheck? There are roles out there that offer different and more acceptable challenges. Something I noticed about the man while catching his breath between raping and beating her into a coma made this scene all too real to me. The love scene earlier in the day(or later in the film, if you like) failed to make up for this. The subject matter is supposed to provoke the reaction that it does. I'm not supposed to accept or be entertained by violence or sexual violence. So maybe the film works by the fact that I don't like it, if you know what I mean. So does this make it a good film? For some, I can understand why it does make it a good film. But the fact that I'm still questioning why the film was made in the first place and why a censor would pass it uncut makes it a bad film for me. That's why I'm giving it low marks, but I do understand why some give it high marks. If you're easily offended by the subject matter, avoid. If you can cope with a film that makes for difficult viewing and want to know if this film will provoke a reaction (and it almost certainly will), then this might be for you. I only got it out on DVD because I'm a fan of Monica Bellucci, not one hundred per cent sure then what it would be about. After seeing it, I won't be watching it again.",Irreversible

Then the violent and edgy gay club scenes will shock most viewers. There were several ""Oh My God"" and expletive comments from me as I watched the scenes. Viewers finally learn how time and chance conspire to produce life altering events, showing no mercy. The never ending rape/sodomy scene will have both women and men looking over their shoulder in corridors after viewing this movie. This movie shows how dangerous it is to stand up for someone else, how evil some people can really become, and how justice and injustice can be served at the same time. I would never watch this movie again, because it is just too violent and sad.",Irreversible
363,unreconstructed,Irreversible: Noe's Cosmic Determinism,6,16 September 2003,"I just watched Irreversible....very difficult to watch. On the surface, the movie is very exploitive. It simultaneously arouses the two worst feelings possible: anger and helplessness. Below the surface, the movie may be more depressing than the rape of Monica Bellucci and the mistaken vengeance that it inspires.  I think there's a deeper philosophical idea underlying this movie and it's not a happy one. At one point we see a poster of 2001: A Space Odyssey as the movie keeps segueing into the past. How is Irreversible related to 2001? Recall how Kubrick showed a very brief glimpse into the prehistory of humans at the beginning of 2001, before leaping far into the future Space Age? And in both time periods, Kubrick's work is imbued with a chronic pessimism about humanity. During the prehistoric era, our capacity to evolve and survive depended on the ability to create crude tools which we promptly used to exterminate rival gangs of pre-humans.  In the Space Age our ability to break the bonds of Earth and explore Space depends on our ability to create more sophisticated tools: building and programming supercomputers, like HAL. But eventually that also winds up biting us in the ass.     Noe, does the opposite, sort of. He shows segments of three individuals' lives but he starts in the Present and keeps going back further to the past. Noe seems intent on showing how what happens to humans is not just dependent on the past but, in fact, strictly determined by the past.  At the end of the movie he has apparently gone all the way back to the Big Bang (Really intense flashing white light and sonic rumbling from the audio track).  What is Noe getting at? Is it something more deeply pessimistic than even Kubrick dared imagine?  What does Noe mean by the title ""Irreversible"" ?     Is it that conditions for the subsequent evolution of our universe were fixed by the initial conditions of the Big Bang and nothing can change what happens later; and the really radical idea that this strict determinism applies to human actions just as much as it does to, for example, star formation in some far-flung corner of the universe???  That humans do not in fact possess Free Will but are just part of the universe undergoing changes by responding to forces and psychological pressures which all follow precisely from what has happened in the past??  If this is what Noe is conveying, it is very very DARK in a way that goes beyond Kubrick: we're not just violent and hedonistic, we really don't have any choice in the matter. For Noe, being ""One With The Universe"" isn't a pop slogan from the 60's accompanied by warm feelings of emotional wellbeing; it's a stark physical fact involving a collapse to nihilism. As Time destroys everything, maybe there are no good or bad deeds, just simply ""deeds"", or as a physicist would call them, ""events"". Noe = Nietzsche ??: Psychologically, intelligent beings can't evolve in any other direction: the struggle for existence forces us to conceive of ourselves as Free. One of necessary preconditions in the struggle for survival may be intellectual Error. Our perception of ourselves as free sentient inner-directed Agents: just a little joke played on us by the universe as it bends us over and we take it in the Rectum.     ""Irreversible"": the universe as one big Process that, once set in motion, will evolve according to it's own laws and cannot be changed even by human awareness of this Process since our awareness is just one aspect that's been set in motion.  Anyway, I hope this isn't what Noe intended because it's very depressing. And even if Noe didn't intend this, maybe it's true nonetheless. Scary thought.",Irreversible
364,themirrorsofmymind,Not for everyone.,6,29 May 2015,"Irresponsible? Maybe...It's quite possible that director Gaspar Noe' may have been attempting to make a point, not just about blind rage over one horrific act of violence leading to another act of violence, but that bigoted attitudes against homosexuals and trans-gendered persons may also play a role when one is out for revenge, seemingly, at all cost. Unfortunately, there isn't ONE LGTB character in this film that is portrayed in a positive light. All are involved in scenes of graphic sexual escapades, most of which take place at a ""gay sex club"", the name of which seems to have been chosen for the HIGHEST SHOCK VALUE possible! The number of gay slurs uttered by numerous characters is appalling (during the infamous scene in ""the tunnel"" where Monica Bellucci's ""Alex"" is attacked, even her attacker had to use the word ""F-ggot"" or ""F-g"" multiple times!). At the end of the film I (as a gay man) was left feeling insulted and confused. This is obviously not a movie that you watch for ""entertainment"". The director appears to be trying to teach his audience some kind of lesson. For me, that lesson seems to have gotten lost in translation...",Irreversible

The continuing shots that carry you backwards through the story of this couple keep your eyes fixed on the screen. However there are those moments when you want to look away. Like the scene in the bar when Pierre bashes the wrong guy's face in and leaves a bloody stump. Or the infamous rape scene, in which you yourself want to take revenge for Alex. I think there are only a few people who can watch any of these scenes listed above. Even the scene at the end of the movie, when Alex finds out she's pregnant is extremely difficult to watch.But even with the gut-wrenching details, it's a film worth viewing.

By the end of the film i was filled with a great admiration not only for the actors who participated in the film but also for the filmmaker and his ability not to pull his punches. As a film student of many cultures and many different kinds of movies, movies such as this one who push the envelope and don't exchange artist merit or vision, for financial success or glamorous cow towing to the actors involved. It's gritty. The beginning scene in the gay club is a scene that took a direction in film that i have honestly never seen before. It's worth it, but only in the same way for people who like Requiem For A Dream, or movies that have deep lows and that leave you emotionally straddling thin air, saying thank God i am where i am.

In movie, women must be beautiful and pregnant to be good and everything else is hell, violence and perversity.

Thesis of the story? Sodomy destroys everything! Even innocent, beautiful women in wonderfully fertile relationships are raped by those evil, drug sniffing homos (of course! Gay men are always anally raping beautiful, braless heterosexual women, those immoral swine!) before they go off to their depraved sodomy underworld to have random, animalistic S&M sex before getting their heads righteously bashed in (while all those evil fags just idly stare on in lurid/detached fascination) by a fire extinguisher (put out those destructive, flaming queens!) wielded by a righteous straight man whose beautifully idealized, biologically reproductive relationship was ruined ruined ruined by the anal-obsessed fag demons who crawl around a raunchy club called The Rectum! Pump your fists in the air, straight men, your directionless and testosterone-poisoned anger now has a focus!The director didn't even try to veil his vehement and bigoted chauvinism and then attempted to make the film envelope-pushing simply by resorting to banal shock-value intensity (just bash his head in again and again! Just keep the camera still for 10 minutes while this evil fag tortures this poor screaming woman so all the sadistic straight men can covertly get their kinky kicks while pretending to really contemplate the raw experience of a real rape. Wow! Gritty!) and attempted to make it arty by reversing what is actually a very conventional and hackneyed narrative (You killed my beautiful girlfriend and now I must GET REVENGE! Just like in The Crow! Wasn't that a time-tested work of art?) and also by simply spinning the camera to disorient the viewer in a manner that never ceases to be cinematographically ostentatious and annoying. Conventional narrative? Just reverse it (even though this lets all the steam out of it in the beginning, making the second half even more dull and predictable)! Need art-film innovation? Just swing the camera around! How arty! And of course, it will be easy to gain empathetic investment from the audience by morally indicting the feces-covered rectum rapers that are the bane of all reputable societies- those haters of the holy life-affirming vagina: the male gays! ""We hate them too!"" the audience all chants in cathartic, mind-blown unison.Cheers all around. What an innovative, intense, emotionally gripping cinematic tour-de-force for Nazi Republicans with a penchant for sadistic violence, pseudo-complicated pretense, and the much needed hyper-glorification of the moral superiority of heterosexual intercourse.

This was the only part that made me a bit sick and I really can't understand the idea of making it this way.Second: The rape scene, which is uncut and extremely long, however 'brilliant' and exceptional thanks to Belucci.Third: The stroboscopic very ending. It could end with the wide upside-down shot easily. Didn't get why was there supposed to be there.In the end, it is quite easy love story. Nothing exceptional, but a nice movie to watch.",Irreversible
372,wmcginty,For what it's worth...,10,26 August 2002,"... here's my own, personal reading of Irreversible. I don't normally make comments on films here, but, on this occasion, I have felt moved to, as I truly feel that the film, in some ways, has saved my life. I really don't wish to enter into the work of art/sick piece of rubbish debate (although I, for the record, thought that the film was a masterpiece), but rather, I would like to share with you the conclusions I reached by the end of the film. Perhaps they will give you a new angle upon a second viewing.WARNING: SPOILERS(NB: To avoid confusion, from now on I am going to refer to moments of the film based on the order in which they appear onscreen, eg. the beginning of the film means the scene with the two men talking in the room above ""Le Rectum"")In the second, infinitely easier to watch part of the movie, we have a couple of revelations: Alex (Monica Bellucci) is reading a book on dreams that predict the future. Later in the film, towards the end, we see her and Marcus (Vincent Cassel, who for my money gave possibly the most fantastically intense performance of the year in this film), waking up. Marcus admits to dreaming that he lost the feeling in his arm (an allusion to his arm getting severely broken at the beginning of the movie), whereas Alex describes the tunnel where we saw her getting raped earlier. We then see Alex find out that she is pregnant.The final scene has Alex lying in a park, reading the above-mentioned book, while children play around her. Then, the camera swivels towards the sky, we witness some strobe lighting, and the curtains close on the film's final message: ""Time destroys everything"".Now, here's the question: Does time destroy everything? In English, the saying goes ""Time heals all wounds"". After a long walk (much needed after witnessing some horrifically graphic scenes), I came to this conclusion: neither of the above are true. Time is like an express train on a long, interminable track. We board at one station (birth), and get off at another (death). But we can't stop the train. What we can do is make the most of our journey.The best way to illustrate my finding is to take the two above contradictory time-related statements: imagine, if you will, two people who have a parent die at the exact same time. The two people are the same age, have had the same intensity of love from said parent, and have had the same level of proximity to the parent. This does not mean that both will react in the same way. While it is obvious that both will grieve for a period, one may eventually come to terms with the fact that death is a part of life and move on, while the other may become resentful and bitter, withdrawing more and more into themselves. What this means is that life is both what happens to us and how we perceive it: how big a deal we make out of it.With the revelations given to me in the final scenes, I realised that I had the power to decide that Alex was never raped, and that Marcus and Pierre never made the subsequent descent into hell. This is backed up by the final scene, in which Alex seems to be some way into her pregnancy (although this may just be the angle at which she is shot). The film is a work of fiction, and therefore I can make that decision: it was all a dream, and, contrary to public belief, the film was in fact shot in the correct chronological order, starting with the nightmare and ending with the pair waking up. Dreams are, by nature, hazy, disorientating affairs, which explains the camerawork, sound and editing.Another realisation I made was that, given enough time and without external influences, a human being (if of sound mind) will always see what is right (whether they choose to act on it or not is another matter). This is illustrated by the speech of the Butcher from Noe's earlier ""I Stand Alone"" (Philippe Nahon), who admits that he was wrong in all he did in that movie.But more importantly, the film teaches us to learn all we can out of life, to consider all the possibilities, and to seek happiness and peace in all we do, for every second counts.Anyway, that's my two bits. And while I will admit that, on a number of occasions I was forced to look away, and indeed nearly vomited at a couple of points, I ran the course and came to the conclusion that ""Irreversible"" is a profound, moving and not at all gratuitous piece of work (having said that, anything can be profound if you read enough into it). I feel privileged to be one of the few people living in Britain who (at present) seems likely to get the chance to decide this for themselves. It's a great shame that the film is unlikely to ever be released here, and I'm disgusted that the BBFC can't see past the sensationalism surrounding the work (stirred up mainly by people who haven't even seen the whole film) and get to the heart beating inside it. If it is released uncut, and only one person came away as enriched as I have, it would be more than worthwhile.",Irreversible

It is a brutal masterpiece that should be seen by everyone, an amazing film of twisted genius. Taking violence to dizzy heights Gasper Noe starts an assault on your senses straight from the beginning but it is the 9 minute rape and beating scene which could push some people over the edge. Watching Monica Belluci being violently raped is extremely disturbing to say the least... it is 9 minutes of pure hell for the victim and viewer making the film stand out as one of the most powerful and realistic rape scenes in cinematic history. During this 9 minutes Gasper Noe gives us a pure static camera with no flashy editing, it's just one long 9 minute shot at ground level where you feel as helpless as Monica Belluci. Cinematography is brilliant, sound is superb and the acting is top notch all the way. Monica Belluci and Vincent Cassel are amazing and Albert Dupontel is truly inspired. So Yes it is disturbing... Yes it is shocking... Yes it is sickening... Yes it is incredibly violent,savage & brutal... Yes it is amazing... Yes it is a masterpiece... and yes... it is ONLY the second most disturbing film in modern cinema because the Japanese film ""Audition"" is without doubt a million times more violent and savage than ""Irreversible"" could ever be.

377,Drakkhen_Khort,Brutal remake,10,1 April 2004,"This film was really disturbing. I won't argue longer on this point, I just wanted to notify the fact that the story had a taste of déjà vu.This film reminded me some ""Hitchcock presents"" short-cut telling the story of a man leaving his wife in their mobile-home for his working day and who discovers her bullied and ""folded"" alive in the oven as he returns. Then comes to him an irrepressible wrath. He takes his wife in the car and drives her through the city hoping to identify the aggressor and, finally, the woman designs a man with the finger, ""It's him"". The husband follows him to his apartment then comes back to the car (the murder is only suggested). Satisfied, he drives back to the camping outside the city but as they leave it, the woman points another man... ""It's him"".The brutality of these deeds are magnified in Irreversible by the way the camera is moved, the sick ambiance of the film beginning and the coarseness of the violence. Out of all this horror, the rest of the movie just gets us closer to the characters trying to increase attachment to them, but the electroshocks of the first half makes it almost tasteless after such a bitter entrée and hardly succeeds in calming the spectator.Irreversible trades the Hitchcock film's moral for pure visual crash, and plays back the emotional crescendo of films like Requiem For A Dream.

So why should we question art that is made to be thought-provoking? A lot is already said about 'Irreversible' so I especially wanted to mention the soundtrack of the film, composed by Daft Punk mastermind Thomas Bangalter.

You'll gain something from within yourself, maybe previously untouched. And then come back and read this review. But form your own opinion before reading the jacking of some other nit-wit's opinion****The juxtaposition of our two main ""protagonists""; Pierre's intellect and studious refinement versus the brash, hyper-masculinity of Marcus reacting as two polarizing entities thinly tethered to one another by their feminine interest, but ensues complete anarchy when that binding is snapped.This is important as you recall the beginning of the film, the way which Pierre bashes the ""fag's"" head in while in defense of Marcus and for resisting his commands to stop jerking himself off. At the time, it is perceived as meaninglessly, excessive violence, but later on- while you develop a clearer sense of the character- you realize the act of Pierre's violence after declarations of pacifism, remorse, and grief was his transition into the exhibit which he studied from behind the philosophical glass for so many years - which is a quality of his as being foretold by Alex detailing their sexual experiences. The impulsiveness of the action seems uncharacteristic to his general complex, but given the circumstances, it occurred, and thus he was carried away guilty, in handcuffs, while Marcus was in a stretcher. You see this transition as witnessed over time, bringing us back to the quote of ""Time destroys everything"". In this film, through extraordinarily graphic and foul events, you witness the destruction of a marriage, relationship, beauty, life, and it causes you to reflect on the possibilities and potentials pertaining to you and all of human life.You can exact so much from this film, socioeconomically, morally, it just requires some thought and grasping subject matter that is rather raw and generally abstract to the average person.

386,jp80-552-991433,Irreversible??... Unforgettable...,7,11 December 2012,"Everyone will talk about the 2 scenes of graphic violence in Irreversible (especially the rape scene). These 2 scenes are rightly notorious and the rape scene especially is something I had no chance of preparing myself for. It is gruelling horror. However, Irreversible has some scenes of genuine beauty(especially towards the end of the film) which in my opinion are just as memorable. Scenes like Monica Bellucci washing in the shower and then laying on the bed with Vincent Cassell are humane, natural, moving and initmate. I also believe that the best shot in the film is saved for last with Monica laying out on grass in what seems to be Spring sunshine. The camera starts off near, overhead and then begins to spiral up and start an ascent in to the sky whilst still looking down on Monica's beauty. Resulting in a dream like sequence and beautiful artistic mastery.The fact that the last 3rd (or so) of the film is so beautiful and compassionate is vitally important. After viewing what I believe is the most violent scene (the rape) that I have ever witnessed in any movie. I needed to see in the latter parts of the film scenes that were tender, touching, soft, natural and at the same time believable. Irreversible delivered. Not a film that I will watch over and over again but certainly a film that I will never forget and importantly for me not just because of the violence.However, Irreversible isn't going to be everybody's cup of tea. Some people believe that the rape scene (sorry to refer to 'that' scene again) is offensive and glorifying violence. I am of the belief that this opinion is rubbish. The perpetrator mocks his victim and the violence is graphic but it felt real to me and I was sickened but not offended by the scene. I ask myself, if I were going to make a movie that included a rape scene, would I want to hold back or water it down so as not to try and offend a few people? Absolutely not and why would anyone want to do that? Rape is an horrific crime so you might as well portray it that way, for what it is. I didn't't enjoy watching that scene but it is undeniably a remarkable piece of cinema also.I would suggest you only watch Irreversible if you have an open mind and if you're keen to see more than just the violence that everyone talks about. Because if it's just the violence that you are interested in, I believe you are missing the point of the movie.",Irreversible
387,mindfulpulsar,Powerful and haunting,10,15 October 2004,"The way the movie starts, with the camera rotating constantly, is a prelude to the nightmare you are about to face. The scene in the Rectum bar with the fire extinguisher is the most shocking one I've ever seen. It stays in your head. The rape scene was extremely painful to see too. Irréversible is an ""avant-garde"" movie made like never before. Very long takes, few cuts, so you have to see the horror in all its gory and mad details. The music plays an important role in this movie by hypnotizing you and increasing your receptiveness. Apparently many viewers needed medical assistance during its first presentation at Cannes.",Irreversible
388,RachyLovesRattys,Gaspar Noe Does It Again!,9,3 September 2013,"As a huge fan of Gaspar Noe's work, this movie didn't disappoint! The beginning (end?) of the movie is a dizzying and nauseating ride- which I later read in the trivia was exactly his point. As my friend's around me began to drop like flies from the sound and visuals- I was drawn closer, completely intrigued that Noe always manages to make his films a whole body experience. I had recently seen ""A Serbian Film"" and saw many comparisons between the two- mostly arguing which was more EXTREME. Well, I can safely say that Irreversible made me more uncomfortable and I found to be much more thought provoking than A Serbian Film. However, again (and this may just be a fault with my own movie viewing), but I found the ending (beginning?) to be quite predictable. I guess there may have been nowhere else to go with it that would really hit where it hurt, but I sort of saw it coming. Great film nevertheless and I would definitely recommend. It felt more REAL to me than most movies, and that makes it truly horrifying.",Irreversible
389,ceprn-1,Crap movie; complete waste of time.,1,15 March 2006,"Directors need to stick with more conventional film-making techniques. Watching this was like seeing something with a strobe light on and and you're turning uncontrollably. I was able to sit through about 20 minutes of it before I had to turn it off. Good grief, I have to add 10 lines of text... OK, here goes. The movie opens in a crime scene, although you really can't tell it, except for the flashing blue lights bouncing off the walls; the camera is flying around, as if it's a leaf tumbling in the wind, so it rolls, and it turns and seems to fly around randomly without really settling on a scene. Finally, it does settle on a scene, and it's two guys in a hotel room which seems to have absolutely nothing to do with the movie. OK, I didn't sit through the entire movie and maybe they tied back in some time later, but at that point of the movie, they had nothing to add. The next scene is chaotic, as they pull the protagonist out of the ""gay"" club on a stretcher and place him in the ambulance. Then, there is more chaotic ""leaf"" blowing imagery. Then, it goes back in time, and it's the protagonist arriving at the club, and more leaf blowing video. The real issue is, I believe, that the camera never rests on a single scene long enough to actually understand what is going on. I finally gave up on this PoS movie after the protagonist's friend beats someone to death with a fire extinguisher. I know this was supposed to be presented ala Memento (another movie with sucked) or Pulp Fiction, but it really didn't work, at least for me.The fact that it was subtitled in English also helped distract from the movie itself, as it's hard to read text at the bottom and watch shifting images at the same time.",Irreversible
390,LarryB-5,Haunting and beautiful as a memory,10,8 March 2003,"Like a mind turning through the mists of its own memory, the camera in Irreversible turns through shadowy places that from time to time collect in the light. We see random details, we see nothing, we see ambiguous surfaces that sometimes clarify themselves and sometimes don't, we see moments of clear and unforgettable horror, and we see distant visions of serene happiness and youthful play set in no clear place or context because the place and context are irrelevant. And like so many of the images that haunt our memories, the images in Irreversible haunt us too. What exquisitely rendered imagery! And what an extraordinarily original and moving film! Shame on the thoughtless critics who think this film is nothing more than a graphic depiction of rape and murder shot by some good cameramen. Irreversible doesn't need a complex plot. It doesn't need to soften the brutality that many human beings do in fact suffer or the mistakes they do in fact make. The film only needs viewers who open their hearts to the tragedies of contemporary life; the good-bad power of time; and the beautiful, sad flights of the mind as it moves forward and looks back.",Irreversible
391,Fuzzy Green,A difficult yet excellent film.,10,10 April 2005,"Unsettling? Yes Facile? No Unnecessary? Far from it A great film? Absolutely If you take offence at this film then you have missed its point. It is, in some ways, the 'Seven' of rape. Belts you over the head with its ideal, in not very subtle but totally correct filmic language and at the same is a masterpiece of understated editing and superior camera work. Utilises a similar method to that of 'Memento' and dances all over it.To fly into discourse and break it all down would be futile and unjust.Watch it.Absorb it.And be glad that films of its stature can still be made.",Irreversible
392,Heizer-3,Happiness is more cruel then violence,10,31 December 2006,"SPOILER! I've seen this move years ago unintentionally at the theatre. The summary did not give a hint that this is not some Hollywood ""shocker"" about revenge, but a true peace of art. But the extraordinary opening told me very quick that this would not be one of those amusing evenings at the movies. When we left the cinema, it took some time till we spoke again, and we all where fascinated.When it came out on DVD I bought it and tried to watch it again. But I was amazed that I did not had a problem with the scenes of extreme violence (the killing and raping) but with the end of the film. As the film goes further, it becomes more and more positive and that was what I couldn't cope! The film is told backwards (like Memento), so it start with the ending which is a lynch justice in a gay club, followed by a never-ending rape in an undercrossing. But after that (in watching-time, but before in story-time) the day of that sweet but everyday couple is told. And the story gets nicer and nicer, ending with the girl learning that she is pregnant and being very happy about that. And I had to learn that it was more horrible to see how good that life had been before what happened to it (and what I already had seen) than to watch a life going down from a happy point. When watching it an DVD, I had to turn of in a scene in the underground when the talking gets more and more common and more away from any indication of what will come (in story-time, but what has happened in watching-time).This was the first ""happy ending"" I could not stand, as it was ""only"" a happy ending in watching-time, but the happy starting in story-time.I hope I was able to express this in my poor English ...",Irreversible

394,deathdrop,Brilliant but tough film.,10,2 December 2007,"I gave this movie a 10 because it is a fantastic movie. However, it is very difficult to watch. Especially if you know that it will hit close to home. If you've been through things that you know are in this film and being reminded of it upsets you then i would really advise against watching this film. I normally find that watching these kinds of things help me but this was more upsetting than anything. I got half way through the rape scene before i had to turn the film off. I was sweating and dizzy, almost at the point of panic attack. I was literally squirming from the moment the film began. That night I could hardly even stand to have my boyfriend touch me and decided that the next day i had to watch the rest of the film so that I didn't just keep thinking about the nasty bits.one of the reasons that the rape scene is so hard to get through is that you've already seen the outcome - and you know that that doesn't come from rape alone. as he gets off her you have this sense of relief but at the same time a sense of dread.close to the end of the film you find out something that changes your perception of the film that far. everything you think and feel about the characters changes. it might seem silly that the character development comes so close to the end but it gives you this huge rush of new feelings. in this last scene my opinion of this movie went from something that was graphic violence for the sake of pushing the boundaries to a tragic and sad movie which really touched me.",Irreversible
395,jonskerr,My eyes! My eyes!,2,12 October 2006,"This film contains the most graphic brutal scene of violence I have ever seen. And I've seen the original Faces of Death. It's much worse. The main page's reviewer really hit it. The wildly swinging camera is just plain nausea-inducing, and the graphic gay sex and the infamous rape scene all make for a film you'll never forget. Unfortunately for me, I saw Japon the night before; what mistake! Irreversible looks like every scene and camera move is deliberate (as opposed to what looks merely sloppy in Japon).So if you like going to the museum of modern art and love the giant painting mostly of great swaths of black and red, this movie is for you(ooh art!). But for most of us, pass by and pass the alka-seltzer.",Irreversible
396,harvey_osullivan,This isn't a movie for everyone but its brilliant,10,20 March 2004,"Violence is an irreversible action. I'm sure everyone at least once in their lives has struck out at someone in anger and then felt the sickening combination of regret and guilt.In Gaspar Noe's new film we see violence and revenge and the terrible consequences. The plot concerns 3 friends out on the town for a night of partying. Monica Belluci who play's Alex is raped and beaten to within a inch of her life, her boyfriend (Vincent Cassell) tracks down the rapist and along with his friend Pierre viciously beats the rapist (or who he thinks is the rapist) in a gay S&M club.Much has been made of the scenes of violence in this film, the beating in the the disorientating and disturbing scene in the gaybar is extremely graphic and impactful, the rape scene lasts 9 minutes in duration, such are the hype surrounding these two scenes that the achievements of the rest of the film have been overlooked. Despite the core of ugliness and nihilism, there are moments of transcendant beauty and insight. The last two scenes in this film have particular resonance with what will happen later (did I mention that the story is told backwards?) Noe lies Belluci on a bed underneath a poster for the film 2001: A Space Odyssey and with no dialogue, no nothing, makes a scene ripe with meaning and power. The last scene of this movie and the controversial last seconds will shatter you.
Shooting on 16mm film (then digitally altering in post) gave Noe the freedom for 20 minute long takes and the ability to move the camera in ways that would of proved more difficult with bulkier cameras. The dialogue is improvised and all the 12 seperate scenes in the film are shot in one take. Monica Belluci and Vincent Cassell are (or were) married and unlike alot of real life couples that appear on screen together they look totally real, have great chemistry and understanding, in several scenes we see two actors in great form just going for it.It was a master stroke to tell this simple tale of revenge backwards. The film opens with a crpytic conversation between a fat naked man and skinny young man in a hotel room, characters from a previous Gaspar Noe film, then we cut to outside the gay bar, two men are being led away by police, punters are gathered around shouting abuse at the men. The men look dead, numb, beaten down.Then begins the infamous scene in the S&M club. For many people this scene will be too much, the camera swirls and pans out of control, we glimpse images of gay sex out of the darkness, all around are disembodied aggresive male voices, a throbbing electronic soundtrack featuring 28khz frequences (sounds used to break up riots, that induce symptoms of vertigo and sickness) drones.when our hero catches up with ""The Tapeworm"" he starts a fight and is beaten down, his friend Pierre appears from nowhere and uses a fire extinguisher and to beat his skull in. After several strikes and when the skull begins to collapse the camera does an amazing movie, much like a backflip, and gets us closer to the action, all the factors of the scene, dialogue, lighting, violence (much of it well used CG), soundtrack are design to make the viewer as disgusted as possible.(A quick note on the homosexuality represented in the film. Noe set this scene in a gay bar because he wanted to show a place of total male sexuality, where there are no female influences.)At this stage we do not know the reasons for this brutal murder, we are just witnessing one man kill another. It may not be apparent on first viewing but they don't even kill the right man, the real rapist is in the background lurking in the crowd of men watching the fighting.This whole scene is probably the most disturbing thing ever committed to film and once we make it through anything that comes later might seem quite tame in comparison, but before we can relax we have the actual rape itself. Alot of people seem to complain that it goes far too long but the movie is shot in real time and all the scenes done in one take so to cut it down would be silly. Belluci directed the scene herself, the only note from the director being that it couldn't last longer than 20 minutes because the film in camera would run out after such a time.The fact that it lasts as long as it does is a tribute to Belluci's willingness to immerse herself in the character, to impose a time limit would destroy the spirit of improvisation that this film thrives on.A quick look at the films ratings on the IMDB.com website shows that females rate this film higher than males, why would that be considering it has such a awful end for a female character? Noe has a theory that the film puts off males more than females because the rape scene is ""femanizing"". It is shot from the groundlooking up at Belluci's character Alex is lying on her stomach on the ground, so we see nothing sexually very graphic, rather we see Belluci's trapped and frightened face, unable to stop whats happening to her. We don't so much see the rape as hear it.For me the film's most chilling moment comes during the rape scene when at the end of the tunnel where it happens we see a shadowy out of focus figure enter the tunnel, he sees whats happening, then walks out again.As I said earlier the movies violent scenes have overshadowed its other scenes. The scenes before the rape happens but come after (remember the story is told backwards) make up the bulk of the film. Improvised scenes of great skill, both technical and acting, the scene on the train in particular is brilliantly done.The films ends with Belluci and Cassell at home contemplating a night out, Belluci tells Cassell of her strange dream that hints at her fate, the two actors are very tender and beautiful and especially considering the first half of the film we are relieved to see them so happy together. It would be interesting to see this film in chronological order, I think these scenes wouldn't play half as well.This isn't a movie for everyone, it is violent and upsetting, but its brilliant and in my opinion for what it sets out to be is pretty much perfect. It is hard to describe this movie in words, it speaks for itself. The last scene with Monica Bellucia in a park and discovering a secret is perhaps the most moving scene in cinema history. Art is not always meant to be pretty, art is meant to make you think and feel, by this measure Gaspar Noe has made a masterpiece of art.10/10",Irreversible
397,awjhall,There is a line you don't cross ...,1,5 September 2008,"I'm sorry but this film goes way beyond what is acceptable. It's a great idea for a story and needs a certain level of violence to convey it but this goes too far. I am not a prude, am very broad minded and love a good blood n guts horror as much as the next person but this film made me feel physically sick! Showing a women get brutally raped for 10 mins and then beaten into a coma is not entertainment. Showing a man get his skull beaten to pulp with a fire extinguisher and actually see it cave in is not entertainment. I accept that both scenes were integral to the film but there was absolutely no need to make them so revolting and downright brutal.I stopped watching half way through the rape scene, took the film out and promptly binned it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!",Irreversible

399,info-16310,Best movie ever made!!!,10,29 March 2008,"Let me start off by telling you that I am a scholar in literature with a profound interest for literature in general and the works of the Russian masters in particular. Modern day authors are often completely uninteresting for me, since they fail to comment on questions that are immortal for mankind and only submits to shallowness.With that being said you might not be surprised when I tell you I tend to look for the same thing in movies. Sure I can watch a movie purely for the entertainment factor, but the ones that become favourites are always profound and often splits its audience in two halves. What prompted me to write this review was scanning the comments that have been written on ""Irreversible"" before. It seems many who watch this movie does so with the wrong kind of preconceptions, resulting in displeasure when it fails to live up to their expectations. Also, the curse of humanity is that stupid people have no way of knowing that they are, so there is no way keeping them from watching movies they do not understand.Not only do I hold this movie as the best one ever made, but also doubt there will ever be one as good in the future either. Pretty strong words, yes, and I should probably tell you why... Everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING, in ""Irreversible"" is there for a reason. Every move of the camera, every word spoken and every face made by an actor. Let me point out a few of these: 1. The inverted chronology is there to enhance the atrocities the characters live through and increase the sympathy any sane person would feel for them. It is NOT a gimmick to draw attention to the movie, nor a rip off from ""Memento"".2. Many of my friends have (unfortunatley) misunderstood the reasons for some of the dialogue in the movie and found them excessive. They are not! They are there to make it impossible for the intelligent viewer not to identify with the characters. The unmasked realism makes it impossible to say ""it's just a movie"" and leaves you pondering the issues raised by Noé long after you've finished watching.3. The controversial scene everyone talked about (and Noé was accused of making so long to draw attention to the movie) is constituted also in a way to reach a climax of realism and transfer some of the pain the character feels unto the viewer. I was both sweating and shivering from paroxysms of fury when I watched it, but as Aeschylus said ""With suffering comes wisdom"".This movie is as close as a movie will ever get to literature and actually adds depht with its format (which is extremely rare). Anyone attempting to adapt the screenplay and rewrite it as a novel would fail.Basically if you like a movie to end when it ends, don't watch this one. If, however, you like to be left with thoughts open for discussion and interpretation and have a chance to evolve as a human being, this is for you!",Irreversible
400,theatrejake,Evokes a reaction. That should be enough.,8,17 July 2009,"So, you decided to watch this movie. Unless you accidentally stumbled on it (and shame on you for not doing your homework) you know that it contains some brutal scenes, notably the rape scene and the extinguisher scene. I truly wish I had seen it without knowing what was coming, because it's hard to be objective when you're prepared for the worst.Let's start with the controversial stuff. The rape scene was awful to watch. So was the murder. But I was prepared, so it wasn't as bad. I was more disturbed by the (Pan's Labyrinth spoiler coming) crushing of the skull in Pan's Labyrinth with a bottle - mostly because I went into that movie with the idea it was going to be a lighter fantasy. I had not done my homework, but I often do that so I won't be prepared. So I will genuinely react.My point is, you won't hear about this movie without the controversy, so can you really objectively separate the controversy from the movie? I don't think you can.I think that it was easier to watch this movie when I knew what was in it before I watched it and therefore could watch the movie as a whole without focusing on the controversy. As a result, it's a movie that evokes a reaction. Whether it's disgust or loss, that's the whole point. Make your audience react. So in that, it succeeds.The theme is strong - there are things you do in life you wish you could take back, irreversible things. Once done, they can't be undone. Killing a man is one of them. In the end, Pierre loses his morality and can never get it back. That's the point the two men at the beginning are trying to make. The tragedy is that Pierre is trying to stop Marcus from doing what he ends up doing. Those who condemn this movie for making them react in a negative way need to ask themselves why they decided to watch this in the first place. Except for a small percentage of people who accidentally rented or watched it, you knew what you were getting into. You watched it to see if it was as bad as they say. To say it's bad after that is like drinking milk that has lumps in it just to see if it's really spoiled, being upset when you taste sour milk, and then telling your friends how awful the ""milk incident"" was.As for the style of the movie, I didn't need the low-frequency nausea-producing sound nor the hand-held camera style to get the feeling of sickness. It's a bit of sledgehammer symbolism that isn't needed (hence 8 out of 10).",Irreversible

After hearing the hype and all the inevitable Memento comparisons I thought I'd give it a go only to find it has none of the originality or spark that Memento had.I found the rape scene disturbing, but not to watch, I just found that a bit dull. It was disturbing because I couldn't help but get the feeling the director was objectifying Alex and the 'she deserved it' vibe was a bit too much. Spoiler** I found the revealment of the fact that she was pregnant towards the end an extremely crass plot device worthy of a high school film students.Overall a dull film and disturbing for all the wrong reasons - 2/10",Irreversible

404,Gensyn,A tremendous shock,10,7 April 2004,"Gosh... Where to start?First of all, there probably will be spoilers in this comment (I don't dare call it a review), so if you haven't seen the movie and intend to, you should probably look away. Or maybe not, if your intent is to prepare yourself to watch it.I came to Irreversible rather by chance, hearsay, and curiosity, rather than being attracted to either its plot, actors, or director in the first place. I hadn't (still haven't) seen Gaspar Noe's previous effort, I Stand Alone, so I was totally estranged from his universe. Not anymore. The clichéd comments I'd heard about Irreversible depicted it rather like a gratuitous, vulgar French nouvelle-nouvelle vague provocation a la Baise-Moi than anything else (mostly from people that either hadn't seen it, or left the theatre early in the movie/stopped the DVD - which can be understandable in itself. More about that later...). These comments are so far from the truth it's laughable, and do miss the point completely.If you're reading this, then you've probably read most of the other comments so I won't offer any synopsis, you know what it's about in terms of storyline. However, mark my words, NOTHING can prepare you for this emotional devastation that is Irreversible. It's the very first time that a movie really doesn't present itself in terms of ""I like it"", ""I don't like it"", or any expected logical conclusion we usually draw when the curtain closes. I still don't know if I like it or not. The point is moot, anyway, at least as far as I'm concerned. Irreversible shares only celluloid, the physical format, with so-called ""traditional"" movies. The comparison ends here. Other than that, it's a primal assault on the senses and emotions, unlike any other I've ever experienced. One word of advice: if you really want to try to get to the core of this work, do watch it until the very end. It's much easier said than done, however. Yes, everything you've heard is totally true. It is literally NOT, I repeat, NOT for the faint of heart. And I don't mean queasy stomachs by that, though those sensitive in that area should also think thrice before deciding to watch this.The first quarter of the movie is an absolute abomination. Forget Cannibal Holocaust, forget the pseudo-snuff movies (Faces of Death comes to mind), this is ten times more intolerable. The first twenty minutes are something that will probably stay in your mind for life. It is that barbaric and gruesome. I freely admit, I could watch only part of the murder that takes place in the club. I had to avert, even close, my eyes. And I had to lower the sound, completely, until the monstrous deed was done. This sequence is formidably potent, and has the power to make you feel literally close to panic. For the record, I've seen it all too, in terms of horror movies and the like, so I've seen much more than my fair share of gore ;-) Or at least I thought so. The ""problem"" here is that it goes far beyond just gore on film. I don't think I can clearly depict here in mere words the why and how, the reason, regarding why it's so brutal, so raw a shock, but the fact is, it's a lightning bolt right into your cortex. And I felt physically ill watching this, not just queasy or nauseous. Sweating, with accelerating heartbeat, tingling extremities, the works. So there you have it.Frankly speaking, the infamous rape scene coming some fifteen minutes after that is not nearly as traumatizing. Sure, it's atrocious, hard, viciously brutal. But honestly, what do you expect from a rape? Of course it's gonna be one the most despicable act that you'll see, no surprise here. I digress, but what did people expect of that scene before the scandals and controversy began? It's for sure what a rape should be: violently repulsive and merciless. However, except for a few seconds at the scene's end, it's nowhere near as primitive and graphically indescribable as the first -and only- murder in the film.All this being said, this work is THE most vibrant anti-violence statement I've ever seen put on film. There is no embellishment of any kind here, no stylish editing, smart cuts, slow motion... It shows violence -and all of it- only as it should be seen: repulsive to the extreme, blindly and uselessly destructive, utterly unable to resolve anything, and as the most terrifying dead-end that exists; indeed, having totally irreversible results. There is no coming back from such acts, no redemption either. Man just has to live with his obsession of being stronger than his neighbour, whatever it takes. It's also, let's admit it, a very cruel movie, in terms of its resolution -yes, the beginning of the movie as such, as the character of Pierre destroys the wrong man, and the rape's perp is not only alive and kicking, but apparently rejoicing at the sight of another act of terrifying violence. That, by the way, puts an end once and for all to all the ridiculous comments I've heard made that the movie was an apology for revenge. This is in total opposition with what really happens in this story, and on the screen. It's up there for everyone to see. The film is much too clever to try to deliver a lesson however, but it's obvious to anyone who watched this closely that Noe does not condone violence of any kind, but condemns it without appeal. He just gives a cold, harsh look at whatever is sleeping -or not- inside ALL of us. Personally speaking, I can understand where Pierre comes from when he snaps, I can relate, even if I don't give him excuses. All honest people will. I did have, like so many other people, somebody close to me that was mugged/robbed rather brutally (though thankfully not raped) and the first, FIRST thing that came to mind was ""where are the b***ards?"". If you get my drift... Unfortunately, it's a human reflex. Whether we're solid enough not to give in to it, is what's decisive... If I had the possibility, in my own experience, to find the aggressors, I still don't know to this day what I could have done. Probably I could have killed someone out of sheer rage, anger, and blind fury. So there is no clear cut, prefabricated opinion to have about the madness and rage these people dive in. This is part of the unease we feel as we watch... The characters are likeable, but blend. Anyone could be in their place. That is the power of this film, to rub where it hurts, to tell it like it is, that anybody tomorrow, despite all our certainties, could end up in exactly that same situation as the average folks depicted in Irreversible. And the movie shows it as real as it gets, not only the violence of course, but in terms of witnessing plain, normal people who are going straight to hell because of uncontrollable circumstances. All it takes is nine minutes, and dark, nasty chance. All of this is not preachy, by the way, just the embryo of reflections I have from seeing this film a few days ago. I'm only beginning to feel good -no, strike that, NORMAL again just now. So this scribing is probably not very structured or coherent. ;-) There's much to be said about the arresting camera work, the infernal soundtrack (the synthesizer drone during the club scene evokes a demented and anguished monochord lament), and mostly the quality of the acting -suffice to say that all the actors in the movie do a superb job of capturing truth.In the end, Irreversible is a most unique, if sobering, experience. A weird one, a disturbing one, even and especially a tremendously traumatizing one, but ultimately a rewarding one, for there is good and beauty in the film too. It's quite a paradoxal feeling though, and starkly ironic; this beauty is all the more dramatic because as we are witness to it, we do know at the very same time it's about to be irremediably lost, crushed, destroyed soon. That's also why it's obvious the movie could only be edited as it is, telling the story backwards, comparisons with Memento be damned. So finally, whether or not you'll be willing to pay quite a lot in terms of emotional cost to experience the power of this film is all the question.Good luck...",Irreversible
405,alex9564,"One of the most ""fucked up"" movies ever made",7,30 March 2008,"I have just watched ""Irreversible"" and the only comment I have is that I can remember just one movie, which is so sick, depressing and brutal- ""Requiem for a dream"". If you like that one, you surely will like ""Irreversible"". The first 40 minutes are the most cruel ones. Actually, the movie is really sick and is not for everybody. So think twice before watching it. Monica Bellucci is beautiful as always, which actually made me feel worse, because of the things that happen to her. In my opinion most of the people don't wanna watch that kind of movies. Still there are people that ""enjoy"" them. So if you consider yourself as a normal guy, I suggest you- don't watch the movie unless you want to feel bad afterwards. I watched the movie just because of the idea about the ""reverse order"" of the things. So, I suppose that they could do another type of movie (for example normal thriller) with the same idea- the things could happen backwards and it would be much more enjoyable. And in the end, if you decide to watch the movie, I wish you good luck :)",Irreversible

407,mobius-21,Out of the comfort zone,8,7 October 2005,"As any film moving the viewer from their comfort zone, irreversible draws considerable fire. If I have any complaint with the film's technique, on occasion it is a little too self-conscious. But for the movie itself, many of those disapproving must have no understanding of the street, or what it can produce; and for that matter, of people in general. Of course, it could be they desire no real understanding, and have no wish to be reminded all our little decisions in life are irreversible and consequential. You took a left turn instead of a right at the intersection, and there was that semi that smashed your skull. Had Alex left the party a minute off in either direction, she would never have had the encounter in the tunnel. I think what may disturb many folks about this film is the graphic detonation of one's presumption of control. It is Pieere after all, the most controlled of the characters (delineated by his sexual difficulty with Alex), who ultimately is the most out-of-control, and perhaps the scariest, person in the movie. Those reviewers off-handedly insulting the intelligence of people appreciating this film need to be informed words of that nature may lead to ""Irreversible"" consequences, uttered on the street. And so, possibly, illuminate their discomfort at being so reminded by Gaspar Noe ...(For an excellent critique of Noe's films and the ""Cinema of Attractions"", go to: http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/03/noe.html",Irreversible

Kick him in the balls or something? After watching the ending first, you are bored with the beginning. The spinning camera actually takes away from all the graphic things going on in the club. My last thing is a question. I watched this on tubi and wonder if the inaudible sound wave that is played in the first thirty minutes of the film still comes across in that format.

409,leehay-91684,Misogyny just for the sake of it.,1,22 June 2017,"I bought Irreversible out of curiosity as media colleagues of mine always bang on about it. I've seen some violent films in my time, and always try to keep an open mind. For example the film 'Funny Games', the original version is as brutal as it gets. Throughout this film you can identify with the 2 culprits and you learn about why they behave so brutally. You are brought into their world, whether you like it or not. Within Irreversible, In some ways you can identify with Alex and Marcus, you may like them,you may not,or you just don't feel anything. Out of all the characters in the film, I didn't like Marcus for some reason, are we supposed to think he is to blame for the brutal the attack on Alex ? The rest of the film just left me numb and bored. By the end all I could think was, what's the point ? Most of the male Characters are assholes, all the women are treated like objects, even Marcus treats Alex like a piece of meat. I just felt it was trying to be shocking without any real point or subject matter. The pitch bend LFO during the club attack scene was grating and distracting. It just seemed to be there for the sake of it. I'm a composer and sound designer. I personally felt it didn't fit in with the rest of the film. There was little if any music elsewhere, and the film was more like a screenplay. Over one night 3 people's lives changed forever, all we really know about the characters are one was a beautiful woman, one of them drank and took drugs as well as treated his girlfriend badly, the 3rd person asked weird questions about people's sex lives whilst appointing himself protector of women. Violence for the sake of it without really exploring any purpose. Maybe that was the whole point ? In order to somehow be shocking, when actually it lacked substance.

It's a shame, that along with A Clockwork Orange, that this film cannot be viewed in most film courses because of the controversial rape scenes.Don't get me wrong, I am as liberal as they come, but this film does not turn me off.  It should never be censored.  It is art, and it is actually I think, as anti-rape and violence as you can ever get.
The movie shocks you, and then it goes and shocks you even more.  The end of the film only makes you re-suffer the the horror from the beginning.
The reference to 2001: A Space Odyssey is important because in Kubrick's film, there is the juxtaposition of early man(apes) and the intelligent man of the future.  The jump cut that turns the bone into the space ship serves to remind the spectator that even though hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, we are still animals inside.  The bone, the pen and the space ships are the same tool inside.Irreversible depicts humans in the most realistic -- we are nothing but animals and violence is a reflex. It becomes a shocking anti-violence film, which is ironic in a way.All I can say is, wow.",Irreversible

414,funketefilms,Film is overrated!,1,18 August 2003,"This film is a perfect example of hype over substance.  Some have compared Irreversible to Fight Club and Requiem for a dream.  While the before mentioned films were graphic, these films had a message.  The violence in these films was a tool used to advance the storyline.In the case of Irreversible, Gaspar Noe has no message.  The violence is gratuitous and pointless.  Yes, it is most definitely real, but for what purpose other than to shock.  As for the camera work it is obnoxious hand held garbage similar to The Blair Witch Project.The only saving grace for this film is the acting.  Bellucci and Cassel are brilliant.  Vincent Cassel goes from one end of the emotional spectrum to the other.  This is his best performance to date.Monica Bellucci is radiant, her reaction and body language after the rape seen is brilliant.  Obviously, these performances do not occur spontaneously, for this I most praise Noe, who pushes these actors to the edge and beyond.Unfortunately I cannot recommend this film.

415,Descartes-3,A fantastic piece of film making!!!,9,28 May 2002,"There are those who's whole attention is drawn to the two graphic depictions of sex and violence within this film and those that see the genius within the whole story. This is not simply a story of revenge but in fact a real time experiment in the use of time as blatantly stated by the book read by Monica Belucci's character towards the end, 'An Experiment with Time' by J.W. Dunne. The audience is engaged both emotionally and physically by the controversial scenes and then slowly healed (at various points I heard the audience laughing at the light-hearted dialogue). The controversial scenes are also used to to show the weight of emotion that can be elicited from an individual and help us experience the rage and anger that lies within us all. Noe also shows us how complacent and desensitized we have become to screen violence by depicting a realistic scene and showing us the real horror of these situations.As a whole, the film is structurally, narratively and visually stunning, with one industry insider stating that the credits alone deserved a prize. Having seen 'Irreversible at the competition screening I can say that the only thing that disgusted me was the amount of people who walked out. It seems that alot of people only pay lip service when it comes to being serious about film and film making and once the glitz and glamour have worn off find the ride to tough to handle.If you think that you are intelligent, open-minded and can tell the difference between art and real life then see this film; you may have to re-examine your place in the herd!This is film making at its best and unmissable.",Irreversible
416,edgar-82,A brilliant idea marred by excess.,7,2 February 2009,"This film brought to my mind other films such as Uli Edel's Last Exit to Brooklyn and most of David Lynch's work. The aforementioned directors are talented people who get stuck in their childish crusade to enlighten through shocking their audience. Gasper Noe's film is shocking and beautiful. Too bad that the shock overshadows the beauty. The concept was brilliant. I ""got"" what he was trying to say. That is why I'm so disappointed by the excessive violence in the film's opening scenes. The beauty of the film's second half made the brutality of the opening sequences more irritating. Gasper Noe, the film's director is capable of telling a story that is thought-provoking and engaging as is evident in the scenes following the opening sequences. Film directors insult their audiences when they leave nothing to the viewer's imagination. When an artist says that they are showing us something that is supposed to disgust or disturb us, my intelligence is offended. Who does not think or know that mutilation and rape are bad? Why do modern directors (and other artist in other mediums) hate their audiences so much? Do they not appreciate that we are paying their rent with our hard-earned money and therefore desire something other than abuse and repulsion. This film fits into the same genre as tabloid news, Reality TV and most pop music. It is purposely unsatisfying and immature. Where are the real storytellers? Hitchcock could frighten and disgust by showing us the nothing but the face of the hero witnessing horror or maybe even the sound of the horror(birds pecking at flesh). Watching the violence in this film was like listening to a four year old learn to curse. It was fascinating for and few second and then turned quickly stupid and overly indulgent. I'm glad that I saw this film. I will not watch it again nor will I recommend it to anyone.",Irreversible
417,johnnyboymcgee-1,One Of The Most Ground Breaking Movies Ever Made,10,18 October 2007,"This movie has been the centre of a lot of debate and certainly seems to evoke equal levels of both love and hate for it. I for one think it's a breath-taking piece of cinema. I had heard the hype before watching it and had always considered myself very hard to shock but when I first watched this film my stomach was churning as though I were witnessing a brutal fight in a nasty nightclub. Even before the first instances of extreme violence are on screen Thomas Bangalter's outstandingly nauseating soundtrack has already set the scene. The camera work, though not to everyone's taste, perfectly matches the intensity of the lead character's mindset throughout the film and the sheer technical brilliance of how the entire thing is shot (long takes, invisible edits and gravity defying steadicam/special FX) is nothing short of breath-taking.Noe allowed a lot of improvisational dialogue and as such gets very realistic performances from his cast, a lot of whom are incredibly authentic (the rapist being the rather tough, former world kickboxing champion Jo Prestia and the two hoods being originally hired as security guards for the location shooting).The reverse chronology of the narrative, though it would seem like a rip-off of Chris Nolan's Memento and the movies of Tarantino, is perfectly justified in terms of how it relays the story to the viewer. As Noe himself has said it deconstructs the revenge-movie formula by robbing the audience of their big pay-off at the end and forces them to confront the horrible violence that many revenge movies choose to glamorise.For me Noe is potentially the most exciting director working today.",Irreversible

This is a definite must see, Cassel is brilliant (as always), and the ""Memento"" style narrative works to great effect. the film starts in chaos, and slowly works towards tranquility.

However, as an film lover, the cinematography is technically brilliant, and the film-making process well realised. The director also chose to include an extremely low pitch(inaudible) as part of the backtrack for the first 30 minutes of the film, so if you feel sick or dizzy, don't worry, its the film.The film features two main events that will quickly disturb you and repulse you to your core. A Hyper-Realistic approach is taken to these scenes, which is well suited, as the scenes seem more terrible and personal than any other movie in recent memory. !!!SPOILER ! SPOILER!!! The murder scene early on is disgusting and, at the time, completely unprovoked. Even at the end, that opinion wont be completely changed. !!!SPOILER ! SPOILER!!! The rape scene is even more terrible, as it forces you to watch everything with no breaks. A 9 minute unbroken scene. Deeply effecting, it is savage and too personal. No-one can enjoy this scene.

423,kairothon,sc'rape'ing the bottom of the crappy movie barrel,2,22 March 2003,"yes, there are some SPOILERS.somewhere i saw someone mention that this joint was LESS boring than Memento (that ol' thing) because it didn't show the shots at the end of time sequences to remind you that the film was in reverse. Well, i hate to break it, but not only was irreversible incredibly more boring than the afforementioned (which didn't bore me at all), it also wouldn't have worked out re: understanding had Memento not come before it. in addition, Noe fails to be aware of and use the backwards device: the movie would have had more build up told straight forward and there is no plot twist (or plot, for that matter) at the end (beginning) of the movie that you should watch out for. that said, let's review: story is weak and uninteresting, once i had seen the head smashing and the rape i was wondering when the film would be over (when it would start?) and what Noe could do to keep me even moderately interested. Unsurprisingly, what he came up with was the two usual suspects, the rest of the film revolved around talk about sex and nudity. a note about the rape sequence, IT WASN'T GRAPHIC AT ALL. in the same way that last year's crap critics choice ""y tu mama tambien"" was filled with 'sexual openess' but utterly failed to depict any of what was to be its only gay sex scene (and possibly the best interaction in the movie), irreversible gives us the 'brutal' rape from one angle for 10 minutes. here's what you see: Monica Belluci screaming with her face muffled and the film's antagonist on top of her, presumably giving her the prison treatment. the guy behind me actually fell asleep during the rape scene. throw in some cheesy film school 'poster-symbolism' (via the 2001 poster at the end, amongst others) and mind bogglingly stupid statements about time that mean nothing, and there you have it.i must mention that i am quite disapointed that what was some fairly intense camera work and vincent cassell's great ""maniac"" portrayal went to waste on such an intentional turkey.",Irreversible
424,justicej,"An honest review, hold the ego.",5,22 November 2003,"One way to take a mediocre story and make it 'artsy' is to tell it in reverse.  Irreversible is a simple tale of revenge - guy's girlfriend gets raped and he angrily tracks down the rapist to get - yes, revenge. Another way to make it artsy is to add in a lot of shock-value and long vulgar scenes. Another way is to add in a homosexual backdrop (nearly a requirement for an `art film' these days.  Just go to any film festival!  Plain sex doesn't do it anymore. The final way is to move the camera around so the audience can get only a glimpse of what is truly happening, i.e. make the audience work for their entertainment so the audience feels smart and satisfied when they `get it.'  Ego-stroking for audience and the French `auteur' alike. If a real producer had gotten a hold of this bad boy, it would have been cut down to 45 minutes. Sadly, this movie is basically a very fat, overcooked, dry turkey, with as much sauce, stuffing and dressing added as possible - to make it palatable to our intelliguntz.
The good side is that if you look at this movie as experimental, with techniques utilized in the extreme to prove their mechanical-dramtic effectiveness, then, if that really is the message, well done.  Camera movement and creepy music do add tension. Telling the story in reverse does make you watch some scenes twice (with the luxury of dvd or tape).  Rapes do make people sympathetic and angry.  Gay themes make it edgy.  Long scences demonstrate that the director called his own shots (Baby!). All done to the extreme?  Yes, an interesting experiment, but not really a good movie.",Irreversible
425,rickjb,Any publicity is good publicity.,1,11 December 2010,"Not sure if this contains spoilers but I ticked the box in case...This is my first review - I signed up specifically to review this film after skimming it on video. There is not much that hasn't been covered in the other reviews so I will just share my thoughts.So glad that I didn't watch this on the BIG screen. Well done, to the director for prompting this reaction. They say that art should provoke and sometimes make you feel uncomfortable and... and there you have it. This did, but for what point? I don't believe that the director was trying to illustrate the depths of depravity and cruelty that certain members of society resort to, which he did to full effect.Of course, ""any publicity is good publicity"", so I have merely fanned the flames by condemning this movie.Do we really have to endure the full duration of the prolonged rape scene? We get the picture... Couldn't the camera have faded out and faded back in again to create the illusion of longevity? He could have faded in and out 10 times and made it seem even longer...Enough has been said about the fire extinguisher scene. It's just graphically gratuitous but for what purpose? I have to say that I found the whole movie very realistic and believable but I can go to a gay bar myself if all I need is realism for realism's sake.I watched this movie to see 2 of my favourite actors - Bellucci and Cassel. I am somewhat bemused and disappointed that they have condoned this movie by actually starring in it. I only hope it was because they wanted to try something different and extend their repertoires because they both put in great performances.I recommend this movie for shock value only. If the director was trying to achieve anything else as claimed elsewhere, he failed. There is no real point to this movie. It is not entertaining and perpetrates 'evil' without a good reason. It is a very realistic, well acted, real life horror movie. You can read the newspapers if you want that. Don't watch this... but now you probably will. :)",Irreversible
426,gloucesterbloke,Something we are all capable of!,9,17 February 2005,"This movie is brutal. There is no other way to describe it. Yet at the same time it filled me with more emotion than any Hollywood blockbuster has for a long, long time. Noe really does an amazing job of transferring the emotions his characters are feeling into the viewer. After the rape has occurred (or before the rape, depends how you look at it) the camera is very chaotic, representing the way the characters are feeling - angry, upset, confused, etc. Yet before the rape (or after) it moves around smoothly, again, very good use of using the camera to reflect the characters emotions/lives - calm, happy, regular people.The rape scene is very, very disturbing. Not only are you put through the ordeal of watching this, but you really feel like you have no control. Yet, you feel you have to watch it. I was appalled by this scene, yet it really was essential to show it this detailed to get the emotional link I mentioned earlier. After watching the movie for the second time, I realised that when you thought about Alex' character, you really feel detached from her, due to the fact that you know what happened/is going to happen to her, so I think this is to reflect how Marcus would feel about her after the ordeal (although you never find out what happens afterwards). What's worse is that La Tenia gets away with it! The scariest thing in this movie for me, was the fact that most people have the ability to hurt/kill someone, it just takes a certain trigger. In this case, it was the rape of Alex. As I mentioned earlier, the camera work reflects this anger by constantly moving around.To sum up, this is a real emotional ride of a movie with some of the most disturbing scenes I've ever seen, but at the same time, so well made that I feel I could watch it over and over. Definitely one of my favorites. I'll give it a 9.",Irreversible

Monica Bellucci does a wonderful job as Alex. I give her a lot credit for being involved in such difficult role.I really like the way the story was told. Some people say that it's a rip off of Memento, and that it doesn't work well in this movie, but I have to disagree. The movie ""starts"" in a dark way, with a lot of graphic images and violence. But at the end there's this kind of peace, a little dose of happiness...""the calm before the storm"". It works really well, and that's what make this a really sad story.I really recommend this film.

Put it in DVD player, didn't like the menu's even, right from the start there's's a lot of flashing going on, very annoying. But then it gets on it's way and that's one shaky road it's heading down, either the camera is shaking or it's turning around in some strange angle. I guess that's the tricks you have to use as a director when the story, characters and dialog can't carry the film. I do think the movie would have been better without those annoying things in it, and what's up with the flashing white light at the end ???? is that some kinda brainwash going on ""you liked the movie, you liked the movie, you liked the movie"", totally pointless in my opinion. on a 1-10 scale i give this a 5, it was OK but not very good.",Irreversible

I myself found it very powerful and scary in the fact that it seemed incredibly real. I would not advise viewing this movie if you have a background of sexual abuse. For those who have a liking of rougher sexual practices, this does in fact play like a low budget pornographic scene.Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci are always a pleasure to watch, though for real entertainment value, I would suggest viewing a very similar movie, Memento (2000), instead.",Irreversible

Noe doesn't hold back and its this refreshing no holds barred attitude in his direction makes you very uncomfortable but intrigued throughout. The reason why there was so much controversy when released is because it gives you a look at how raw life is and doesn't play it down.

432,Matthew_Riley,"Cripples you, mocks you and doesn't even do it well",2,22 November 2014,"Irréversible is the notorious French indie film which came from the mind of Gasper Noé. Its notoriety comes primarily from the sadistic, harrowing and realistic anal rape scene in an underpass, add this with other frequent distressing scenes throughout and you have one very disturbing film. This film is not for the faint hearted, with two horrific scenes, viewer discretion is definitely advised.Its non-chronological order is very unique and executed well enough to make sense. Disorientated camera movements symbolise a cut back in time and are accompanied with the incessant, gradually intensifying sounds, which suits the films gritty aesthetics very well. These sounds are used incredibly well throughout and are definitely a highlight of the film, especially in the underground gay bar ""Rectum"" where an already intimidating atmosphere is enhanced to an astounding level, increasing your anguish. Its use of no sound is also used in all the right places as well; it adds masses of suspense and unease, particularly when Alex walks down to the underpass.The actual rape scene is far too long; it achieves what it sets out to do within the first minute, when it reached the second minute I wanted to stop watching but when it began pushing the ten minute mark it just got ridiculous. I understand why it is so graphic as it does give you a real sense of a rape, but why would a film want to portray such a scene? It just seems to use rape as a novelty purely to add shock value as there are no educational factors in the film. Because of this, it ends up giving off the essence that it's only included to get more views. At the end of the day it just angered me as there seems to be no reason behind the film, it's just pointless. If I'm honest, the film wouldn't be so well known, watched and rated if it didn't have the rape scene as it doesn't really do anything well. The characters are very unlikeable and have almost no development, there is no satisfying conclusion and the worst part is that it insults you after the scene.You're expected to continue watching the film forty minutes after the rape scene which is a gruesome task due to the mediocrity and frankly, boringness, of the film. Alex even states ""the future is decided already, everything is fixed"" which blatantly suggests that she was destined to get raped. Marcus, Alex's boyfriend, makes references towards the scene further on in the film. What no one seems to notice is that the man whose skulled gets bashed in at the start of the film isn't even the rapist, who it seems, gets off scot-free. What really tops it off is the fact that Alex is actually pregnant during the rape which we find out right at the end. I'm livid just writing this, is this what Irréversible really wants to achieve?Irréversible is as insulting as it is infuriating for what appears to be, no reason. The only thing it pulls off is the use of sound which is done to a tee. It cripples you, kicks you on the floor and doesn't even do it well, or gracefully. The fact that it is dependent on the rape scene gives the feeling that it uses rape as a novelty to get views. The film is simplistic and straight forward; because of this it lacks depth. Ignore the 10/10 reviews, ignore the 5+/10 reviews as they obviously haven't taken the film apart and examined its every detail. Don't waste your time on Irréversible as its disturbing, harrowing contents will make you suffer and will give you nothing in return.",Irreversible

434,xan_sun,Good. Disturbing. But good.,9,21 February 2005,"This film is, without a doubt, the most brutal, realistically violent and cruel movie I have ever seen. Hands down. I don't buy it when people say that The Passion of the Christ is the most violent film they've seen. They obviously have not seen this. But thats the problem with this film, the ONE PROBLEM: the controversy and shock value becomes the star of the show, not the brilliant direction and narrative and acting (most of which, I believe, was something like 75% was improv.'d). When shock value overtakes a film, it feels almost like that was WHY it was made, but I am willing to give this film and Gasper Noe more credit than that. Technically speaking, this film is genius, continuing the trend of films being shot hand-held, giving a more realistic look. I appreciate the eclectic style towards the beginning (aka the end) of the film because of how representative it is of the tone. Not only that, my favorite touch of this film is the technical detail in which Gasper Noe, when editing it, put in the background of the club scene where the man's face is crushed by the fire extinguisher, a constant tone at a very low frequency; at about 27 Hz. This tone creates a feeling of nausea and your stomach WILL tighten, making you feel quite ill and even nervous and scared. I think this action taken upon by Noe further distances this film from being labeled as exploitive (unfortunately, most people don't seem to think so). Ironically, to do this almost MAKES the film exploitive, but I don't think that was the intention. The fact that the movie is told in reverse actually does serve purpose and isn't just gimmicky like Memento (as much as I like that movie). Roger Ebert made a point in his review stating that if the film were told in natural order, it WOULD be exploitive, building up to the rape and beating scenes. Also, it makes the revelation at the end (being the beginning) much more sad and apparent, making this film extremely effective overall, at least in terms of story and narrative.The acting, while mostly improv (favorite moment: in the club when Vincent Cassel is asked his name and he, by mistake, says, ""Vincent..."" and he realizes his blunder right away and says, ""Just kidding""), is quite top-notch. The fact that Vincent Cassel and Monica Belucci were also together in real life really helped their performances. Overall, this film is quite amazing on many levels. It needed to be as shocking as it was to be noticed and to make its point, and thats too bad, because it does indeed detract from the film's overall quality. However, that does not stop this film from being possibly the most effective drama in the last few years.",Irreversible
435,phoughton77,This movie was so disturbing it was hard for me to even access it on this website.,5,22 February 2005,"Seriously disturbing movie. At some points I got the feeling that it was disturbing for the sake of being disturbing, but then I remembered it was a French film, and their films seem to know no bounds when it comes to how disturbing they are. This film depicts the rape of a woman and her boyfriend's quest to avenge her rape by hiring two thugs to assist him. I was able to figure this out by the movie's end. Unfortunately, I found it difficult to follow throughout as it is told in reverse - Memento style. I understand the point of telling this story in reverse, but it could've been fleshed out better. The rape scene is so real and so graphic that it makes me wonder how both Monica Belluci and the actor playing the rapist were ever mentally the same again afterward.",Irreversible
436,christopher_peacock_1982,A brutal depiction of life that will make you question the nature of cinema and entertainment.,9,14 March 2005,"Director Gasper Noe is no stranger to controversy as his film prior to Irreversible ended up being censored for its containment of real, albeit blurred, porn images. The genius behind Irreversible then is the way in which it cleverly defies censorship through unfolding the action backwards and in single, uninterrupted takes forcing the audience to witness a climactic and terrifying beginning set against an almost optimistic and happier end. The plot of the film is purely and simply a 'rape and revenge' tale, with the crucial difference being that it is filmed in reverse. This means that after a bizarre, seemingly unrelated conversation between two men, the camera dizzyingly moves out of the window to the Rectum nightclub below, opening the film with the lead character, Marcus (Vincent Cassel) being led away by the police. Moments later, we see the horrifically brutal act of violence that led to his arrest, then Marcus discovering the badly beaten body of his wife Alex (Monica Bellucci), followed by the deeply shocking and powerful nine-minute central scene in which Alex is horrifically attacked both mentally and physically, anally-raped and then brutally beaten after she tragically walks through a subway underpass. This, admittedly, is extremely uncomfortable to sit through and there were numerous reports of walkouts when the film screened at both the Cannes and Edinburgh film festivals. However, the structure of the film means that, perversely and paradoxically, Noe provides his film with a happy ending, since the film leaves us with beautifully intimate and sometimes humorous scenes involving Alex and Marcus as lovers in bed whilst Alex discovers she is pregnant. Visually, the film is extremely impressive as the swooping camera relentlessly follows the actors, plunging us into a world of horrific nightmares and sexual depravity. The fact that the camera never cuts away with each scene lasting up to ten minutes long means that the audience is never given any space to breath and cannot escape the reality of what is happening before us. Similarly, Cassel, Bellucci and Dupontel as their mutual friend, are exceptional through their immensely tender, naturalistic and no doubt-improvised dialogue. The reversal effect of the film is both technically and mentally stunning as the audience in its position of safety and authority examines and replays the films unfolding with a deeper understanding and resonance for the tragedy and horror on screen. The film is undoubtedly an unusual and unique cinematic experience that forces you to examine the way in which you experience a film and indeed your reactions to it. Films like Irreversible, Requiem for a Dream and Ma Soeur force us to consider the question of whether we can ever truly enjoy watching such harrowing films when they appear perhaps too realistic in their depiction of a brutal life. Some might argue that a film which conveys such disturbing images of extreme physical violence and rape must have something redeeming about it in order for the film to be constructed as a worthwhile cinematic experience. Certainly when talking about such controversial films as Irreversible and Requiem for a Dream, it is impossible to say you liked them yet they remain powerful and thought provoking nonetheless. What can we say about it other than it is a film that captures the incapability of fate and consequence, underlying how we are all susceptible to time's destruction. A controversial film yes, but one that is sure to get people into a dialogue into the nature of cinema and entertainment.",Irreversible

This movie is not my usual fare, as I am more an action/fantasy guy. The end of this movie, (I mean the beginning)the whole reverse thing. A guy running through a gay club screaming and the constantly moving camera and that low frequency hum, (how pleasant). The rape scene was actually a slight step up out of the sewer after what occurs earlier. I did get to see Monica nude (did I mention she is beautiful?) Cannot recommend this movie for much else.

438,atexbigs05,A Divided Opinion,6,19 March 2015,"I will admit that if someone said that this film was amazing and that this film was crap I would agree with both of them. This is my first review on IMDb, and it's because of the intense feelings I have towards this film and why I believe I need to explain the 6/10. First, the beginning of the film is awful. Yes, it is supposed to portray the mindset of the characters, increase the violence, and possibly nauseate the audience. And it is effective. But the camera movement is absolutely awful. It gets to the point where one cannot understand anything that is going on and it distracts from the movie. The film is pretty awful until the rape scene. Before that, everything (besides the actual plot and acting) feels like standard Gaspar Noe techniques. The rest of the film isn't actually interesting, but the events that have come before them gives them additional meaning and actual creates interest for the viewer. The backwards story-telling allowed for me to make decisions about the characters and their actions during the scene, since I knew what would happen. The acting was also incredible and the complexity of the characters is not seen often enough. At times, the film felt too indulgent (not the rape scene) or just unimportant. Noe had to take long shots and I applaud him for that and I would hate it if he cut out the ends of scenes to make it quicker, so it was really a catch 22 for him. If not for the well executed middle to end of the film, I would have given it a 4/10. If not for the awful beginning, unimportant, or lengthy parts I would have given it an 8/10 most likely.",Irreversible

440,VietnamZombie,Irréversible,10,4 December 2005,"This film will play with your mind then snap it in two. The film commences in gay bar called 'the rectum' with two guys searching for 'tapeworm'. The camera work plays with your mind leaving your vulnerable for the following scenes, not to mention the low frequency sound for the first thirty minutes making you feel sick and literally wanting to turn it off, only you can't because you're so intrigued by such a mad creation. For the first half of the film the camera work is awful, permanently rotating making it virtually impossible to focus on anything for long. I think this was done to recreate the madness in the characters mind. I'd say this is a very sick revenge film, Quite a basic storyline but very well made. The film is completely reversed (Credits at the beginning, Equilibrium at the end). Before watching this I presumed it would be quite difficult to keep track of time because of this but in fact it's very clear. It simply shows a scene then shows the scene previous to that. Very original. Two main scenes imprinted in my mind with this film; The initial 'rectum' scene with the extinguisher caving tapeworms skull in and the twenty minute, realistic, detailed, violent, rape scene, with the stunning Monica Bellicci and the horrible 'tapeworm'. The acting is truly amazing, the camera work is a total thrash (which works perfectly with this film) and the layout is truly unique.

442,nether-1,It's so bad it sucks,1,20 November 2007,"Why is this movie so bad? I keep asking the question. And why has it got such a high rating? The movie was apparently shot using only free hand, and the camera keeps spinning like half of the movie which makes you nauseous and also convinces you that people who filmed it had mechanical problems.This movie has probably the most prolonged scenes I have ever seen, a desperate attempt to lengthen the movie and keep us viewers in agony. In the beginning there's a scene where a man goes to a gay bar and keeps repeating the same question like 100 times which apparently in English is ""Do you know Tapeworm"" or ""Where is Tapeworm"" Why are the scenes so long? It could last only like thirty seconds and we would get the picture already. The scene ends with a man getting his face smashed with a fire extinguisher which probably makes some teenage boys think that it's cool and that they're such tough dudes now that they have seen this movie. Sad.There is also a rape scene in this movie which lasts like fifteen minutes, again unnecessary. Why are the scenes so long, honestly? Did the director think that it would add more shock value to the movie? They might as well shoot a ten second clip and then repeat it 50 times and have the same result.I didn't watch the last 20 minutes of the movie with full concentration, which in my point of view needs no explanation as I think I already exceeded myself by forcing myself to almost watch this ungodly abomination. But from what I understand, the movie ended with the woman finding out that she was pregnant. Great. Then the sun was shining again and the dark clouds were all gone.Bad actors, bad plot, bad directing, bad filming, bad attempt, bad idea (was there an idea?)Did they watch this movie after it was made or did they just think: ""Nevermind, let's just release it.

I can understand that sometimes this film is quite hard to put up with it, specially the outrageous Monica Bellucci's rape scene and I can understand too that many people, above all women, left the cinema. Needless to say this film is neither a porno movie nor tasteless sequences screened as if they tendon,t make sense. Lots of readings can be extracted after its showing. What might have gone on if the couple hadn't argued each other? Our life is not always the same as ever, could change a lot depending on occasions. Maybe our future is written in spite of not being aware of it. The performances are quite convincing: Monica Bellucci is a lot more than a pretty face and a stunning body and this transgressive film is going to introduce her to stardom ( I hardly ever imagine an actress so conventional, for example, Julia Roberts played a role like this). The men roles center on her but from my point of view Vincent Cassel's character is a bit upset and overacts at times opposite Albert Dupontel's which is calm and sensible to fly into a rage in a fortunately ""politicatelly incorrect"" ending. It is certainly a good movie, it's worth seeing unless you've got some preconceived ideas against out-of-the-way movies like this one.

445,Darkgreenphoenix79,"Artistically ambitious, experimental, deep and damn disturbing",10,6 February 2019,"Let me present you one of my all time favourite films, Irreversible. It This one is a monster of a movie on so many levels... It is definitely not an easy movie to watch, but then again, the greatest movies rarely are.The story is told in reversed chronological order. A format that I believe was pioneered in the 2 years earlier released Memento. The atmosphere is from the very beginning very hectic. It starts with an atmoshpheric intro with really dizzy hand-held camerawork, introducing shooting tehcniques other directors can't even dream of. And from there on, it doesn't let you go of it's grip. The crushing, disgusting and violent climax of the stroy is presented immediatelly in the beginning. After that, we start seeing what pushed the characters to such an extreme actions.And boy, does it do the trick in bending your mind! First you feel strong antipathy towards the exhaustingly masculine agressive Marcus. After you learn about the event pushed him into the vengeancefull trip, you feel for him, until you realize that him being a complete narcistic jerk towards his girlfriend is what greatly contributes to the event happening in the first place, when you start despising him again. The more you see the background of things and the character development of Marcus, the more you realize that he doesn't really love Alex (the female lead) at all. Even the whole vengeance thing is not for her, but for his masculine manly honour.Pierre, then again, many see at the beginning half as sort of irritating sissy philosopher who tries to talk Marcus out of the justified vengeance and give the antagonist free pass of whatever he has done, yet at the same time you wonder how did he end up in such an end solution. And yes, you will realize the antagonist has done pretty bad things to make Marcus so angry, even it isn't revealed immediatelly in detail. But when you see more how the events have played out so far, you will realize he's been right from the very beginning. The more you know the background, the more likable Pierre becomes and the worse you feel about the cruel fate he must confront at the aftermath of events.Oh, and the controversial rape scene, that made the headlines. Well, it made them for a reason. Both actors involved would deserve an Oscar only out of their performances in this scene alone. The fear of the innocent victim, as she begs mercy from her sadistic tormentor is even more emotionally striking than the extreme physical pain presented here very graphically. However, in some sense the cruelest part of the scene is the bypasser, who not only doesn't get involved, but obviously doesn't even call the police. It's cold in Paris and it's each man for himself.From there, as we proceed to the beginning of the evening went horribly wrong, it becomes clear that Alex dumped the kinder Pierre for masculiner Marcus, and let's the two guys understand while the three of them are talking, basically because Marcus is better in bed. Understandable reason of course, but this time it comes with horrible consequences.So, the movie on the other hand seems at first sight promote kindness and humbleness, because a bit more of that would have changed the story of the evening. On the other hand, the kinder the person, the crueler the fate at the end. So, what do you make out of it? It's a cruel world, but because we people make it that way? Makes perfect sense, and becomes more actual all the time, the way I look at it. However, I see a bit deeper message behind that. During the whole movie there's strongly the feeling that the characters don't have any real control over their actions, but things just happen to them, which then lead to more or less predecided and automatic responses. This is true especially for the testosterone driven Marcus, but as well for Pierre for different reasons. It is just about the role we build for ourselves in front of the eyes of others and sort of limiting with that our own freedom of choice, in order to fit that role. Also, the weak communication between Marcus and Pierre, from which both are to blame, don't help matters during the evening. Anyway, such an piece of art that this movie is can be interpreted in countless ways, from which none is right or wrong, so decide yourself what it is to you.So, summa summarum, this is a movie that will stick to your very core and leaves you thinking and wondering. It is a movie that makes several statements in a very artistically ambitious and experimental manner. The acting doesn't fall short from the excellence of other aspects here. All the leads do phenomenal job in very challenging and emotionally intense roles.",Irreversible

They feel dependent upon the idea that it's okay to be pushed emotionally through a film, please insert tears here or laughter here. Even filmmakers climbing over each other in prestigious film schools need to ""lay in a theme"" or figure out their character's chakra color...With that in mind, Irreversible takes on a whole new meaning. This film is about beauty in life and the irreversible force of time that will ultimately devour us all. I am saddened by those that simply didn't understand the nature of this film. Their ignorance and uneducated minds will consume them over time as they continue plunking down their dollars and pounds for $%^* films like ""Crash"" and ""Munich"". I applaud Gasper for his unrelentless pursuit of showing the darkest parts of existence and life at its most brutal force. The space between Monica and real life husband Vincent is a truly beautiful moment in cinema. The overall architecture of this piece is a masterwork and no one will ever be able to replicate it. I have never been a part of a film where people were horrified beyond belief and clapping enthusiastically at the end of this film.

Even though this is a movie who says that things like this never happen in our every day life, for that same reason i would not have wanted this movie to be less violent or disturbing. and what better way to wake awareness than through a movie.The story is difficult to watch because of the fast motions of how the movie is filmed, it is hard to grasp your mind around it.

I give props to the beautiful actress who played Alex in the movie. She truly played quite roll during the rape scene where i wanted to gag because of the violence and disgust, i felt horrible that something like this could actually happen when i put myself in her shoes. the actor who played Marcus as well does a great job. he shows the viewers this feelings of revenge so well, from his facial expressions to his actions.All and all this is not your regular movie.Though I do recommend you watch this movie, not because of the violence or vulgarity but because of the message behind the movie and the wakening of awareness.

But regrettably I also rented Irreversible based on the recommendations that it received here.Let me just say this to anyone who is cosidering viewing Irreversible. Don't. There's really no reason to watch it unless you want to be exposed to scenes of abject brutality and depravity. You learn NOTHING. Absolutely nothing from this film. If you need a movie to tell you that rape is a despicable act, and that it shatters the lives of the victims and their families then you are a seriously warped individual.This movie is completely ham fisted. It bludgeons you not only with the scenes in the Rectum and the underpass (as stated elsewhere) but every scene in the entire movie. There is no subtlety, there is no subtext, and let's face it folks, there's really no point.If you're going to make a *controversial* movie, featuring morally questionable scenes such as these, then you should at least find some way to justify what is portrayed on screen. A good example of this is Requiem for a Dream. Without a point, without justification, this movie is nothing more than sensationalist trash.",Irreversible

458,wiredwhitewidow,"don't be afraid, this film speaks on understandment",10,7 October 2002,"Most of the critics go poo-poo because it's not the typical ""fight for love story"", as ""Casablanca"" is. This love story speaks of how love is strong, how brutality and nonsense leads to more violence. It's so strong at the beginning, but the whole film is a reflection on how far normal people can go to fight for their beloved... It's astonishing when it shows somebody hit in the head to death with a fire extinguisher, but it's true too when it tells the strong personal links between the main characters. It's a true film, it's real life, it's aesthetics as a tool to suggest, it's just magic. Go to the theater open minded, let the film explain itself. Children must be protected from this film, just because they cannot understand it. This is not entertainment. This is the amusement of life, not recommended for those who haven't lived, for those who feel ok eating popcorn and watching the telly. Raw but true. Beautiful, strong. I'd say one of the best films ever. I just saw it in the Sitges film fest, I can't say anymore. i'm just offended how silly the critic has been. Let the film guide you, take your own conclusions, accept violence as a part of our lives and understand why.(peace, anyway. The violence I reject is the unjustified. If you are in the US you my understand what I'm speaking about. Let's invite him to some more pretzels... let's recognize violence as a rotten part of society through understanding)",Irreversible
459,Popsicle_A,Excellent,10,27 May 2003,"Irreversible is a thought provoking film about the human nature of revenge. With shock-value, we see scenes with the brutality of murder and rape, uncensored. The film touches an extreme range of our emotions.  We the viewers are provoked to feel anger, repulsion(Monica Bellucci delivers an unabashed performance with bravery and courage that a minute minority of actresses are willing to give. She was exceptional.) and tension that leaves you tasting adrenaline in your mouth. The audience also experiences the beauty of life, the tender moments shared between two lovers.  In a scene that is so naturally developed, we can all relate to the feelings of comfort and intimacy between the two characters.The plot line may be simplistic thus the characters do not get the chance to blossom completely, although the brilliant acting that we witness leaves no doubt in our minds that there really is more to these characters, this film is only allowing us a glimpse of their world. The dialogue is consistent throughout the film pertaining to the themes; time destroys all that is good, premonitions do not change the course of fate, and being in the moment is only way to experience life(for better or worse). I recommend this film specifically to the art/film study community.  For the simple reason that the high level of violence can be misunderstood(concluded from reading reviews posted on other message boards). I rate this film 9 out of 10.  If you are interested to vicariously live through a good day gone horrible, realisticly, I recommend Irreversible to you. *",Irreversible
460,winny62,Is this violence totally gratuitous?,7,8 June 2002,"After having seen Irreversible, a question is remaining: is the violence showed by Noé absolutely necessary to the film? I think particularly about the scene of the final revenge. I admit that film is about a hidden pain which come to light suddenly, but Noé could have limited that violence. So it is not a film for everyone, even for adults. But this film is really good. It makes the audience think about, and that is the most important for a film.",Irreversible
461,e_vduijn,Violents has never been so realistic,8,19 November 2007,"The first thing you should know about this movies is that it is a very realistic one and a very very violent one. If you think of realistic violence in movies you might come up with movies like Fight Club. Well this movie goes a bit further than that. Al the violence that you'll see in this movie is like being there while it happens, but not being able to do anything about it. They'll leave nothing to you're imagination, and all the gore will be shown to you.This movie is about a every day evening/night where some terrible things happens. It could happen to anyone. But this movie isn't just about that terrible thing that happens, but more about the 'most' terrible thing that can happen. It is also very realistic because the main characters are ordinary people with ordinary lives. This movie is picturing how that ordinary evening of that ordinary live can easily change into the worst thing ever, and how vulnerable we actually are. This movie is (just like memento) backwards. My opinion about this movie being backward is that it shows that our live isn't ""reversable"", although we sometimes wish it was. If I had to compare this movie, it would resemble Requiem for a Dream the most.In a nutshell I think that this is a very (again) realistic movie, which makes it interesting, but also very hard. If you have a stomach for it, and like artistic camera shots (like a scene of 10 min in one camera angle)you mite find it a interesting movie witch you'll see ones, because it is very very dramatic and hard on your feelings.",Irreversible
462,psicozoid,You must see it!,10,21 July 2002,"Yes, the story is very simple and not so original: a man wants to take revenge on who raped his woman, but the movie is very interesting for several reasons. The first question could be: what is ""Irréversible""? After my point of view the flow of time is something not reversible in this life; the elliptic way of telling the facts of the movie in a continuous flash back is something not new either. We have a perfect example of it in ""Memento"", but I was very fascinated by how everything had a previous cause in this story. I would say this is a Zen movie, everything is very simple, everything is very understandable and at the same time surprising. The technique of filmmaking is very peculiar: all the facts happen in less than one day time, the night has a prominent role, as it was the real protagonist of this story. At night everything is different and this is a different night. A hard night filmed on very sensitive emulsion without beautiful unrealistic lights. At the beginning also the camera moves in a very disturbing way, but there are very good reasons because this has been done. I admit the actors are also very good and well looking, but my opinion is that all the success of this movie has to be recognized at the great ability of the director G. Noé What it happens in this movie is very strong and violent, I saw a man leaving the room during the projection and a girl praying the boyfriend outside the cinema for not taking her to see such a film, everybody is advised.",Irreversible

It is a Masterpiece",8,17 December 2008,"This is the most disturbing film you will ever seen,it has a simple story but in a very good direction and acting, believe me. Gaspar Noe was a very creative director,I don't know why he wasn't nominated for a golden globe or an academy award, the film making is very original though. I warn you that the film is pretty violent and very pornographic.The disturbance that this film makes is hard to explain, the thrilling sound effects, the constant rotative movements of the camera and confusion makes you be alert at anything in the film, it obligates you to concentrate. The violence: There is only one big violent scene in the movie but is one of the most graphic in the cinema, SPOILER ALERT: A man is hit in the face with a fire extiguer several times (Every hit occurs IN-CAMERA so there is no censorship) the mans head deforms with every hit until its head is totally smashed, the body of the man stills moving the fingers and part of its remeaning jaw. Sex: We see several homosexuals having sex in a club and also a nine minutes nearly anal sex rape scene SPOILER: The woman is raped and the man dirty talks her and insults her touching her breasts and destroying her clothes covering the mouth of the girl with one of his hands also her anus is bleeding, at the end the guy kicks the girl around three times in the face, we see blood, then he starts to punch her several times in the face and the he hits the girls face several times with the flor leaving her face highly hurt.

It was clear that they were also trying to be original with the camera shots. My point is that I felt this movie went completely overboard in many aspects. The camera was too shaky, at times nauseating. The violence was taken too an extreme that I loved for it's absence from film but ultimately it was pointless. The story isn't that great and NOWHERE near the likes of Memento!!! If feel this movie tried to be extreme but it failed by giving the viewer motion sickness.",Irreversible
466,mondrosen-prime,A Glorified Snuff Movie,5,27 March 2010,"Irréversible is what you get when you throw in a bland script, uninteresting story, long violent scenes and dress them with reverse- chronology. However, the reverse-chronology doesn't make the movie any good.The movie has a good tagline --""time destroys everything""-- and at first I thought I was going to witness a deep story about how time can destroy things. I persisted that feeling until about 20 minutes. The movie uses long takes with camera spinning and I thought they had some meaning. After awhile I get the feeling that this movie is just showing off its directing style and shooting techniques right from the start until the end.I didn't find it hard to watch at all. Every emotion shown on this movie means nothing to me because they feel so fake. After a while you're going hate the main male character (Marcus); I thought I'd feel a sympathy for the characters in the end but I was wrong. I felt sorry for the raped character (Alex) but in the end there's nothing that would make me feel more than sorry for her (this doesn't mean I don't have any sympathy for rape victims in real life, this is a movie and I knew it's not a real rape so I was hoping for something that'd make me feel sympathetic for the character other than just a rape scene). The character plot is just that uninteresting. Well, to be honest it could have been interesting if there are more development & depth here and there or a creative directing style to stir your emotion. But no, reverse-chronology or not this movie is still bland.Sure Irréversible has a lot of realistic scenes, I applaud the special effects. It's a shame that this movie only focuses more on the presence of hard-to-watch scenes. It's proud of its violence and sex scene while it lacks a meaningful depth. Irréversible is no better than a gore- flick.I'd like to compare this movie with The Hills Have Eyes. Both film have rape scene, the only difference is The Hills Have Eyes delivers a character background and that makes the audience feel something for the raped character. Irréversible doesn't have that, not even after I watched the end and learned more about the characters.",Irreversible

471,garbagelvr,Brilliant - but not for everyone.,10,7 August 2003,"*potential spoilers* (although I'm almost positive that everyone is already aware of the story)Brilliant! I rarely use that term to describe a film but Gaspar Noe is able to possess my brain for a long time after I have finished his films.  The power behind these films can only be delicately described and most of the time escape words all together.  I don't think I need to state that this film will have only a select few viewers who will enjoy it, (although the word 'enjoy' seems rather perverted for the subject matter) let alone understand it.  IF YOU ARE UPSET BY BRUTAL ACTS OF VIOLENCE DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.  There, I've done my duty as an upstanding citizen and now I can move on.  Irreversible is the best film of 2002 (unfortunately in 2002 I was unaware of this).  This film is deeply upsetting and from the very start (which is in fact the end) you (hopefully) understand that this film is not simply about revenge or violence, its about life.  Life does not have order, it does not have happy endings and horrible things occur every day. Having this film run in reverse only demonstrates how well Gaspar Noe understands both cinema and humanity.  By seeing the events of the film unfold without knowing the history behind them makes us more aware of the horrors of violence and revenge because we don't understand the reasons for them to take place.  Instead of the typical 'hero' in a revenge film getting sympathy from the audience (and as a result the audience condones this behavior, not matter how disgusting the act) we see a brutal killing without understanding the reasoning behind it.  This is the reason many people believe this film is actually violent for the sake of being violent, when in fact Noe is showing just how disgusting violence is regardless of the motives behind it.  Bravo! (too bad this point will not be understood by most of the audience-who is too focused on the violence itself, the irony is somehow appropriate)  The camera work also creates an eerie, uncomfortable experience for the viewer.  We are taken without consent to places most of us would never dare venture to.  The 12 scenes, all done with a single shot, create a 'documentary' feel to the film.  It's brutal because the camera does not cut away no matter what content is being shown.  The violence is excessive (and in this case quite long) because violence doesn't come in a pretty package.  We are almost given an endurance test during the underpass scene (at a staggering 10 minutes).  We watch as a stranger comes down the stairwell, witnesses what is going on, and finally leaves without doing anything at all (while the camera stays perfectly still, unflinching). This demonstrates perfectly that unless you are the victim of a brutal crime you have the option of walking away and remaining unharmed (and people do choose to simply walk away).  Noe takes away this option, we are forced to watch the entire act take place without a break and in this case with the knowledge that in the end the perpetrator walks away and will never be held accountable for this crime (for those of you that didn't notice, the man killed with the fire extinguisher was not the same person who raped Alex). Then to top it off we witness that before this horrible act, a simple argument is what caused Alex (Monica Bellucci) to leave the party alone in the first place.  Then even further back we see Alex and Marcus (Vincent Cassel) laying around on a typical evening doing the (boring, I think I heard one reviewer say) typical tasks and saying the typical things (which only makes the things we have already experienced in the film even more effective).  The very end of the film is perhaps the most upsetting, a seemingly ""perfect moment"" when the world feels like it might actually be all right after all. I'm not going to mention much about the directing, acting, etc. because they simply have to be witnessed rather than described.  This film is near perfect and anyone that says otherwise I think just had a difficult time with the content (which is totally understandable) and brushed the film off as artistic, foreign crap (which is really unfair).  I'd give this a 9.99999 out of 10.",Irreversible

Worst of all, the filmmaker uses every trick in the book to toy with your emotions. Does it advance the story to make the woman pregnant? No. It only gives the viewer a heightened sense that the forthcoming event is going to be excruciating horrible. Does it advance the story to make the victim extremely beautiful and free spirited? Of course not. Yet Noe knows how that this, too, will affect the viewer. What about the couple in bed before the party foreshadowing their own fate? This trick is used to bring the viewer out of the bliss that they have been experiencing for the last 30 minutes or so and draw your attention back to the rape.If I am supposed to learn anything from this movie, I don't know what it is.

The spinning goes along with the music like a amusement park ride. At parts I had to fast forward until the screen stopped spinning.The effects in the fight and beating were very well done not the CG stuff in a lot of movie.

In an Eye for an Eye we only see blurred images and the phone on the ground but that was move emotional upsetting for me.I gave this such a low rating because I really had a hard time watching it with the spinning.

475,rhealy-not-really,"Interestingly sequenced but undisciplined, condescending and over-cast",2,24 March 2012,"The two opening scenes are tense and dramatic. The flaws in the story leading to these scenes erode the value of the movie.Acting is acting, and Cassel and Bellucci put a great deal of effort into their performances, but neither is believable due to how they are directed.Vincent Cassel--even seduced into a madness for revenge--is playing far too against type in the cab scene--even an emotionally throttled Marcus wouldn't irrationally assault an immigrant cab driver and steal the cab. This scene isn't Cassel's fault, it's Noe's: Cassel exudes confidence and control, not mania. The preceding confrontational scenes suit Cassel fine. But this one breaks the spell.Casting Bellucci as Alex is a critical mistake. Bellucci, at the time of casting, was internationally recognized as a beautiful actress and model. She is capable, intelligent, and in control of her desirability. As Alex, she's not believable in the linchpin for the story--the rape. Even though she is shown from the back of her head when the audience first sees her pre-assault, she is not sufficiently anonymous to not be an attractive, self-aware woman: in Paris, in the 21st century, it's unlikely that such a woman would not have either pepper spray to fight off Tenia or a phone to call the police when she witnesses him beat (what the audience assumes to be) a whore. Perhaps using amateurs may have made the film more engaging.Those reservations aside, the rape/beating scene is highly flawed. The rape is eroticized into a dominant male/submissive female relationship, as Alex does not fight the rape under threat of violence and makes only empty screams that do not epitomize the violence of the act. Had she been beaten first, this would be more logical, and, ironically, less disturbing, as a physically injured person is far less able to fight back. The order as given will The rape scene is also eroticized by its suggestiveness--Alex is never shown even partially naked, and Bellucci--not Alex--moves a scarf deliberately early in the scene to obscure her breasts. This is obviously a function of the actor and not the character, and, while it spares Bellucci, it damages the violence of the scene by failing to show a devastating portrait of sexual violation.The characterization of the rapist is troubling because of what it declaims about perceptions of beauty and wealth. While raping Alex, the insecure and stupid Tapeworm repeatedly makes reference to her beauty and wealth as his reasons for raping her--or else why would he risk imprisonment for assaulting someone in a public place? It is narcissistic to argue that even monstrous people would be unable to prevent themselves from trying to destroy and violate a woman because of lust for beauty and envy for wealth.This marginalizes rape victims who don't resemble cover models and who aren't wealthy. It also effectually argues that men who admire beautiful women or respect their status are unconsciously drawn to rape them.In the end, by sensationalizing and glamorizing rape and violence, Irreversible is exploiting problems rather than addressing them.",Irreversible
476,thylacine666,What an experience!,9,1 April 2004,"All I need say is WOW.This is the new Gaspar Noe pic starring my dream woman Monica Bellucci, and her real-life husband Vincent Cassell (he's lucky I like him too or I'd kill him).This is the movie getting big press over here (the controversial kind), where it just came out 2day, over the graphic nature and excruciating length of the rape scene. THEY'RE NOT KIDDING! Here you have Thylacine, one of the most ardent anti-censorship proponents around, doubting his very position during this scene, and actually having to look away, it was so disturbing and horrifying.Now don't by any means think that it was somehow titillating; it was sickening and horrifying, and another scene in the film contained violence so graphic it put ""Passion of the Christ"" to shame - it was literally like a close-in vid of the leadup to an Ogrish pic.Now you may at this point be thinking a-la ""Ken Park"", shock for the sake of shock with no substance whatsoever. You'd be very wrong. The film is utterly brilliant. It's told in reverse scene-order, in the same way as ""Memento"", starting with Vincent Cassell being stretchered out of a club unconscious and beaten to a pulp, and his friend being led out in cuffs alongside, being sworn and jeered at by the patrons. As the film progresses (and the scenes are revealed in reverse chronological order), we see the day in reverse, the film ending at the morning of the day depicted.Now the start of the film is a TRIP. The camera is swirling and swooping all over the place and you can barely see what's happening, and I was beginning to wonder what the hell was going on and hoping it wouldn't all be like that, but it isn't - give it a chance. To me this is a representation of the madness and psychotic frenzy the main characters are in at this point in the story. You can barely see what's happening with all the swooping and shuddering, and thundering rise and fall of some deep bass thunder overlaid on the scenes.People walked out during the film, not surprisingly. Interestingly enough, it was all the young people! All those left in the theatre were older (than me, at 25), 40s-50s, including a COUPLE in their early 50s who stayed through the whole thing. RESPECT! THEY recognised it for what it was... a genius crafting a visceral experience, not a blatant attempt at shock. Not ONCE were the violent scenes glamourised or glorified.
See this film. Seriously. I realised towards the end, as skilfully manipulated as I was, through their depiction and conversations that I really cared about these people, and soon had it hit home - I'll never know what happens to them. Obviously we see what's happened at the end of the NIGHT, but there's a long way to go for the characters if they're not totally destroyed. I cannot recommend this film enough. Trust me, I doubt you'll EVER have seen anything so violent or disturbing, but if you believe you're capable of stomaching that to take in an utterly brilliant piece of film-making, get out there and see it. 10/10 (a DAMN rare mark from me).",Irreversible
477,GodBlessCanada,Important; One of the greatest motion pictures ever made.,10,12 June 2004,"A lot of people hate this movie. I suppose that's understandable on a knee jerk reaction kind of level for it is intensely disturbing and horrifically violent. However this is merely one level to the film, arguably the most superficial one. And it's a shame that people close the book and pass judgment on Irreversible based solely on that stuff. For it is a truly amazing artistic work. Gaspar Noe has created a film that the world has so desperately needed for a very long time. It accomplishes the rare feat of actually, successfully redefining the parameters of what a movie is. This is where the majority of so called ""independent"" or ""art house"" cinema seems to fail, the result being forced stylism and pretentious pointless new conventions. As director, writer, producer, cinematographer and occasional steady cam operator Noe is an artist who is truly realising his vision. Through courageously genius camera work, a successfully manipulative storytelling style and above all wicked directing he takes the audience on an emotional ride. In 5 words: Frantic, terrifying, depressing, melancholic, defeatist. In one word:human. I urge everyone to give this movie a chance.",Irreversible
478,GodBlessCanada,The single most definitive artistic vision in the history of cinema,10,14 August 2005,"Noe is a genius. Everyone who fancies themselves a ""cineaste"" needs to experience this movie at least once. It is far too easily written off as exploitation due to the 2 famous, explicit scenes. These scenes comprise about 20 minutes of a nearly 2 hour movie. They are graphic and disturbing and hard to watch. But the one thing they are not is exploitative. They are not gratuitous. They are necessary. Noe wrote, produced, directed and even shot some of Irreversible. This is truly his vision and one worth seeing. If for no other reason than such a thing is a very rare thing in this detrimentally politically correct time, where everything is made by committee, everything is PG-13, and art takes a backseat to selling tickets.

What Noe managed to achieve here is to shake up the viewer with various methods, that add a layer of immersion above everything else. The acting is beyond superb - as most of the dialog is actually improvised. The cinematography is simply mind blowing - unlike ANYTHING I have ever seen before. The way the director chose to sequence the scenes is one of the most original and dare I say necessary executions in recent memory. The pulsating soundtrack and the incredible disorienting camera work are perfect and are integrated into the film in a professional manner that doesn't make it cheesy or unneeded - the contrary is true.

480,xaiki,"What ""Irréversible"" penetrates..",9,12 August 2004,"Note: Spoilers.While many people focused on whether or not this film has made a landmark in cinematic culture, I believe it breaches a mark in acting. Bellucci's character has possibly the most difficult part; bearing the horror of rape. Though the scene is nearly impossible to watch, her acting was so conceivable, I felt as though I was watching an actual victim.This is not to say that the director is heroic for his portrayal, but that if anything, this is a landmark in acting. Cassel was authentic as well, and I believed his anger, and felt his revenge to the rapist. Near the beginning, Cassel and another character search for the rapist, and when found, his face is bashed to the point of no recognition, with a fire extinguisher. The scene is also unbearable to watch, but done so effectively, that I felt every bash to the man's face.The film's photography, and lighting was amazing, though nauseous at times. Sometimes I feel that directors try to be ""controversial,"" and forget about the art, and focus on what can put them in the media. I tended to feel that this movie was made graphic, solely for the purpose of controversy, but overall, the artistic view, was innovative.",Irreversible

The way the movie was filmed and edited stabs the viewer in the most painful way just to give the meaning of the movie! The music added a special feeling to what is the most shocking film for the last 10 years! Well done Gaspar for a unique and shocking 12 minutes! Monica i think is an amazing actress only she can play a part like that just like Malena...showing us what can happen to an ordinary woman and what the consequences do!Lets see what other shocking film Gaspar can think of and maybe this time it can actually win a award at the Canne Festival instead of shocking the audience!,Irreversible
482,mathcos,It has been 8 months...,8,14 December 2016,"It has been eight months I have seen this movie and it still haunts me. I surprise myself in the darkest moment of my life; humming. Humming the second movements of the seventh symphony of Beethoven. It is like a childhood trauma that emerges after years of repression. Trauma is the word to describe this movie. It is like a dream.It begins in the darkest place of existence. You don't know where you are, what is going on. You only guess it's awful. You don't want to be here, it is chaos. Then scene after scene, the mystery unveils, until the horror. And from this point, knowing what will happen. Seeing it has not yet happen. You are happy. They are happy, the most happy couple, until the very last scene, where you feel relieved. Living in denial. You know what will happen to them, but it was but a dream. It is truly one of the best french cinematographic piece of this century. Noe has a unique way of disturbing the norm and what is expected. The french Von Triers. Furthermore, one of the best acting couple I have seen on screen. It's believable. You can empathise and you do.I don't recommend this movie to everyone, but if you like great cinema and are not easily choked, perturbed or traumatised, do watch it.",Irreversible

484,darrent91,structure,7,11 July 2006,"This film has some very effective scenes and masterful cinematography. The graphic violence is purposeful, stylistic, and utterly realistic. Other reviewers tend to focus on the films strengths (or they hate it for its violence). What I find to be just as interesting is the film's structure. Like Memento, it is filmed backwards. The climax (and the most powerful scene) is at the beginning. Towards the end of the film, new things are revealed, but the dialog seems to be mediocre, and the film seems to drag. It is obvious why Memento was filmed in reverse chronological order, but the structure in this film seems to weaken the film. The structure is interesting because it is rare, but it is also seemingly arbitrary. The reverse order seems like it is for its own sake, rather than for the sake of the story. Also, the previous comparison to ""I Spit on Your Grave"" is misguided. That film really is exploitative trash. This film is art--but has structural weaknesses.",Irreversible
485,Knighf,Not a big fan,3,14 May 2016,"I understand what Noe goes for in the dizzying shots representative of chaos but it's a bit too lofty here. I wasn't even sick during the first 20 or so minutes that the camera goes ape but more annoyed as I was trying to determine the location/setting and was getting nowhere. The entire backwards filming fell short to me as everything pretty much lost relevance after the rape scene. The entire goal for me as an audience was to find out who indeed raped Alex and if she was avenged. The film moving backwards was entirely counterproductive as we find out ""The Tenia"" WAS NOT the drugged up individual who Pierre ruthlessly murdered. The whole scene happened in the same night and both the real and fake Tenia wore different clothing AND seemed to look different. The only thing that could link them as far as I could tell was that the rapist chose her anus, seeming like a weak link to homosexuality which would have served to place him at The Rectum BUT even so, that place was such a madhouse, the fact that they determined the fake Tenia was Tenia from virtually complete silence was just ridiculous. This lead me to believe an innocent person was killed.Skipping past that however, the rest of the film after she got raped was simply Pierre whining about coulda-shoulda-woulda's concerning his past relationship with Alex (which was 3 years ago) sounding like a sad loser and his constant insulting of Marcus - who I honestly thought was going to beat the snot out of him because he took it WAY too far. The film then fizzles out to their mundane sleep scene showcasing a normal life. Granted, this was to show anything can happen but it could have done so without trying to be avant-garde and just show the movie in a forward setting. The final shots were just lazy in my opinion. The pregnancy to add the typical emotions to the viewer followed by her holding her stomach assumedly in a flashback... farther back? The film then finally flashes back to her reading a book on grass which symbolizes nothing at all. We are then finally subjected to a torturous minute or so of grating noise accompanies by seizure-inducing flashes that apparently are supposed to symbolize chaos but really just symbolize Noe subjecting us to torture. We then see text about time destroying all things, a broad philosophy that is actually too broad to have any direct correlation to the film.",Irreversible
486,fakeass-1,Realistic on screen violence.,7,8 February 2013,"I was told not to watch this movie by a friend of mine, who, like everybody else, had certain moral judgments about this movie. I'm pretty sure that if any of what happens in the movie was real, it would've been very hard to watch. Knowing this made me watch it a bit like a horror movie: sure, terrible things happen, but you know they are fake. The story is told in reverse order. This actually made it easier to watch. Once you have seen the opening scene, things progress from bad to better. Besides feeling a bit contrivedly 'artistic', it reduced my sympathy for the characters, because you do not get to know them before terrible things happen to them. It's style is fast-paced and absorbing. There is some graphic violence and sex, though I've actually seen much more graphic stuff on screen recently. The soundtrack and the acting make it feel slightly nauseating and uncomfortable (perhaps disgusting, if you take it seriously), which results in a more accurate portrayal of violence than I have ever seen on a screen. 'Irreversible', while being far from fun to watch, succeeds at being a unique movie that you will remember for a long time after. It also left me wondering: do we really want be numbed to this kind of violence by watching hyper-realistic movies?",Irreversible

How anyone can fail to see this film is blatant, homophobic misogynistic tabloid style sensation? There is even a dumb bimbo at the centre acting out a brutal sadistic rape fantasy for the titillation of the male audience.

This is a great movie and while disturbing, the only people that say its crap are those that do not understand it. It captures the brutality of humanity and shows us that there is no justification for violence.***************SPOILER******************** ""An eye for eye"" as the old saying goes, but this movie illustrates quiet well, that there is no justifying this. The film is intentionally shown backwards, because if the rape scene was at the beginning of the film, and the brutal bashing was at the end of the film, people would have almost felt justified in seeing that. The purpose of the film is to show us that two wrongs don't make a right, especially when taken out on the wrong people. Not a total spoiler so to speak, but when you watch this film, pay particular attention at the beginning to who is getting bashed.Top film, although I have only watched it once, and it was some time ago, I still remember it as if it were yesterday. Definitely not for the faint hearted, but in my opinion, anyone with a brain can watch this appreciate it for what it tells us about people, and how in the right or wrong situation, we do exactly what we think is necessary, even if we are not aware of the consequences.

In my opinion it would have been more suitable as a fifteen minute short with only the shocking parts. That is why I propose a re cut of Irréversible. The short would basically consists of three scenes:1. It starts with the revenge murder. (That befalls the wrong man if I'm not mistaken.)2. The rape scene everyone talks about.3. We are shown the innocence that will be destroyed.The dialogue and camera spinning that isn't contributing to the plot is gone, but the purpose of the film remains.To sum up, I can't recommend  it.",Irreversible
492,exon_fr,the next step in cinema,10,26 May 2002,"There is a book written by Andrei Tarkovsky called ""Sculpting in Time"", in wich he tries to define an alternative to montage driven film; that is to say almost the entire film production in the world. He saw cinema as the ultimate art that was capable to reach the audience in its soul. By the use of time. This clearly appeared in his films by the extensive use of sequence shots. But, it doesn't mean a whole film like this, no; it's still moments in life carefully chosen, captured - through a single shot to truly FEEL the time, wich is inseparable from its meaning - and then arranged in the cutting room. That is what Irreversible manages to do in an absolutely, incredibly, fantastically stunning way. Don't listen to the easy critics; it's absolutely not a story of revenge. In fact don't listen to any critics, try to see the film with a neutral approach (impossible), and experience what cinema is. Like Tarkovsky's films, this film is the proof that eisenstein wasn't right. You can use juxtaposition of unrelated shots to create a meaning. But not emotions. Not rythm. Rythm and emotions are IN the shot, not around it.It's a film about what passion driven lives lead to. What you get when you just want to enjoy present time. Like Marcus, you destroy what you really care for.It's the film you have to see if you plan to be a filmmaker, cos it's a vaccine against mediocrity.",Irreversible

The story line is good, but the camera man spins the camera around so much you can hardly make out the actors in the movie. I would guess the camera man was an amateur and has very little experience staying focused on the scene. I only watched it once and would not recommend it to anyone. Watching the beginning gave me a headache because of the poor filming. I almost felt like I was sitting in a chair spinning around getting more dizzy and sick as the camera moved through this movie... Otherwise, it could be an OK flick.....",Irreversible
495,x_tank_kitten_x,Time destroys all things...,10,21 August 2007,"I rented Irreversible after years of hearing about it. I was shocked when I found a copy of it at my local music store/video rental.For anyone who's about to watch it the first time, this is very important: STICK WITH IT! You may get very confused at first. This movie is told backwards. Instead of a beginning going through to the ending, the ending is first. The last scene of the movie is technically the beginning. It's a bit difficult to explain, but if you stay with it, don't get fed up and watch it all the way through, it'll make perfect sense.I heard that this movie was incredibly disturbing, and some aspects of it are. The story follows Marcus and Alex, a couple. The first scenes of the movie show Marcus being wheeled out and put into an ambulance. As the story goes back in time, it shows how he wound up there. You see him in a gay club called the Rectum, searching for a man called Le Tenia. At this point, you don't know what Le Tenia did. The unforgettable fire extinguisher scene pops in here; it shows Pierre (a friend of Marcus) brutally beating a man in the face with a fire extinguisher, inevitably killing him. The scene then changes to a conversation with a she-male, revealing that the man they want is Le Tenia.The story keeps going backwards, and every new scene reveals more information on what's going on. Alex, Marcus's girlfriend, is introduced on a stretcher, face beaten and bloody, only for Marcus to learn that she was raped and cruelly beaten. She's in a coma and Marcus knows that the police won't do anything to provide real help. Marcus wants revenge so he sets out to find her rapist, which is what the previous scenes show. Through talking to people and talking to the she-male especially, he learns that her rapist was a man called Le Tenia. The she-male knows because she witnessed it.The most horrific scene in this film is the rape scene, where it shows just what happened to Alex. As she's walking along in a tunnel, she comes in contact with a man who wrestles her into submission and anally rapes her, leaving her crying and screaming. What makes this scene especially horrific is that the camera DOES NOT fade away. For those few minutes, you see in full focus the brutal raping of a woman, nothing held back and nothing sugar-coated. Once he gets done raping her, he beats her. He hits her repetitively in the face and smashes it against the ground, leaving her in the coma.It turns out that she was walking home from a party herself, Marcus, and Pierre attended. She left in a huff of anger towards Marcus, who was messed up on a combination of alcohol and cocaine. As she goes to leave the party, Pierre nearly begs her to stay, telling her that it's too dangerous for her to go alone. She leaves alone anyway.The rest of the film shows the three hanging out, with Pierre nagging Marcus and Alex about their sex life. Turns out that Pierre and Alex were once together, and he wants to know what Marcus is doing right. After that, the last scenes are of Marcus and Alex together in their room. It shows how Marcus treated her when he was sober. Together, alone, they were gentle and playful. Alex discusses a strange dream of a tunnel with Marcus. When he leaves to buy some alcohol, Alex takes a pregnancy test since she's late on her period. It never clearly states whether she's pregnant or not, but my assumption is that she was.The movie closes with a black screen and the words ""Time destroys all things"" written in French.This movie made a huge impact on me. Yes, the violence and the rape are disturbing, but I think what disturbed me the most is that all these things can actually happen. Every single thing in that movie is possible in reality, which makes it eerie and frightening. Once the movie ended, I found myself sitting there with chills. You grow attached to the couple and to learn that Le Tenia was never actually killed in the beginning made me feel repulsed. The man who was killed in the fire extinguisher scene was not Le Tenia, but just a friend of his. This movie shows fate in its raw form and shows that anything can happen through the simplest of actions. In this case, Marcus getting wasted and Alex leaving in anger lead to a disgusting rape and lives ruined.If you can handle it, this movie is definitely worth it.",Irreversible
496,MasterSidious,Irreversibly Moronic,5,14 March 2003,"Today before leaving work, a good friend and fellow amateur movie critic recommended I see ""Irreversible"" because it was supposed to be ""a movie similar to Memento in that it is filmed in reverse chronology, but much more violent.  Directed by a guy named Noe who is way over the top.""  Well, with a review like that, how could it go wrong?Well, I have to say that this was a really BAD movie.  I'm not easily turned away, even by the most graphic depictions offered by modern cinema. However, not only was movie thoroughly agonizing to watch, but was just piss poor in general.The ""artistic value"" was lost in the pretentious twisty, spinning, dizzy and very unnecessary camera-work in the first 1/3rd of the movie.Of the two mega-violent scenes in the film, the early one was gory but tolerable, though like most of the scenes in this movie you want to yell ""OK, we get it...let's friggin' move on!"".  The second scene...the now well publicized ""12 minute rape and brutalization"" was pure torture.  Anyone who felt appreciation for the scene for any reason after the first 90 seconds should immediately do society a favor and kill yourself.  By the first 5 minutes of the rape at least 1/4th of the theater was walking out...with many women in tears.  Normally, I would have silently jeered the escaping movie patrons for their censure, but instead silently applauded them for exercising their right to seek a more functional outlet somewhere outside of this theater.A few minutes later I realized that I was pushed back as far into my seat as possible and saw that the female friend I was watching the movie with was also crying with her face buried in her hands.In thirty years and hundreds upon hundreds of theater viewings I've only walked out of two movies, the first was ""Larger Than Life"" starring Bill Murray, the second was ""Irreversible"".  Because of the reverse chronological order of the film, we had seen how the rape victim was going to end up, and at that point I had absolutely no desire to see how director Gaspar Noe was going to show handle it.  I also had no desire to learn the characters back-story or know anything else about the movie.  It was pointless and Irreversibly lost by that point.  We left. After leaving I've read a few critical reviews of ""Irreversible"", most which say that we'd fortunately left just before the movie changed into a very sappy attempt at showing the extremes of ""bliss"" on film and that we would have been equally as eager to beg for the director to yell ""Cut!"" by the middle of each scene.  I guess I may find out if I happen across this movie a few years from now on TV, or trapped at someone's house-party who's watching it.  But, until then, Gaspar Noe can kiss my ass.This was not a movie that ""would have been good if you get past the disturbing scenes.""  It was just a bad movie that happens to have some really disturbing scenes.",Irreversible
497,tinitussi,awesome movie that hurts,10,7 June 2006,"For some time now, I tend to think of violent - or ultra-violent - movies as modern fairy-tales. Most of all fairy-tales are ultra-violent stories: A stepmother who wants to eat heart and liver of her gorgeous stepdaughter because she goes green with ivy due to her beauty. Another stepmother who tells her daughters to cut toes or heel in order to get the foot into a much too small shoe (this mother loses both eyes to a pair of picking doves). Shock and goriness of these horrible deeds build the anchor for the moral of the story. Stuck in Remembrance. A Jolt. I think Irreversible is somehow such a fairy-tale, a very hidden one because of the films time structure (backwards, like others before me said already). It can be seen as a fairy-tale about flush, inebriation, intoxication. And also about illusion becoming delusion. The dizzy, swimming, spinning camera appears all the time, when someone's stuck into one of these states. These were my thoughts some time after the movie (I watched it yesterday). Funny thing is, I own the film's soundtrack for about two years now and I like it a lot. Having been given (with this movie) the pictures ""belonging"" to the sound, i couldn't get rid of the pictures... And suddenly it occurred to me, hey, so, why then - when all delusional scenes have a spinning camera - is this rape scene so steadily filmed? Because it's the scene to set the ball rolling? Because it's no illusion? On no side? Let's see... He seems to be a regular rapist. He is in deed intoxicated and he is definitely not a womanizer (he's gay). But lady-killer is definitely a proper word for him. And she? Princess Bellucci (Alex) in this unbelievable dress? Alex has an illusion. But not at the time of the rape. Watchers are voyeurs. But Noe gives full blast, all the pain, the vilification, being degraded to an object dominated by a very brutal and evil subject, the sickness, it seems to be never-ending... I think it's a brilliant movie, although I know i will probably never watch it again. As a movie. As I love the soundtrack, I will otherwise see it again and again and again. Reminds me a bit of Romper Stomper, where powerless people try to get a grip on their lives. Get some power. Same thing here. Irreversible is full of people flushing through live one way or another.

There is absolutely nothing original or artistic about this film. It seems like every scene was shot in order to provoque in a very gratuitous, easy and cheap way.

It adds absolutely nothing to an already very weak storyline. Understand this, I have nothing against powerful images, but it has to be used for a purpose (I wasn't too surprised when I found out Mr Noe was involved in Baise-moi) Time destroys everything, is that supposed to be deep?

Yes, the two scenes of violence are absolutely shocking, as well as the first 20 minutes or so of the film being very hard to watch due to the camera work. It wasn't until the film ended that I really saw how powerful these images and techniques were in telling this story. I know many members here have commented that the film was homophobic or misogynistic, but I have to disagree. It's really a strong statement against violence and on how events move forward in time to create situations in which the horrible parts of human nature are called out. Don't see this one if you are not strong of stomach.

Also, if you compared this to the Blair Witch Project, then you're a complete moron",8,8 September 2006,"This was an amazing film. It was an amazing film because it made me squirm, gasp in utter disbelief, and and say ""oh man that was some F-CKED up sh-t"". I like that in a movie. It takes a lot do to that to me. I thoroughly enjoy being emotionally moved by a film, even if that emotion is disgust. This film confronts the viewer with the brutal reality of what actually unfolds in people's lives because of rape. This is done in a (nearly) completely realistic manner.It's not all disturbing though. It has all the elements of a good movie, including lots of witty humor. I also thoroughly enjoyed the dialogue, it was very well written. The scene with Pierre pressing Marcus and Alex about their sex life had me cracking up. This brings me to the acting, which was incredible. I thought every character was played very well. Although I don't speak a lick of French, I thought all the characters appeared to be very natural. This was crucial to making the movie feel ""real"", and not like some shock-value B movie. These actors had their stuff down. Talk about intense scenes, the rape scene was one shot!!!! This was also the most confronting film I've ever seen. There are few things in the world more messed up than rape. This film shoves that in your face. It FORCES you to face the reality of what happens to people everyday. This is why it was perhaps the most powerful film I've ever seen.However, it was not perfect. It does not deserve all the praise that it gets. I found many aspects to be quite cheesy. For example, how Alex foresaw the rape in her dream, and how she was reading that book about dreams predicting the future. That's just lame. I thought the foreshadowing (or reverse foreshadowing I suppose) was taken care of perfectly well when Marcus pinned her down in bed, and when he told her he wanted to give it to her in the ass. The dream thing was cheesy as hell. Another thing that bothered me was the cinematography. Yes, it adds to the disturbance, makes you feel disoriented, lost, etc. I just thought it was taken way too far. A lot of unnecessary spinning. I thought the most powerful part of ""Irreversible"" was its realism, how it forces you to accept the terrible reality of rape. The fancy camera-work took away from this realism. The film could have been MUCH more powerful (which is why I'm only giving it an 8).All in all, this was an incredible film. It made me gasp, wrench, and feel disgusted more than any other that I've seen. For all of you that complain that this movie is ""depressing"" or ""has no resolution"", please get a fOcking clue. That's not the point of the film. It's a friggin tragedy. The point of it is to move you by showing you, in complete detail, a terrible thing that happens all the time. And if it made you feel ""sick"" or ""disturbed"", then good, that's a testament to how powerful it is. One cannot compare this to films like ""The Blair Witch Project"". This was not a film going for shock value. If you think it was, then you need to seriously open your eyes to the world around you. Yes, many aspects of the movie were exaggerated, which is why it could have been even more powerful (8/10). If not for certain slightly cheesy aspects and overdone trick shots, this movie could have achieved greatness. Maybe even Blue Velvet status :)",Irreversible

If it was to shock, disgust and nauseate this we duely achieved. I am not one to critise any film, so i will tell you what i enjoyed. I thought the second scene of the film, in the rectum club was amazing camera work.

Excellent!!! I liked how the film defied convention in the chronology sense, it would probably make a better film if it was chronologicly correct, but the fact that it wasn't makes it more disturbing and harsh! I hope someone else agrees with me!",Irreversible

509,tuxracer69,what a good movie!,10,7 April 2007,"Aow, I loved this movie. The effect of the images and sound at the beginning is incredible. My heart was beating twice faster than normal. A friend of mine recommended the movie, but I chose to wait to be alone at home to watch it: I do not recommend the movie to everybody; I am not sure I will recommend it to my wife for instance.>>>Spoilers: The first part is difficult to stand and will hurt you. You will feel pain. The second part will let you think and feel mixed feelings (joy, sadness). When I first watched the movie, I was unsure who they killed in the gay ""the Rectum"" club; Yes, indeed they killed the wrong guy.Well you have read about the head crunching and the rape scenes.And Yes, this movie is about violence. How and why can human be/become violent. The pimp is violent, Marcus (Alex', alias Monica Bellucci boyfriend) gets violent, and Pierre the calm history teacher explodes in violence.In this respect, I would compare the movie to Cidade de Deus (2002) (City of God).Clearly, the movie is about revenge.But the movie is also about Love. How strong is the love of Marcus (and Pierre) to super sexy Alex (Monica Bellucci)? In its second part, the movie is one of the most romantic movie I ever saw. It is about silliness: how silly can you waste your life? How silly to kill the wrong person in your attempt to take your revenge to maybe end your life in a jail? How silly is it to waste your relationship with a dream woman? How guilty are you to let your dream woman go alone back home?Very good performance by Vincent Cassel (Marcus) and Monica Bellucci (Alex). Very good soundtrack by Thomas Bangaler (of Daft Punk). And very good direction.As written by another commenter, get the subtitled version if you can: it is sometimes difficult to catch what is said at the beginning of the movie.10 out of 10, no hesitation.I just regret I can not recommend the movie to everybody.

Also this film did't really disturb me as I've heard. don't get me wrong the long rape scene and the guys face smashed in was pretty disturbing but it didn't live up to the hype i heard. i'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me but it was still a great movie.

When I first put this movie in, I watched for about 5 minutes and nearly turned it off. It starts off confusing, wildly hard to understand, and the camera work looks like someone was tap-dancing while filming. Believe me, it takes more than a few minutes to figure out whats going ON in this film. Trying to keep up with the action on-screen, and reading the subtitles was giving me a headache. But, it GRABS you in a death grip and doesn't let go. As cliché'd as that sounds, trust me, you WANT to finish this film!!! I consider myself an AVID, die-hard horror movie fan, and I THOUGHT that's what I was getting into. Oh, my my noooo. Horror would have been easier to swallow. This film plays scenes in REVERSE, hence the confusion. The brilliant camera work, choppy and erratic, is done for a reason here. The director GRABS you like a rag doll, and forces you on this insane carnival ride of a flick. The first scene alone had me asking my best friend, ""did that just happen? was that REAL?? that HAD to be real! THAT WAS SO NIGHTMARISHLY REAL!!!"" There is STILL a little wicked devil in the back of my sick mind that says the guy killed with the fire extinguisher WAS REAL. Alas, he was NOT real. I think. Anyway, after your mind and stomach calm some from THAT fiasco, you're sent spiraling into the life of Marcus and his friend. Know now, that you WILL be confused. You'll get lost. STAY WITH IT. It stabs you repeatedly with very real, very fast-paced action from there, then dumps you unceremoniously into Marcus' love life. Finally, a break it seems, things are a bit calmer... You can relax a bit. Even smile at the interaction of these two lovebirds. Right?? OMG noooooooo, because the END scene in this, which I'm NOT going to ruin for you, is the MOST brutal, realistic, horrific, MIND SHATTERING scene I have ever seen on film. And believe me, I'm hard to SHOCK. I'm the type who saw ""I Spit on Your Grave"" and kinda made FUN of it, even though its a cult classic. I was SO disturbed after this movie that I FORCED my best friend to stay with me. Not out of FEAR, but simply out of sheer shock. You'll talk about this for months. Horror movie? Yes. But NOT the Jason/Michael Myers type. THIS movie will horrify you for a very long time. Give it a chance!",Irreversible

I have to say that I believe this is the most violent scene I've ever had the opportunity to see in a film.  I think the reason I wasn't particularly shocked by the rape scene is because that is how I imagined a rape would be; horrifying, terrifying, and brutally vicious. No real surprise there. But I never really thought about what bashing someone's face in with a fire extinguisher would look or sound like. These images will stay with me for quite some time.

Problem with the ""twist"" is, when the story is told ""backwards,"" you know what it is half-way through.That's the problem with ""Irreversible"" altogether: Somebody forgot the fundamentals of storytelling. Unlike ""Memento,"" which is well-crafted to deliver its climax and a twist whether viewed ""forward"" or ""backward,"" ""Irreversible"" simply puts everything in reverse order.The climax  the ""fire extinguisher"" scene with all the raw energy and emotional release  happens in the first minutes. The set-up  the very long and brutal rape  takes place in the very middle.Watching ""backwards,"" we wonder just what will be revealed to make the story any clearer; it never happens. In forward time, ""Irreversible"" has little to redeem its overly graphic violence and largely unlikable characters.That is probably the best reason for reverse-chronology and dizzying camera.

Terrible actors, stupid story (even worst screenplay) and the director must be blind, because i can imagine someone watching this trash and at the same time liking it. Actually, this movie (if the producers wanted that kind of result) did not need a director, but just a monkey to carry the camera across the set while the actors and the retarded cinematographer walk on his side pointing the light to make us think that they really knew what they were doing.

The sound track and spinning still cause nausea and still haunt me.I don't think I will ever get over this film.Yes, as others have commented, the violence is extreme and very hard to watch, but that's the point of the film. Bad things happen.The violence has been amped to show the contrast of human behaviour. What could be more different than getting your face staved in with a fire extinguisher, than sitting in the park reading a book!? This film provoked the intended reactions from me. I was completely disorientated; confused and very sick at the start and by the end I was in tears. I felt real pain for the characters loss.The other films that people have mentioned, like Momento, are not in the same league as this. This film, although shown in reverse order, is not the usual Hollywood pap, that sugar coats everything. It wants to shock you, it wants to disturb you, it wants to distort your perceptions and emotionally scar you.It's not a film to watch alone, purely because you will need to hold someone and talk about it with the lights on for a very long time afterwards, probably while rocking back and forth.Would I recommend this film to anyone? Probably not. Mainly because of the ""2girls, 1cup"" stigma (how did you know about this sick depravity, and why are you showing me this?)

From the story ingredients to camera techniques or the plot development, Irreverible shows many things both to like and dislike. There are some good ideas, some real good film craftsmanship, being selfishly pushed a bit too far, undermining what is a remarkable film as a whole. The film starts demanding way too much on the viewer. The first ten to twenty minutes are a chaotic maelstrom that will put the viewer's stomach to the test: camera usage is nothing short of nightmarish, and there is some hardly paralleled graphic depiction of extreme violence. While all this fits a purpose it's being overtly overdone. The ensuing sequence of a brutal rape, filmed non-stop from start to end, adds fuel to the fire forcing the viewer to wonder whether Noe is actually putting all this in tape to enrich the story or to add some shock value. Take another sequence. Belucci in the WC doing a pregnancy test. Well, I think everyone in the target audience knows how those tests work, there's no need to tape Monica pissing there. Noe seems to have a problem here. This sequence reminded me of the scene in Seul Contre Tous in which the main character was watching some porn movie and we could see what was going on in screen. Mr. Noe, we could have figured out that piece of the action all by ourselves, thank you. Same goes to Von Trier's idioterne spasser gang bang sequence, or Almodovar's La Mala Educación anal lubrication scene. It's bad taste on screen, but a very out of place bad taste, unlike, let's say, Pink Flamingos. In John Waters' own words, ""there is good bad taste and bad bad taste"". I personally enjoyed Pink Flamingos' bad taste. The upside-down storytelling, while somewhat enjoyable, left a similar aftertaste to that of Christopher Nolan's Memento: was the inverse storytelling really necessary, or is it just a long wrapping to a short story, a golden cover on a shallow book? There is an undeniable sense of selfishness in Noe's film-making. He benefits from being extreme and tries hard to be so. But extreme means relative, non-intrinsic value; it is valuable because it is aside from the rest. If twenty other filmmakers began shooting movies in Noe's fashion, Irreversible would grow old very fast. If Noe hadn't relied so hard on extremes, maybe his work would have left a more positive idea in my mind. As it is, all I can say is that Irreversible is a remarkable film that tries too hard to be even better.",Irreversible
530,sdaigle,A misunderstood masterpiece - contains Spoilers,10,6 March 2003,"I don't really understand all the people who are condemning this movie as violent exploitation. The violence isn't graphic for the sake of shock value at all. It is graphic to mourn the peace that is destroyed, not to glorify its destruction. The basic point of the movie is that the actions you take in life cannot be taken back. That is why the final scenes of the movie show the two lovers in such a calm way, because it makes the beginning (the end) all the more disturbing, because you already know the actions they will take and you cant help them because their fates are already sealed. ""Time destroys everything"" means exactly that. The film is told backwards to resemble a memory, and the camera is so schizophrenic in the opening scenes to show the husband's desperate and mostly unfocused lust for revenge. The characters aren't thinking rationally, they are operating on pure, uncontrolled instinct and the camera shows that visually. It creates a nightmare that is in direct opposition to the beautiful dream at the end of the movie (the beginning). The movie shows violence in such a graphic way to make the ending all the more tragic. If the director had cut away from the rape or not shot the death of the man in the club in such uncomfortable way, the impact of the main theme wouldn't have such resonance. And the fact that it is an innocent (relatively, since he does try to rape him) man and not the rapist who gets killed, adds to the impact of the film. I don't think it is fair that people compare this movie to other recent controversial films like ""Baise Moi"" (which IS cheap exploitation and deserves all the critism it gets), because Irreversible does have a point and is breaking important new ground in film making. The ironic thing about the violence in Irreversible is that it is honest, yet people don't want to see violence as it really happens, because it makes them uncomfortable. We want to be lied to, because it makes us feel safer. We are so used to seeing violence as cartoonish action movie fluff, that we have lost touch with reality. It is important to see the world as it truly is, and not as we think it is or how we hope it is because it halts any efforts to change its ill because we aren't that moved to change them, because we don't think they are really ""that bad"". Films that don't lie about reality like ""Irreversible"" are important for people to watch as a way to formulate answers to problems through opening people's eyes to the real world. This movie SHOULD make you uncomfortable. Violence should make you uncomfortable. And I applaud director Gaspar Noe for having the guts to show people something they don't necessarily want to see, but something they NEED to see.",Irreversible

532,alexwrenn,"Bambi, this ain't. But it's very good anyway.",10,2 February 2003,"I'm a little surprised Irreversible has drawn such damning criticism. Gaspar Noe always provokes his audience with extreme violence - and expects, no doubt coverts, the predictable outrage - but this film has also been attacked for naivety and failing to top the scenes which characterise the first half.I think this is unfair for a number of reasons. Storytelling in reverse has certainly been done before, but here it is an effective device. One of Noe's goals is to show how quickly the veil of human sensibilities can drop. The stomach-churning murder scene, which defines the beginning of the film, is so strong that it is still a vivid memory by the end, when you see the perpetrators in their sickly sweet normal lives. The other way around, and this would lose impact. It's easy to overlook, during the course of a film, the contrasts involved on the characters' journey into darkness. Here, their normality is important, and brought home by the final sequences juxtapposed to the earlier violence.There are two scenes for which this film is well known: the fire-extinguisher murder mentioned previously, and a prolonged rape scene. Both are intensely uncomfortable viewing, but Noe's depiction of violence should be applauded. He paints a mercilessly accurate picture with an unflinching eye, challenging the audience to confront reality. Noe's work, here and in the equally good 'I Stand Alone', is the antidote to cinematic glamorisation of brutality.I read one critic who accused Noe of delivering the two major scenes too early in the film, leaving him nowhere to go at the climax. But I believe this is a misunderstanding. The violence doesn't exist for its own sake, as in Hollywood-style horror flicks. The action isn't bound to build to an ever more violent climax.There are many more features that make this an outstanding film, not least the great acting. But above all, I believe Noe should be feted for his courage and not attacked for showing the world as he sees it, bleak and fatalistic as it is.",Irreversible

DO NOT SEE THIS FILM if you are unable to deal with explicit violence and rape, and go into it knowing that no matter how desensitised you are, you will leave feeling sickened and frightened. When i went to see this movie, over half the theatre walked out during the rape scene (several left earlier, during the murder). The first half of the film is intensely difficult, and very emotionally trying.

Yes, it is shocking on the first viewings but this is not a film made only for that purpose. At its core, Irréversible is a powerful manifestation of the human condition, of our bounds to the little details that surround us and how helpless we really are against destiny. If you look past the nausea-inflicting soundtrack you will also find one of the most step-by-step perfect films ever made. The color, the lighting, the pace, the camera movement, the acting and the script are all made with such mastery that at the end you will find yourself troubled by such a disturbing message delivered in such a beautiful package. The much- discussed non-linear narrative has also an elemental purpose; instead of telling us a tale that goes from hopeful to bleak as many similarly- themed films, the director chooses to end the film with the brightest, innocent scene, and that is the scene that lingers in the viewer, not the rape or the head-smash, but the image of joy. Not all monsters were born that way. Kudos for Gaspar Noé, Monica Bellucci, and Vincent Cassel for giving us truly a masterpiece. Le temps détruit tout.",Irreversible
539,kelbernadine,Not as awful as I thought,4,13 August 2010,"I read the reviews on this film, and so I was apprehensive about watching it, but I am a fan of Cassel and Bellucci so I decided to just buy the DVD. I was prepared for the shocking scenes, maybe too prepared. The gay club scenes were a little too vivid for my taste, and I probably experienced the reaction that was expected by the director. Maybe because I am a Sci Fi fanatic, and I tolerate pretty graphic horror films, I was not horrified by the fire extinguisher scene – actually, it was nothing special, it obviously had some great digital work to appear to have such exact violence, but I was not horrified – and certainly not the worst I've ever seen. Now, the rape scene was a bit annoying. The director I assume, had the character (Bellucci) just lay there, crawling or trying to recover, but in the same spot on the cement floor after being raped, all the while, the man is sprawled next to her recuperating from all the energy spent raping her for some 9 minutes, casually glancing over at her while he pulls himself together. I thought that was ridiculous. I was literally screaming at the TV for her to get up and run! So, I was very disappointed in the direction of the scene, and it was absolutely too long – an obvious attempt to generate great emotion, shock, pain for the victim, disgust for the rapist, and any other emotion you could think of. The best part of the movie was the end, where you saw the affection between Cassel and Bellucci and that was too short. I should have rented the DVD, I was hoping for a bit more of a story line.",Irreversible

I know there are these things in world, e.g, babies gang-raped in the Congo, ""etc"", but I don't think I want to see them graphically portrayed anymore. I'd heard about this movie and resisted watching it--now I know I was right to avoid it. In the asset and liability balance, I believe the liabilities far outweigh what is positive that we can take away from this movie. I'm tired of having my brain visually assaulted--I just read the paper for the information now. The ideas of violence, revenge and the tenuousness of our happy lives that are developed during the movie could easily have been developed minus the 8 minute long rape scene. The writer/director knew that all that would talked about in the press was this scene and whether or not it has a place in cinema. EIGHT MINUTES! Really, how is this justified? Shouldn't this movie be called ""Anatomy of a Rape""? I've read one review of this movie that said this movie is not pornography, true, more specifically it approaches a snuff film or a documentary.

541,Rambostyle9,Huge waste of time,1,14 September 2013,Decided to watch this movie based on all the hype it has wat a waste of time.This would have to be the most overrated movie i have ever seen.With the movie going in reverse the only two Bits of action happen in the first 30 minutes then the rest of the movie is watching two boring people go about there lives.The fire extinguisher scene was decent but no worse than wat happens in most films of this type.The rape scene is hard to believe she basically puts up no struggle at all and just accepts her fate.The camera work was also very bad fair enough they wanted it to look as real as possible but with shaky blurry cameras darting around everywhere especially at the start i found it hard to get into the movie.

542,max-fabigan,Usefulness highly questionable,2,17 December 2010,"Maybe i've gotten too old for the kind of raw violence that is shown in this movie, or maybe i've seen too much of it myself.Movies are good in my opinion if they fulfill one of two criteria, and preferably both: A movie has to be either enjoyable or it has to be able to give you some perspective on something you didn't have before or at best an entirely new idea.Neither is the case here. Yes the world can be a horribly cruel and violent place - self destructive drug abuse, rape, manslaughter, murder. It's all there and plenty of it too. But why make or watch a movie that does nothing but wrap all those things up in 90 minutes in the course of one night? It so desperately tries to come across as thoughtful, innovative or even philosophical (camera panning and twisting until the brink of complete nausea) wanting to do disguise that it's nothing but a snuff-film.If you want to watch a good movie that deals with reverse chronology, watch Memento. If you want to see a good movie about cause and effect, watch Run Lola Run. If you want to feel bad and somewhat guilty for even staying with it to the end, watch this one I guess.Some might say that the acting in this one is excellent. That's debatable. If the quality of acting is only measured in authenticity, then yes, the entire cast does their job incredibly well.But is it a sign of integrity to agree to portray the role of a rapist, doing a several minute long, no-cut-scene rape that is so shockingly realistic that it's hard to watch? Is it a sign of integrity to agree to the role of the rape victim? I'm not sure, I'm not even sure what i'd do if I was offered the role. Probably hard to turn down, because after all, it's money lost if you turn it down.Nevertheless, this is far from a must-see. If you wanna see some authentic violence and an example of how horribly wrong things can go in just one night, sit down and ""enjoy"".

Rapes do happen in our happy society. One every 8 minutes. Others closed their eyes to the murder scene.  Ask a policeman in homicide department. He has seen worse.  The movie continues.  Party time. Alcohol. Cocaine. Isn't that an option? Isn't?  If you stayed in the dark room of the theater 'til the end, you have watched in the last scenes of the movie some of the best scenes of your life.  LOVE. HOME. SEX. BABY. NATURE. SILENCE. SAFETY. MOTHERHOOD. HAPPINESS.  HOPE.  HOPE. HOPE.  And then you had this bitter taste in your mouth. You realized what the movie's title truly meant.

This is one of those movies that seem to bend genres between drama and horror. Some might say that Irreversible is just a shock film. Which in the first half of the film, if you can keep watching is more shocking than any other French film ever made. In my opinion Irreversible is one of the best French films ever made. Brutally honest and dares the viewer to not shy away. Gaspar Noe is one of the best directors of a generation. This film is unlike any other film ever made, as is Noe's previous and later films.

Indeed this is the only film i've seen which has dealt with the issue of rape, in a truly realistic, unglamorous and non titilating way. The storyline is interesting and absorbing and very original. I sat down to watch it with my heart in my mouth, as i'd heard about the particularly long rape scene and I wasn't sure if i'd be able to watch it, but from a female perspective, its incredibly realistic, pulls no punches and i believe that it doesn't sensationalize the act of rape atall, like some other films have done. The camera work and direction is highly original and compliments the storyline perfectly, the same goes for the soundtrack. This whole film is definitely an experience!",Irreversible
546,elijosef,There is no Revenge in Irreversible,5,14 September 2004,"The film Irreversible is brutally shocking. However, there is no possibility of shocking anybody into sensitivity. On the contrary. Shocking is to produce either of two effects, the first being numbness, retreat, the closing of one's mind for anything offered from the outside world during hours or even days to come after the shock occurred; the second being the uninhibited expression of one's always readily available, and mostly only dimly slumbering impulses for aggression and need to revenge for the exerted shock on whatever subject might be at hand. Both effects are unwanted, from different points of view, but if the shock is produced to just prove the occurrence of those effects, the shocker can only be called a reproducer of well known human possibilities, and therefore should not be considered an original artist at all, but a fraud. We cannot deny, though, that shocking brutality exists all over the place. As we cannot deny that civility and peace and love exist too. Here, then, may be one 'message' of the film, message between scare-quotes, because one must seriously doubt, as Jonathan Rosenbaum (http://www.chireader.com/movies/archives/2003/0303/030314.html) so neatly and wisely is arguing, that any such message was intended by the film makers: If you're to weak to interfere with brutality you come across, flee before the brutes turn around to hit you. Do not stand around, hypnotically staring at what is going on before your eyes. Be prepared to run, and not remain fixed in awe, only to become the next prey. Alex could have run out of the tunnel. She was so good, one imagines, as to want to help the beaten woman, but she could do nothing of effective interference. She was captured in the web of watching aggression, like you are day after day after day in the pictures of brutality on TV and in films. Stop yourself. Switch the TV set off. Walk out of the movies. Stop letting yourself be further hypnotized by brutality. Reverse the process. De-hypnotize yourself. If you cannot interfere, run out of the tunnel, shout, try to collect a crowd to help and stop the aggressors in their run. Let yourself not be made increasingly insensitive by shock after shock, or increasingly aggressive. Civilization comes at a price, yes: As many people as possibly can, must control themselves, and must help as many others as they possibly can, to learn and control themselves too. Not by shocks, but by sheer patience, empathic behavior, and by example, and openness to organize help for gradually and effectively changing weird circumstances. That, boy oh boy, would be one message! In addition, here is another 'message': Do not believe knowing what you have seen. From a slow motion analysis one can easily decide, (as is noted in http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290673/board/nest/9652292), that neither Marcus was killed in the fight, and one feels his survival to be only natural for a non-tragedy, nor, however, the rapist either, which is the more confusing part of this black comedy of errors. It is, in fact, a buddy of the rapist, the man in the black suit, who is being killed. He is the taller man standing before Marcus, at Marcus' left hand side, when Marcus, in his drugged rage, is addressing the smaller man, who, indeed, is the rapist, as can be seen from slow motion comparison with the rape scene. The man in black, takes the initiative to get Marcus out the club, and the rapist is standing by, watching, while slyly smiling, when Marcus and the man in black are getting into their physical fight. Marcus wins the first round. Luck for him turns round, the man breaks Marcus' arm, and is preparing to give him a treat in his behind, when Marcus' friend Pierre interferes, and hits the man in black with the back of a (fun, fun) fire extinguisher, beating his face into inverted shape, the nose gone and bones pointing inward. So, there is NO REVENGE after all, there's only senseless aggression from all sides, and the rapist survives unhurt and, I imagine off camera, loudly laughing with lust. If this 'message' would have been intended as a warning about what the American Presidency is trying to pursue, the film, obviously, appeared years to early, since anybody who would also have extracted such understanding, would have forgotten it by long, now, at election time.",Irreversible
547,monlexkey,"Sick and wrong, slowing down to look at a car wreck",8,12 May 2005,"This is probably the most wrong film ever, but also it is one of the most interesting films stylistically and thematically to be born in the new century.The camera technique used although Gonzo to look at is amazing and probably contrived although in a good way. It is almost like watching a piece of documentary because of the way you feel you are there watching something really messed up like a war zone on TV either Iraq or Vietnam or something like that.The soundtrack used in the initial sequence is horrendous in the way that it disorientates, that combines with the camera tumbling around truly makes the viewer feel sick, but this is also perfect in the way that it captures the mental state of the main character Vincent in his state of extremme disorientation and anger.This film scares the hell out of me, and is a dark journey into revenge and madness. The rape scene is a horrific portrayal of anger and hatred personified in one man the rapist. While on some levels the necessity of depicting so graphically the rape of the central female character may be questionable, Antonin Artuads 'Theatre of Cruelty' is evoked, the scene is like a bomb be thrown at the audience, and the viewer can either leave and escape the bomb or stay and face the consequences.I never saw this film in the cinema, and on some levels i am grateful because it allows some distance from the film viewing on video, I can imagine in the cinema that this would be an experience that would haunt you worst than watching on video.This is a great film, but it is also a film which is sick and wrong, it is like slowing down to see the people all mashed up in a car wreck, it is also very interesting and artistic.

548,kilrgoat,No Entertainment Value At All,1,18 December 2003,"Please do not read this if you plan to watch the movie, unless you want me to save you some money.
Like the summary of my review, this movie has no entertainment value at all.
I work at a movie store and the owner asked me to watch the movie when I got a chance and to let her know what I thought about it.  I found this website (thankfully) and noticed all the reviews it got and its average score.  I thought it must be pretty good so I recommended it to a friend before watching it.  He called me that night and really gave me a hard time about referring it to him.  I thought, `Surely this movie can't be THAT bad.' So, I took it home.  It is that bad.  How it got a 7.2 rating or whatever it is at now, is way beyond me.The way the movie started out should have told me to press stop and eject. The filming looks like it was shot by the same company that makes those safety meeting videos a lot of employees have to sit through.  Also, it reminded me of a cheesy PowerPoint presentation.The fact that the whole movie required English subtitles, which I was not aware of, disappointed me.  If I want to spend 2 hours reading, I'd read a book.There are many negatives to the movie and few positives.  There were a couple of times in the movie when I was anticipating the next scene. but only a couple.The fire extinguisher part everyone is talking about was pretty violent, but nothing more violent than in movies like Braveheart, or Casino, for that matter, when Joe Pesci actually crushes a guy's skull in a vice to the point his eyeball pops out.The gay love-bath scenes were just disgusting to me.  There will be people who found it erotic or those that want to argue their opinions, but know in advance it won't change mine and I'm not going to argue moral grounds with you nor will I reply to such arguments.The Rape Scene: That has to be the worst 9 minutes of footage in any movie I have ever seen. I was appalled, and again, disgusted.  The scene could have been told in 2 minutes.  The only purpose it was given that length of time was to shock as many viewers as possible (which is what people with no talent usually do for attention.)Bottom line: Save your money and watch a rerun of Faces of Death if you want to see blood and violence.  You'll get just as much entertainment.",Irreversible
549,flickerboy,"interesting, worth seeing",6,2 January 2004,"I found this movie interesting and worth viewing.  The story is told in reverse sequence, which is a captivating technique; however a movie such as Memento generates much more effect using this technique.  In this case I searched for motivation for using this technique (other than because it keeps the viewer intrigued) and found none.  Furthermore, I felt like the climax of the story is out of place, however classic climax/denouement structure does not apply as usual when a story is told in reverse.  One detail I appreciate is how Marcus pressed Alex for sex when they were together in bed (which occurs before the rape on a linear timeline) and is denied.  In a linear timeline this foreshadows the rape (even if from another man).At one time I felt this movie was an excuse to show Monica Bellucci naked (which is greatly appreciated) and to dazzle the viewer with dizzying camera techniques and a non-linear timeline.  Even if that is the case, it is still an interesting story, told in a captivating fashion, and the director's techniques are non-standard.  Refreshing overall.",Irreversible
550,cmalk,Shockingly Powerful,9,18 February 2004,"-SPOILERS-'Irreversible' is a totally unique film experience. It may not be totally enjoyable due to its content, yet a must see for any film enthusiast.Director/writer Gaspar Noe delivers this mind-bending, harrowing film in total reverse sequence. Thus we are given a view of the conclusion at the film's very start. It is immediately known that the principal characters (Vincent Cassel and Albert Dupontel) are engaged on a vicious search for an individual who has committed an extreme act against them. Whether directly or indirectly, we sit eyes affixed to the screen eager to know what has transpired. As the film unfolds, we view the principals in a wild dash around Paris to find this mystery individual. Stopping at nothing, these two characters will clearly not be denied and are willing to assault and harrass anyone who might hold the key. Eventually, we bear witness to an extremely unpleasant and repulsive rape scene of Cassel's girlfriend played by the lovely Monica Bellucci. This scene lasts at least 10 minutes and we now understand the reason for this vengence. The remainder of the film provides the set-up for this awful scene and allows the viewer to gain an understanding of these incredibly complex characters. This is a triumphant achievement for Mr.Noe. He is clearly a man with vision and one who knows no boundaries in terms of what to put on the screen. A big thumbs up to Thomas Bangalter of DAFT PUNK for putting together a musical score that flows so well with the story. This film will not appeal to everyone. If your idea of film is the latest Julia Roberts flick, steer clear of this movie.

552,xochip,Revenge is a dish best served backwards,7,6 May 2010,"Hard to know what to say about this film because it's artful cinematic devices mean you will not find a standard set of plots, motivations and morals in there. As one of the bedroom philosophers at the start of the film says: there are no bad actions, only actions - and the film sets out to make you understand this point of view by offering the otherwise standard revenge plot line with the use of low frequency sound, disturbed camera movements and reversed time.It is the careful re-ordering of time in the film that makes for a fragmented, intense and drug like experience which forces the viewer to witness it's acts without conventional story patterns to help you form a justification. Unlike a more Hollywood offering such as memento there is no comforting resolution or standardised meaning and it leaves it's otherwise pornographic centrepiece laid bare in a truly stark fashion that forces you to confront your own innermost feelings on the subject with only knowledge of the aftermath and not a tranquil beginning. This has a profound effect on the material that is worth some meditation if you can stomach it.A true masterpiece, but not in a pleasant way. Worth watching if you like to see human experience from a different angle, but definitely not for those with a weak stomach or who are looking for a self indulgent film experience. The actions are laid bare for what they are, the violence of murder and a horrific rape scene do not come pre-processed but feel real as they would to a passer by and are filmed in unrelenting fixed shots. The construction is good enough that it doesn't just decay into confusion. It is extremely intense and will likely incite feelings of hatred and hopelessness in equal measure.

Such scenes have been attempted before, but it's the camera-work here that forces to dwell on the darkness of what's going on, and deal with it as you see fit.It's a difficult film to watch, and to recommend to someone, but if you're into artistic films and are prepared to see things that will make you deeply uncomfortable shot in a startlingly realistic way, then this film is well worth your time, and proves itself to be far more than just a shocking film.Possibly the most powerful movie I've ever seen, absolutely unforgettable.",Irreversible
554,shahk-kingston,Irreversible - A Relentless Masterpiece,10,27 November 2012,"Some spoilers I guess, but the reverse plot line makes it rather unspoilable imoHaving just seen this wonderful, challenging and inspiring film at a cinema as part of a season on controversial films, I feel compelled to defend and put forward the case for what has become my favourite film of all time.Firstly, from a purely technical standpoint, the film is an absolute triumph, objectively so. The design of the production is something that is often forgotten but Noe chooses his locations brilliantly and makes them complement his film in a way I have seen few directors manage to such an extent. By god does he film it well though! Some people see his camera work as gimmicky but its often beautiful, always challenging and a true landmark in modern cinematography. My favourite work comes toward the end of the film when the camera subtly follows the characters through the subway and the party in a way that adds to the naturalism and immediacy of the film in a way that I had never seen done before. The acting is also, without a doubt, some of the best I have ever seen. While it might seem cheap to cast real-life couple Cassel and Bellucci as the ""romantic leads"" this hasn't always worked and has certainly never produced anything so intimate, tragic and energetic as the performances in this film. Cassel is at his ferocious best, whilst Bellucci gives real credence with her entire body and soul to the most difficult scene for an actress in movie history. Mesmerizing stuff.The film is far more than just a technical delight, however. It remains an absolutely awe-inspiring emotional experience told primarily through our senses rather than our thoughts. The backwards structure makes the tragedy become overwhelming as the film reaches its climax and Noe, in the tradition of the greatest directors, suggests everything and nothing with his camera. A plot which is in reality, so simple (death wish meets memento) becomes something that has a message about the universe, existence and the passage of time. Its visual storytelling allows the viewer to decide for herself. Truly awe-inspiring cinema.I think people have often judged this film wrongly and I would disagree strongly with those who would call it misogynist or homophobic. The ""misogyny"" label is completely out of place on a film which treats rape in the way it really should be treated, a horrible, tragic and repellent act which is completely unjustified. Critics of the movie have said the rape scene's length adds viewer complicity, however I think it does the very opposite in that it presents horror as truly horrifying and in no way eroticised or glamorised, unlike other controversial films on rape such as Straw Dogs. The homophobia allegation certainly makes more sense but it is still from a misunderstanding of the film. Le Tenia is not gay nor does he represent gay people, he is merely a monster who cannot be explained by sexual orientation or any human discussion of the character. In a way he represents fate and inevitability more than anything else, his appearance in a gay club does not necessarily make him a gay man per se.Overall this film should be watched by all strong-hearted lovers of cinema.",Irreversible
555,blowfish07,"""Irreversible"" is a brilliant creation of brilliant mind.",8,8 April 2015,"""Irreversible"" is a film that you will find unwatchable. Even if you do manage to stay in the theater seat till the end of it while you see others walk away, it's a film that will make you cringe to the bone and one that you will desperately wish you could forget. Cruelty of the most repugnant kind around which the story revolves will try your patience and in all probability, make you want to throw up, not once, not twice but several times. In the beginning, the camera sinisterly pans across the ""inverse"" opening credits employing flipping letters and words that strike the viewer with a sense of suspense, urgency, and fear. You just know that something profound is going to happen. The events of the story span across a single, harrowing night & the narrative, fashioned in a striking, reverse-chronological order (the story is told backward). If the film was made in the customary chronological order, we would meet a couple Alex (Monica Bellucci) and Marcus (Vincent Cassel) very much in love, relaxing and having sex. They are at perfect ease with each other. Alex has missed her period and is uneasy with the feeling that she might be pregnant. She shares the possibility with her lover who looks excited at the prospect of having a baby. The couple have a friends' party to attend later in the day and Marcus's best friend & Alex's ex-lover, Pierre (Albert Dupontel) would attend it, too. Marcus wants to be kind to him and goes out to fetch wine while Alex takes a pregnancy test and discovers she is pregnant. She is elated. We would then see them at the party. Marcus tries to get Pierre to hump one of his girlfriends while he himself tries to get a kick out of smack. Alex is wildly dancing with her girlfriends, wearing a dress that doesn't leave much to the viewer's imagination. A man also happens to ask how his lover could let her go about in public dressed in that, hinting that he could very well be a voyeur. Alex is upset with Marcus and his reckless activity and leaves early for home. Pierre requests her to stay back but she doesn't, promising she'd call him the next day. Alex doesn't get a taxi. So, she walks alone in the subway tunnel that has garish red-lights and witnesses a transvestite whore getting beaten up by the pimp, Le Tenia (Jo Prestia). She tries to flee but is aggressively accosted by the man and brutally raped in the desolate tunnel. When he sees Alex crouching helplessly, he makes it clear that he isn't done with her yet and mercilessly beats her up for seemingly, an eternity. The camera shamelessly refuses to cut away. The horror and the traumatic, suppressed moans of the victim go on and on, giving the viewer goosebumps that refuse to go. Marcus & Pierre hear a chaos on the street after they come out of the party. Both are devastated to see the bloodied face of Alex. The cops make an empty promise that they will very soon nab the culprit. A burly man randomly walks up to Marcus and urges him to be a man and revenge his lover's death since he knows the cops would do nothing about it. Marcus goes mad in rage and they go about frantically searching for Le Tenia and their quest leads them to a gay-club, named ""Rectum"", where they get hold of the wrong guy and beats him and batters his face with a fire-extinguisher. This scene goes on unrelentingly, too, as the rape scene. The camera seems to have a hammering effect, too. The effect precedes the cause. The director must have deliberately employed the reverse-chronological narrative because he knew that there is no better way to pound the audience down with the film's unflinching honesty. The rape scene almost makes you feel ashamed of calling yourself a ""human being"". It reveals the monstrous side of us that is ghastly to the point of being unbearable. The morbidity will tear apart the insides of you and make you cover your face in shame and cower in your seat in fear. The film breaks structure, no doubt, but I haven't seen a more well- structured film as this before. The rape deliberately happens before the couple's lovemaking scene, firstly, so the director can compel us to sit and endure the torture that the victim endures, and, secondly, because he wants to make us realize that our happiness rests on a thin, fragile thread. We cannot, in any way, whatsoever, predict our future and sometimes, that is a blessing and not a curse. What will drive you to insane fury is the manner in which Alex fights till the very end. She is not just the heroine who can kiss and make passionate love. She is a fighter, too, who exhibits fierce survival instinct. She loses but doesn't surrender. You will be so deeply empathizing with Alex that you will almost find yourself praying for her safety when she decides to leave for home all by herself in the late hours of the night. You'll wish she didn't wear that revealing dress and risk her safety. It's true women are free to wear whatever they want and however they please & Alex does look stunning in that dress she's wearing to the party but it, sometimes, isn't a safe and wise thing to do. ""Irreversible"" is a brutally honest film made with a lot of courage. It demands an equal amount of courage from the audience. ""Irreversible"" is a far cry from entertainment and does nothing to amuse and pander. It, however, lingers on in your head forever for its emotional complexity and deeply humanist outlook. Yes, it is disturbingly unforgettable. You may call Gasper Noé a misogynist, a homophobic or a provocateur but you can't be indifferent to his film. It is certainly a brilliant creation of a brilliant mind.",Irreversible

The events that happen between the beginning and end in this case, they are reversed, so the end and the beginning] are a perfect lesson in entropy.

What if his car had not broken down? What if she hadn't left the party? And yet, because we have already seen the shocking climaxes, we know that the events are indeed irreversible, as the title suggests.The characters are swiftly and very complexly acted; Monica Bellucci as a beautiful but concerned girlfriend, Vincent Cassel somewhat of a puppy dog turned rabid, and Albert Dupontel as placidly remarkable.The cinematography is gorgeous, accurately reflecting the level of entropy that has occurred, with dizzying film-noir-esque shots at the beginning, leaving you unsure as to just what has happened, to an idyllic paradise reminiscent of Sofia Coppola's Virgin Suicides, but without the creepiness.

Another important issue of cinema (in my humble opinion anyway) is that she should bring strong emotions of happiness, hate, regret, anger, loss, compassion, etc, to safe environments like a movie theatre or my own nice and cozy living room.Irreversible succeeds in doing this in all aspects. The camera-work in the first scenes is really disorientating, confusing and shaky, and it really makes you think that you were there. The brutal violence in the first half of the movie becomes almost a bit too much. However, in the second half of the movie there are some very nice scenes with nice dialogs and you really get sympathy for the main characters. They become human. At the end of the movie the sphere is very happy, the camera-work becomes much less disorientating, the characters seem much nicer and the settings become less and less ""darker"". In summary: there is a huge contrast between the beginning and ending of the movie, not only by regarding the plot, but especially(!) when you are concerned with the audio/visual effects, sphere and emotions you experience as a viewer.If you then  at the end  realize again that the movie is told backwards and you become aware again of the brutality still to come, you get a unique feeling of mixed emotions! After you get to know the characters, the dark half of the movie becomes even darker then it already was (and believe me, it already was). The story itself may be very simple and uninteresting (a woman gets raped and some people want to take revenge nothing fancy), but it is the way in which the story is told that makes Irreversible unique. The explicit violence is hard to cope with and the backwards storytelling may seem pointless, but those things are absolutely necessary to bring this really unique feeling of opposite emotions to the viewers.If a movie is not ""plot-driven"" like most other movies and leaves me shaking, trembling and laughing on the couch in my own nice, safe and cozy living room (like Irreversible does), then all criteria's for great cinema are met! This movie is not like ""just watching a story"", and not everyone will appreciate it (or want to appreciate it). It hits you with a sledgehammer with its realistic violence and lingers in your head for days because of its ironic ending. People who get bored of all the standard Hollywood clichés and standard story lines, go watch elbisreverrI and you will experience what great cinema is meant to do!",Irreversible
558,shakil24,"truly a disturbing, but great movie",10,14 June 2005,"i heard about this movie because of the rape scene and since i heard it starred one of my fav actresses and was unavailable at blockbuster, i just had to see this movie. the 10 minute rape scene is the most hard-to-watch sequence of any movie id ever seen. it looks so real and because its apparently done in one take, u forget that this a movie ur watching. what makes this even more disturbing is the beating at the end of the rape. how one human can do this to another is beyond me. my blood boiled even more so seeing the stranger in the background who sees whats going on and decides to walk away. while this scene is the most-talked about in the whole movie, the first 20 minutes are also sick. the combination of the camera work, lighting, music, and content make it hard to watch as well. as a whole, this movie is not trash as some would say, it is very artistic and bold. it tackles subjects so vividly the way all other movies try to avoid. if u liked the way ""memento"" played out, u should like this too. i recommend it to anyone who would like to see a real, unforgiving story which is sure to bring out a variety of different emotions from the viewer.",Irreversible

Do we feel pity or do we feel horror?You have to experience the movie, after that you will think about wrong and right. The ones who to blame... don't we accuse people too fast?

I have rarely seen such a simple, yet powerful and original film. I think most credit should go to the director, for achieving such spontaneity, it feels as if the actors are often improvising. There's no point in telling the plot, but you'll notice that everything is under control, from the very concept of the story, to the font they used in the main title :) These are the most convincing artistic endeavours, where you can feel, that all details derive naturally from one single, very strong idea! Pls feel free to contact me, especially if you've already seen the picture :D ps. Monica Bellucci... wow, an exotic goddess!!! Don't miss Asterix&Obelix:The Cleopatra Mission either :)",Irreversible
561,tektur,Tragedy Reversed,8,22 November 2004,"Before this movie came out, everybody knew what it was about. Yet no one would expect to feel such intense feeling of despair, sadness and trauma after watching this film. The history itself is rather plain and simple, though horrid and brutal, but it's not the story that matters - it's how it's told.By reversing the story, Noe has managed to deepen our shock and grief, to show how something injust and terrible to every person can get more injust and more terrible if we get to know the main characters' life after we've seen all the violence and crime. In the beginning we only see irrational violence and rage, and though of course we know what is the cause of all this, we don't feel so much compassion for the characters, because we don't know who they are, what they went through, we just see violent, irrational behaviour and dirty, vulgar places. Then comes the horrible rape scene...and then, when we get to know the characters, we realize the full monstrosity of the crime done to them, how a wretched, sick man destroyed three happy lives (well, at least two - maybe even four). Because of the reversed story the movie is even more painful to watch, it becomes a study of happiness being utterly destroyed, of how ""time destroys everything"", how we can't reverse things even if we would die for it. I like to see this film as a string of recollections - a dream of a tortured soul (maybe Alex), wishing to turn back time...The way of shooting this movie is a very pioneeric one. The camera movement reflects the emotions in the story. First, we have a very vivid, brutal sequence, and from that, the camera movement is becoming calmer, more steady, until the end, where it seems to float peacefully in the air. Also the colours get calmer and calmer from the start (finish?), and the soundtrack too. If there was an Oscar for showing emotions, I'd give it to that film.The acting...a brilliant Marcus by Cassel, who is in my personal opinion the best actor in France in showing emotions (as he did also in his debut ""La Haine""). Monica Bellucci is beautiful as always. One might say that she didn't have a lot to act, but she did - especially in the scenes in Alex's & Marcus' apartment, she really embodied happiness and peace, and she was brilliant in the rape scene (I know it sounds like I was fond of it - believe me, I was abhorred, but nevertheless, it was brilliant acting). The Pierre character was a funny guy, nicely played. The rapist...well, he too had acted good. Too good even.What most people don't see, and what scares me the most, are the hints of precognition we see later on in the film. A dream, a book Alex reads, conversations about sex...Does someone want us to think those people knew what will happen?I have an interesting theory about the eyewitness of the rape...I think it could be someone we know...My grade: 8/10",Irreversible
562,usmanov_jakhongir,This movie will make you love women,8,25 April 2013,"A good movie if you want to know how fragile and helpless girls are in the face of danger. Though, I have to warn you if your an aesthetics lover- STAY AWAY, movies has a lot of blood and female abuse. After watching it I look on females differently hence, with all this emancipation we forget that they're weak and they need protection no matter what. The movie also shows how despicable, oblivious and selfish the one should be to perform such an evil doing to a helpless girl. Another thing learned, is that it can be any one, no girl is protected unless there is a man nearby. The main character(Bellucci) was a rich girl that usually never get into a mess like that but this time she got unlucky, so it shows that abuse can happen to any women and the one should always be alert and ready",Irreversible
563,xhangbhat,Absolutely Appalling,1,28 June 2013,"I'm shocked to read the reviews of this movie. Most people have missed a very simple point. That the rape scene, which is the central scene, sexualises rape. And its very simple how it does this. It uses Monica Bellucci. As most of you must know, a star brings all their former work to a film, they carry an aura about them. Bellucci has made her name as 'worlds most beautiful woman' etc. She is a sexual icon. She has made her living from being so. When she appears on a screen, the meme she brings is sex. By her very presence she sexualises the rape scene. If the film makers had really wanted to make the point that rape is a violent act, and 'show it as it is' they should have shown it as it is. Not with some icon of the screen, who is in fact a fantasy person. It should have been an unknown, and not some beauty queen either. Just a normal looking woman would have been best if that was what they wanted to impress upon us. Meanwhile, the tapeworm is taking immense pleasure in the act and we see him very clearly as doing so. The message is that there is pleasure for some people in that act.In this regard the film actually fantasises rape, rather than, as most people are saying, shows the reality.But rape is not a sexual act. It is an act of debasement and control and violence. It debases both the victim and the perpetrator. It actually reminds me of porno more than anything. As we know, porno films use a lot of rape fantasy, this just seems an extreme version of the same. Horrible, ignorant film. I am totally unimpressed with the film makers. They must be experienced enough to know that using MB would cause the effect I'm talking about, or perhaps in some twisted kind of reverse psychology they actually thought that using her would have the opposite effect. Or perhaps, and this would be pretty typical french film philosophy. They are actually trying to point out what I have just said! And its actually an inditement of violence against women on screen. But that's just getting too self referential and clever and hardly anyone will get it. Though its a great fall back position if called out for making a snuff film. wish I hadn't seen it.",Irreversible
564,Omer_Raza_Gilani,Very Different Way Of Seeing Movies,7,4 January 2005,"Folks, there are two ways of seeing movies, one is from your own perspective & viewpoint & the other is with the eyes & mind of the director. usually the ones who see movies from their own perspective tend to dislike most of the movies. but the rest love almost every sort of movie. ""IRREVERSIBLE"" is typically one of those movies which never gain much popularity. Because of its abstract nature of sound & vision, it seems distracting. but DISTRACTION is the only beauty of this film. the rape scene in the underpass is so real that i have never seen such original (& long too) shot ever in any movie. In my view, the reason of playing the film in reverse order is to show the hard fact of ""Cause & Effect"" & also the philosophy of ""Time & Space"" that a certain action at a certain time creates an irreversible chain reaction that no one can resist. remember the last scene of the movie (actually the first) where there's beautiful green grass, the birds chirping, everything's so calm. but as the time passes, u can see the results yourself. i loved the movie, loved the idea and loved everything about it including camera work, acting, lighting, digital effects......",Irreversible
565,nhafilm,"A compelling, shocking, beautiful film about love (not violence)",8,27 December 2004,"I came out of this film feeling anger towards only one thing - the criticism that this film should never have been given a certificate due to its infamous rape scene. There may be some valid arguments against the length of that scene, but not for its broad inclusion in the first instance. And it is shot with care. Without it, we would never understand the depth and intensity of the love between two people, a love explained and depicted so magnificently and beautifully in the last scene of the movie, which is, of course, the starting point of the whole story. This is a story about love, not rape. About a man's desperate pursuit for retribution, fearless of outcome and consequence. Of how a moment of mild insouciance and 'neglect' in a moment of an otherwise complete relationship leads a lover to almost extravagant feelings of guilt, both unfair and undeserving. How hard can you love someone? How hard can you hate someone? This hard, and yes, it does hurt. Is it possible to condone such violence? Of course not, but then again what would you do, how would you feel? AT the every least, it is worth an exploration.This is genuinely innovative film-making and story-telling. The rape scene is pivotal, but it's not why you should see the film. Everything that happens before and after (or should that be after and before?) is why you should see this movie. Allow plenty of discussion time after wards - I can't remember a film getting me thinking so much.(Note: I would suggest that sub-titles even for French natives are a pre-requisite as too much of the dialog is drowned in the sound of violence, especially at the beginning of the film, You need to get what's being said at every point.)",Irreversible

567,badreligionphan,"""Sodomy destroys everything"" Tagline for a bad movie",3,14 January 2005,"This movie essentially contains two hyper-violent scenes, the first is presented in the first act and the latter in the second act. These rather gratuitous scenes serve as the film's setpieces. After these two scenes are realized, the film has essentially shot it's wad. The third act of the movie attempts to flesh out the involved characters, but during the odd dialogue between the three, I kept thinking about the previous subway and gay bar scenes. The big reveal in the third act was not that big as I kinda saw it coming ever since the party scene. Traditionally, most people will sit through the more boring parts of a movie to get to the climatic parts toward the end. By reversing the order, the audience is expected to sympathize with the characters after the fact. That could have worked, but because of the extreme violence of the previous acts, it's seems as though the director was aiming for a shocked reaction from the audience rather than a sympathetic one. Personally, I believe that the gratuitous ten-minute rape scene desensitized me a great deal and after sitting through that, I felt it unnecessary to sit through the character development scenes. Also, the plethora of anus references was really distracting. The first and second acts are mostly filmed in reddish, enclosed, tunnel-like spaces. Male characters threaten to sodomize each other and bandy about homophobic language frequently. That movie is a hotbed of Freudism. On that note, I thought the movie should have stayed with that scene and placed a male in the role of rape victim and then the movie could have explored the whole ""male anxiety over his anus"" theme. Placing a women as the victim of sexualized violence perpetrated by a gay male? That was a stretch. I could see that man beating her into a coma but because he was identified as gay he should have acted within the confines of the term and raped a male. Then the movie could have retained a little consistency. Even the tagline, ""time destroys everything"" is nonsensical. In this film, it appears as though gay pimps who forcibly sodomize women in subways destroy everything. I found the fire extinguisher/subway scene quite affecting, but overall, this movie is heavily flawed.",Irreversible

I can't understand how the director put such a brutal and nasty scene(death in gay club) on the movie...it was a real shock for me.

That is, if you can get through the shaky camera scenes at the beginning without getting a headache. However the way it is shot does a good job in throwing the viewer into the atmosphere of the film, leaving us disoriented in a sense. Rather than beating around the bush when it comes to a controversial subject such as rape, it forcefully makes you aware of just how brutal and traumatic it is. Some scenes are downright uncomfortable but at the same time, can only be described as real and not sugarcoated. It shows you how your life can be destroyed in the blink of an eye. It sticks with you.",Irreversible

I had to make my husband turn the movie off about half-way through the rape scene and was so bothered by it, I took the movie and broke the disk. This movie is not artistic, it's violent and disturbing. This movie is not erotica, it's exploitation. This movie doesn't have a plot, it just moves through violent and sexually explicit scene one at a time. With each move back in time we see a new and more disturbing scene than the last. Why anyone would pay money for this kind of film is just beyond me. And if you are ""getting off"" on what you saw then maybe you need to assess what you are missing in your life that has you finding rape and violence toward people sexually arousing.",Irreversible

After a while the continuously shifting camera angles loose their excitement and with this any artistic message that there might have been. Telling the story back to front is a nice idea but compared to Tarrantino's Pulp Fiction this approach doesn't work anywhere near as well. Belucci and Cassel are excellent but Dupontel fails to convince; maybe because his character seems inconsistent. I'm not sure what all the fuss about violence and the rape is about. Yes it is ugly, but then how many people are maimed and killed in the average Rambo movie. I suppose it's too close to real life. In the end the whole thing didn't quite work for me.",Irreversible
572,josh_love31,Disturbing but Rewarding,9,16 July 2005,"During the first quarter or Third of this film, I was finding it very difficult to continue watching. Its no exaggeration that I felt physically sick watching it, I really considered this film to be violent and sick for the sake of it(especially with the over the top camera movements). However, if you can stomach the powerful, brain damaging opening scenes you are in for one of the most artistic, thought provoking, well rounded masterpieces of film out there.The films scenes play in reverse, which at first I wasn't too keen on. I get a little bored of these sort of time-structure stylised films. 'Memento' pulls it off (with purpose cos it is a film about memory), Tarantino and Innaritu pull it off but rarely do others. I figured it was employed just to make this pointless violent onslaught seem artistic. However, what I will say is that it works a treat. This structure emphasises the feelings on the mourning of the destruction of a beautiful thing, rather than building up or glorifying its destruction. Plus that shell shocked feeling from the opening stays throughout the film and makes you care intensely for what the characters have to say there on.The dialogue is fantastic, acting is fantastic. Bellucci is perfect as the epitome of beauty, seeing that beauty destroyed is heart breaking. (Don't know his name, but)Beluccis boyfriend is a brilliant character; over-testoroned yet likable and admirable. He is particularly good in the party scene. Cinematography is very good as well, dynamic and artistic yet very real feeling. I wont give anything away about the film so I'll stop here. But my advice to you is stick through the opening scenes. Don't make the mistake I almost made of quitting. A very good film.",Irreversible

I kept pausing it, going and doing something else for a while, then coming back to it. I must have done that like 5 or 6 times. That's how dull it was. Another thing, this movie didn't have much of a plot. The thing about it being in reverse order makes it more interesting but, when you think about it, if this movie wasn't in reverse order, it would suck even more because there isn't much story to it. Also, in some parts of the film, the writing sucks. I didn't find it very suspenseful or shocking but, I've seen a lot of other films that make this thing look like ""The Teletubies"", such as Angel's Melancholy and August Underground's Mordum. I guess that if someone that wasn't used to shocking, disgusting and horrible content in movies would find this movie very disturbing. The only scene that made me feel uneasy was a scene in a gay club. The fact that it was a gay club didn't make me feel uneasy, OK? I'm not homophobic! It's just the way it was filmed and the soundtrack that was playing sort of disturbed me. But, yeah as I said before it's very dull at times, there isn't much of a story and some of the writing sucks.

A beautiful pregnant girl is raped and the man who does it brutally beats her. Her boyfriend tries to catch the rapist but gets the wrong guy while the rapist laughs.

579,lstuehl,Quite perfect,10,22 April 2005,"After witnessing the nightmare of Gaspar Noe's ""I Stand Alone,"" a movie that left me in open-mouthed awe for days afterwards, I just knew I had to see ""Irreversible."" I am not a big foreign film aficionado, not by a long shot, but Noe's films are worth watching simply because they are deeply disturbing jaunts into the darkest recesses of the human psyche. He's not above showing life as it really is, and he does it in ways that make you laugh at the cleverness of the presentation even as you cringe in disgust at the subject matter. In other words, his pictures are right up my alley. I always love to watch cinema that challenges the viewer on some level, something rare indeed in an age of the American special effects laden summer blockbusters. That doesn't necessarily mean I always like these types of films; oftentimes I don't when the fine line between challenging and pretentiousness is crossed, but Noe's stuff is great because it is premium grade weirdness. ""Irreversible"" will remind many viewers of the American film ""Memento,"" except Noe's film is darker, oh so much darker, than that movie.""Irreversible"" flows backwards, with the closing credits opening the film and each scene shown from the end towards the beginning. Right from the start, you know you're going to see something different. Boy, are you ever! A sex club with fleeting sounds and images of pornographic behaviors, a sickening scene of a human head being bashed in with a fire extinguisher, and an arrest quickly start you wondering about what it all means. As the film progresses (regresses?), we learn why one man killed another in that seedy bar. Alex (Monica Bellucci), a rather carefree soul, was brutally raped and beaten by a thuggish French pimp in a subway tunnel. Her boyfriend Marcus (Vincent Cassel) promptly had an emotional meltdown when he discovered what happened to his lovely woman. Full of seething rage, he goes on a rampage through the city looking for the man who maimed Alex. Along for the ride is Pierre (Albert Dupontel), Alex's former boyfriend who desperately attempts to rein in Marcus's reckless quest for vengeance.Surprises abound in ""Irreversible,"" surprises that will leave you thinking about the film long after it ends. I was a little amazed I figured out how the film concludes (begins, actually) long before I got there. You just knew there had to be some big, explosive revelation that would give Alex's victimization even more pathos. Well, there is and it's quite shocking. In fact, it would have worked almost as well had the film been shown in chronological order. Since Noe chose to reverse the sequence of the scenes, he not only retains the film's shock value but also imbues it with a frequently recurring sense of ""what if."" If only Marcus had paid more attention to his wife at that party. If only Alex had listened to Pierre and not gone out alone in a dangerous neighborhood. If only, if only, if only. You get the idea. This sense of identification gives the movie its edge. We've all done the same thing, asked the same questions, after a personal tragedy. I know I have.What shocks even more are the things Gaspar Noe can get away with showing in a French film. The French have little problem with overt pornography, morally repugnant violence, and lengthy discussions on the most intimate details of sexual relationships. Sure, American films are violent and sometimes crass in their discussions of sex, but not like the French films I have seen lately. I can't imagine any mainstream film made here that would show a rape sequence that runs for nearly ten minutes, or the weird goings on in a club. If you have a serious problem with any of these issues, stay far, FAR away from ""Irreversible."" For that matter, stay just as far away from Noe's ""I Stand Alone,"" a movie that shows in gruesome detail a murder/suicide. I will say that the filmmaker does not in anyway attempt to glorify the vicious acts of cruelty and barbarism he depicts in his movies. That doesn't mean it makes these incidents any easier to watch, however.""Irreversible"" is a shocker on many levels, a film not suited to a majority of the movie going public. It's not the sort of movie you would take a date to, or watch with members of your family unless you're a member of the Manson family. It should go without saying that Noe's picture is not suitable for young children. I recommend watching ""Irreversible"" alone so that it becomes a personal experience. I don't know what Gaspar Noe will come out with next, or if he'll ever make another film again, but I want to see it whatever it ends up being. If you haven't seen ""I Stand Alone"" before watching this one, make sure you see it soon. Fans of this type of cinema should also check out ""Baise-Moi,"" another French film filled with even greater amounts of nihilism and despair than this one.",Irreversible
580,workingbahm,Simply Pretentious.,2,28 January 2007,"Sometimes, in life, movies go over people's heads. People think they are dumb when in fact they are really quite intelligent. This is not one of those movies. This movie is a simple example of pretension in action.The characters are boring. The story arch-typical. The movie is shot in reverse in an attempt to hide the fact that the plot is... nothing. Everything that you'd expect to happen, based on the premise, does happen. So they tell the story backwards. It's a weak gimmick. The camera work is a weaker gimmick. You probably won't quite understand what I mean by this, but in the movie, they swing the camera around arbitrarily non-stop. You might be surprised by this, and think there's something I'm not telling you. Surely that can't be exactly what it sounds like. But it is. In a decision that would make even the lowliest film school freshman cringe, they swing the camera around like idiots. Is it symbolic? Is there a message behind it? Probably, but it's still a flat out idiotic way to communicate a message. And that's what defines this movie. Failed attempts to deliver substance. There's no substance to this movie. It's so desperate for substance, it ends (begins?) with an ten minute long rape scene. As if that has worth in some way.Don't see this movie. There have been a thousand before it and there will be a thousand after it, that are the exact same way. Just a movie made by someone with no artistic skill, who tries his best to fake it.",Irreversible
581,zoid999,Absolute Trash,1,10 April 2006,"What the hell was that?This was probably the worst piece of cinema I've encountered, considering its very thinn and simplistic plot, shadowing the disturbing atmosphere of very sinister subjects which were specifically rape and murder.I particularly found the 9-minute sequence of Monica being raped disgusting, and I'm sitting here wondering why anyone paying to watch this in the cinemas would enjoy witnessing a rape -- completely unnecessary.If you are considering purchasing this film, don't. If you own a copy, burn it. I cannot believe a piece of garbage such as this was allowed to make screenings. Only a psychopath would most likely defend this film.",Irreversible
582,bbow324,an excellent film,10,14 July 2005,"i think this film is one of the greatest films i have ever had the pleasure of watching. Firstly let me start with the intense noises and sounds that have a massive impact. the sounds are dark and industrial, perfectly complementing the shockingness of the film, which leads me on to the shock factor. This is the most shocking film i have ever seen. I like gruesome films but this film had me looking away from the screen on a number of occasions. the sheer brutality of the film is what did it for me. It does not hold back at all. The film is as it called. It is in reverse which due to the story line leads it to have a very happy ending and a brutal start. For me an excellent film well worth watching or indeed owning especially on DVD so you can slow down the best bits...",Irreversible
583,spoonman-9,Only mildly interesting,4,19 August 2005,"After seeing all the great reviews here, I rented the film. I have to say, I wasn't very impressed. The story is rather dull with no twists or clever aspects. Being told in reverse order doesn't add anything to the film - in fact the movie, which is a pretty standard and pedestrian revenge flick, would have been improved by unfolding in chronological order. As for the camera work, which has been raved about - it comes across like a 1st year film student discovering all the effects with a newly purchased digital camera. The novelty of the swooping and trembling POV runs out of steam very quickly. Worth a rental, but does not live up to the hype.",Irreversible
584,lukaivkovic,More than a movie,9,22 January 2018,"I've never seen a movie like this. The film is very disturbing, especially during 
the scene of rape which is featured in a way that the camera was steady. This scene definitely remains remembered. The film is directly approaching and show's suffering and pain of raped women. Point of a movie for me is to increase consciousness about how terrible violence is against women. It is also shown how much drugs and alcohol can be awful.",Irreversible
585,wallacesimon,An uncompromising film that stays with the viewer long after it ends.,7,15 October 2005,"I found it hard to make up my mind about Irreversible. At first the harshest scenes, horrifically realistic, powerfully acted and hard to watch, seam a little desperate in their attempt to shock. But then in comparison to the glorified, 'fun' violence of Hollywood, at least the director is telling it how it is. Violence in the real world is sickening and rape is a vile, destructive act of power and this film certainly forces that point home. You have to give credit to Gaspar Noe for making such an uncompromising film that stays with the viewer long after its abrupt ending. The sound in the film is a thing of genius which, when married to the constantly moving, spinning shots, leaves the viewer woozy and disoriented, but also engrossed, before the plot even begins. Despite all there is to admire in the film, the story didn't quite work for me. Told in reverse, it's an overly simple tale of effect then cause, with a lot of implicit comments on human nature thrown in. We don't get to know the characters enough and by the end it is the shocking moments alone that stand out. I'm glad I saw the film- it holds its own in comparison to recent revenge films. I preferred it immeasurably to Kill Bill which shares the same lack of story whilst being less original, but I enjoyed Park Chan-Wook's Old Boy more, which despite the odd moment of cheesy violence, tells a heck of a tale and asks the question Noe fails to- 'What would you do?'",Irreversible
586,janeduran,Why?,1,26 January 2019,"This is a horrible unnecessary movie. We all know the world can be a cruel evil place so why watch this type of brutality, there's no need. I thought it was some sort of masterpiece by the reviews and struggled through it hoping to feel something positive at the end at least...but no! My idea of entertainment is not watching raw violence and a brutal rape scene thank you!",Irreversible
587,kaorichan-08292,Atrocious,1,7 February 2017,"First of all, don't be fooled; this movie is nothing near shocking. This movie is a really poor work of ''art'' compared to movies like A Serbian Film. It's absolutely homophobic, which is well depicted through the obnoxious main character, Marcus, and the deviant nature of trans and homosexual folks shown in the movie. The character development is so poor that I felt no sympathy for any of the laughable main characters.The only thing shocking about this movie is the awful shaky camera that got me a headache. Overall, don't waste your time on this false ''art''.",Irreversible
588,herman-clark,Worst movie Ever,1,5 August 2010,"How can anyone sit through a rape of a woman? How can anyone find that entertaining? I thought this was going to be a horror movie, but instead found a HORRIBLE movie. It made me angry to watch....I stopped watching mid-way through the rape scene, just hoping someone would have come to her rescue. Very poor taste in a movie and I would have been number 201 to walk out on this piece of trash. It started out bad, all the spinning and rotating and then all the f#& this and f*#k that!...I'm not against bad language in any movie, but it was non-stop. I can't believe that I rented this movie and even more I can't believe that IMDb users give this movie a 7.3 rating. I will gladly rate it a 1, only because there is no rating for P.O.S. movie.",Irreversible
589,stquintin37,Watch it without the violent scenes,2,23 March 2006,"If you have never seen this film then watch it without the violent scenes first and then see what you think of it.For the fire extinguisher scene jump to the end just as Marcus is about to get a good bum bashing from the guy he just glassed in the club. That's the point when his friend Pierre steps in to give the harris bandit a good slap with a portable safety device. In other words Pierre caves the man's face in with the fire extinguisher (very graphic, realistic, swirly camera work and low frequency doning sound designed to make you feel qweezzzzyyyyy) Secondly, for the rape scene, you can jump to end of scene when Tapeworm, or La Tenia, starts threatening Alex with the Knife. She then get brutally and graphically raped.Without the violence you may well find it very boring as most of the scenes are long dragged out affairs with pretty pointless dialogue which goes round in circles. The theme, time spoils everything......well what does that mean? Shown in the correct order the story is about a girl who discovers she's pregnant, gets raped and then her boyfriend and ex go to get revenge and they get the wrong man. And that's it! You could choose any series of unfortunate events, chop the film up into scenes, reverse the order a la Memento, and apply the same moral. Some people have suggested the film shows the futility of revenge....well of course it does if you choose to let your characters get the wrong man. But that's hardly very creative or inventive. Had they got the right man they would have done the world a favour.Lets face it, without the fire extinguisher and rape scene, nobody would be talking about this film!!!!!!",Irreversible
590,smooy16,your jaw will drop,3,9 January 2007,"Not only will you go to bed still thinking about this shocking and disturbing movie, but you'll go to bed dizzy and physically sick from watching it. The camera is constantly moving in circles during the beginning of the film, and when it stops, it stops to show a hauntingly real and gruesome rape scene, a skull smashing fight scene, and other distasteful images. I can't think of the last time I actually had to stop watching a movie because of how grossly it affected me. So this comment really only applies to the first half of the film. After the party scene, when Alex leaves Marcus and Pierre alone, I had to turn it off. This movie went way beyond what I expected... I'm not really sure what I did expect, but if you were to ask me: ""what is one of the scariest movies you have ever seen?"" I would put this one at the top of the list. And when you're browsing through the horror section of your movie rental place, I'm almost positive you wont find this movie there. But it should be there.",Irreversible
591,phantasmagoria-films,A must see but not for the faint of heart.,9,5 November 2005,"Gaspar Noé introduces us to a story of vengeance and arguable justice. What he unapologetically does not do, is spare us from the odious and unmistakable truth of life. Beautifully intertwined, Noé portrays two opposing elements of the human soul. Caught in the middle is Alex (Monica Bellucci), who experiences both, horrific, unrelenting, psychopathic violence, and tender-hearted, euphoric love. Any true lover of cinema would have to agree that the backward-structured narrative is smartly edited and a visual marvel full of disorienting and breath-taking imagery. The film questions the limits of human morality, grasps your attention with a cast-iron grip -forcefully peeling your eyes open, and effectively forces the viewer to both squirm in terror and rejoice in love.",Irreversible
592,billmurrayisrad,really?,2,19 September 2017,"this is actually one of the worst films i have ever seen. not only is it terrible on it's own merit (reverse chronological order! So innovative! So postmodern!), but it's really, genuinely offensive. This is, essentially, a glorified exploitation film. Nothing about it exactly screams ""tasteful"" or ""artistic"" like the film was marketed. No, in fact, it's quite the opposite. Exploitative and offensive. Of course, you've got all these pretentious kids talking about how ""brutal!"" and ""unflinching!"" the whole affair is. A real ""meditation"" on ""Human nature"". I don't see it. Now I've got nothing against all of these ""dark"" ""depressing"" ""art film"" type affairs. Quite the opposite, I think they're totally rad. Just this particular film really, truly angers me.Even ignoring how dreadfully offensive it is, this still isn't a particularly good film. The ""innovative"" narrative techniques come across as gimmicky more than anything else, and the dialogue is largely pretty bad. I can appreciate what the director is going for, making the whole thing look intentionally ugly and uncomfortable, but even that doesn't entirely succeed.The portrayal of gay characters is also... deeply unfortunate, coming across as almost inhuman monsters. I kind of take issue with that, obviously. The whole inclusion of that comes across as some desperate attempt to make an already edgy and unpleasant film even more so.Of course, I understand that the film was not intended to be especially pleasant or easy to watch, but it feels like the director is trying too hard.Also, does anyone else find it in any way uncomfortable that most reviews comment on how attractive the lead actress is, considering... what film this is?Entirely unimpressedAdmittedly, I have enjoyed the director's other films, and have nothing against him personally. It's just this one, particular film that I take issue with.",Irreversible
593,catgravy007,Inspiring Film for Students,10,8 February 2007,"This is a film that cannot be summed up in any way to prepare you for the excellent material that is to be delivered upon viewing. Delightful to watch but hard to stomach this is something you can't talk about or recommend, but a experience that you need to find for yourself and explore. Quuite possibly the most raw material I have enjoyed but it is hard to tell under the presence hallucinogens. Reminds me of a happier place I once called Battle Royale and lost when I walked into Irreversible. No more paths to take - time to work on to Salo. But seriously, this was a very excellent film that works on so many levels that you can't count them all after a few viewings. Whether you want more than a few viewings worth of obscure media ADHD material or not is not a choice here. Watch it again. Wash. Rinse. Repeat. Welcome to class students.

594,ewerqw,nice meditation on justice,3,8 April 2018,"Series of events are unfolded in reverse, only to teach that, despite the initial apparent disappointment (a seemingly wrong man got his brains bashed in in a lovely scene which would be brutally satisfying if the target was right), and that a high class girl got apparently unjustly raped, we learn that in fact justice has been done after all. The murdered man was worthless, and the one who got away was in fact macro wise gay who actually and justly got an oversexed snobs privileged face remastered, to fit internal ugliness. A brutal, but honest way of checking white privilege. The two perverts at the beginning and the other two during the film got their privilege checked too - impotent frenchman got to go to prison after proving his masculinity with a little help of fire extinguisher, while ratbrained high class junkie got away with just his hand broken. Such is cosmic justice, and it is good.",Irreversible
595,sorin_enoiu,An apology for violence,3,11 January 2006,"I really don't understand the purpose of this film. Even if it is intended to be a ""kind"" of cine-verite revealed in an rather unusual than original manner (backwards  it's hardly a new idea  and with a lot of dazzling movements of the camera) I still don't get the point. Maybe someone can give me a hint Is this intended for a complete study of psychologically deranged and sadistic human behavior or maybe it is intended to let us mortals know that this kind of behavior exists and there are a bunch of individuals that do this for fun ? Or perhaps this film is a kind of extreme violence apology intended for mentally deranged individuals who are feeling sexually excited watching it ? In any case I think that this is not a film to win any awards (even if the role played by Belluci was very good) and furthermore I think that this kind of film (increasingly ""en vogue"") should be pulled out from the market !",Irreversible

598,daddyistight,"An acquired but grand experience, but one that should be had with an open mind and some caution",8,9 February 2019,"This film leaves you devastated, most if it from the quite disturbing sequences contained within this film, but some of from the things this movie says about sadistic people that exist in our society. Though not in the same category as splatter, torture porn films; this film has a clear message that highlights the sick depravity that can exist within our world. Though not entirely focused on social commentary, one can definitely recognize this theme. This film however-- I'm not sure if it stands alone in this type of cynical social commentary-- manages to shock you in a way you would not expect. Thus film does not contain a happy ending. Though one might argue that the reverse chronology, which is very big factor in this film, might make the ending-- which is actually the ending-- happy. But I believe the ending as bittersweet, as it shows Alex (Monicca Belucci; please tell me if I spelt that wrong) being happy in her time before her brutal rape and assault -- which is showed in a very graphic scene that lasts about 9 minutes-- but also highlights the fact that her happiness is later shattered into a million prices. I think the bitter outways the chocolate though, because it shows how she is oblivious to her future, and how only the veiwer knows of the violently depravity that she has yet to endure. One can only cringe in realization that this women, happily laying in a park, will later be violated and hurt greatly. And this theme is extended furthermore as the movie ends,band we are shown a tagline which reads simply, ""Time destroys all things."" This movie, however, when thought of simply seems like a peice if cinema which would contain some optimism and satisfaction, because when veiwed simply, it is a recent saga that is later fufilled. But satisfaction is denied, for two reasons, every sequence of events is shown is shrowded in horror and devastation. As instead of seeing someone getting revenge, we see only disturbing horror as we are not aware of the context, and thus theme continues throughout sequences before the rape. Though one can infer why scenes before that are arguably even worse , as we see Alex (played by the aforementioned Monicca Belucci, which I should say did a fantastic job with this subject matter) happy, unaffected and oblivious to what's yet to come. This movie though grim and surreal is a grand experience, one who's artistic expression does not get overshadowed by violence. Thus movie is worth watching but only if you feel you can handle the devastation. My hats off the Gaspar Noe for this overwhelming technical proficiency and knowledge of how to make his audience feel how he wants him to feel. Though not my favorite of my films this is definitely worth a veiwing. Thus film is not for everybody, but I would recommend it if you feel like this is a movie you would like. Finally I tip my hat also to the amazing performance within thus film, and the cinematographer Benoit Debie for the surreal shots in this film. As I mentioned this film is not for everyone, but if this interests you I would highly recommend, but this movie is veiwed best with an open mind, and one should pursue this peice of cinema with caution.",Irreversible
