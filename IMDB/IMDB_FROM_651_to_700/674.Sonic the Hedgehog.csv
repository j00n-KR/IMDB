0,MartinHafer,Enjoyable.,7,9 June 2020,"Recently, ""Pokemon Detective Pikachu"" came out...and ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" a few months later. Of the two, ""Sonic"" is definitely my favorite...simply because it was more fun and the plot was simpler and more enjoyable.The story isn't all that important...so instead, I'll just say that it's a buddy picture, of sorts. The crazed Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) is seeking to capture or destroy Sonic....so it's up to Sonic's new friend (James Marsden) to help him avoid this nutty guy.The choice to hold off release to make Sonic look less creepy was a very good one. Additionally, the story is fun...and not especially complicated. Good for kids...as well as parents forced to watch it with them!",Sonic the Hedgehog
1,Leofwine_draca,Bad CGI and worse scripting,3,11 October 2021,"An awful and awfully generic kid's adventure movie, supposedly based on the classic Sega videogame series. This wisecracking, annoying blue hedgehog is nothing like the game character - it doesn't even particularly look like him - and Jim Carrey's stock bad guy is a return to his overacting style of the early 1990s. As for James Marsden's one-dimensional human lead, the less said the better. The whole thing is extremely tedious and juvenile, a near-plotless odyssey of bad CGI and worse scripting.",Sonic the Hedgehog
2,SnoopyStyle,somewhat good,6,12 March 2020,"Sonic the Hedgehog (Ben Schwartz) is a blue alien refugee on Earth. He's living in secret near the small town of Green Hills. Tom (James Marsden) is the town's friendly sheriff. When Sonic accidentally causes a power outage, the Pentagon calls up evil genius Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey).The Sonic redesign is good. This is mostly fun. Jim Carrey is very weird which somewhat fits. I like Sonic and I like his chemistry with Marsden. I like the family. It's all somewhat good but nothing great. It doesn't have much of a plot. The last act is not that great. That makes this a good video game movie.",Sonic the Hedgehog
3,Horst_In_Translation,Pretty disappointed by this one here,4,20 February 2020,"""Sonic the Hedgehog"" is a new American English-language movie from 2020 and this one here runs for 100 minutes approximately. Actually, I may correct myself immediately here because ""American"" is only partially correct for there worked many Japanese people on it as well as part of the crew, which makes sense because after all this is about a Sega video game character and Japan is also one country of production. So is Canada. Okay, now about the film itself. I must say I was more of a Mario/Nintendo and also Kirby kind of guy in my younger years, so I did not grow up really that much with Sonic, but I definitely remember him and, back in the day, we also played his video game(s) occasionally. Apart from that, hedgehogs are like my favorite animals ever and even if he is more of an alien, he identifies himself as a hedgehog (and what you identify yourself as is all that counts these days we have learned haha who cares about facts related to science and biology). Anyway, let's not get carried away now.Like I wrote in the title of this review, I was pretty underwhelmed here. I thought that this film really seemed much more for young audiences than it should be because I think many people who are around my age now (30 to 40) grew up with the Sonic video games and would really want this to be good and bring back some nice memories. The film only does so very early on when we see this brief gigantic collection of snippets that create the word SEGA with Sonic being one of them, but also another pretty cool video game there. And the ending sequence with the closing credits was nice too because it was so retro. Sadly, everything that was good quality in this film was when they used themes and inclusions from the game(s) (such as the laundromat) and it feels as if there is zero creativity here from the filmmakers itself. This refers to the many writers who are definitely a perfect example of too many cooks spoiling the broth. But it also refers to director Jeff Fowler. And I am genuinely surprised they picked him for this film to be honest. He has made exactly one short film before the Sonic movie and this was 15 years ago and even if he received an Oscar nomination for that, it was still an animated short film and there is nothing animated about this film here except Sonic of course. Maybe an experienced director could have done a better job. Then again, I believe the screenplay was so weak that almost nobody could have made it work.I already said that I felt this is more of a film for children, but I'd say this is also only partially true because the 6 or 7 kids in my showing did not really seem to enjoy it that much and the number of occasions on which I heard them laugh loudly wasn't higher than the number of fingers on your hands, probably one hand even. This also had a lot to do with the cast here I must say. First of all, James Marsden, who plays the central human character, did absolutely nothing for me. His comedic timing was not good at all and even those running gags like his donut-related nickname felt so try-hard and unfunny that, even when it is mentioned the second time, you had almost forgotten already why he exactly he is called like that. Very fitting that they also used this reference as an inside story near the very end to express how close the two had gotten because of all they went through together, Tom (Marsden) and Sonic I mean. In general, their more dramatic and ""emotional"" moments like how Sonic is forced to say farewell to a beloved one early on or how the bucket list about saving a life or, especially, making a friend felt forced to get some kind of emotional reaction out of the audience at least. But they did not. It rang very false. They did not get an emotional reaction, they did not get many laughters. They simply should have gone for pointless fun, there is nothing worng with that approach at all. So Marsden was definitely a bad casting decision, but maybe I am biased here because I am not a fan of the actor in general, also in other movies.Now as for Sonic, he is voiced in the original by Ben Schwartz (sadly an Emmy winner, but hey shows everybody can win an Emmy these days right?) from Parks and Recreation and I find him really unplesant to watch and overrated. But luckily I did not have to watch him here, but had I seen the English-language original I would have found him bad too I'm sure. I watched the German original and admittedly the ""actor"" who voiced the hedgehog there was not good at all either. It was Julien Bam and he is one of Germany's most successful Youtube influencers (i.e. influenzas) I believe. I don't know him. And after hearing him here, I am glad I don't. Shame on the producers (or whoever decided to pick him) for not casting an actual actor or prolific voice actor, but instead going for a social media phenomenon hoping all his subscribers will go to the movies to see him. Despicable approach. Going back to the actors we actually SEE here: Tika Sumpter plays the only female character who has a decent amount of screen time. And she was as bad of a decision as everybody else. Not only does she constantly overact, especially at the end when they stand at the open door and talk to the government official, but also had her character been left out completely, nothing would have changed about this film. I guess they picked her (character) because of her ethnicity because it adds some political correctness and people (we know who) won't complain there is no Black actress in this film. Thank God, Asians, Hispanics, Russians... are not complaining. Admittedly Sumpter's character's sister was slightly funny here and there at least. Or just not as unfunny as everything else.As for Sonic, I think I read that when they released the first shots a long time ago, fans were so unhappy with his looks that they completely started from zero with the character animation and this was a good decision because Sonic's looks are fine, one of the better aspects for sure. Sadly, they messed up almost everything else though. In general, the film reminded me a bit of this Garfield mix between live action and animation (in terms of the title character). But the Garfield films are much better than this one here, don't trust the critics. Okay, now how can I not mention Jim Carrey here. Great fan. But sadly, even him / his character they messed up here. For most of the film, his scenes were just slapstick solo presentations by Carrey (sometimes with a sidekick) and as good as he may be, not even he could have made them work. Or all of them. And almost every other actor would have done an even worse job I am sure. I wish I could say more positive things about Carrey, but his character was also destroyed with the writing already I think starting right with the reason why he was called upon (the ridiculous baseball sequence, come on don't tell me we should feel sorry for Sonic's loneliness there, the shrink scene before that was alright and enough) and also this scene with all the powerful guys on the table trying to justify the selection of his character over a group of elite soldiers/scientists or so.Aside from him, there are many unrealistically bad moments: Like how Sonic supposedly knows immediately what is going on when he sees the Frisco shirt during his first ""meeting"" with Tom. It's just a shirt! By the way, this storyline about moving elsewhere and the reference to how people like and need Tom in his hometown also felt really botched and for the sake of it. None of these many writers should ever be in charge of a drama screenplay unless they considerably step up their game. Then the bar scene was a mess from beginning to end really. Yeah he is 40 years old and has some strange genetic disease. Right. And only one character would ask with this joke of a costume. I can't believe they even messed up this slow motion (actually standstill) sequence that at least in the end worked better. And yeah, the fart humor on one occasion showed us that they really only intended this for kids. An insult to all the grown-ups who played the video game.At least the ending was slightly okay. I am glad they did not act as if Sonic is known and loved by everybody now and they don't have to hide him from the government. They did, even if Sumpter ruined this scene like I already said. And in the end, there were many hints that we get a sequel, but I am not sure if the reception here really will be good enough for that. Carrey's character is going to be back eventually to Earth from the mushroom planet and in the Avengers-style post-credit sequence, we also get a brief inclusion of the red fox, Sonic's best buddy, the Diddy to his Donkey Kong you could say, another franchise I am more familiar with than Sonic's. Honestly I wondered throughout the entire film where the fox is. Even if I am a bit curious about him, I am not sure if I want to see a sequel, even if that one will be featured way more prominently in this movie. I hope that if it happens, they really step things up there. How about getting the writers from ""Wreck-It Ralph""? Still I feel already bringing back (most of) the cast from this one here will make it almost impossible for a second film to become a quality watch. And please, if you still go for it, stop sucking up to Will Smith (and Keanu Reeves). So yeah, overall this film is about as cool as the name of the one in charge of the soundtrack here: a certain ""Junkie XL"". Oooookay. It's a thumbs-down overall for me. Not a failure, but definitely a missed opportunity. Watch something else instead.",Sonic the Hedgehog
4,nogodnomasters,I hate mushrooms,7,20 February 2020,"Sonic escapes from his home planet and lives in isolation on Earth until he causes a power outage. He is chased by a cartoonish Dr. Ivp Robotnic that could only be played by Jim Carrey. He is aided by sheriff Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) who is part of a biracial couple in Montana, perhaps less believable that a talking blue hedgehog.Sonic talks to himself a little too much for my comfort zone. The film is an excellent blend of animation and film. Fun for the kids.Guide: I thought I heard an F-word about 33 minutes into the feature when Tom punches Jim Carrey and says something that sounds like, ""Oh F."" It was quick.",Sonic the Hedgehog
5,kosmasp,A long way,7,18 November 2020,"Which incedently for Sonic isn't an issue (he's fast you know). I don't know how much you know about the little Hedgehog and his game history, but even without any knowledge at all, the movie will make sense to you. Certain things, like the rings and hoarding them is one of the things you do when you play him .. wait that didn't came out wrong did it? I hope not, this is a childrens movie after all.Jim Carrey really relishes and dives into his evil character! He has quite the fun with him and a lot of interesting zingers/one liners. This is overall a funny and entertaining little movie. Is it flawed? For sure - should you care though? The movie won't be fun if you do! Now that does not mean that the studio doesn't listen! The first trailer had quite the catastrophic reactions from fans all over the world ... so back to the drawing board (I guess almost literally) and a new improved Sonic was developed ... nicely done! So sit back, relax and enjoy the ride (that has quite a few plot holes in it, but a lot of heart too)",Sonic the Hedgehog
6,Sleepin_Dragon,Plenty of fun.,7,23 February 2020,"I wasn't expecting to enjoy this, but I did, it literally was a burst of fun and energy, just like the game itself.I would imagine there were many that would have wanted to make a movie when Sonic really was big news, but perhaps the technology at the time wasn't sufficient, now though such resources are available, it looks great.Standout for me was Dr Robotnik, Jim Carrey looks awesome, and as always delivers with such charisma.It won't win awards, but enjoyed it, it was genuine good fun. 7/10*Wishes for those days of Sonic on Megadrive.",Sonic the Hedgehog
7,classicsoncall,"""It seems with great power comes power hungry bad guys!""",7,18 February 2020,"This would not have been my choice of movie if I were going to the theater alone, but with three grandkids under the age of eleven who voted unanimously to see it, how could I refuse? It actually turned out to be fairly entertaining and the kids wound up laughing a lot and had a good time. In fact, the two who were visiting from a couple hours away called it the best thing they did all weekend. So grandpa scored a few points there if I must say so. Not being familiar with the Sonic character, everything about him was new to me. The combination of live action and animation appeared to work well as Sonic teams up with Donut Lord Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) to thwart the evil designs of Ivo Robotnik (Jim Carrey) to take over the world. Colorful cinematography and a frantic pace keeps the action moving along, so if you happen to come across a couple of stray family members, why not take them to see the flick. It wouldn't be the worst afternoon you ever spent.",Sonic the Hedgehog
8,jboothmillard,Sonic the Hedgehog,5,24 February 2020,"I had a Sega games console when I was kid, Sonic the Hedgehog was probably the only game I ever played on it, I also used to watch the cartoon series on TV, so I suppose I was up for a big screen movie. Basically, Sonic is an extra-terrestrial blue hedgehog who can run at supersonic speeds. When he was a child, he was sought by a tribe of echidnas for his power. His guardian, Longclaw the Owl (Donna Jay Fulks), gives him a bag of rings that can create portals to other worlds, she uses one to send him to Earth to escape. Ten years later, Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) enjoys a secret life near the town of Green Hills, Montana, but longs to make friends. He often watches the local sheriff, Tom Wachowski (James Marsden), and his veterinarian wife, Maddie (Tika Sumpter), unaware the pair are planning to relocate to San Francisco where Tom has been hired to join the San Francisco Police Department. One night, Sonic is overwhelmed with his loneliness when playing baseball by himself, and runs at supersonic speed as a result, inadvertently triggering an electromagnetic pulse that knocks out power across the Pacific Northwest. Robotics expert and scientific genius Doctor Ivo Robotnik (Jim Carrey) is enlisted by the United States Department of Defense to investigate and uncover the source of the outage. Robotnik discovers and tracks Sonic, who is hiding in the shed at the Wachowskis. Knowing he is in danger, Sonic intends to use a ring to escape to another world, a planet of gigantic mushrooms, but Tom discovers him. Tom shoots Sonic with a tranquilizer, causing him to send his bag of rings through a portal to San Francisco. Tom reluctantly agrees to help Sonic before Robotnik arrives at the house and the two flee. The pair attempt to evade Robotnik, and Tom appears on the news labelled as a domestic terrorist. He and Sonic slowly bond, whereupon Tom learns about Sonic's desire for a real friend. Robotnik comes across one of Sonic's spines, discovering the power in it has the potential to fuel his robots, and becomes obsessed with capturing Sonic. Tom and Sonic get into an argument after Sonic learns of Tom's plans to leave Green Hills. Shortly after defeating a robot sent by Robotnik, Sonic is injured in an explosion. Tom brings Sonic to San Francisco to the home of Maddie's sister Rachel (Natasha Rothwell). While Tom explains the situation, Sonic recovers and receives a new pair of sneakers from Maddie's niece. Sonic, Tom and Maddie head to the roof of the Transamerica Pyramid, where Sonic's bag of rings landed. After recovering the bag, Sonic prepares to create a new portal, but Robotnik appears. Sonic sends Tom and Maddie back to Green Hills through a portal, and battles with Robotnik, who he calls ""Eggman"" (because of his robots being shaped liked eggs) across the world. Sonic discovers his enemy is matching his speed by using the power from his spine. The chase ends up in Green Hills, where Robotnik incapacitates Sonic. However, Tom intervenes, along with gathering townspeople, allowing Sonic to regain his strength and reclaim his lost energy. Robotnik is defeated, Sonic uses a ring to transport him to the mushroom planet. Following the incident, Tom and Maddie decide to stay in Green Hills and let Sonic live with them. The US government erases all evidence of what happened, including records of Robotnik's existence. Robotnik himself, still in possession of Sonic's spine, has lost his sanity, shaved his head and grown a crazier ginger moustache, he begins plotting his revenge. At the same time, a twin-tailed fox, Miles ""Tails"" Prower (Colleen Villard), from Sonic's world emerges from a ring portal, seeking to track down Sonic. Also starring Lee Majdoub as Stone, Adam Pally as Wade Whipple, Neal McDonough as Major Bennington, Tom Butler as Commander Walters and Frank C. Turner as Crazy Carl. The original trailer for this anticipated movie was met with highly negative backlash and criticism online, the biggest reason being that Sonic looked like a freak, with a more humanoid image, including smaller eyes, and arms and legs with joints. So, the release was delayed for a few months to make changes, and the new Sonic was much better, much more like the recognisable video game hero, including the bigger eyes, white gloves, and red and white sneakers. Anyway, Carrey revels being the nutty villain, Marsden is fine, and the computer-animated speedy spiky video game icon is likeable, there are some relatively entertaining chase and explosive sequences, and it made me titter at times, it probably is more for the kids, but overall a reasonable action adventure comedy. Worth watching!",Sonic the Hedgehog
9,BA_Harrison,Not-so-super Sonic.,3,22 February 2020,"I spent many happy hours in the early '90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on my Mega Drive. I just spent ninety-nine minutes watching the Sonic movie in the cinema; they were nowhere near as enjoyable.When early images of a horribly human-like CGI Sonic were leaked online, fans of the speedy blue mammal were not at all pleased; as a result, the studio revisited the hedgehog's design and re-rendered the special effects.Or so they would have us believe.Call me a cynic, but I think that the whole thing was a clever marketing ploy. That they had the final, cuter design in their pocket all along, fully rendered and ready to go, only pretending to have got it terribly wrong in order to generate interest. By seemingly going to the immense trouble and expense of re-visiting the look of Sonic, they appeared to be genuinely concerned about keeping us hedgehog-heads happy. How could anyone not go and see the film after all that effort?The truth of the matter is that screen Sonic is still a bit off (his eyes are a weird shape, his spines look strange and his legs are too long) AND he is a bit of a dick to boot: he plays with property that doesn't belong to him (baseball equipment), spies on his neighbours, steals from a gift shop, trashes a motel room, crashes a borrowed car, causes a bar-room brawl, and leads Dr. Robotnik on a merry chase through a city's streets that undoubtedly involves many human casualties. His personality is abrasive to put it mildly (and he's borderline schizo).Sonic might have been a bit more bearable had the plot/script for his movie debut been hilarious and full of inventive action, but sadly this is not the case. The storyline is weak, the action predictable and the humour unlikely to appeal to anyone over the age of five. One might argue that the under-fives are the target audience, but are they really? Anyone who played the Sonic games at the height of their popularity will be in their late thirties, forties, or even older; there's very little in this film that will appeal to adults.Jim Carrey, who plays Robotnik, is his usual manic, larger-then-life self, but soon proves to be just as irritating as his CGI co-star. James Marsden, who plays Tom Wachowski, the small town sheriff who befriends Sonic, is simply bland. The action is overloaded with unimpressive digital effects, with two scenes being blatant cribs from the X-Men movies, Sonic stealing his super-speed/slow-motion schtick from QuickSilver. There's only one genuinely amusing line of dialogue, when Sonic is hiding in a hold-all -- the rest is just unfunny blah!My favourite thing about the whole film are the closing credits, which are rendered in the style of old Sega game graphics: not only do they evoke a feeling of nostalgia and look cool, but they herald a very welcome end to a painful ninety-nine minutes of pure dross.3/10. They should have set the whole film on Sonic's world, with the hedgehog having to brave various perils in order to free his woodland pals from Robotnik. I'd have loved to have seen an underwater scene with the hedgehog taking gulps from bubbles of air to make it out alive.",Sonic the Hedgehog
10,paul_haakonsen,"A movie based on a side-scrolling platform game, what could possibly go wrong?...",5,5 March 2020,"Well, I can't claim to ever have been much of a fan of the games, so I wasn't in any particular rush to get to watch the 2020 movie adaptation of a side scrolling platform game. I mean, movie adaptations of games usually stink to high heaven, and basing a movie on a small blue creature that runs fast and collect coins? Come on...But having a 10 year old son made me sit down to watch the movie with him. While he enjoyed the movie and the CGI animated blue hedgehog, I can't claim to be as impressed or as entertained as he was.Sure, the movie was watchable, but it wasn't an outstanding movie, expect for the CGI. The storyline was as to be expected, so you know what you are getting here. And having a lighting fast blue hedgehog running around in America just didn't really cut it for me. It was a flaccid and rather pointless, if not actually stupid, storyline that failed to impress or captivate me.It was the Dr. Ivo Robotnik character and the portrayal of the character as done by Jim Carrey that made the movie bearable to sit through for my account.This movie is definitely aimed for the younger audience. And not being a fan of the side scrolling platform games, I didn't find much enjoyment in this particular movie.For me the 2020 movie ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" came and went without a lasting impression, and this is by no means a movie I will be returning to watch a second time. It is mostly due to the special effects, CGI and Jim Carrey that I am giving the movie a very generous - albeit very mediocre - five out of ten stars.",Sonic the Hedgehog
11,studioAT,What a nice surprise,4,14 February 2020,"After people apparently didn't like the design of Sonic the release of this film was delayed, but happily this ends up being a fun family film that should entertain a lot of people over the half term.It's almost like Sega were following lots of the tricks used by the makers of Detective Pikachu, with a nice mix between visuals and live action acting.James Marsden makes a refreshing change as the lead, and having not seen Jim Carrey's hammy acting style for a while, having him do this as the bad guy was a nice touch too.It's not the best film you'll ever see, but it's a darn sight more entertaining than ones that we pretend to like once they've won big at the Oscars.",Sonic the Hedgehog
12,view_and_review,I did not expect that,7,26 February 2020,"My daughter wanted to see ""Sonic the Hedgehog;"" I did not. I expected full scale absurdity, instead I got an enjoyable movie that was pretty funny.To be honest, Jim Carrey was in fine form as the antagonist Robotnik. He was vintage Jim Carrey and he was hilarious. I was laughing at parts that everyone else stayed silent on. It was like Jim Carrey knew his older fans were out there wanting to see what made him one of the top guys in the biz in the 90's.Sonic, voiced by Ben Schwartz, was pretty funny as well. Some of his gags fell flat, but for the most part he kept the humor up. The plot was fairly straightforward and simple. I think sometimes, especially with Disney, they try to get too deep with their plots as though the kids in the audience would be able to follow it. The plot was good, the movie was funny, and the visual effects were what they should've been. Like Robotnik said when Sonic pulled a stunt on him, ""I did not expect that.""",Sonic the Hedgehog
13,neil-476,fun family film,7,18 March 2020,"A small and extremely garrulous hedgehog-like creature called Sonic finds his way to our world where police officer Tom becomes his unwilling guardian, while mad scientist Dr Robotnik covents him for his amzing speed powers.I spent a great deal of time 20 years ago watching my children enjoy Sonic from his earliest incarnations (I also learned that hand/eye coordination was not high on my list of gifts, which is why I was generally watching rather than playing). This film contrives a plot of sorts on which to hang Sonic's computer game attributes together with a moral object lesson.In short, it's a family film with jazzy visuals, a lot of callbacks to the videogames, Jim Carrey in full over-the-top mode, enugh story to serve, a dusting of fart gags, and an air of likeability. It's nothing spectacular, but it's tolerable fun. And it gave me one of those occasional wonderful cinema moments when someone two rows in front of me actually squealed with delight at the reveal in the mid-credits scene.",Sonic the Hedgehog
14,Mr-Fusion,Should please fans and children alike,6,4 November 2021,"If you walk into Sonic the Hedgehog with apprehension like i did, you're bound to start nitpicking. I'm not the target audience, and I haven't played a Sonic game in 30 years.Despite this, I was pleasantly surprised by the performances from both James Marsden, Ben Schwartz and Jim Carrey (back in full '90s swing here), and the production values were up to snuff. The filmmakers actually seemed to care about the movie; there was that whole internet meltdown over Sonic's rendering, and they did go back and revamp it, unprecedented as that is.If you're reading this and you have kids, it's a sure bet. The movie's energetic, it looks good, and my own kid really enjoyed herself. That's really what's important, right?",Sonic the Hedgehog
15,siderite,ET meets video game... and it's fun,8,8 March 2020,"The film is part of a certain genre of lovable alien coming to Earth and being chased by unnecessarily evil and ineffective power hungry guys while being protected by regular people for emotional reasons. It checks all the boxes, it is funny and pleasant, too. The villain, while being the usual cardboard evil character, gets much more nuanced and interesting from Jim Carrey's performance. And frankly, I thought James Marsden was just a pretty face, but I kind of like him in everything he does so, good luck James!As a successful and fun to watch movie based on a game - they are too few and far between - I think this is way above the average. Maybe a bit too childish, though, but I guess this film isn't for adults.",Sonic the Hedgehog
16,thesar-2,"Go, Sonic Racer, Go!",8,20 February 2021,"Full disclaimer: I have never played this game. As Microsoft and Nintendo were my things, Apple and Sega weren't my bag.So, I have no stake in: Was this faithful? All I know is the internet erupted (me included) when the first trailer dropped and Sonic's CGI body was revealed. So, the studio caved and what we ended up with was...a cartoon/live action flick.Yep, this is absolutely nothing but a cartoon/live action movie like Roger Rabbit or the original Pete's Dragon, just to name a couple of dozens like it. And...I was totally okay with that because from the get-go, this is truly a kid's movie.Don't get me wrong. As an ""adult,"" I laughed WAY more than I thought I would and I loved to see the Jim Carrey of Batman Forever and The Mask return to form. And if you just see this for what it is, again, a live-action cartoon movie made for kids, you'll have a blast. I did.Sonic's a little brat alien who's both super-fast and hyper-active even when still. And for really weak reasons, he's thrust from his world to Earth and told he needs to use rings to transport to another world if he's in ""danger"" again. But, it's hard on him as he's come to love Earth and through a series of events, he loses the rings after being discovered and must use his human friend to journey and get them back.I left out a lot of the plot, and incredibly, this simple story (SEE ABOVE: made for kids) is sometime pretty complicated. Suffice to say, it's still a silly adventure with some fun action sequences and Sonic being funny.Is it perfect? Oh, heck no. You will never see Sonic as anything but CGI and never ""real on screen."" He can be, at times, pretty obnoxious as a character and not in a good way. And there were at least a dozen ways to end this movie's conflicts sooner using Sonic's powers, but the writers kept making him pause and give one-liners to the audience, instead.But, other than that, I actually had a blast watching this. I loved seeing old-Carrey routines and despite him bringing virtually nothing new from his Riddler/Mask days, I was okay with it. It's been a long time since I saw one of my all-time favorite 90s comedians perform. It was like a reunion tour.Also, like I reported, the humor actually got me sometimes. Some of it was definitely meant for the kids in mind, but overall, it was never fully adult, or sly for adults. It was honest, kid-friendly humor that I genuinely laughed at. Also, the human performances were invested, the sets and locations pleasing and even the already-outdated scenes (such as a super-fast hero running around in slo-mo) were creative for this film.(Another full disclosure: that said, it was still pretty much the same as the ones used for The Flash and Quicksilver. Regardless, I dug what they were doing here even with the now-clichéd technique.)I would actually, and unbelievably, highly recommend this kid/family-adventure.***Final thoughts: It appears (RE: The Inter-Net) I CAN get Sonic on my Xbox. Maybe, I'll finally check out this little blue booger after nearly 30 years and see what the hype is all about.",Sonic the Hedgehog
17,FeastMode,surprisingly awesome,7,11 May 2020,"Well made movie all around. very funny and fun. great pacing and kept me invested throughout.i already said it was very funny, but i need to specifically talk about jim carrey and the pure gold that is every scene he's in. his first scene in the movie had me crying, no exaggeration. it wasn't that hysterical for the rest of his scenes, but when he wasn't hilarious, he was so awesomely over the top. a perfect role for him, and a perfect casting choice since i can't imagine anyone else making such an outlandish character believable. jim carrey, you are the GOAT (1 viewing, 5/10/2020)",Sonic the Hedgehog

And so, we had the peculiar sight, somewhere in the world, today, of a 36 year old man wondering into an auditorium packed with kids (who were pleasingly well behaved!) whose parents had probably never even met when that man became such a big fan of the hedgehog. And indeed, debut feature length director Jeff Fowler has certainly geared his film firmly to the kids market, with it's PG certificate, assuredly rid of any 12A edginess or Dark Knight style fantasy violence.The film plays like a relentless chase sequence, which is in-fitting not only with a character who's special ability is his speed, but with a video game where he was constantly having to speed along. Fowler has ensured a fair degree of authenticity to his production, with pleasingly accurate recreations of the game, such as the inclusion of the rings (both from Sonic and the world he inhabited!) and some of the robot villains he had to destroy. Carrey steals the show as the villain, despite looking nothing like the video game Robotnik (a fat suit would have been nice!), revelling in the sort of zany, wild role that he made his name with. And, indeed, Fowler wisely keeps the whole thing consistently tongue in cheek, with Sonic dishing out the wise-cracking quips on roll.Sonic is a strange by-product of his time, and a sad indictment of the laziness of this one, a time bizarrely obsessed with talking animal heroes, from Teenage Ninja Turtles to Biker Mice from Mars, rivalled by a speedy, immodest blue hedgehog. I always wondered what a film version would be like, and I guess this is as good as it could be, not an unforgettable piece of work, but colourful, fun and funny enough. ***",Sonic the Hedgehog
19,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A pleasant surprise.,6,14 February 2020,"'Sonic The Hedgehog (2020)' is pleasantly surprising. Of course, it isn't a masterpiece, but I don't really think anyone expects it to be. It's a breezy, family-oriented adventure which should be decent fun for kids and adults alike. In fact, it's actually quite funny in places. One genuinely good joke, in particular, gave me a good giggle. It's also quite fun. A lot of this is thanks to Jim Carrey's always entertaining scene chewing. James Marsden is pretty good, too. The flick isn't exactly gripping, but it's engaging enough and it's certainly never boring. It's so fast-moving that it's over before you know it, which is unexpectedly appropriate. The same can't be said for all of its elements, as some stuff seems to cross the line a little. For an adult, it's tame; for some kids, or over-protective parents, it may be a tad too much. It doesn't feel like 'Sonic', either. Still, despite its odd tone and somewhat off-brand vibe, the thing keeps things light and accessible. It's quite clearly made with children in mind - as it should be. Its messaging is good, if mixed, and its visual effects are actually rather great, considering where they started off prior to the redesign. The movie is predictable and, frankly, forgettable (I mean, it's already almost all faded from my mind), but it's enjoyable enough. While it isn't great, it's much better than it has any right to be. That, in and of itself, is an achievement. 6/10",Sonic the Hedgehog
20,ThomasDrufke,Not For Me,3,3 March 2020,"I'm honestly not sure why I decided to spend time going to see this film. The trailers never sold me, I've never been a big Sonic guy, and I certainly don't typically like Jim Carrey comedies. I'm sure there is a large group of people who love this movie & Carrey in it, but it wasn't for me. Albeit admittedly a lot better than I thought, the film still lacks interesting characters, plot, and a reason to come back for a sequel. It was a chore to get through.3.9/10",Sonic the Hedgehog

22,ericstevenson,I'm a big Sonic fan,8,27 February 2020,"This is the movie everyone was waiting for, as it debuted as a trailer showing a much hated design of Sonic the Hedgehog. The entire film was changed due to backlash and recreated into what is considered one of the best video game movies ever made. Granted, it's still not great, but worth watching. The plot is that Sonic winds up on Earth (as an infant at first) and the story features him meeting a guy who will take him to San Francisco where he left his rings. They're being pursued by Dr. Robotnik, played by Jim Carrey. Let me just say that is soooo refreshing to see Jim Carrey one of his biggest comedic roles in probably decades.This is the Jim Carrey I grew up and since he was a big comedic influence on me, it's great to see him utterly hilarious in this. He constantly makes great jokes and Carrey is having an incredible amount of fun in this role. True, the cartoon character coming to Earth has been overdone, but they do make it unique by having him grow up mostly there and making the human characters quite likeable and realistic. I'm not even going to mention what happens in the credits. This movie was so fast paced. Oh yeah, because of Sonic! ***",Sonic the Hedgehog

25,CuriosityKilledShawn,A New Venture worth taking,8,6 March 2020,"Of all the video game properties out there I have long believed that Sonic was the most un-filmable, which is probably why it has lingered in speculative development hell for so long. Like most people, I was freaked-out by the sheer nightmare fuel original trailer with the horrific hedgehog design. I wrote the movie off and assumed it was, yet another, massive studio misjudgement. Only my devotion to Sonic made me give it one last chance, and I'm glad I did.Opening on South Island on (what I assume is) Planet Mobius, we are introduced to Baby Sonic reared by Longclaw the Owl who does her best to keep his gift of supersonic speed a secret. When a group of Echidna's find them and kill her she uses a pouch of magic rings to send Sonic to Earth, where he grows up in the small town of Green Hills in Montana, appearing only as a blue blur to the townsfolk that he longs to be friends with. Frustrated by his loneliness, Sonic accidentally creates an electromagnetic blast that wipes out half of the country. Assuming it to be a terrorist attack the government sends in Dr. Robotnik to find the real source and Sonic must reveal himself to the world once and for all, starting with affable local Sheriff Tom, played by James Marsden, whom he idolizes.I was very sceptical, but Jim Carrey is brilliant as Robotnik. The role allows him to go full Ace Ventura, something he has not been able to do for a long time, and it's nice to see him return to the manic creativity that made him a star in the first place. I also can't believe how much my opinion of James Marsden has turned around. The first movie I ever saw him in was Disturbing Behavior in 1998 and I thought he was one of the worst actors ever in that, but over the years he's become great at comedy and has quite a range. His chemistry with Sonic (effectively a character who is not there with him on set) is pitch perfect and Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic is quite endearing. I was worried that they were going to make him into a smug, obnoxious character but he's just super-cute and loveable. I want him as a pet (though not before getting Gizmo and Slimer).The story of the original games was so thin I reckoned that it impossible to adapt to a movie, but they really did come up with a smart formula that lays the groundwork for future sequels. The story from the Sonic Comic series is immense and features dozens of characters with huge potential. We already have a cameo from Tails in this movie but I hope to see Amy Rose, Cream the Rabbit, Vector, Shadow, Blaze the Cat, and, obviously, Knuckles in sequel movies. This movie the perfect beginning of a potentially great franchise with plenty of humor, character, and excitement to make it appeal to just about anyone, not just kids or video game nerds.Against all odds, it's a fun movie that deserves its success and, next to Mortal Kombat, is the best movie based on a video game. As the flagship movie from Sega Studios I hope we can get equally good movies based on Golden Axe, Shinobi, or Streets of Rage. I'll even take a Crazy Taxi movie, that's how much goodwill I got.",Sonic the Hedgehog
26,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,Fun,7,28 August 2021,This was the last movie I watched in the cinema before the pandemic. It was great to watch Jim Carrey again. It was a great decision that they listened to people and changed Sonic. It was fun to watch in the cinema.,Sonic the Hedgehog
27,inkblot11,"SuperSonic Fun, what else?",9,12 November 2020,"Poor Sonic the alien hedgehog (voiced wonderfully by Ben Schwarz) ! He lived on a planet rather peacefully, with a protector owl named Claw. But, alas, Sonic went out of bounds and ended up putting his life in danger. Claw, in sacrifice, sent him to planet Earth, with more ""stargate"" rings if he should need them. Now, Sonic lives in small city Montana in his own cave where he watches his neighbors in secret. His favorite is Donut Man, who happens to be Sheriff Tom (James Marsden). Tom is married to beautiful Maddie (Tika Sumpter), a veterinarian and is loved by the town. But, Tom thinks he wants more action and has applied to work for the San Francisco police department. Maddie wants what is best for both of them and her sister lives in SF, too. One day, Sonic watches the little league baseball game and loves it. After everyone has gone home, the little hedgehog goes wild playing his own game, for he is fast enough to pitch, hit, and catch all at once. Nevertheless, he runs so fast he ends up crashing and knocking out power to the town. And the entire western Montana. This brings in the Feds, including Dr. Robotic (Jim Carrey) who finds a blue quill, analyzes it and knows he's dealing with something that needs to be CAUGHT! Thus a chase begins with the looney Doctor pursuing the little hedgehog, who accidentally sent his special ""rings"" to a tower in SF. Sheriff Tom is the one who drives Sonic just ahead of the Doctor, stopping for a bit of fun at a country western drinking establishment. Will Tom and Sonic be able to outwit Robotic with his bag of cool gadgets? This film is SuperSonic fun and will delight many audiences, including older children. How wonderful to see Carrey on screen again, with his high octane humor, while Marsden, Sumpter, Schwartz, and the rest of the cast is great as well.

Jim Carrey gets to play an evil updated version of his dorky earlier characters in a new and improved way that the wild and crazy guy Steve Martin would probably have approved of. Filled with comedic cliches and a bar fight version with a twist as somehow ""most"" of these humorous lines run smoothly while only slightly at times bordering on tedious parody. This movie also includes an undertone of the meaning of loneliness and friendship that holds the emotional substantive glue of the movie. Overall, this fun, mostly delightful, encounter offers a nice younger entertaining contrast to the more adult version that came out nine years earlier entitled ""Paul"" (2011) starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.",Sonic the Hedgehog
30,ironhorse_iv,This speed demon movie is worth going for a spin. It was mildly entertaining.,6,28 February 2020,"After spending years on the shelf in development hell, this troubled live action production of one of the most popular video game franchises of all time was finally released in theaters during the 60th anniversary. That was at least, after a complete redesign of the iconic Sega mascot was done by Moving Picture Company before they were shut down due to part that the first trailer looking a bit unpleasant with rough looking real animalistic features. The turnaround pretty much cost Paramount 5 million dollars more in order to made Sonic (Voiced by Ben Schwartz) resemble his video game design. For the most part, the plan work as fans found the visuals lovely enough to watch over and over again. As of right now, this movie directed by Jeff Fowler is on the fast track on gaining back its losses with its box office earnings. Still in the long run the film is not quite Super Sonic. For starters, the plot written by Pat Casey & Josh Miller for this flick is still kinda disappointing for diehard fans for not being that faithful. Instead of having the titular speeder go around his colorful loop world of South Island collecting power up rings and avoiding obstacles like robotic enemies. The movie only teased us with that in the opening; only to have Sonic escape his way to our world from some echidna tribe that doesn't even reappeared anywhere else in the flick. As an alternative, the film now has the hedgehog with the help from a local cop Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) try to escape a new antagonist while hiding on Earth; a mad scientist/US government agent named Dr. Ivo Robotnik AKA Dr. Eggman (Jim Carrey) in a rural American version of Green Hills. Because of this new fast & loose direction; a lot of the original lore was missing. Don't get me wrong, I get that Sega did produced a lot of Sonic games with many of them aren't considered canon because of the contradictions and inconsistences, but how can you have a Sonic movie featuring echidnas in the beginning without the mention of the Chao Emblems? Regardless I do like the rings having the ability to become portals. I kinda glad the film used that plot device over the other lesser known McGuffins like mind controlling Wisps or time stones. However not having Eggman seek the rings out was a miss opportunity. Still most of the cat & mouse chase between them were entertaining intense to overlook that. They were mostly top notch; especially the highway pursuit with many sorts of robots. Yet I found the 2014 movie 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' Quicksilver like comedy bullet time event in the bar and downtown San Francisco breaking the fourth wall to be over the top goofy and clichés as hell. Another scene that I highly dislike was the dance sequence. That scene went a little too long and Jim Carrey's over mugging was a bit annoying. Regardless of that, Carrey as Robotnik, while general humorous was surprising threating. I found him to be a great antagonist. As for the hero. Schwartz is a lot better than most people give credit to. He really did capture how lonely Sonic can be in this world. I like that this version has flaws and still trying to figure out his powers. It's great character development. I always found original voice actors Jaleel White and Roger Craig Smith to be too in your face obnoxious, loud and unrealistic faultless. I believe that Schwartz made Sonic seen a real creature. I haven't saw this close of great performance since the days of Jason Griffith. However, I hate that movie couldn't figure out how smart & powerful his character is supposed to. It was all over the place with that. The whole road trip aspect seemed kinda forced because of that. I doubt that he really needed Tom's help. As for his friendship with the guy. It was mostly fine. Marsden really did work well as the overall good heartened every man. However, throwing his career away and helping a fugitive is kinda out of a character. While the dad jokes between them; while not super funny, it did have its charms. Only one joke felt cringe worthy. I really didn't like the misunderstood child abduction moment. Nevertheless, most of the scenes with them weren't as awkward as hedgehog's apparent romantic relationship with Princess Elise in the 2006 video game. Now that was pretty weird! Regardless some of the CGI work with Marsden carrying Sonic could had been touch up a little bit more. It was a bit fake looking. As for the ending; the whole government forgiving Tom seen a bit of a cop out. This guy's life would totally be ruined as Sonic causes a lot of destruction and deaths, not only in the blackout, but in the chase scenes. It would had been life in prison for sure. In truth I would rather have Tom escape with Sonic to a new world or something rather than stay on Earth. Regardless I still dig mid credits dis to the Mushroom Kingdom and a cameo from a certain Miles Prowler. Better than some cheesy short PSA. As for the soundtrack. Thomas Holkenborg's choice of songs is much better than the trailer that aired lyrically-inappropriate music. Most of the musical score he made himself also match the visuals. I just wish he was able to use more of the original game's themes rather than snippets sprinkled throughout the film due to legal issues. Overall: The movie was fast pace. It did stumble on occasions, but the flaws weren't so bad that I had to walk away. I'm glad the movie never introduced silly elements like Werehogs and others to the mix. I also happy that the film is not as murky and confusing as the television shows or the 1999 anime movie. In the end, the film is worth running through.",Sonic the Hedgehog
31,The-Sarkologist,"Entertaining, but not great",5,23 February 2020,"This film seems to be rather popular, if the reviews are anything to go by, and there also seems to be praise for Jim Carey as well. However, I'm going to have to disagree because it really does feel as if Carey's best days are far behind him. In fact, it sort of reminds me of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, where the main character has found himself in the situation where he is basically playing the bad guy of the week. Well, that probably isn't the case with this film, namely because the bad guy is a pretty significant character, but I still found him to be rather annoying.Maybe it is just because I am not all that familiar with the Sonic the Hedgehog series, which seems to be Sega's answer to Super Mario Bros. Yeah, this is a film that is based upon a computer game, though from the initial reactions, it does seem to have gone down much better than a lot of other films based on that medium have gone down.So, Sonic finds himself on Earth namely because he happens to be really powerful, and there are a lot of people who want to get some of that power. Actually, it seems as if his quills can produce energy, or at least that is what was indicated near the end of the movie. So, being a powerful alien on Earth that has accidentally knocked out all of the power to the Pacific Northwest, he is certainly getting some attention.We also have this cop, Tom Wakowski, who has just been invited to join the San Francisco PD, as long as he passes the character test (which I suspect, being a cop, shouldn't be all that hard to do). Unfortunately, he ends up helping Sonic, which basically puts him at odds with the government, so I guess the whole San Francisco plan has gone down the gurgler.There are two major themes in this film, one being the importance of friendship, and of course the joy when somebody actually makes a true friend. The other seems to be that there is nothing better than living in your home town. In a way it is suggesting that such a community means that everybody knows everybody, and there is a friendship there that doesn't exist in the big city. But the thing is that friendship is important, and while it does hammer it home a bit, we do need to remember that this is a film primarily for families.In the end though, I probably do have to admit that Jim Carey was probably perfect the role that he played, and certainly performed well as the evil genius. Still, it did rub me up the wrong way, but I can appreciate that others have quite liked it.",Sonic the Hedgehog

A lot of your enjoyment of this will come from a couple of things, first off, are you a fan of the games and character? Now I played the first couple of games on the Sega, but lost interest when I was 13 and got a girlfriend. So I have no REAL love or affinity with him, but know who he is. Secondly, remember it's a kids movie, I'm pretty sure this is not aimed at Zoners, so remember who the movie is made for.I'm not a fan of studio's/producers/directors-and the creative teams bowing to fan outrage, but moving the release date to 'fix' the animation was a great decision. However made that call, deserves a lot of credit. This would have tanked in November with or without the fixed fx.It is quick paced (no pun intended) and whilst sonic looks much better, It does still have some bad CGI (the drones especially) and whilst most of the jokes fell flat, the odd one liner amused me.As for the actors, I dare say this is classic Jim Carrey, as he really goes all in. Based on the trailers, I was worried it could be a bit 'trying to recapture glory days embarrassing' but he was fun in an Ace Ventura way. One guy laughed really hard at every one of his jokes. My girlfriend hated him though and found his performance cringey!! But she is considerably younger than me (21) and when she started paying attention to movies, Carrey was not doing his zany comedies anymore and she never really cared about anything she seen him in.Tika Sumpter is fun, James Marsden, an actor I always like seeing on screen is as reliable as you'd expect. However I suspect Neal McDonough was a victim of the cutting room floor. He is too good of an actor to be in one scene where he barley gets to talk as Carrey constantly won't let him speak.There were 33 people in my screening, mostly adults with kids (whinging about who they had to sit next to) or gangs of kids about 8-13) except one guy who was sat on his own, he was the one who really laughed loudly at everything Jim Carrey did.Side note: the kids were all well behaved once the movie started.

James Marsden himself plays the weary father figure, Jim Carrey chews the scenery as Dr. Robotnik and Sonic is the energetic but lonely child figure. The plot was set up effectively (although I wish we could have seen more of Sonic's origins and the other planets) but the energy petered out somewhat. After the beginning, there is a lot of set pieces and Sonic's goofiness with not much really connecting them. They have to go to San Francisco to find the rings but Dr. Robotnik tries to stop them; there's not much else to the story. The character arcs promised in the beginning don't really go anywhere.

Like myself who has played the original games with Sonic running at superspeed and facing against Eggman. Well the movie is decent. It could have been better but it was entertaining for what it is worth. I feel like the plot is a straight up cheesy movie that kids will enjoy more. It does have some fun action, decent visual effects, and an okay casts like James Marsdan, Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic, and Jim Carrey playing Dr. robotnik (the villain for Sonic). The humor was cheesy and may make you cringe. It could have been a lot worse.The plot follows Sonic, a hedgehog who can run at super speed. When he is sent to Earth to hide from their enemies. He is in a small town where he tries to entertain himself. He enjoys watching over their small town sheriff Tom (James Marsdan). Who wants to be part of the police unit in San Francisco and move there with his wife Maddie (Tika Sumpter). When Sonic accidently sets off the electricity in that town. Causing the military to be involved. And Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) to investigate with his drones. He becomes obsessed when he discovers Sonic and his powers. Which Tom and Sonic go on a run to find Sonic's rings that can help him transport to another world.The plot is thin. And forgettable. The movie's humor is cheesy and mainly aiming for the younger crowd. Which the adults may get bored of it. Even if they grew up playing Sonic. The film is lacking the fun energy that trailer made it out to be. It just was more of a cheesy family film that may divide the fan base who enjoyed the games. It does have some fun action with Sonic taking down Robotnik's vehicle drones and being on a chase with Robotnik after him. It was all brief and forgettable.James Marsdan is decent playing Tom. Ben Schwartz is an acceptable choice playing the voice of Sonic. Tika Sumpter role was brief and only playing the supportive character to Tom. Jim Carrey is acceptable as the villain Robotnik. His character's dialogue and humor is cheesy and cringing.I was kind of disappointed with the music score. I feel like with this kind of movie based on the game. They could have an energy fun filled score that's similar to the games. But the music score is underwhelming and forgotten. One of Tom Holkenborg's worst scores.The film does have a mid credit scene that may make fans happy when another character is introduced for a future film. Or the ending with Robotnik and paying homage to the villain in the game which may make fans happy.Overall, Sonic the Hedgehog is a fair film. It has some entertaining action. It has a decent cast ensemble. The direction and script is cheesy with its humor. The music score is forgettable.",Sonic the Hedgehog
36,eddie_baggins,A genuine surprise,7,27 February 2020,"If there was a film released over recent years that had no right being as enjoyable as it has ended up being, it's most certain that Sonic the Hedgehog would be near the top of that list.A seemingly doomed video game adaption directed by a first time director and pushed back months from its initial release date due to large-scale online backlash aimed at its first reveals, Sonic didn't have the easiest of paths to its final release but against all the odds, it succeeds where so many before it have failed.One of the most purely enjoyable mainstream family films of the last few years, Jeff Fowler's fast-moving and wittily delivered film never threatens to do anything in a way that reinvents the wheel of its genre but thanks to some energetic performances, accessible material and a loveable CGI creation, Sonic deserves to be ranked among the better video game adaptations.Taking the mismatched buddy road trip approach to its source material, an approach that is tried and true in many similar adventures, Sonic sees the Ben Schwartz voiced extra-ordinary animal team up with James Marsden's do-gooder small-town sheriff Tom Wachowski, as the destined to be best friends face off against a rampaging Jim Carrey as famed game villain Dr. Ivo Robotnik, who wants nothing more than to harness the powers of Sonic for his devious technology.There's nothing to write home about story wise here but Josh Miller and Patrick Casey's funnier than it should be script allows its main performers ample opportunities to play out scenarios that will get the young and old laughing in equal measure, as Schwartz feels like the perfect Sonic, Marsden the solid grounded support he needs, while Carrey gets to rewind time and go full manic in his most enjoyable turn in year's, in what is a performance that is sure to please long-term fans.Full credit must go to the team as a whole here, managing to craft a breezy and easy to enjoy experience that balances that tricky line of being perfect for kids and entertaining for adults (bar fights and all), so much so that the thought of more big screen Sonic adventures is not only tolerable but exciting, a rare feat for modern family films and video game movies in particular.Final Say -A hugely enjoyable romp that never outstays its welcome or try's to be anything but a fun-filled yarn, Sonic the Hedgehog will go down as one of 2020's nicest cinematic surprises.3 ½ chainsaw wielding locals out of 5",Sonic the Hedgehog
37,leonblackwood,Surprisingly a lot of fun! 7/10,7,25 August 2020,"Review:
I really didn't have high hopes for this film because it seemed like a crazy idea, but I actually found it entertaining. Don't get me wrong, the plot is extremely unrealistic and some of the characters couldn't act at all, but the witty script saved the day. Jim Carrey, who plays Dr. Robotnik, wasn't as crazy as he usually is in his films, so I was actually able to keep up with him. The buddy relationship between Sonic and Tom (James Marsden) was, surprisingly, a joy to watch and the CGI made it seem like the little blue fella was actually in the room. There is something for all ages, especially if you grew up playing the game, and I like the fact that they gave Sonic the majority of screen time. If you don't take the plot seriously, you will find it fun for the whole family, and I hope that they don't take years to make a sequel. It will be good to see how Sonic adapts to Earth, now that he has joined his new family, and with Dr. Robotnik making his way back to civilisation it has the makings of becoming a decent franchise. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This is the first movie directed by Jeff Fowler, so I'm unable to compare this movie to his previous work. With a sequel due to be released in 2022, which was announced before the virus, and this being the 3rd biggest release of 2020, behind Bad Boys For Life and 1917, Fowler must be happy with the success of the film. It managed to beat Rise of Skywalker, Harley Quinn and Jumanji: The Next Level, so I'm not the only person that found it fun. With many big-budget movies held back due to the virus, I'm sure that this movie will go down the box office takings chart at some point, but it went down well with the critics and I personally would recommend it.Budget: $85million

I think the rest of the cast are great too. The various scenes which are corny really distract from the pretty good plot.Towards the end, the deus ex machina really is a put off. It is like the writers gave up or were rushed. In fact, about 2/3rds of the way through I realized the ending.Either way, it is a pretty good movie.",Sonic the Hedgehog

44,subxerogravity,Not the Sonic movie I wanted but a good movie.,8,14 February 2020,"I gotta say I thought I was coming into this about to see garbage projected on a big screen and I'm always gonna question why they did not make a Lion king remake style CGI film that better represents the game as a whole, but this was nothing like the catastrophic Mario Bros. Adaption. That would have been funny if Sega'a mascot failed as miserably as Nintendo's but man that's not the case.
Sonic as a character was actually pretty cool to watch for 90mins. Jim Carrey actually brought his A game when it came to playing Robotnik, a decent supervillain for a child based movie. Forget about how skinny he is, too skinny to be Robotnik. He was funny, entertaining and the robot drones he used were cool.

This is a live action and CGI movie that is based on the Sega video game. I must confess that I am not a video game player. I have heard of Sonic the Hedgehog but I have never played the game. Anyway, the movie is good, with plenty of fast paced action and humor. Ben voices Sonic, a blue furred hedgehog from another planet that can travel using rings that make portals for him to travel through. When he comes to Earth, he catches the attention of the US government, who sends Jim-an evil but genius scientist-to track down and capture Ben. Ben lands in a small town that has James as the local sheriff. They become fast friends and James tries to help Ben evade Jim and his elaborate machines. Tika plays James' wife. Like I said earlier, I'm not schooled in all the characters from the video game but when the end credits start, there is another character from the original games that shows up-a friend that was with me informed me of who he is, his best friend named 'Tails'.
It's rated ""PG"" for action, violence, rude humor and some mild language and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes.
I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.",Sonic the Hedgehog

I really enjoyed this movie and can't wait for the sequel,8,21 May 2021,"Sonic the Hedgehog (2020) is a movie my daughter and I went to the movies and saw together as soon as it came out. The storyline is about Sonic having to escape his planet and using his rings to get to Earth and hide. He does a good job for the most part until he gets identified and a crazy doctor starts hunting him down. This movie is directed by Jeff Fowler in his directorial debut and stars Jim Carey (Ace Ventura), James Marsden (X-Men), Tika Sumpter (Ride Along) and Neal McDonough (Minority Report). The storyline for this picture itself is just okay but delivered and execution of it is in a very entertaining way. I loved the intro from Sonic's home, the transition to Earth and the ultimate conclusion and evolution of Dr. Robotnik. The comedic content was excellent. I thought Marsden's interactions with Sonic were great and Carey was classic Carey. Loved him in this role. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and can't wait for the sequel.

48,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Sonic the Hedgehog,7,11 December 2020,7/10 - I was shocked by how fun and just overall well-done this family-friendly video game adaptation was and will definitely watch it again,Sonic the Hedgehog
49,alindsay-al,An Above Average fun family film,6,21 February 2020,"As a big video game fan I have played many Sonic games, some good & some bad but when The Sonic film was announced I was interested. Now some backstory to this film, when the first trailer was released Sonic's look was heavily slated, so in an unprecedented move Paramount & Sega decided to change the look to a more faithful version to the game. This move really was a great way to get support for this film and I think this film should be supported for this decision, anyway this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees an alien hedgehog with superspeed trying to survive with a police officer from an evil genius.
Main Character
Ben Schwartz voices Sonic in this film and I feel like he does an alright job in the voice, he is very charming and entertaining in the role. Also you grow to care about him a lot as there is some depth to his character and you do feel sympathy for him, I also liked the way he addressed pop culture as it was a constant way to get laughs. However, there was a point where I thought that he just became a bit too annoying also I don't understand the need to try and make more and characters like Deadpool, first of all Harley Quinn in Birds Of Prey & now Sonic in this film and I don't feel like every character has to narrate their own film and it does take away from the film.
Supporting Characters
James Marsden plays the police officer that Sonic befriends in the film and I thought he did a good job in the film, he is your likeable average guy that is pretty easy to root for. The relationship between the two characters is handled well and even though it is a pretty generic journey I did get emotionally invested in there story in the film. Now we get to the thing I couldn't stand in this film and that was Jim Carrey's performance as Dr Robotnik, he was just so over the top I thought I had been transported back to the 1990s. I know this film isn't meant to be taken too seriously but he is just so off the walls that it is so hard to take his character seriously at all even when the film tries to make you feel that way.
Story
The story is at its strength when it focuses on Marsden & Sonics relationship, it is quite heartwarming and nice to see this friendship develop throughout the film. However, one thing that should be noticed in this film is that it is really safe, it is a very predictable film that is pretty paint by numbers. Even though this is an entertaining film if you can easily predict the film all the way through then it does take away from your experience even if it is a film that is meant for families.
Script
Some of the humour does work in this film, as I mentioned earlier I did like the pop culture references used by Sonic, also the drama was suprisingly well handled and it made me care about the two main protagonists in the film. But I will admit sometimes, there are just a few too many references in the film and it can sometimes take away from some good character moments and good dramatic moments.Style
The style of the film is easily the best part of this film, it is very bright and colourful and feels like it is straight from the video game. Sonic looks great in the film and I am so happy they changed the design and it is a great thing to see this version of Sonic on the big screen instead of the horrible version in the first trailer. The action scenes are exciting and entertaining with moments that feel appropriate for this film and the age group that the film is aimed at.Overall
Overall this is an entertaining film for sure that starts to make Sonic a more mainstream character again, there was definitley some issues for the film but if you like fun action films then Sonic might be worth a watch for you.",Sonic the Hedgehog
50,kwenchow,"A bit promising at the beginning, but fell short all the way! Too many overuse and annoying scene! Very disappointed!",2,23 March 2020,"This film start with Dr. Robotnik chasing Sonic, the flashback of Sonic save by Longclaw, and ten years later, the introduction of a police officer ""Tom"" scene! As turnout, this film is about Tom helping Sonic to retrieve a bag of rings, he accidentally lost at a rooftop on a building! They also need to deal with the threat of Dr. Robotnik along the way! Entire film full of overuse of the playing dumb scene! Make the film unwatchable! Dr. Robotnik dancing in his lorry also very annoying to watch! The action scene in the film have, drone shooting, car crash, explosion and lightning struck! All the action too short, not intense, and not satisfy at all! Barely laughable scene is, Dr. Robotnik pass out, when he found Sonic in Tom house! At the end, Sonic defeat Dr. Robotnik by throwing him into another portal! Sonic stay in Tom house!

It looks very impressive and Carrey, despite being extremely Carrey, is pretty good fun, but other than that............",Sonic the Hedgehog

53,jimbo-53-186511,There's enough on offer for all audiences though I suspect kids will enjoy it more,6,15 January 2021,"After fleeing from his home planet speedy Sonic The Hedgehog quickly stirs up trouble on Earth when his antics cause a power outage. When the government suspect that something 'other-worldly' is responsible for said outage they send in eccentric Doctor Robotnik who becomes fascinated with Sonic wanting to carry out his own 'experiments' on what he describes as a fascinating creature. Sonic's only hope of survival is to head to San Francisco to retrieve some rings that he dropped through another portal in order to necessitate his escape from Earth and his only hope may lie with a police officer who he befriends on Earth...Those of a certain age (like me) will remember the original Sonic The Hedgehog computer game being all the rage back in the 1990's and feeling a little nostalgic I decided to check out this film hoping for a little bit of light relief and escapism. Whilst I don't believe that Sonic The Hedgehog is a perfect film it did well enough for me on both fronts.The opener of the film (with the classic Sega logo) and Sonic running round his home land were a time capsule for me and were reminiscent of the classic game. However, for 95% of its running time, Sonic The Hedgehog takes place on Earth with our blue spiky friend trying to escape the clutches of the resourceful and rather determined Doctor Robotnik. Although the story plays out more-or-less exactly as you'd expect it to, it is helped along the way by having a certain likeability and charm. Ben Schwarz as the voice of Sonic really helps to bring Sonic to life; he's cocksure on the outside (but not to the point of being arrogant) but at the same time Sonic has a certain vulnerability which makes him endearing. Likewise James Marsden is good as well and forms a solid repartee and bond with his CGI friend. Jim Carrey was a highlight of the film and his infectious energy meant that he too brought Robotnik to life.One thing I found a tad disappointing about this film was the script and some of the dialogue; whilst Sonic is an energetic likeable character he isn't really given many funny lines and the same can be said for some of the other characters. Whilst I've complimented Carrey's performance I too found he wasn't given particularly great lines to work with meaning that the film was a little too reliant on his energy.Still I don't mean to be too harsh on this film and my review should be taken in context; as a man in my late 30's I'm clearly not the main audience that the filmmakers were aiming this at and I have to say that the likeability and charm that the film offers in abundance should certainly please the young ones - although as I've said there's still plenty for adults to enjoy. One line I did like was the line where Sonic says 'Jeez and they say Amazon are going to use these things to deliver parcels?' and there were odd amusing lines like this littered throughout the film.Overall I'd recommend Sonic The Hedgehog, but I think it's fair to say that kids will probably find it more enjoyable than adults - although it is kids that the filmmakers have clearly pitched the film at so we can't really say that they don't know their audience.",Sonic the Hedgehog
54,MissSimonetta,Nothing new but so much fun anyway,7,15 February 2020,"Family comedies tend to stick to tried and true formulas, and the SONIC THE HEDGEHOG movie is no different. I could predict the story beats quite easily. However, within the confines of that structure is a very entertaining movie. I smiled throughout and laughed more than I expected I would. Ben Scwartz makes for a charming Sonic-- cocky and upbeat as always, even a bit more childlike than he is in the games and comics-- and all the supporting characters are fun. I gotta go with the people who say Jim Carrey steals the show though. When he was first cast as Robotnik/Eggman, I was weirded out, but he does well, acting like Robotnik on cocaine.About my only major complaint is that the music is quite unmemorable. It sounds like any other movie soundtrack composed in the last fifteen years, which is doubly distracting since the Sonic video games, even the worst ones (looking at you Sonic 2006) sport catchy music.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Carrey steals the show as the big bad villain Dr. Robotnik & He's absolutely hilarious!!!This reminded me why Jim Carrey was one of the highest paid actors ever during his glory days during the 1990's & why he's still a Comedic Genius.James Marsden is good here too as the local nice-guy Sheriff of a small all American town who befriends Sonic the hedgehog. Sonic looks perfect on screen, he's cartoony & voiced perfectly & he even gets a back story & find out he's from another dimension world (the world that's in the games) & the heart of the movie is the funny friendship between Sonic & Tom & moves along like a fun buddy flick with a mix of the road movie & a fantasy adventure too.The special effects are great & i loved the crazy gadgets used by the hilarious Dr. Robotnik.All in all Sonic is a big budget fun blockbuster for the whole family to enjoy & a nice heart to it all about friendship & finding where you belong & finding your family.

56,aidanratesmovies,A Fun Ride,8,14 February 2020,"Fun-spirited, often charming, and entertaining, Sonic is everything you would expect from an adaptation of the beloved SEGA character, and although not perfect, it is certainly enjoyable. The obvious standout for me in the film was Ben Schwartz as the voice of the furry hedgehog himself, providing the utter backbone to the film, besides the obvious change in CGI. At times, you can see the CGI does seem a bit on the nose in term of quality of finishment, but it never truly takes away from the enjoyment of it all. All in all, I adore the new design, and although I believe it is a bit ridiculous how the internet can have such a negative impact that changes the fundamentals of a film working, I quite believe given the circumstances that this was the right choice. Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik was quite a perfect match, at times his humor didn't totally land the way it seemed to be trying, but by the second half of the film, you truly begin to enjoy his character being on screen- and performance of it. The film can be a bit unoriginal at times with its plot progression and circumstances of storytelling, but although it may not be totally unique, it provides balance with humor and some quite clever uses of the title character. In the end, Sonic the Hedgehog is by no means a great film, but a decent one, especially for an adaptation off of a video game, and by all means a fun ride. Here's hoping the blue devil will be able to speed across the screen again sometime soon.
My Rating: 7.75/10",Sonic the Hedgehog
57,questl-18592,Sonic,4,17 February 2020,"Whew, I loved the Sonic games when I was a kid, though when I heard about the movie I was a little worried because Sonic doesn't generally have tons of story in the early games and even later on the story is never why anyone played those games.It won't be why anyone likes the movie either. The story is remarkably bland, the plot is very basic, there's no sense of surprise here or even anticipation. From the get got it gets on a very familiar track and then stays there.This is definitely a kids movie, it's goofy and light without much of any depth. That said, there were kids in the theater I saw it in and they were cracking up at points, so good on SEGA I guess. It got a couple chuckles from me but that was about it.Marsden was fun, and I continue to lament how underused and under appreciated he is despite how solid he is in everything. Carrey is always a riot to me. I grew up on Ace Ventura and his rubber-faced antics have never gotten stale for me. He is a little extra crazy in this though and there were a couple of screens where I felt like he should have been reeled in a little.The biggest problem here for me is that from the opening SEGA logo, this felt very much like a product to me. Now I know all movies are products, they exist for consumption and projects only get the green light if someone thinks there's money to be made. But this felt like such a cash grab. So many things that seem clearly meant to sell toys. Worse though was the blatant and repetitive product placement that just got on my nerves.Still, kids generally don't notice that sort of stuff and like I said, the ones in my theater loved it, which is great. I just wanted more than dumb jokes, predictable scripting and reminders about whatever fine products paid for this movie. So, take the kids, let them enjoy it but know that this was made with them in mind, not you. It won't be torture to the adults, but it won't be real engaging either.",Sonic the Hedgehog
58,I_Ailurophile,"Ridiculous, fun adaptation",10,29 May 2021,"Given even just the production history of this movie, I had extremely mixed expectations before watching. Yet given the opportunity, I couldn't pass it up - and you know what? 'Sonic the hedgehog' is both absurd and delightful.Truthfully, I was hooked from the moment early on when Sonic befriended a turtle.Sonic, as voiced by Ben Schwartz, rides a line between terribly obnoxious and annoyingly endearing, but indisputably entertaining. James Marsden, in his role as small-town cop Tom, plays it straight, and is a swell foil to Sonic's madcap frivolity. And Jim Carrey, as infamous Dr. Robotnik is... Well, there's no mistaking that his knack for physical comedy and exaggerated facial expressions makes him perfect for a part so cartoonishly villainous. At the same time, this is the most Jim Carrey that Jim Carrey has been in years. Yet the end result of it all is that the cast is outstanding, and they give swell comedic performances to bring this picture to life.The special effects, including Robotnik's machines and Sonic himself, are as realistic as such pointedly unrealistic visions could be. That dovetails neatly into the nature off the film as a videogame adaptation: For working with a franchise whose concept boils down to ""gotta go fast,"" writers Pat Casey and Josh Miller have concocted a story that ports over familiar elements of the game series to the cinematic world, while also creating something new and fun. Even when it dips into overly sentimental moments, or gets extra cutesy or cartoonish - this is honestly just such a blast.Despite myself, there's just not much more to say. No one is more surprised than I am by how much I enjoyed this film. It had so much working against it since the moment production began, but all the hard work has paid off. 'Sonic the hedgehog' is an unapologetic, silly, playful romp that has caught me off guard, and I'm so glad I took a chance on it.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Actually it's indeed a fun family film and we might have just witnessed a new iconic baddie (played by Jim. C), that is purely from the dark side.

Despite all the criticism and hate this film has gotten, alongside the character design, Sonic really is a fun film that will hit a lot of audience members. Nostalgia, comedy, and kid friendly film are the selling points for going to see this one in theaters. Throw in good action, a fast pace, and some great performances for Sonic and Robotnik and it only helps seal the package for seeing this film. However, the movie is still not without its flaws with the gear towards the kid/family audience being one of the most limiting components for me. While I appreciate this adventure breaking the walls, the gamer in me who has loved the mobius arcs would have liked to see that direction over this integration into our world for the originality and game feel I want with video game movies. Separating that out though, it's the modern trend of making kids movies comedy fests crammed with one liners, forced sappy moments, and toning down some of the action scenes that were the biggest limitations for me. All in all, the movie succeeds in accomplishing the goal of being fun for all ages and a solid opener to a potential franchise. My encouragement is again to catch this one in theaters for the fun and effects, but otherwise get the hedgehog on Redbox or streaming soon.LIKES:

64,rannynm,Fast and Furious. Loved Every Minute. Love Sonic.,10,14 February 2020,"I've never played Sonic the video game and was never a really big fan of the character but I really like this movie. It is very well done and great for the whole family. I like the animation and I love the acting. The story is very human and has very little to do with video games. It is about friendship and friends that become a family.Sonic the Hedgehog is about a blue hedgehog that ends up on earth and he's trying not to be discovered. He lost a ring that helps him transport to places. When humans find Sonic, he has to run away (something he does well because he moves at super sonic speeds). Sonic feels lonely and wants a friend. When he meets Tom, a police officer (James Marsden), they develop a great ""bromance,"" but they have to face Mr. Robotnik who is obsessed with everything fast and wants to experiment with Sonic. In their journey, both learn they don't have to run away from their problems.I love all the characters! Dr. Robotnik is so funny and pleasing to watch. He is played by Jim Carrey, who is one of my new favorite actors. His performance is amazing and he is definitely a fascinating villain. He is graceful, entertaining and full of life. I also love the character Sonic; even though it is an animated character he really looks realistic. I could really see all the details in Sonic and I felt like he was pretty much a stuffed animal, opposed to a virtual digital character. Sonic is played by Ben Schwartz, an amazing voice actor who gives the character a great personality.It's so amazing to see a character that was made about 30 years ago continuing to fill children's hearts with joy. I think Sonic is 100% absolutely adorable and all the characters are so fun to watch. There are a lot of action scenes and wonderful colors in the film as well. The music adds so much energy; it is catchy and upbeat. Finally, I like all the jokes and they definitely made me laugh. To add to that, I love how Sonic gives everyone their own special nickname. That gives the movie its own special touch and I guess I'll nick name this film ""Blue Speedy Furry with Heart.""I give Sonic the Hedgehog five out of five stars and recommended it for ages 4 to 13. The message of this film is that friends in our lives bring us the most joy and they are the family we chose. Another message is that humans will always be more important than technology. Dr. Robotnik keeps trying to make technology a greater power than humans, but Sonic and everyone prove that our simple life and connections are what really matter.Reviewed by Zoe C., KIDS FIRST!

65,rannynm,"Based on one of my favorite game characters, this hits it out of the park! Loved it!",10,20 February 2020,"I like this movie because is based on one of my favorite game characters. Sonic The Hedgehog is a live-action film-except for Sonic who is a CGI character (Ben Schwartz)-based on the global blockbuster video game franchise from SegaThe story of Sonic the Hedgehog follows Sonic, a small blue hedgehog who has super-speed powers. When Sonic was younger, his owl guardian gave him a bag of rings to help him escape to different planets in case anyone discovers and kidnaps him because of his powers. One night, after he comes to Earth, he is playing baseball by himself and he gets upset because he realizes he is very lonely. Sonic runs in circles as fast as he can because he is upset. He is so fast that blue energy comes out of his body causing the whole town to black out.This power outage causes big problems for Sonic who is pursued by a crazy military man named Dr. Ivo Robotnik (Jim Carrey) or Dr. Eggman, as Sonic calls him. Fortunately for Sonic, the town's sheriff (James Marsden) catches him and helps protect him from Dr. Robotnik.The graphics in the movie are excellent, and, with the new Sonic design, it looks like Sonic is real. The new design works better than the Sonic design Paramount Pictures had before redoing this movie. The special effects are impressive too, such as Sonic's blue lightning which also looks real. Ben Schwartz did and very funny voiceover for the Sonic character. He is really full of energy.The moral of this movie is that you are never alone in the world. There will always be someone for you to be your friend, to talk to and to be by your side when you need it. When Sonic is feeling alone, Sheriff Tom, or The Doughnut Lord, as Sonic calls him, takes Sonic to protect him and help him get to the Mushroom planet where Sonic needs to go.Sonic the Hedgehog is filled with a lot of action and fun.

66,justin-fencsak,One of the better video game to film adaptations. I was surprised.,8,15 February 2020,When i saw the first teaser for Sonic I was a bit upset that the character looked mean and ferocious. By the time the second trailer came out I was relieved. Now that the movie is finally out all I can say it is quite a good movie for fans of all ages. Jim Carrey is great as Dr. Robotnik and the CGI Sonic is well done.,Sonic the Hedgehog

68,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Sonic the Hedgehog""- A silly, fun flick for the whole family, and another step in the right direction for video-game-to-film adaptations!",7,1 June 2020,"Hey! Hollywood appears to be on a roll lately! After last year's ""Pokémon: Detective Pikachu"" proved to be one of the most faithful and engaging video-game movies yet, a certain blue hedgehog with a speedy superpower has arrived to continue the trend!2020's ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" is based on the famous Sega mascot, and comes to us from first-time feature director Jeff Fowler. Featuring a fairly impressive cast including comedic mastermind Jim Carrey and the delightful Ben Schwartz as the voice of our titular hero, the film is by and large a success thanks to its solid cast, infectious humor and some very creative sequences. And although it may be a slave to formula and at times can come off as generic and quaint, it's another step in the right direction for video-game-to-film adaptations!Sonic (Schwartz) is an anthropomorphic hedgehog hailing from a distant alien world. Sought after for his powers of super-speed, he was forced to flee to the planet Earth as a child, and has been hiding out in the small town of Green Hills, Montana ever since. However, when he inadvertently catches the eyes of the US government, he is forced to team up with local Sheriff Tom (James Marsden) to find a way off of Earth. At the same time, an evil and unhinged genius called Dr. Robotnik (Carrey) is assigned to the case, and becomes obsessed with catching our speedy hero!The cast is a great deal of fun. I've always really enjoyed Schwartz as a performer, and he really fits the role of Sonic. His enthusiasm is infectious, and he makes the character endlessly likable. Marsden is quite solid as Sonic's human friend Sherriff Tom. He's a really good foil to the hedgehog and they have great chemistry. I also really enjoyed the adorable Tika Sumpter in a supporting role as Tom's wife Maddie. She doesn't have a huge part, be she's always a pleasure when she's onscreen. And then there's Jim Carrey, whose clearly channeling his work from the 90's in an endlessly over-the-top performance. Your mileage may vary, but I found him... decent. I would have preferred a little more restraint on his part, and his jokes didn't always land for me. But I still liked him for the most part.The film is also generally very well put together. Director Fowler has a sharp eye for visuals and composition, and the movie is very well-shot. It's bright and colorful and crisp. Exactly what you'd want out of a ""Sonic"" movie. There's also some fantastic little sequences that display Sonic's powers in interesting ways. A scene set in a baseball field where Sonic plays a game against himself is a lot of fun, as are two scenes that utilize a ""frozen time"" gimmick similar to those used in the 20th Century Fox ""X-Men"" films. You really get a sense of Sonic's speed and powers here. It's also very fun and engaging. I laughed quite a few times throughout, and it kept me invested from start-to-finish. And I absolutely have to commend the film for all the brilliant little references and callbacks to the games. There are dozens upon dozens of Easter Eggs for major Sonic fans. If you're like me and grew up on the original games, you'll have a ton of fun looking for them.I feel I should also address the pink elephant in the room-- that being the original design. Everyone knows that the first trailer features a radically different rendition of Sonic that was changed for the final release after immense backlash. And I think it was the right move. The movie is so fun and so playful, the original much-more realistic design just wouldn't have worked. And the studio definitely earned some serious brownie points from me for listening to the fans.If I were to point out any major flaws, however, it would be that the film is at times a little too reliant on clichés and formula. While writers Pat Casey and John Miller do a good job at writing characters and snappy dialogue, the story itself is... kind of bland and predictable. It really is just another movie where a fantasy character ends up in the ""real world,"" and it uses all the tropes you'd expect. If you've seen movies like ""Masters of the Universe"" or ""Enchanted,"" or heck... even ""The Smurfs,"" you'll know what you're in for. The pacing is also a little suspect at times. It's kind of slow to start, and the ending feels rather abrupt.But that one major flaw aside... I can't help but give ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" a hearty recommendation. Thanks to its great cast and impressive execution, I was able to (mostly) forgive its flaws. This is one seriously fun flick! And it's easily one of the better video-game movies.I'm giving ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" a pretty good 7 out of 10. While it may not be a particularly groundbreaking film, it's a perfectly enjoyable romp that should appeal equally to both franchise fans and families.",Sonic the Hedgehog
69,arungeorge13,A perfectly serviceable video-game flick feat. Sonic The Hedgehog! [+53%],5,22 May 2020,"Let me sum it up in one line - Sonic The Hedgehog is Paramount Pictures' attempt to Americanize the iconic character of Sonic with moderately appealing results. For a video game flick, it's not all that bad. While it definitely doesn't offer an intriguing premise, it doesn't overstay its welcome either. At a crisp run-time of 95 minutes, it's a decent (but unmemorable) watch.The attempt to turn Sonic into a bucket-list ticking American didn't completely win me over. My biggest problem with the movie, however, is that it lacks logic even by Sonic-verse standards. Sonic can save people falling off a building, a turtle from getting crushed under a moving vehicle's wheel, and dodge bullets like they're flies but he gets tranquilized so easily? Gimme a break. The same goes for the scene where Sonic needs the assistance of his human friends Tim (a functional James Marsden) and Maddie (an okay Tika Sumpter) to get to the terrace of an SF building. In another scene, he's shown to be racing to the top of the pyramids on foot. (Come on!)Now, let's talk about the little wins. How Sonic gets his signature red-and-white shoes is conveyed through a sweetly written scene. Jim Carrey (as Dr. Robotnik) lands most of his funny lines and rises above the generic baddie. The set-pieces (especially the one that's shot around the seven wonders) are good fun - though the ""time-freeze"" style has now run its course thanks to Quicksilver, Flash, and many such characters in Hollywood movies. I'm glad they re-designed Sonic's appearance - he doesn't look a ""kid in a hedgehog suit"" anymore!I think I liked Detective Pikachu more, in terms of detailing the connect between its two lead characters. Here, the writing seems a tad too convenient. And the idea of Sonic being branded a people-stalker didn't go down well with me. This film is at best, a one-time watch, with lowered expectations.",Sonic the Hedgehog
70,Abdulxoxo,Fun,7,13 January 2021,"Sonic the Hedgehog is visually beautiful to look at, I enjoyed some of the comedic scenes; and there is a sweet moment involving the presentation of a pair of trainers. I'd actually say that the visual effects are one of my favourite aspects of this film. The new and improved look of Sonic is actually really cool; as are the action sequences. A particular highlight is a scene where we see Sonic in a bar moving so quickly that it looks like everyone and everything has frozen still. Although an obvious Quicksilver rip-off, it is a well executed sequence. Another major highlight is Jim Carrey, he is back on his 90's form. He plays Dr Robotnik with such improvised zaniness so good that he outshines everyone, and makes him the most entertaining and interesting thing about the film. There is a mid-credit scene which sets up a sequel which actually makes me want to see what they do with that sequel!",Sonic the Hedgehog
71,martimusross,Very Entertaining Family Movie,6,4 March 2020,"Sonic The HedgehogThis was a well constructed family movie brilliantly delivered by Jim Carrey. This man has certainly not lost his brand of comedic magic and I would go as far to say without his presence this movie would have descended into a turkey.Sonic was well drawn but we were still left with unanswered questions, on his origin his powers his purpose, but hey!",Sonic the Hedgehog
72,rivertam26,Overly mediocre and too silly,4,23 February 2020,"Theres lots of excuses the people who like this movie will give you for the reasons you don't like it. But in truth it's an awful movie. Aimed squarely at kids with the dumbest humor I've seen in quite some time. Almost everything doesn't work but most of it has to do with the confused execution. Regardless of how much money they spent to redo Sonic he still looks weird and creepy and at times is kinda terrifying. The movie presents him as a loner, oddball with schizophrenic multiple personalities. James Marsden still looking fine does the best with what he can and some of human stuff isn't too bad. That being said Jim Carrey is atrocious. Although hes basically doing the same stuff that made him famous it feels more forced and with less energy. All in all it's a dodgy money grab that's unfortunately catching on so expect more of these cinematic brain farts.",Sonic the Hedgehog
73,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Gotta go fast!,7,1 August 2020,"Sonic's finally made it to the movies after years of development: and it's the best video game film ever made by default! It's a fast-paced buddy-comedy superhero film that works well enough on its own. And for now, well enough is just fine: because video game cinema has a LONG way to go just yet. If video game films are to be at least Sonic-levels of quality there is hope for the future. It took time for Hollywood to get comic book movies right but they got there, so video games are sure to be the new frontier for the taking.Sure this film's character arcs are predictable but it's not grossly offensive in its familiarity and it does add some self-awareness in the script thanks to Ben Schwartz and James Marsden's unusual buddy chemistry. Oh, and Jim Carrey's Dr. Robotnik was just right for this movie; he's arguably the most enjoyable aspect of Sonic the Hedgehog. This 2020 film has mid-90s charm to it in the way it was made and the way it plays out the story. It may date the movie for some but it's at least a firm base of style and direction, because many of these video game movies simply don't have direction or purpose: they usually squander with no arc or character resolutions. Thankfully Sonic realises it's a movie and doesn't bother hammering too many of the video game's elements for fan-service pandering's sake. It plays things out in a conventional, predictable but enjoyable manner.I sincerely hope Hollywood takes notes for how Sonic was adapted for the big screen, because this is a big step in the right direction for video game adaptations. It's not perfect but it's good. And for now, good is more than enough.",Sonic the Hedgehog

76,IonicBreezeMachine,"While there's not much in the way of suprises, Sonic the Hedgehog will delight both franchise newcomers and seasoned fans",7,9 March 2021,"Ten years after being forced to flee his home planet, blue superspeeded Hedgehog Sonic (Ben Schwartz) now lives in secret in the small town of Green Hills, Montana. After one day inadvertently tapping into his powers triggering an electromagnetic pulse, this brings the attention of U.S. Government who sends in genius scientist Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) to investigate and deal with the anomaly. Now hunted by Robotnik's drones Sonic enlists the help of Green Hills Sheriff, Tom Wachowski (James Marsden), to helptravel across the United States so he can avoid capture.First appearing on video game consoles back in 1991, Sonic became an instant success for both Sega and their 16-bit video game console the Genesis/Mega Drive. Sonic even helped Sega eclipse sales of competitor Nintendo (albeit in brief spurts) and lead to well received sequels and an expanded media franchise that still runs strong to this day with long running comics and multiple TV series having been produced. A movie had been in various stages of development from 1994 onward with iterations of the project coming close to fruition at MGM and Dreamworks, but conflicting visions and fleeting success with films such as Super Mario Bros. and Street Fighter resulted in the project stalling. The film began serious development back in 2013 and even with the commitment it was slow going for the blue speedster with original distributor Columbia getting cold feet and selling the project in a turnaround to Paramount (who was eager to bulk up franchises in the wake of their faltering Transformers and Star Trek films). Then of course there was Sonic's design/redesign which was so reviled by everyone the movie was delayed to fix the look. Against all odds, the movie is actually quite good.While the movie is certainly a family film (with some of the types of humor that entails), the movie does have a charm and sweetness to it that makes itself very endearing. Ben Schwartz is effectively energetic as Sonic and brings to the forefront the character's good natured penchant for mischief and adventure that makes him such a fun protagonist. In many ways he still captures the attitudes carried from the decade of his introduction that could also be seen in similar properties like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Swat Kats, and many other properties from the era. While Sonic's attitude is definitely in line with his persona, the movie does a good job making him a character with depth. When we first see Sonic as a child it's in a flashback sequence on his home planet where a tribe of Echidnas (a reference to the lore of the games) tries to capture him and his Guardian, an Owl named Longclaw, is presumably killed in the process trying to help him escape to Earth. It's a really well done sequence that establishes the stakes quite well and creates a nice emotional core to build the movie around. We see Sonic's isolation as he hides from the sight of Green Hills' citizenry (save for a hermit who's the only one who knows Sonic exists but no one believes) and how he watches them from a far pretending to be friends with them and giving them nicknames like ""Donut Lord"" for Tom or ""Pretzel Lady"" for Tom's wife Maddie (Tika Sumpter). It's both a very funny and surprisingly sweet take on the character.The human characters in the movie are also quite good. Both Tom and Maddie are really sweet as a married couple and have great chemistry and comic timing together. Tom is also great as a foil for Sonic once the two end up teaming up together and is not only a well done proxy for the audience to get more well versed in Sonic's universe, but he's also a good man with ambition who genuinely wants to help people and feels like he can't do that in his job as a small town Sheriff. There's some really nice exchanges between Sonic and Tom as they go across country getting into various misadventures involving not just Robotnik's drones but also road movie trappings like tourist traps and tough bars that are one accident shove away from breaking into a full on fight. Which brings us to Dr. Robotnik. Jim Carrey is amazing as our villain. An arrogant misanthrope with a Superiority complex and a general contempt for all humanity, Carrey does an amazing job of bringing to life Robotnik. As the movie goes on he becomes more visually similar to his video game counter part in aesthetics, but even if he didn't it'd still be an amazing performance. Carrey's performance is somewhere between his performance as The RIddler from Batman Forever and the cable guy from The Cable Guy. It's not as silly as the riddler nor is it as creepy as the cable guy and strikes just the right note to make a threat but a very entertaining threat we love to hate.The plot of the movie is very standard fare as it plays like a PG version of the Simon Pegg/Nick Frost movie Paul as filtered through the lens of a lighter superhero movie like Deadpool or the Quicksilver scenes from the X-Men movies. In contrast to a lot of big budget movies with characters who are super powered, I liked how the climax and the movie as a whole was more dialed back in scale and scope and didn't rely on many trappings such as sky portals or citywide destruction and instead went a more personal route with its stakes. But while I personally liked the smaller scale approach to the material, I can imagine there will be others who will feel it wasn't an adequate pay off to what cam before.Sonic is not only a solid video game movie, it's a solid movie. It's well cast with charming leads, a really good performance by Jim Carrey as our villain, and fun and creative usage of Sonic's super speed that leads to both big laughs and exciting action sequences. while the movie follows a predictable path and some of the humor flirts with being juvenile, it's a solid film that can be enjoyed by most family members are will entertain both newcomers to the franchise and long time fans.*Also note there is post credit scene establishing potential threads for the sequel",Sonic the Hedgehog
77,jeremycrimsonfox,A Good Video Game Movie Where A Company Listens,9,16 February 2020,"Yeah, Sonic The Hedgehog's movie debut had a rocky start. Planned for release in November, it got delayed to Valentine's Day 2020 when the first trailer was met with backlash over Sonic's initial redesign for the film. Having seen it myself, I am happy to say this is a good video game movie.Basically, in this movie's universe, Sonic lives in the town of Green Hill, Montana, where he idolizes a cop named Tom Makowski. However, when Sonic causes a power outage that alerts the Pentagon, who is quick to summon Dr. Robotnik, the two are forced to team up to go to San Francisco to get a bag of magic rings Sonic was using to escape.The actors are great. James Marsden does a good job as Tom, and Tika Sumpter plays Maggie, his wife, but the actor who really takes the show is Jim Carrey, who portrays Dr. Robotnik. Jim is funny as the evil genius, who is working with the government to capture Sonic, as he has some comedic lines and even a dance scene. For the titular hedgehog, his voice and face are that of Ben Schwartz (a good voice actor who was in some good movies and TV shows) and I can say Ben brings an energetic personality to the blue blur to the point where I felt it was missing all these years.It's a good movie, with a good story, action, and if you're a longtime fan of the Sonic franchise, there are various little Easter Eggs to discover. This one, I hight recommend.",Sonic the Hedgehog
78,reddiemurf81,Donut Lord & Pretzel Lady,6,9 March 2021,One of the few times I agree with the ranking. I'd give this one a 6.5 all the way. Sonic and Jim Carrey as Robotnic were perfect imo.,Sonic the Hedgehog
79,one9eighty,"""Here we go"".... I mean ""Seeegggaaaah""",7,24 December 2020,"It's been a long time coming - ever since the 1990's brought us the first Hollywood game-to-film adaption with ""Super Mario Bros"" (1993), it was clear that their biggest rivals wouldn't be far behind. In actual fact, the biggest rival to Nintendo's mushroom stomping plumber in 1993 was Sega speedy blue hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog. Nobody knew that it would take 27 years for somebody to manage to get Sonic into a film.
With writing by Pat Casey and Josh Miller, this 2020 film is directed by Jeff Fowler. It stars James Marsden as Sheriff Tom, Tika Sumpter as his wife Maddie, Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, and the voice of Ben Schwartz bringing Sonic the hedgehog to life.The film acts as an origin story and is set up like various popular superhero films which have been released between 2015-2020. The action starts, then there is a freeze frame while the titular hero suggests a flashback to how it all started. At this point we see where Sonic comes from, how he ended up on Earth, and what he's been doing to survive. An event occurs which means that he has to come out of the shadows, at which point he strikes up a friendship with Sheriff Tom. They both get hunted by Dr. Robotnik and go on a journey of discovery while trying to survive.When I sat down to watch this film, I expected it to be a lot worse than it turned out to be. I knew there would be loads of CGI, I mean how else is a computer game character going to be brought to life? I just didn't hate the film like I expected to, even though the plot was absolutely predictable form start to finish. Maybe I was expecting the worst because I had seen the pre-release version of Sonic that had been leaked - the one with a weird face and scary teeth. Boy am I happy that the CGI and animation department went back to the drawing board on that one. It's not often fan backlash makes a studio rethink things as dramatically as happened with this film, but I am glad that it did, and if they can do that, then I can fore myself to sit in front of this regardless of any preconceptions I had.The acting was OK, like other parts of the film I had low expectations for this too. I feared it would be a cheesy and ham fest but I think James Marsden does a good job as a counter balance between the Sonic character, and the over-the-top acting of James Carey's Dr. Robotnik. In fact, the interactions between an animated character and the real actors worked quite well throughout, there were not many times that goofs occurred with hands in the wrong place or animation cells overlapping actors. There were one or two minor things that I spotted, but unless you go looking for it you aren't going to be let down too much. One goof I will mentioned, which is not directly because of animation or actors is to do with the car chase. One minute the road is wet, the next it is dry. Then when the car needs to skid it is wet, but a long shot shows it as dry again.Visually the film looks good, the early scenes on Sonic's home-world look authentic, and newer concepts that the film brings to the audience later in the film seem to fit good too. I was really happy with the musical score, in particularly I liked how it used the sound from the original Sega version of the Sonic game. In places it was as I remembered, and in other places it had been used as inspiration with new beats sandwiched around it. It worked.Although the plot was totally predictable this still turned out to be a fun family film. It had action and humour in it; there was a pantomime villain in Jim Carey; and there was a lovable rogue of a hero in it in the form of a smart-talking, dance-flossing, speedy blue hedgehog too. The world in which this was set was fun and appealing. There was tongue-in-cheek humour in it that poked fun at itself, TV shows, and other games (it even poked fun at the mario universe game and 1991 film too! How's that for console rivalry from the 90's!!). Expect to see a sequel within a year or two based on the strength of this and the expanse of source material available - as if the appearance of Miles Two-Tails at he end of the film isn't enough of a clue.Despite expecting to hate this film I actually enjoyed it and would happily recommend this to fans of the game, and families with young kids too.",Sonic the Hedgehog
80,rockman182,Sonic the Hedgehog (2020),7,16 February 2020,"This was meant to come out last year. That is, until it made waves for all the wrong reasons. There were massive complaints about the very humanoid design of Sonic the Hedgehog with many complaining he looked nothing like the character from the beloved SEGA game franchise. In a fairly unprecedented move, the studio decided to pull the movie back and redesign Sonic, while injecting more cash into the budget. Lo and behold they redesigned Sonic and he looks great, much like the video game character. However, the designs and graphics are one thing, how does the film fare up?The film is about Sonic, a hedgehog with super speed. He is hiding on Earth after being sent here with a magic golden ring that acts as a portal. While on Earth, he is revealed to an ambitious cop and they befriend each other. There is an issue though, as a scientific genius named Doctor Robotnik is recruited to investigate a mass power outage, which was initially caused by Sonic. Robitnik clashes with the pair and then makes it his job to capture Sonic.
I think instantly the film utilizes Jim Carrey brilliantly. This film absolutely allowed Carrey to be in his element, much like he was at the height of his career. Its tremendous, he's so outrageous and overacted that its such a fun portrayal. I thought the design for Sonic was good and finally resembled the likeness that we are used to. The film's plot falls into cliches and is nothing that has not bee explored before.
In fact I'd say portions of the plot are borrowed from other films, namely when time is slower relative to Sonic and he messes around with the environment of whats going on around him, which was blatantly done with Quicksilver in X-Men: Days of Future Past. The film is still good fun that the family will enjoy and stay tuned after the credits for a fan moment. I fully expect the film to become a series.

82,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A standard origin story with generic characters and jokes.,6,6 November 2020,"As someone who grew up with the original Sonic video games, I was highly skeptical of this film adaptation. There's not much plot behind a game that's basically: move right as fast as possible and defeat a robot-making madman. Granted, Sonic has developed a little more depth to its lore over the years...but not much. The appeal of the character in the '90s was his attitude, and I have to admit that his movie does capture that attitude quite well.For a video game adaptation, Sonic the Hedgehog (2020) isn't terrible, which is saying something. I can only imagine the nightmare-inducing original design for Sonic, though. However, it's still not the greatest movie ever for the genre of video game adaptations. I did appreciate the little ""slow-motion"" moments, as well as the practical use of the rings as teleportation devices. Jim Carrey's Dr. Robotnik was passable, if not a little too goofy/sinister at times. This movie probably won't age well, though, as there are plenty of cultural references included in it-not all of which are directly linked to the source material.What really gets me about this film was how generic it felt. All the major plot points, characters, and jokes felt like the same tropes I'd expect of any other ""an alien coming to Earth and learning to live with/save its inhabitants"" plotline. For my money, I'd probably watch Bumblebee (2018) again instead. Of course, many of these problems stem from the ""origin story"" trope that all these franchises feel they need to produce to get those who aren't ""in the know"" to understand their franchise moving forward.A standard origin story with generic characters and jokes, I give Sonic the Hedgehog 3.0 stars out of 5.",Sonic the Hedgehog
83,RforFilm,"It's collected enough rings! Sonic the Hedgehog may be predictable, but it's character, Jim Carrey and attention to the games detail make it fun",7,20 February 2020,"If you were a child of the 1990's like I was, then you were well aware of the business competition between Nintendo and Sega. The video game industry was still new, and no one knew if this was going to last. I'll say now that I was a Nintendo kid, and I had always been the one to rent the latest Mario game or fighting over whose turn with the Super Nintendo. Because of this, I didn't get much of a chance to play with the Sega Genesis. If there was something I was familiar with, was their mascot Sonic the Hedgehog.Even though Mario is a well established mascot and character of Nintendo, Sonic gained a lot of popularity for having a more developed personality. If Mario was the classical jazz character, then Sonic would be the punk rock character, as he was more cocky, confident, and more quick to action. This had allowed him to get several cartoons and a comic series, but there had been no attempt at a movie adaptation. I don't blame Sega as the track record for video game movies has been spotty as best. So let's see what a live action Sonic the Hedgehog can bring to the table.Teenage Sonic the Hedgehog (played by Ben Schwartz) has been living in Green Hills, Montana ever since he was sent from his world to Earth as a child from his caregiver. He's filled his time with reading comics, playing games, and pretending he's a part of the family of local sheriff Tom Wachowski (played by James Marsden) and his wife Maddie (played by Tika Sumpter). He manages to remain low profile until he ends up running around at a speed so fast that he causes a major blackout, sending word for the US Government to respond.They call upon a mad, but intelligent scientist Dr. Robotnik (played by Jim Carrey) to investigate with his machines. Sonic attempts to escape Earth using his precious rings, but is discovered by Tom and shot with a tranquilizer. This causes the rings to be teleported to San Francisco without Sonic and the hedgehog has no idea how to get there. Tom agrees to take him there and the two end up on a road trip. As Robotnik realizes what he's chasing, he becomes obsessed with getting Sonic's power. It's here where Sonic and Dr. Robotnik develop the classic hero/villain storyline famous from the video game.As far as video game adaptations go, Sonic the Hedgehog was an enjoyable family film. Whether or not your going to like this movie depends on what your looking for. My guess is that given the updated design (which caused a slight uproar that got the movie delayed three months to redesign Sonic), most people are going to get what they expect. It's not a story within the world of Sonic and the game. It's rather Sonic on earth and going through a lot of family film tropes like the road trip, fish out of water, and learning about the importance of family. For most, including me, that was enough.If there's something great I can say about Sonic the Hedgehog, it was made by people who understand the character and the potential it has. There are a lot of Easter eggs related to the game and they take a lot of advantage of the fact he's fast. They even try to explain why Sonic doesn't just run to San Francisco, which I won't spoil. Having said that, the story can be kind of predictable if you've seen this kind of story before. Again, I think the personality of Sonic is what helps carry everything.Ben Schwartz has the right voice for Sonic, giving him more of a teenage, naive persona that I think a lot of kids will relate to. James Marsden does fine as the human lead, but as I expected, Jim Carrey steels a lot of the movie. He's just as manic and hyper as he was in Ace Ventura or The Mask. Seeing him back on the big screen makes me realize how much I missed him as a regular presence within the movies.I'll give this seven Sonic rings out of ten. It's obvious that if you don't like or care for Sonic the Hedgehog games, then this is not your movie. It may not have the expansive fantasy worlds a lot, but I think this movie makes the right steps for setting up future movies. Even on it's own, it's still likable enough that families will like it.

85,eminkl,I would recommend it to mostly everyone but mainly kids,6,22 April 2020,"I surprisingly I liked this more than I thought I would have because I haven't really watched any sonic or played any sonic. I love Jim Carrey in this movie and he is my favorite part about this movie and you can tell he is having such a fun time in this movie. He has two Quick Silver scenes when are some of my favorite moments of the year so far and the sequences are amazing. This movie is more of a kid-friendly movie and you can expect that will a character like this and isn't really surprising. They are going to do a sequel and they do, do a post-credit scene like the MCU which I don't really like but some will but I didn't. They have some solid acting and the voice acting from Ben Schwartz is very good. The animation and CGI is one of my favorite things about 2020 so far. Like I said the action sequences are amazing and they are some of my favorite moments of 2020 so far and the QuickSilver scenes are some of my favorites of 2020. James Marsden and Ben Schwartz chemistry work so well and it is mostly entertaining. It is kid-friendly which means it will have the cliche poop jokes and they do and almost all of the jokes are kid-friendly and most jokes I didn't laugh at and the jokes were just bland and cliche. This is a very cliche movie and you have all of the cliches from every movie and it is annoying at times. The script is bad and the character development is there but they didn't flesh the characters out enough and that means I didn't really care for anyone besides Sonic.",Sonic the Hedgehog
86,Anurag-Shetty,Lots of fun.,8,2 March 2020,"Sonic the Hedgehog is a feature film adaptation of the video game series developed by Sega. When police officer Tom Wachowski(James Marsden) meets a wise-cracking & incredibly fast hedgehog named Sonic(Ben Schwartz), they should join forces to take down the evil yet genius megalomaniac, Dr. Ivo Robotnik(Jim Carrey).Sonic the Hedgehog is a superb movie. Director Jeff Fowler has given us a faithful adaptation of the Sonic video games and television shows. The action set pieces are fantastic. The visual effects are awesome. The CGI-animated Sonic is top-notch. Kudos to the producers, the director & the animators for being faithful to Sonic's original design than the cringe-worthy 'live-action' take on the iconic character, as seen in the very first trailer. The only flaw is, the jokes get a tad bit repetitive after a while. Ben Schwartz is outstanding as Sonic's voice. Schwartz's unique voice is perfect for Sonic. James Marsden is brilliant as Tom Wachowski. Jim Carrey is spectacular as Dr. Ivo Robotnik. Carrey's mannerisms, gestures, one-liners & antics are the stars of the show. Tika Sumpter is excellent as Maddie Wachowski. The supporting cast is impressive. Sonic the Hedgehog is a must watch for the entire family. Race to a theater near you!",Sonic the Hedgehog

91,kjproulx,A Harmless Good Time,7,1 April 2020,"Aside from maybe 2018's version of Tomb Raider or Pokemon: Detective Pikachu, most films based on video games either terribly miss the mark or bomb at the box office. Although the video game industry is booming and probably always will be, the need for game-to-film adaptations doesn't seem to have any benefit for movie studios. That's a pretty sad truth because movies like Sonic The Hedgehog deserve some recognition. Now, this film is far from great, but in terms of adapting a video game, this may just be the best one yet.Having to flee from his homeworld via a teleportation ring, a fast, blue hedgehog by the name of Sonic ends up on Earth at a very young age. Having to fend for himself for many years, he eventually is hunted by a mad scientist and befriended by a man named Tom (James Marsden). Their bond has them eventually working together against the evil Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey). This movie is less like the video game and more of a ""What If?"" scenario for the character of Sonic. Personally, I found myself attached to the story and many of the elements made it an even more enjoyable experience.Where this movie shines the most is the fact that they made such a likable feature film version of Sonic. Ben Schwartz does a great job voicing him and James Marsden did such a great job playing off a character that wasn't even there. Normally, scenarios like this seem cheap and laughable, but the bond between the two felt pretty real, even if Sonic didn't feel all that real. On top of their bond, the threat of Jim Carrey's Dr. Robotnik was a blast to witness. Although he is tamed down for kids, which is who this whole movie is really aimed at, he delivers a fun performance that felt like he was channelling his 1990's roots.if you stick around to catch a scene in the mid-credits at the end, you'll see that they're planning on expanding this world in future installments and I really hope they do. This film was a nice little story, that also nicely set up a sequel I would gladly see. Yes, this movie was missing all the other classic Sonic characters, but this was also a nice move, saving the fan service stuff for later. For kids, adults, and fans of the video games, there's a lot to enjoy here, but it's also nothing you haven't already seen, so keep that in mind.In the end, Sonic The Hedgehog delivers a fun experience for all ages. The story is something you've already seen in nearly every movie that involves a character coming to Earth from another world, but that doesn't mean it still can't be effective. This is a heartwarming story of the bond between a human and an alien essentially, but it's different enough. I'm normally not someone who champions for a sequel to be immediately made for a film, but I believe this one was good enough to deserve another go around. If you're looking for a harmless good time, Sonic The Hedgehog may just fit that description for you.",Sonic the Hedgehog

94,msbreviews,Everything Sonic-related is fantastic. Everything else... not really.,5,5 April 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Sonic the Hedgehog was one of my Most Anticipated Movies of 2020, not because I expected it to be one of the best films of the year, but due to the controversy that surrounded it. The original design of Sonic was awful, and a lot of people still blame the VFX artists/animators unfairly. These people work extra hours, they're underpaid, and they were given an impossible schedule to deliver a masterful work. Fortunately, most people now recognize that the studio and all of its execs are the ones to blame.The Internet voiced its opinion in a very polite manner (as usual), but this time, an unprecedented event occurred: the studio actually listened and decided to delay the movie until Sonic received a better treatment visually. Now, I firmly believe that, in any other case, this would be extremely dangerous. I don't think the audience should have this much power over the studios, especially through social media. I mean, if studios changed their films every time people criticized a design or an adaptation decision, movies would be constantly delayed. However...In this particular case, I'm super glad they did it. One question a lot of people might ask is, ""how would this film perform with the old design?"". It would be horrible. There's absolutely no chance of people enjoying this movie with the previous Sonic. This new design not only honors the character's visuals, but it complements the film's tone. Jim Carrey delivers an incredibly cartoonish performance, which would become way too out-of-place if Sonic looked (awfully) real. Having both the hero and villain being/acting like a cartoon, that awkwardness doesn't exist.Sonic truly is the best part of the whole thing. If you've played the games and if you carry an emotional connection to this character, there are tons of scenes for you to enjoy. Sonic looks wonderful, sounds fantastic (excellent voice work from Ben Schwartz), and best of all, his personality resembles the videogame character. Everything that's directly Sonic-related is perfectly faithful to the source material, which will definitely please every Sonic fan. That's pretty much my main message: if you're a fan of the little blue guy, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed.Unfortunately, he's honestly the only great aspect of the movie. It's really cool to watch Jim Carrey going back to his roots and having so much fun with his role. However, he's very hit-and-miss. When he's condescending someone, he's quite funny, but Carrey's mannerisms don't always work. Still, once again, I believe he's very faithful to the original Dr. Robotnik, who was by no means a ""normal"" person. James Marsden is really good as Tom, but his character never goes beyond ""Sonic's pal"".My main issues are regarding the screenplay. No, I never expected it to be an Oscar-worthy narrative. I just wanted a simple story that allowed Sonic to shine, and in the film's defense, it's indeed a basic plot. However, the sheer abundance of cliches, the lack of any surprises, and the logical questions raised by some narrative decisions are too much to handle, in my opinion. There are three product placement scenes that are some of the laziest, obvious, cringe-worthy examples since the Transformers' movies. It feels like the film stops to have a few commercials.Subplots that serve as tension-building during the movie fail to have a resolution by the end. Storylines that were once important are entirely forgotten and never addressed again. Every single character serves as comic-relief, everyone gets to be the ""clown"". I repeat: I never expected a brilliant screenplay. But is it too much to ask the writers to have as much dedication and creativity as the VFX artists who handled Sonic? The latter group worked like crazy to deliver a perfect design. Why can't the writers try harder to offer a more compelling, unique, and rational story?The way Dr. Robotnik comes into play and the level of permission he has to do whatever he desires to is laughable. Everything human-related raises too many eyebrows and rolls too many eyes. I've commented about the film online, and some people addressed me by saying, ""you're overanalyzing /you're expecting too much from it"". I wholeheartedly understand these observations, I genuinely do. The thing is: I don't believe I'm overthinking, let alone expecting it to be a masterpiece. Why should people simply accept that a movie ""can't be better than what it is""? Why can't people ask for the potential that a Sonic film has? Why should I be content that it's ""not bad""?I'm completely honest: I wanted to like this movie way more than most people. The whole controversy concerning Sonic's design and the unfair blame that the VFX artists received, left me with an overwhelming desire to absolutely love this film, so I could support the massive work that these people went through. I love everything that's Sonic-related in the movie. His design, voice, and personality are spot-on, and I can't imagine a single fan of the little blue hedgehog being disappointed. However, even with a really good cast and a 90s' Jim Carrey, Sonic the Hedgehog is packed with extreme cliches and narrative decisions that roll too many eyes. Some of the most obvious and cringe-worthy product placement since Michael Bay's Transformers. Characters built from Hollywood's recycling box and side stories are thrown away with no resolution. It's a fun adventure that any family can enjoy on a Sunday afternoon, but I can't lie to myself: I wish it could have been more entertaining and less frustrating story-wise.Rating: C+",Sonic the Hedgehog

96,SoumikBanerjee25,"Sonic As a Character, Shines!",6,10 June 2020,"Video Game Adaptations have come a long way! They aren't meant to be failures everytime! Contrary to popular belief they sometimes do turn out to be Pretty Decent. That's exactly the case with 'Sonic the Hedgehog'! Filled with lots of fun, energy and entertainment; most of you would have a good time with it. The Writing may not be its strongest point but It does keep us engaged throughout the entirety. Perhaps the characterization is the main reason behind that. They have been done fantastically well. Jim Carrey as Doc. Robotnik steals the show as you would have normally expected. Ben Schwartz, who Voiced Sonic did a commendable job as well. The most highlighting part would be the Character of Sonic himself. Full of special abilities, an enthusiastic otherworldly creature who just wanna be friends with someone. Even with a greater power in hand; he seeks to lead a normal life. Personally I love what they did with him. Apart from these two; others Haven't been that meaningful for me. Underwhelmed honestly. Coming to the technicalities, CGI & Art department have massively rectified their mistakes regarding some horrible choice of Character designs and opted for a total make-over after recieving several backlashes from the Social Media people. Great to see the professionalism from them though. Sound score, was just functional; could have been better. The Storyline has this 90's charm and cornyness that might feel nostalgic to some; bothersome to the others. Overall a generic Sci Fi/Video Game movie that heavily relies on Character writings and Visual Imagery rather than protruding attentiveness towards a compact storyline. I hope they do make improvisations in the coming sequel. Keeping my Hopes on the higher side.",Sonic the Hedgehog

He's a blue hedgehog creature with huge eyes! I mean, maybe babies or children who watch this movie won't be bothered by the complete lack of realism, but I'm an adult and I was bothered by it. The civilians in this movie are like: ""Oh, there's a blue hedgehog creature... that's totally normal!""Apart from that, the acting is ok and the pacing it good... the CGI is very good (thanks to the huge budget of this movie)... but overall it's nothing special or amazing when compared to other live-action movies such as ""Ready Player One"" for instance...

99,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,14 February 2020,"Sonic's first live-action film has taken an interesting journey in the past few months leading up to its theatrical debut. After a readjustment of expectations with the new design of the digital protagonist and a series of crazy interviews by Jim Carrey, who plays the villain Robotnik / Eggman, it no longer mattered if the film would continue to break the curse of game adaptations in the face of immense curiosity aroused .Now that Sonic: The Movie hits the big screen, it can be said that the result is much more digestible than expected from a game movie or the wrong materials revealed to the public over the past year. In a way, the opening of viewers to films with more unusual heroes - Rocket and Groot from The Guardians of the Galaxy - or projects that bet on the visual strangeness of game concepts - Jumanji, Detective Pikachu - prepared their palates for this film.The result arrives exactly according to the order, slightly beyond the expectations of this type of film and within the parameters created by the most recent game adaptations, however it does not do much more than that. Just like the last cinematic foray of Tomb Raider, starring Alicia Vikander, aimed at ""not bad"" and hit its target successfully, the blue hedgehog film accommodates itself within a formulaic mold of the fugitive alien film, without taking great risks , but doing it well.His simple plot does enough to recreate familiar symbols for game fans and present the two most prominent figures in the franchise: Sonic (Ben Schwartz in the original and Manolo Rey in our language), the fugitive hero with a radiant attitude, and Eggman (Carrey ), the chasing villain armed with deadly machines. Their presence is justified in the world of margarine commercials where the rest of the humans live, including the kind policeman Tom Wachowski (James Marsden), without being too out of line for nonsense and breaches in logic.Still, the script by Patrick Casey and Josh Miller proves to be the most disappointing aspect for barely enjoying the rest of the universe established in the games, focusing more on the simple relationship of prey and hunter that sets up between Sonic and Eggman than bringing up their contexts. This constitutes a hit by covering the appeal of the production to children who do not know the games, but for the players and fans, the project ends up sounding too shy in the way it incorporates the elements of the source material, reserving the most direct connections with the games for the introduction and the epilogue.If the plot conceived here does not mark or instigate adaptation, at least simplicity serves a very agile rhythm and, again, an easy digestion. Even risking falling into visual excesses and delivering visually noisy action sequences, Oscar-nominated director Jeff Fowler conceives Sonic's skills on screen with prowess and a clear geography for the pursuits, as well as finding a productive middle ground for digital effects - neither cartoonish nor simple-minded to create a match with live-action images.It is a pity that Fowler has space to orchestrate only a limited number of these frantic situations, since they all have such care and fluidity in their execution. However, the filmmaker compensates for the intervals between the great action scenes with a confident handling of the dialogues between Sonic and Tom and visual humor, as in the bar fight and the sequence of gags in the house of the policeman's sister-in-law, moments that vary from more effects. sophisticated slow motion to simple assembly ideas.By the way, the cast is still committed to the tone of the work, similar to that of a Hanna-Barbera animation. Evoking a bit of the work of Roger Craig Smith, Sonic's most famous voice actor in the Games, while also presenting something of his own, Schwartz perfectly captures the hedgehog's youthful essence. Marsden, for his part, is surprisingly charming, while Tika Sumpter and Adam Pally have good moments of comic delivery in the way they react to the absurdities that occur.Jim Carrey, on the other hand, is more like an elevated version of himself than Eggman, who is undeveloped beyond the role of Coyote for Sonic's Road Runner. Leaving this aside, however, Carrey delivers exactly what is expected of him at this advanced point in his career, making his weirdness a spice for most of his conventional scenes. We've seen villains like this many times before, but we've seen few in this specific key the actor turns on - his evil dance to the sound of Where Evil Grows is one of the highlights.At this point in the adaptations of games to the big screen, one can feel that mere competence is enough when the result does not reach the abysmal levels to which one is accustomed, and in that Sonic: The Film may end up being celebrated as one of the best films of games made so far. But despite the effective direction and harmonized cast with the tone of the material, one feels that something was missing to consider it a handful success, with an outcome that is quickly satisfied with hooks and promises for a possible second film.While the debate about its positioning within the pantheon of game films should last for a few months, one thing is certain: the long blue hedgehog is like a safe and reasonably fast-paced game, without risking many tricks but also without losing many of its rings in the process.I liked this criticism of Observatório do CinemaFilm seen on February 13, 2020",Sonic the Hedgehog
100,RussHog,Obnoxious,1,12 February 2021,Sonic the Hedgehog is a bad kid's movie. A bad video game movie. And a bad Jim Carrey movie. It's not funny. Or memorable.,Sonic the Hedgehog
101,MrDHWong,A fast-moving adventure (obviously) that should entertain newcomers and keep fans of the original series satisfied,7,13 February 2020,"Sonic The Hedgehog is an action comedy movie based on the SEGA video game series of the same name. Starring James Marsden and Jim Carrey, it is a fast-moving adventure (obviously) that should entertain newcomers and keep fans of the original series satisfied.In the small town of Green Hills, Montana, a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) lives in hiding after being forced out of his original dimension due to his powers of super speed. After accidentally causing a blackout throughout the whole area, Sonic attracts the attention of Dr. Ivo Robotnik (Jim Carrey), an eccentric evil genius whom the government has hired to track Sonic down for experimental purposes. Now on the run once again, Sonic enlists the help of local police officer Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) to aid him in avoiding capture and hopefully make a new friend in the process.Even if you aren't a hardcore fan of the series, Sonic The Hedgehog provides a nice amount of fun action and quirky humour to draw in even the most casual of moviegoer. I myself was a Nintendo kid growing up, preferring to play as the Italian plumber instead of the blue hedgehog, but SEGA and their mascot character always had my respect for being worthy rivals during the video game wars of the 90s, and the same can be said for this. In fact, this film seems to strongly acknowledge Sonic's 1990s roots, from his love of chili dogs to listening to music on a boombox. Of course, there are some references to modern trends but they are kept to a minimum likely so that the film will age better.Jeff Fowler, who makes his directorial debut for a feature film, does a fine job juggling his storytelling duties with showing off some solid special effects along the way, especially on Sonic himself. It is well known by now that Sonic's original design for this film was poorly received by the public so it was decided that his overall look would be changed. This worked well in the film's favour as not only does he better resemble his video game self, but he even feels more naturally integrated into the real world. We watch as Sonic dashes around causing mischief and escaping danger through different environments like the big city or the quiet countryside, deriving enjoyment along the way. This led to some amusing Quicksilver/Deadpool-esque moments which provided great comic relief during several action scenes.Comedian Ben Schwartz was a great pick to provide the voice and motion-capture of Sonic himself, both emanating the character's trademark cocky attitude while also showcasing his loneliness and longing for true friendship. This, in turn, makes him more relatable to the audience and causes him to have more human traits than some of the actual people in the film. James Marsden also gave a likeable performance as Tom Wachowski, not merely being relegated to the straight man role but also having his fair share of funny moments as well. However, it is Jim Carrey who steals the show as Dr. Robotnik. I'm not sure whether it was seeing how perfectly tailored the character was to his comedic talents or if it was just how nostalgic it felt to see him acting like his over-the-top 90s self again, but virtually everything he said and did had me laughing out loud. I hope we will see more of Carrey's portrayal of the character in the near future, which reportedly he has expressed interest in doing.In the end, even though the film isn't groundbreaking by any means, it still provides much needed entertainment thanks to its respectful take on the source material that, like POKÉMON Detective Pikachu before it, definitely feels more like how video games should be handled for the big screen treatment. There is certainly potential for other game franchises to be adapted into movies with a similar style and it is starting to feel as though the ""video game curse"" may be fading away altogether. There are two bonus mid-credit scenes worth staying back for, and while they aren't of Masahiro Sakurai approaching Sonic about the Smash initiative, they should excite fans of the series just as much.I rate it 7/10",Sonic the Hedgehog
102,cardsrock,Redemption,7,10 March 2020,"I have to give the studio credit, they actually listened to the fan backlash over Sonic's design and redesigned his character with great success. Sonic looks significantly better and he is definitely the best part of the film. He's very endearing and frequently very funny. Jim Carrey gets to ham it up and shows off the trademark entertaining exuberance that made him famous.The story is pretty typical alien meets human and human protects alien from government trying to experiment on him. It definitely leans more towards children, but there are some amusing moments for adults as well. Sonic the Hedgehog is ultimately a fun family film that ends up being a lot better than most of us would have expected.",Sonic the Hedgehog

104,elicopperman,Decent Attempt at the Blue Hedgehog's Entrance on the Big Screen,6,14 February 2021,"As far back as the late 2010s, there had been an announcement of a movie starring the all popular video game character, Sonic the Hedgehog, and the plan was to make it a half live-action half CGI origin story with the titular character. Despite not being well received upon its first teaser trailer and being delayed from November 2019 to February of 2020, the film was ultimately a smash hit when it was finally released, and has even spawned a potential franchise. So now that it's been precisely a year since the film's release, how well does it hold up now post the beginning of the pandemic?The main story follows Sonic the Hedgehog, an altar dimensional being who can run at abnormal speed. Upon meeting local town sheriff Tom Wachowski to find his lost rings, they also have to fend themselves against the mad scientist, Dr. Robotnik, who plans to use Sonic's powers for world domination. Right off the bat, the story conceptually isn't all that original, and considering that a lot of live-action movies based on cartoon or video game characters tend to rely heavily on this formulated plot, there are few surprises along the film's journey. While the idea to make Sonic interact with another human could work in its own right, and he and Tom do have some decent chemistry with each other, Tom's character overall is a little too pompous for his own good to the point where Sonic becomes the more relatable one of the two. Also, a lot of the humor in the movie is rather hit or miss, with some of his feeling authentic to the surroundings that Tom and Sonic venture off to, while others are just gimmicky and low brow. Maybe it would have been better if they just embraced a more goofy tone.However, despite the movie's weak plot, it is at least very faithful to the video games it spawned, down to the mythos of the rings Sonic uses to travel from world to world. Considering the vast amount of games Sonic has been in over the past 30 years, it all makes sense for this movie to go back to basics and simply establish who Sonic is and what his purpose is to run so fast. In fact, Sonic himself is a generally likable character with some snappy one liners and a charming vocal performance from Ben Schwartz, plus the movie helps provide enough pathos for the guy's origins and desire for a family to make us connect with the guy. But the real show stealer in the movie is none other than Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, who not only goes back to his 90s goofball schtick for the guy, but is practically living up every moment playing this delusioned and scientist out to take over the speedy hedgehog with unearthly powers. Even in a movie that might not have much to offer substance wise, the titular character and primary antagonist are what it memorable.Now it's time to address the white elephant in the room: the design and animation of Sonic himself, which is what caused the movie to be delayed from the start. Unlike the original design which was a horrific attempt at making the blue hedgehog more realistic, the final design in the movie is a lot more simplified and exaggerated, down to where he resembles the general modern design (only more spikes and blue arms). With that all said, not only is his design very visually appealing, but the motion is pretty decent as far as realistic toons go, thus making Sonic's interactions with real people look a lot more genuine than most hybrid movies. Speaking of the visuals, the effects team showcased their talents the most during the action sequences, displaying a lot of highly coordinated action and boldly shot cinematography. Even the music score by Tom Holkenborg is pretty fun from time to time, although nowhere near as delightful as the Speed Me Up end credits song by Wiz Khalifa. One must wonder how so much hard earned work might have not happened had the film not been postponed.Compared to most video game movies out there, Sonic the Hedgehog might be one of the better ones. Sure its story and side characters might not be the most thrilling, but the main protagonist and antagonist, fun action packed tone, and cool looking visual effects do make the film decent enough of a watch for the whole family. It's debatable if this movie will please every Sonic fan out there, but as far as introducing a new generation to the character, this one might actually be a promising contender. So this Valentines Day, why not give this film a watch? It might burn you up to the speed of sound.",Sonic the Hedgehog
105,rdoubleoc,Not bad.,7,10 April 2020,"For a videogame movie, it's actually pretty good. As a movie in general, it's not bad either.I feel like some of the animation was a little on the cheap side for some reason -- mainly Sonic himself doesn't look that real (not like the animal characters in Guardians of the Galaxy, for example).Jim Carrey playing Dr. Robotnik is a nice fit. I feel he really plays the part well. I bet a lot of kids could probably identify with the personality he portrays in his character, and he does a good job of portraying that type of personality (how he loves his technology more than people, etc.). I can't think of anyone better for this role.The story I feel fell a little short, and the best part was actually the few minutes at the end. I won't spoil it for anyone who reads this, but it left me wanting a second part of this movie more than I wanted this first part (no offense to this movie, though).",Sonic the Hedgehog
106,ronakkotian,One of the better video game films,5,22 February 2020,"When I saw the original trailer of Sonic the Hedgehog, I became ANGRY! The first look of Sonic nearly ruined my childhood and proved to me that video game films are just a bad idea. Thankfully, the design has been restored to look much better but that doesn't change the overall film.Sonic the Hedgehog is about a police officer who helps Sonic escape from the evil Dr. Robotnik.This movie actually turned out to be better than expected. To be fair, I did keep my expectations really low after witnessing the horrendous trailer but I did not hate the film altogether. It's definitely not as bad as previous video game films like Mortal Kombat, Pixels or Super Mario Bros. but it's not anything special. The actual story is really basic, predictable and filled with clichés but at the same time the film is entertaining at times. The chase scenes with Sonic and Robotnik are fun to watch. Some of the jokes are funny but a lot of them don't land. The film also has absurd product placement. There are two scenes where the film randomly promotes Olive Garden. It felt really weird to me.I have to praise Jeff Fowler for deciding to change the design of Sonic. It showed to me that he cared a lot about this movie and wanted people to have a good time at the theatres. The visual effects are great. It must have been a pain for the animators to redesign Sonic in every scene he is in but it definitely paid off. If there is one thing I can credit this film for, is the amount of effort that went into the production.The acting was fine for the most part. James Marsden did okay. There were times where his acting didn't work for me and his relationship with Tika Sumpter didn't seem natural. It felt great to see Jim Carrey on the big screen after a long time. He performs his over the top style once again and looks like he's having a lot of fun with his role. Despite that, I did not fully see Dr. Robotnik in him.Surprisingly, Sonic the Hedgehog wasn't that bad. It does have its flaws and is a film I will probably forget in a while but is nowhere near as terrible as other video game films. This movie does cater to younger audiences and I feel they will enjoy this thoroughly.",Sonic the Hedgehog
107,Azanspy,A decent family movie.,6,18 March 2020,"I expected Sonic to be bombed and really bad movie. I'm pretty much satisfied about the end product as I got a decent entertainer that you can watch with your family. The visual effects were sometimes good and sometimes just okay. I'm not still satisfied with Sonic's design but it was acceptable. Jim Carrey is back at what he does best and it was fun watching a role like this for Jim Carrey after a long time. Ben Schwartz also did a good job. Overall, Sonic The Hedgehog is a decent watchable entertainer.",Sonic the Hedgehog
108,trinaboice,"Supersonic fun and entertaining, even for people who aren't fans!",10,14 February 2020,"Super fun. Super sonic. The popular, blue hedgehog is back! SONIC THE HEDGEHOG is a live-action comedy adventure based on the video game franchise from Sega. I was pleasantly surprised because this fun family film is much better than I expected it to be. Movies based on video games are notoriously bad, so I'm happy to announce that this one breaks that unfortunate mold! The design team seems to really know and love Sonic, carefully including lots of details that Sonic fans will enjoy.
I watched the movie with a guy who does video game reviews on YouTube named Lynn Hunsaker, so I was really curious to see what he was going to think of the movie. When I asked him what he was hoping to see in the film before it started, he said he really wanted to hear the famous name yelled out like in the video game: Sega! Sadly, they didn't do that. Even still, after the movie, his one word to describe the movie was ""Phenomenal!"" That's a really strong recommendation from a gamer! His YouTube channel is called ""blue ranger power.""
Mega fans and the original designer of Sonic (Naoto Ohshima) absolutely hated the way Sonic looked in the first trailer that was released last year. Because of their outrage, a new design was created and the film's release was postponed. The good news is that you don't have to be familiar with any of the Sonic video games to be completely entertained.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Biracial, married couple
No profanity, but the word ""sucks"" is used.
Fart noises, which made the kids in the audience laugh every time.
Talk of formula vs. breastfeeding
Despite the movie being a PG film, there is an extensive bar scene with alcohol, bad behavior, and a big bar fight.
Explosions, destruction
People in perilous situations
Some of the humor for adults is pushing the edge for what should be in a PG film.
THINGS I LIKED:
After a long list of A-list actors were considered to voice Sonic, the winner for the role was chosen: Ben Schwartz. He does a great job with the voice and keeps the energy up throughout the entire film.
I've always really loved James Marsden ever since I first saw him in Enchanted and Hairspray (2007) when they both hit theaters the same year in 2007. This is actually his third live action/animation hybrid film, along with Hop He's really good at acting to CGI characters, which is probably why he was selected to play the leading human role.
Rumor has it that Jim Carrey wanted to be in this movie because his daughter has been a big fan of the SONIC video games for years. He's described by Sonic as a ""mad man with a mustache from the Civil War."" My video gamer friend told me that Dr. Robotnik is supposed to be very serious and bad, so he didn't like Jim Carrey's comic spin on the role, but I liked it. Rather than playing a one-note villain, he brings some backstory motivation to his character that is entertaining and allows him to go all in in classic Jim Carrey style. I also thought his villain gloves and gadgets were super cool.
You get to see Sonic when he was a little kid and when his furry body gets all wet, both adorable.
I loved the scene with Sonic and the turtle. I had 3 pet turtles, so it made me laugh out loud.
Lots of fun, upbeat music.
Lots of humor for adults and kids with witty dialogue.
There's a really funny slow-motion scene in a bar. That kind of action has been done better in other movies, but I was still completely entertained.
For Sonic fans, there are some respectful nods to the video game, like talk of flying eggs, and lots of other hidden Easter eggs.
You get to travel around the world to see sites in Paris, Egyptian pyramids, the Great Wall of China, and San Francisco.
Lots of physical comedy. Parents and kids laughed every time Sonic ""flossed.""
Definitely keep watching during the rolling credits at the end of the movie for a fun cameo surprise at about the mid-credit spot. I also really like how they turned scenes from the movie into what looked like video game footage during the closing credits. Unfortunately, there is nothing else at the very, very end of the credits.
Tim Miller, who made the first Deadpool, is a producer in this film, so some people are calling this new SONIC film a type of Deadpool for kids because of the snarky, edgy humor, and breaking of the 4th wall.
The visual effects team, Blur Studio, did a really great job with CGI.
THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The movie doesn't use any of the current cast from the Sonic video games that have been used since 2010 at Studiopolis. Too bad.
Sooooo many shout-outs to companies that it just feels like a blatant cash grab: Olive Garden, Amazon, Optical Illusions eyewear store, and Comic-Con. There are also shout-outs for movies and actors like Charlotte's Web (2006) , Men In Black, The Rock, and Vin Diesel..
I didn't care for Natash Rothwell's character. She was always ripping on James Marsden's character and encouraged her sister to divorce him. She overreacted to everything and was more annoying than funny, but the audience liked her.
Some fake CGI moments.
It would have been more fun to go on more stops during the road trip.You can watch my movie review on the Movie Review Mom YouTube channel or on my MovieReviewMom website. Thanks! I think you'll really enjoy this film!",Sonic the Hedgehog
109,dilipbts,Sonic the hedgehog,7,27 May 2021,"Honestly this was a movie I was never really planning to see. I thought it was another cash grab at our nostalgia. But when the initial trailer came out with the original sonic, I partook in the hilarious and frightening memes and joined in on the criticism. When I found out that they were redesigning Sonic due to the backlash - I was shocked. I never thought a studio would listen to our voice, and oh was our voice heard.So after I saw the second trailer I thought to myself, well, I guess I gotta go see it now. ""Put your money where your mouth is."" If the studio took the time to do this for us then I will gladly pay my money to see this.And I'm glad I did. It's a fun movie. It's not perfect by any means, but it's an enjoyable film for the family. I love the new Sonic, I love the cast, Jim Carrey is spectacular as always. It was a fun movie from start to finish. And it was really entertaining. I love the voice character for Sonic too, I think he fit perfectly. I would've given it a 7/10 but like I mentioned before, an extra star for caring about the fans and the audience.",Sonic the Hedgehog
110,auuwws,Sonic the Hedgehog,7,6 December 2020,Very interesting movie. The character of Sonic was fun and the character of the Sheriff and his wife was bad. Jim Carrey was the best person in the movie. Sonic was perfect and much better than the first show I recommend watching,Sonic the Hedgehog
111,drewnes,"""Gotta go fast!""",7,30 May 2021,"I am not sure how to say this... but I actually had fun watching this movie. With all the negative feedback about the CGI last year (and rightfully so), they actually changed his design to a more classic look, so I decided to give it a chance.Keeping in mind that this is a kids movie, it has heart! Ben Schwartz did a good job being the annoying hedgehog that struggles with being lonely, and Jim Carrey is classic 90's Jim.",Sonic the Hedgehog
112,bgar-80932,About what you expect,5,11 April 2021,"This wasn't a terrible movie and it didn't really have any lulls so the 5 star rating might be confusing. Overall it just did about exactly what I thought it would and that's okay for a family movie but that doesn't mean it's good. The cop was probably the best part in the movie, he was fairly likable. Jim Carey as Dr. Eggman kinda sucked imo. He wasn't funny and he wasn't very evil. He was eccentric which I guess is the villains thing but I dont know about the casting there.",Sonic the Hedgehog
113,ououzaza,Everything is so simple.,6,1 March 2020,"The plot is simple, the story is not that good either.

114,The_Light_Triton,Where was this movie when my 10 year old self needed it?,8,15 February 2020,"""Video games don't translate well to movies"" has been the case since Nintendo put Mario & Luigi in an apocalyptic, futuristic dystopian world which was far from the colorful, innocent, and fun mushroom kingdom most gamers were familiar with. Of course back then most film directors were from past generations that never had a passion for video games. Even the late Bob Hoskins, who played Mario in that 1993 catastrophe of a movie, didn't even know the source material until his son showed him the video game his movie was based upon. In the years that have followed, lots of movies based upon video games have bombed or had no resemblance to their source material.Thankfully, the people who made this movie, listened to their fans. Sonic is not some weird looking being in a strange world. He's exactly who fans like me would envision him, in a world where we feel he belongs. Part of Sonic's image is that he's a cute, fun blue hedgehog in worlds where the color is largely green, but sometimes he travels to strange, dystopian worlds but for a character like sonic, it's still going to be fun for the viewer.What makes it good is the attention to detail. Any veteran fans of the series will recognize little Easter eggs and references here and there. It was difficult for me to keep quiet in that theatre when I noticed all the references to Sonic the hedgehog (Right down to the piano cover of the original Green Hill Zone theme) But if there's any character who got the greatest transition to the big screen, it's Dr. Robotnik, played by legendary funnyman, Jim Carrey. Carrey knew EXACTLY who he was portraying and did it well. His spontaneity and wacky, offbeat style made him fun to watch for a bad guy.And if you think this movie left out certain, even cuter lovable characters with the ability to fly with their 'tails' just wait. If you stick around after the credits you'll smell a sequel with a character that appeared in the 1992 video game sequel to the original 1991 game.But there's still a few characters missing, in particular a red echidna & a love interest for our beloved Sonic, but hey, like the video games, Sonic's bound to get a sequel.",Sonic the Hedgehog
115,PyroSikTh,Medium Entertainment,6,13 February 2020,"I'm not a huge Sonic fan, at least not big enough to have kept up with the more narrative elements of the last twenty years, but I did spend an ungodly amount of hours playing it on my Sega Mastersystem as a kid. It's probably the game I am most nostalgic for. The movie fails to capture any of that, and I get the feeling that was quite on purpose. This is not a straight adaptation of the game where Sonic runs around collecting rings and bouncing on bugs to wipe them out. That would've been boring. Instead the film opens on an alien planet with a baby Sonic being looked after by an owl, until his unique power of speed is coveted by some other creatures and he's plunged headfirst through a portal. Jump forward a number of years and he spends his time in a cave full of 90s memorabilia and watching the locals, including the cop he dubs 'Doughnut Lord', his wife he dubs 'Pretzel Lady', and a number of others like 'Crazy Carl'. His loneliness drives him to accidentally cause a power outage all over town, and now the government wants to find him, dispatching the bizarre Doctor Robotnik to flush him out.This movie is not breaking new ground. There's nothing particularly interesting about the story or the way it's told. In fact it's so unoriginal at times that it feels like it's directly riffing off other movies. Almost every cliché imaginable makes an appearance at some point, and almost all the comedy is reliant on cheesy one-liners that should've been left in the 90s. The only real high point in this regard is Jim Carrey back to doing what he does best; pulling silly faces, prancing about with abandon, and shouting weird concoctions of words and phrases. The line about rubbing it in an orphan's face was a particular standout, if only for daring to go there in a kids movie.But just to showcase how cliché this movie can get, there's a scene where Sonic and Tom find themselves in a biker bar living their best life. Near the end of the night three burly-looking dudes come up to them saying they don't like ""their kind"", by which they mean hipsters. This was particularly hilarious because neither Sonic nor Tom looked remotely like hipsters. In fact they didn't look all that different to the guys accusing them. It felt like such a weak excuse to start a bar fight and, yeah, the entire bar erupts into a mess of PG violence, because of course it does. The unoriginality doesn't end there though. No, the fight is closed out by Sonic going super-speed and pulling a Quicksilver from Days of Future Past. He moves people around, puts objects in people's faces, has a bit of a laugh watching everyone in freeze frame. Except when compared to those Quicksilver scenes in the X-Men franchise, it's missing one crucial detail that made those scenes so entertaining; there's no time limit. Quicksilver has to do everything before bullets hit, or the house explodes. Sonic just doesn't have that threat at all, especially considering his effect is a freeze frame rather than a super slow-mo. There's another Quicksilver scene later on, but it works because it does have those stakes, and it is slow-mo rather than freeze frame, but for an introduction to that ability this just felt weak and like a blatant rip-off. Kids won't care though, I guess.Shall we touch the controversy now? I've got to, right? Sonic looks better. Way better. He actually looks like Sonic now. I have no idea what they were thinking with that original design, but it just plain did not work. There are still some elements about this new design that don't work for me, namely the fur (hedgehogs don't have fur), but it's leaps and bounds better than it was. I just feel sorry for the VFX guys who had to almost completely rebuild the character from the ground up in four months. Some of these effects shots clearly weren't easy to pull off either, especially when he interacts with objects. Is it going to be worth the extra 5 million investment? Who knows. But without the redesign this would've been a painfully mediocre movie overshadowed by it's terribly designed main character. With the redesign it's just a painfully mediocre movie.And that is, in a weird way, where Sonic's success as a movie comes from. It doesn't rock the boat and it distinctly lacks original ideas, so it appeals to the lowest common denominator; the general audience, and kids are going to love it. On the flipside its mediocrity and lack of originality means it won't alienate the core fanbase either. I'm sure there'll still be some nitpicking from die-hard fans, but I don't think the Sonic fanbase is big enough to cause enough waves. There's enough to like in this movie to make it an enjoyable experience. It's a kids movie. It entertained my son. Achievement unlocked, I guess. If you have kids, there are worst movies you could take them to see. If you're a Sonic fanboy/girl, the closing credits feature the entire movie re-imagined as the 16-bit games, the classic theme tune appears every now and then (and has been stuck in my head ever since), and there's a nice little character tease in the mid-credits to keep you happy. If you have no connection to the character at all, there's plenty of action and humour to keep you entertained for ninety minutes. But this isn't going to be anyone's best movie of the year. I give Sonic the Hedgehog an all right 6/10. If they hadn't redone Sonic, it would've plummeted to a 3 or 4, so it absolutely saves the movie from being a complete disaster.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Dr. Robotnik is not a slim guy like they portray him in this!! It's clear the people behind this movie only saw a cash grab because they didn't study the sonic world like they should have!!!",Sonic the Hedgehog
123,maxglen,Most fun I've had at the cinema in a while.,8,18 February 2020,"Last year and the beginning of this year have had some absolute masterclasses in filmmaking... The Lighthouse, Jojo Rabbit, 1917, Parasite, Joker, the list goes on. But those films dealt with heavier themes and were more to be appreciated than flat out enjoyed. Sonic is F U N. Me and my girlfriend were smiling and giggling the whole film, it was a nice change of pace. There are references throughout to the original games as well as some of the 3D era, some obvious, some a little more hidden. Jim Carrey is Jim Carrey, if you have ever enjoyed him you will enjoy him in this and at times he plays a genuinely intimidating villain. Ben Schwartz is near pitch perfect for Sonic, perhaps my favourite version of the character, he brings heart AND humour in equal measure. That's it for the spoiler free portion of this review. Now... SPOILERS! Baby Sonic is adorable, I need more Baby Sonic. They put the Sanic meme into the film which literally had me and my girlfriend rolling while all the kids in the kino had no idea what we were laughing at. Although small, the origin of Sonic's classic red and white shoes is an immensely satisfying moment. Sonic running with a tortoise (nuff said) also this movie has a couple Quicksilver style scenes which were a lot of fun. My favourite scenes in this whole film though come just after the it ends, we see a much more classic Robotnik and... Tails! These scenes have actually made me excited for a sequel which is something I don't usually say. If you don't go into this expecting The Godfather you'll have a good time, especially if you were already a fan of the blue blur.",Sonic the Hedgehog
124,Finfrosk86,"Decent videogame movie, kid friendly.",6,12 February 2020,"After all the controversy with the movie a while back, I'm surprised they got it made and it not being a total mess. Because it isn't!The visuals are pretty good. Sonic for the most part blends in pretty well. The effects are good. We get a couple ""Quicksiver""-type scenes. While not quite on par with the actual Quicksilver-scene, they were good. I love that type of effect. Freeze frame, bullet time, call it what you will. LOVE!Sonic is pretty charming, and they actually spend a whole lot of time on Sonic and his ""relationship"" with James Marsdens character. I'd say a little too much. I'd rather have another speed-scene, or two.
But I get it, they try to give the movie heart. And they sort of succeed.I did feel it got a little kid friendly at times. All the heart felt a little cheesy.
I do think kids will like this movie tho! If they know who Sonic is.Jim Carrey is very Jim Carrey as Robotnik. As expected, I guess. He's alright. I hope he does more roles like this again, it suits him.
Although it bothered me a little that Robotnik is supposed to have an insanely high IQ, but he doesn't always seem to. But I guess to write a character with sky high IQ, you'd have to have that yourself, right?But yeah, a couple chuckles, pretty decent chemistry between charaters, some nice action. You could do a whole lot worse.",Sonic the Hedgehog

126,xamtaro,Jim Carrey steals the show,8,1 March 2020,"SONIC THE HEDGEHOG delivers a fun family film with a simple message, great comedy, and a straightforward plot. Not to mention tons of nostalgia fuel. Let's start with the plot. I was terrified that it would be one of those ""cartoon character comes to the real world to be a supporting character to help bland protagonist with personal problem"" type of cliche which we saw in the likes of SMURFS. Thankfully this movie sidesteps that cliche by having Sonic clearly be the main protagonist and focus of the story.Hunted on his home world for his extraordinary speed powers, Sonic has been in hiding on our Earth in the forests near Green Hills town. He likes it here but has kept a Low profile for fear that he would be hunted once again and be forced to escape to another world. As such, Sonic is one lonely individual. A mishap with his powers exposes Sonic's presence in Green Hills and sets the eccentric tech genius Doctor Robotnik on his little blue tail. Now stranded on earth due to having lost his means of inter-world travel in San Francisco (it makes sense in the context of the movie) Sonic must enlist the help of Sheriff Tom Wachowski, the one person he thinks he can trust, to get him to across the country while evading the mechanical minions of Robotnik.Here is a simple story cobbled from ""person befriends non human creature"" movies like ET, and ""bonding through a road trip"" movies like PAUL. The underlying theme of an outcast desiring friendship and a sense of belonging is also often used in such movies. Not the most original idea, but the decision to keep it simple and even simplify the franchise's often convoluted lore ensures this movie is accessible to even the most casual viewers.Sonic himself is distilled, retaining his recognisable confident personality but downplaying His sometimes annoying arrogance from the games, replacing it with a child-like curiosity and innocence. This coupled with his tragic backstory and character development as the plot progresses makes this version of the beloved video game character one of the most relatable and (wait for it) three dimensional incarnations ever. The special effects used to bring Sonic to life on the big screen is top notch but one gets the impression that most of the Budget was pumped into this and not much else.Robotnick's robot drones are created in CGI too but some scenes have the lighting or the composting feel slightly off, especially since most of the movie takes place in broad daylight. Most egregious is a scene involving sonic and a tortoise early in the movie with the compositing on the tortoise looking particularly shoddy. Ultimately, the special effects aside from those on Sonic come off as just serviceable.While most of the human cast are just as serviceable, high praise goes to Jim Carrey as Robotnik. This is classic manic, old school crazy fun Jim Carrey of the 90s, obviously having the time of his life with the role. The energy he brings and the way he plays off the rest of the cast is such a delight to watch.The music by Tom ""Junkie XL"" Holkenborg of TERMINATOR DARK FATE and BATMAN V SUPERMAN fame also deserves praise. His score on this movie is very unlike his past work, eschewing the loud brass sounds and heavy percussions for a more whimsical cartoony tune with light strings and woodwinds that feels right at home with the family friendly nature of this movie.There is much to love about SONIC THE HEDGEHOG. The passion of the creative team is clearly evident and it delivers simple entertainment without too much pandering. Between this and last year's POKÉMON: DETECTIVE PIKACHU, I feel video game movies have a bright future ahead.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Honestly for all the ignoring of every other character in the game besides sonic and robotnik, it could've easily been an animated some thing else and part of me thinks at one point it was.

In this family film based on the popular video game series, a police officer must help an extraterrestrial hedgehog defeat an evil genius who wants to do experiments on it.

Just when you thought ""Sonic The Hedgehog"" would be bad, it really isn't. The 100-minute family film really does appeal to all and has gags and laughs for all ages. I thought it was a good film adaptation but not great, but honestly it could've been bad especially with those reshoots. Jim Carrey portrays Dr. Robotnik as if we would've in the '90s; so in the end this is '90s Jim we're watching and it's totally fun. Energetic, sweet and full of action, ""Sonic The Hedgehog"" is solid popcorn fun.

Really fun and enjoyable movie for both me (in my 20's) and my nieces (9 and 5)Lots of visually epic scenesA romantic couple that was perfectly supportive and loving; a great example, almost never seen in other movies or showsMain cast was really good, I won't overpraise Jim because he didn't bring anything new to the table but props for nailing a role of a guy that looks nothing like himA mad high number of awesome references to the gamesI can definitely recommend this for adults and kids (over 6) alike and am looking forward to the sequel which I'm sure will happen because the movie was a success and the ending (like I said) hammered down the idea of a sequel.Good stuff! Really happy this wasn't a mess like most other video game movies, though again - at least fix the cringy, generic, useless backstory with the owl.

130,eagandersongil,Exceeding expectations,7,24 April 2020,"Adapting ""Sonic"" seemed to be a very difficult task, expressing a story of the renowned hedgehog of the sega and yet combining that with good direction and a captivating script seemed impossible, especially with the terrible first images and news of the feature.However, Sega's ambitious project was right, transforming suspicion into certainty of a film that conquers by fun and characters, we have nothing very innovative here, but perhaps the low expectation that we had made the film better, well directed, well acted, with captivating characters and giving Sonic a surprising depth, the script was able to adapt and tell a story to all audiences.The use of color photography, good use of special effects and technical agility, with an excellent montage and ambience, in addition to a beautiful soundtrack, conquer the public and especially the fan of the franchise.Jim Carrey is excellent, with charisma and a lot of screen presence, the disappeared and brilliant actor returns to the screens with a charismatic role that contributes to the fun and good film that overcomes all his suspicions and becomes a great adaptation.

Hence, ""Sonic"" boasts a really great sense of humour (bolstered by classic Jim Carrey being Jim Carrey & appreciable adult jokes scattered throughout, appealing to a variety of audiences), grounding the narrative in character, telling a simplistic & yet decent story (that is hardly original) about 2 individuals forming a friendship after meeting in unlikely circumstances. Totally conventional & lacking in uniqueness, it's still endearing & sweet enough to merit emotional engagement, offering a certain level of adorable entertainment to pass the time.

The plot brings Sonic into our reality through a well written backstory in which his only safe haven in the galaxy for now is to take refuge on earth. He is discovered by a police officer named Tom (James Marsden) who quickly befriends Sonic and teams up with him to help defeat the evil Dr Robotnik (Jim Carrey) who wishes to capture our heroic speedy blue hedgehog and conduct experiments on him! I never personally had a huge attachment to the Sonic game franchise as a kid but always appreciated how fun it looked. Through watching the film adaptation, I feel that hardcore fans will leave it feeling hyped as even I did and it's a great time at the movies for a nice, inoffensive family viewing. It's probably gonna be one of the best kids films of the year as it's exciting, funny and engaging for a younger audience aswell as being amusing and entertaining for older. Ben Schwartz does a fantastic job voicing Sonic, it's great to see Marsden in a big Hollywood flick again and Carrey comedically excels yet again in the antagonist role, 100% channeling Ace Ventura here. My favourite scene without a doubt is a certain dance sequence he's involved in that is one of the most delightfully absurd things I've seen on the big screen in a while!

Animations, the design and the voice acting of Sonic by Ben Schwartz are on point. A little bit disappointed about Dr. Robotnik representation.

Everyone in my class used to say their favourite superhero to be Spider-Man, Batman, Superman etc, but when I'd say I like Sonic, everyone made fun of me. Not just because Sonic is supposed to be ""childish"" as they called it (because ignorance is bliss; they'd even think Conker's Bad Fur Day is childish because it has animals as main characters). And I swore that one day when Sonic gets a movie and all normies start looking up to him then I will mock them.When the first trailer of this movie was shown I almost had a mini heart attack. This was not just an atrocious design, it was a nightmare! Thanks to the petitions and Paramount listening to the fans, they finally redesigned Sonic. And then when I finally watched the movie, it felt so satisfying. I had never watched superhero cartoons or read the comics, so I suppose this is the same joy Marvel fans get when they see MCU movies. Today was my turn to take the joy.I really like how they chose to focus more on character development than the story, which is absolutely necessary because they are setting it up for a franchise. They should not rush anything. In the first movie Sonic and Donut Lord have established their friendship and in the post credit we see Tails come to Green Hill looking for Sonic. Also Eggman gets trapped on Mushroom planet in the end which is where Sonic 3 & Knuckles takes place, so it's clear that Knuckles will also appear in the post credit scene of the second movie.Sonic fans are known to be toxic. And I was also one of them as a kid. So for us fans, this movie is like a dream come true. People here are criticising how slow and cliché the plot was, and even I really hope they come up with something original and more fun in the sequel.",Sonic the Hedgehog
137,DeBBss,Too many 8/10s,4,4 April 2021,"There are way, way too many 8/10 reviews for Sonic the Hedgehog. It is nowhere near that level of quality. My best guess is that people are over rating this film for the nostalgia or the fan service. I do like how they remodeled Sonic and put in the extra effort, but that doesn't warrant an undeserving rating, such as an 8/10. There are simply too many flaws with the film. Like the boring and cliched characters who are abnormally calm, and always on board with Sonic, even though they would be risking their lives for something they just met. It's just so strange, the people in this film don't feel like real people.And I see a lot of people praising Jim Carrey for playing Dr. Eggman, but I feel like he ruined the character. His goofy demeanor removes all of the seriousness and intimidation, which just leaves him as wannabe bad guy. And I get that it's a kids' movie (caricaturized characters, unrealistic plots, etc), but you could be half sober and still be able to constructively criticize this movie.But with all of its flaws, there are still some good parts about it. First off, Sonic is a very likable character. He can be annoying, but that fits his character. I liked how they went with a cartoonish look for sonic. He's an oversized blue hedgehog, it would just be weird seeing a realistic version, like what we got in the first trailer. It also does its job as a kids film, bringing an enjoyable story that's fun to watch. The acting is mediocre at best, but at least it gets the job done.If you love the Sonic IP, then give the film a shot. But since I don't really care about the Sonic brand, I'm giving this film an honest 4/10. I'd really only recommend this movie to kids; it would be a pain to watch this movie as an adult.",Sonic the Hedgehog

PG
Director: Jeff Fowler
Starring: Ben Schwartz, James Marsden, Jim Carrey, Tika Sumpter, Lee Majdoub, Natasha Rothwell, Adam Pally etc
Overall rating 85/100
Sonic is based on a police detective who comes to meet a fast hedgehog who is trying to find a way home. But Dr Robotnik (Jim Carrey) wants to capture sonic to do experiments on him. I had an absolute blast with sonic, I had some issues with the first half but once they found their feet Sonic was a great time let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, the sense of nostalgia, character design and voice work were great. Growing up on sonic I was excited for this movie, and they didn't disappoint, they had so many nods to the games and pop culture it was a joy to watch and kept me consistently entertained, they did manage to balance old pop culture references to new ones as well which was great. And boy am I glad that they redesigned sonic as he looked fantastic throughout a truly accurate and loyal representation of what he should have looked like all along. I also have to say that the voice work from Ben Schwartz was fantastic, he sounded exactly like a sonic fan would imagine his voice, so they got everything about sonic spot on.Next the films action and humour were fantastic. This film was for the most part hilarious. All the characters especially Jim and sonic were fantastic, the humour was fast and paced and clever and got me chuckling throughout, the secondary characters were also very funny especially Tika Sumpta and Natasha Rothwell who were infectious on screen and had some great scenes that made me laugh due to their sisterly disputes between James Marsden's character. And the films action was very entertaining as well. The use of slow motion for sonic was used very effectively in helping everyone. And the action scenes involving Dr Robotnik's robots were inventive and you couldn't help but admire the film when they went into true videogame mode when he turned into a ball and went really fast. One little thing I do have to say that was not executed to well was the films humour and emotional moments in the first half. I started to get a little worried at the beginning because some of the jokes fell fairly flat for me especially James Marsden's they improved towards the second half or when Jim Carrey was introduced but its humour was not completely consistent for me. And I thought the moments that were supposed to be emotional or sweet came across as forced and generic to me. The whole concepts of Sonic feeling alone and realising at different times didn't really work for me as I have seen it before
Next, they gave a decent amount of backstory and character development to sonic and the final act was very entertaining. The film actually spent some time on where sonic grew up and why he had to flee his home which I appreciated, and the whole development and conflict with his character of returning home or to a different island or staying with the people who really care about him was nice to watch. And the final act was incredibly entertaining. I loved how long the final battle lasted between Sonic and DR Robotnik. They went across multiple worlds and places in America really entertaining you throughout as you got to see a variety of different locations. And when sonic powered up big at the end you couldn't help but admire the movie for going all out.My final two negatives would be the rushed pacing for the human characters and the slight lack of character development for them. I got the rushed pacing and keeping the story going quickly with the character of Sonic due it working as he is a fast character. But at the beginning they used this same strategy with the human characters which I felt was an odd decision. Because of this it took me a lot longer to connect with there characters. What also didn't help was there lack of character development. All the characters through the fist half had very generic roles, they didn't do much then there being the wife of James Marsden's character, the sister who doesn't like her siblings husband it was just very simple, they changed this with some of the characters in the final act but some of the characters were still one dimensional.But my final positives that made the movie for me was the character of Sonic the chemistry he had with James Marsden and Jim Carrey.
They really got the character of sonic perfect. His design was perfect, his voice was perfect, and he had the same personality as the games and tv shows, so they really captured the essence of the character perfectly and he was just so much fun to watch on screen. And his chemistry between him and James Marsden was great. Their developing friendship was a joy to watch and bought many heart-warming moments in the final act that made me excited to see them both again in a sequel. But the true star of the film for me was Jim Carrey. It was so nice to see him on the big screen again. And he hasn't lost his touch at all. He was quirky and over the top just like you would expect from this man. He was hilarious and had so many fantastic one liners, he really commanded the screen and worked very well in the film.Overall despite a few issues with the tone, characters and pacing at the beginning, Sonic is a brilliantly entertaining video game film, with fantastic performances, great humour and action. I am excited for the hopeful future of this franchise.",Sonic the Hedgehog
139,Donatien3,Sonic is More Medium-Paced than Express,7,5 July 2020,"The Sonic movie generated a lot of unexpected buzz from the early social media backlash: fans were unhappy with Sonic's look and complained. To the studio's credit, they made Sonic look like classic Sonic and fans were happy.But was it all worth it?The Sonic film, like most Sonic games after the early nineties, is a bit underwhelming.The plot is a typical fish (or hedgehog) out of water story, with Sonic stuck in Greenhills, Montana (a nod to the classic Green Hill Zone level in the games) after losing his magic rings in San Francisco and teaming up with local cop Tom (James Marsden) to get his rings back and defeat Dr Robotnik (Jim Carrey).There are some good parts: Ben Schwartz does a great job voicing Sonic, balancing Sonic's cockiness with some sincerity; the rings are used cleverly (allowing Sonic to transport himself anywhere he wants to); Carrey brings back memories of his best comedy roles (it's not on a par with ""Ace Ventura"", but there's some good moments); the classic Sonic theme is heard in the soundtrack; and the final battle between Sonic and Dr Robotnik is pretty cool.The credits are brilliant, with the movie's timeline animated in the style of the classic early Sonic games. There's even groundwork laid for a sequel with a post-credits scene.It's not the worst video game movie around, and is entertaining enough for families, but all the fuss over Sonic's look doesn't match the end result. ""Detective Pikachu"", with more complexity, humour, Ryan Reynolds, and adorable Pokemon, is a much better video game movie.If you really want to be entertained by Sonic, dust off his first two Sega Genesis games and bask in the nostalgia.",Sonic the Hedgehog
140,renegadeviking-271-528568,90s cartoon / videogame hero goes Hollywood.,7,28 April 2020,"For all the kerfuffle that erupted in the spring of 2019 over the visual design of Sonic the Hedgehog, the blue-furred speed-demon mascot of the Sega video game-turned-live-action kiddie adventure, you wish that the creators of ""Sonic the Hedgehog,"" who went back and redesigned the character after being pressured (I almost wrote bullied) by his fans, had been inspired to redo the character's voice.Sonic, who was attacked for looking too anthropomorphic for comfort (there was a great deal of attention paid to his unnecessarily human teeth), is now closer to the big-eyed, red-sneakered scamp with a stylized smirk who was launched by Sega in 1991 and wound up becoming a kind of Mario or Pac-Man for millennials. In the movie, he now approximates the cuddly Astro Boy look of Sonic from the game franchise. But he talks like the ultimate gratingly overfamiliar cartoon smart aleck - a little snide, a little nerdy, with a mild whine of attitude, though essentially he's voiced (by Ben Schwartz of ""Parks and Recreation"") to sound like your pal, as if the film had concocted some sort of vocal smoothie out of Garfield and Fritz the Cat and Owen Wilson and Patton Oswalt. Whatever Sonic now looks like, his soul is innocuous.Given the level of obsession with which Sonic's fans regard him, the makers of ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" would have done well to turn the film into a slapstick theme park of video-game trickery, like the relentlessly imaginative ""Ralph Breaks the Internet."" But no! Their truly epic bad decision, far worse than the original fussy humanoid design of Sonic, was to make the ""Sonic"" movie into one of those clunky live-action adventure comedies with a digitally animated generic weisenheimer plopped into the middle of it.The trouble with this form is that the live-action setting inevitably results in a cloyingly cheerful camp-sitcom woodenness - in this case, the tale of how Sonic buddies up with Tom Wachowski (James Marsden), a sheriff in the small town of Green Hills, Montana. The two finally land in San Francisco, so that the film can have an action climax set atop one of the towering platforms of the Transamerica Pyramid. Wherever they are, though, they're an odd couple rotely snarky enough to make your lids droop.So how speedy is Sonic? He's so fast that he jogs at 297 miles per hour, plays a baseball game with himself, and can effectively slow any situation to a standstill, crawling around inside it to make whatever adjustments are necessary. (This ability comes in handy, and entertainingly, when he's stuck in a redneck bar.) He's like the Road Runner without the silently amused mystique. Early on, he dashes around to the tune of Queen's ""Don't Stop Me Now"" (""I wanna make a super-sonic man out of you""), which gives you a preview of the film's product-tie-in idea of cleverness. Sonic has his gold video-game rings that allow him to teleport, and his mind zips around too, which means that he adds a spin of rapid-fire noodginess to lines like, ""The face I was born with. The confidence I picked up along the way.""""Sonic the Hedgehog"" does perk up, sort of, when Jim Carrey is onscreen as the evil Dr. Robotnik, whose origin story this basically is. After the electric light from one of Sonic's mad dashes shorts out the entire Pacific Northwest, the U.S. military is convinced that there must be some sort of alien invasion afoot. So they send in Robotnik, a freelance machine wizard, to investigate. Carrey, wearing a big waxed mustache out of an old Western, a long black coat with a lining of satanic red, and a haircut that can only be described as a Hitler fade, does a vintage Carrey turn - which is to say, he could have given the exact same performance in 1998, and maybe did, but there's a giddy nostalgia to seeing him execute these routines with such timeless demon-sprite abandon.Robotnik is a cracked tyrant genius who controls an army of sensor drones (they're like the weaponized droids in ""RoboCop,"" except that they look like flying humidifiers), and his driving force in life appears to be to demonstrate, at every opportunity, his innate superiority. We all know that your average Hollywood comedy tends to include some on-set improvisation, but in this case the contrast between the leaden pseudo-brashness of the rest of the movie and the ping! of Carrey's dialogue is so marked that it almost feels like he made up his entire character on the spot. (I'm not declaring that he actually did. I'm just sayin'.) When he leers, ""It'll be fun to take you back to the lab for a litany of invasive exploratory procedures,"" it reminds you that the Carrey personality was always built around cheeky new ways to bring the pain.A review like this one should probably come with a disclaimer: For all the borderline tedium I felt at ""Sonic the Hedgehog,"" I do realize this is a picture made for 8-year-olds. And they'll probably like it just fine. Yet I would also call the overly kiddified tone of the movie a mistake. The protesters who rallied for the changes in Sonic's design by treating it as a line-in-the-sand issue, thereby demonstrating at least one reason why Donald Trump will probably be re-elected (we now have a generation that thinks this is a cause), were not 8-year-olds. As a movie hero, Sonic could (and should) have been hipper and sharper, less megaplex arrested. Even as they fixed his face, the filmmakers strove so hard to make him ""likable"" that they never figured out a way to make him cool.",Sonic the Hedgehog

(No trendy self-loathing or pretending to be god.) His attitude is having this great speed but either being slack or using it the wrong way. Always making sure people are fine. In this movie all that happens is that he has to go to california to find some rings he drops.. and the whole way through he makes shallow comments or acts like a tough guy...They could have lifted a story straight from a comic book and it would have been an instant classic, rewatchable forever.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Don't get me wrong I personally am Jim Carrey fan so it isn't anything personal.

I never played the video game but I'm pretty familiar with the character of Sonic despite that and I think that the only right way to bring a video game character, as well as any other character, is to give him depth, personality and a strong enough reason for us to sympathize with him - and Sonic the Hedgehog doesn't check on any of those. The villain is villainy and even Jim goddamn it Carrey could not save him from being shallow and superficial. The main protagonist Sonic and his human counterpart, played by James Marsden, try feebly to be more than meets the eye but nothing really hits the spot and overall this movie feels so unnecessary like it was made specifically for a sole purpose only - to grab cash and start on the sequel right away.

154,bhernandez2216,The Fastest Funniest Movie of the Year!,10,12 February 2020,"""Sonic the Hedgehog"" is an incredible video game film, and I like to play games and watch the TV Snow about Sonic the Hedgehog, and now it's also way faster and way better than ""Pokémon: Detective Pikachu"", even though I didn't watch the movie and I don't want to, and I also don't like Pokémon shows and movies anymore, I'm all grown up and I'm so glad to get to review Sonic the Hedgehog so fast, because everybody loves Sonic. It has a lot of fun, all the action, and funniest moments in the film. Jim Carrey is brilliant playing the greatest villain, and Sonic the Hedgehog is the fastest hero we need. Based on Video Game created by: SEGA, this is ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" we've been waiting for!",Sonic the Hedgehog
155,darkdementress,Snore fest,1,31 August 2020,"Terribly written, super boring and not made for anyone about the age of 13. I love plenty of kids movies or shows that have charming characters, fun stories and sometimes humor only adults would get but this have non of those. All the jokes made no sense and were not funny. I felt like i was getting dumber as the movie went on. Jim Carrey.. Why dude.. Bad. Just bad.",Sonic the Hedgehog
156,Olicosmic,A faithful adaptation that's both fun and a bit by the numbers,7,24 April 2020,"When I first played the 1991 classic when I was 10 in 2009 (yes, I'm a bit late, but this was my introduction) via the Sonic Mega Collection +, I was instantly hooked. And since then, I've played almost every game the blue blur has been in. Sure, there are some stinkers here and there (Sonic '06, Sonic Boom, etc.), but I've enjoyed most of the other speedsters games to some extent, and there some of his games that I would consider some of the best I've ever played (Sonic 2, 3&K, Colors, Generations, Mania, etc.). All in all, I have and may always consider myself a pretty big fan of Sonic. So, you could imagine how disgusted, horrified, and almost insulted I felt when I saw the original trailer for this film. For one, Sonic looked nothing like himself, since he was essentially just a humanoid with creepily realistic teeth and body. It clashed hard with what the movie seemed like it was going to be, making it seem like one of those terrible Smurf's or Alvin and the Chipmunks movies. While I was really worried, I still kept my mind open for it to be at least somewhat okay. Thankfully, after hearing about Sonic getting a redesign, my hopes were instantly more positive. After seeing the film, I can happily say it's every bit as good as I hoped it would be, and one of the better video game films we've got. For one, Sonic actually looks like Sonic, and he looks great. The charm and life that was completely absent in the original design is here, and it blends beautifully with the silly and lighthearted vibe of the film. The performances were all pretty good. While I wouldn't say anyone was exactly Oscar worthy, they did good nonetheless. Also, seeing Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik was just a thing of beauty. As someone who adores films like ""The Mask"", ""Liar Liar"", ""Ace Ventura"", etc., seeing Jim pull off a manic performance like the good old days, as well as invoke a new light into a video game villain effectively was just awesome. What else is awesome is how much there is to this film, as it not only has some decent structuring, but also fun action scenes and creative world building. The film does a good job in referencing the games it is based off of, whether it be a few locations, the use of rings, etc. With that said, though, since the movie is based off of a video game franchise that's never known for having a story less basic than toast, this film does suffer from predictability and tropes hard. While the film can be a good amount of fun, there's really not much in terms of depth or variety in the story telling. It's your typical ""stop the bad guy from conquering"" story we've heard a thousand times before, and while it works for a video game, transferring that to a feature film well enough can be a bit tricky. It can make the film feel a bit by the numbers at times. Thankfully, with what this film does right, it's not a huge deal. There are also lots of easter eggs peppered in here to make Sonic fans, like myself, happy, so if you're a fan, look out for those. Overall, taking in the circumstances, it's almost a miracle that this film turned out this way. What looked to be an absolute disaster turned out to be a shockingly faithful adaption that's a good amount of fun, and while I would've liked for it to be a little less by the numbers, seeing this is very recommended not only if you're looking for something fun and flashy, but especially if you're a Sonic fan, as this film delivers on pleasing the fans rather than its paycheck-- something that some other video game movies should've learned long ago.",Sonic the Hedgehog
157,fjhuerta-2,Better than expected. Thank GOD Sonic was re-done,7,15 February 2020,"Not a bad movie, after all. Nice message, very well made CGI, and Sonic looked and acted as I imagined it should be.The fact that he was re-done was reason enough for me to go and see the movie. A company listening to its customers and actually delivering a quality product because of complaints? That's pretty much unheard of in the movie industry. This could have been a ""Cats"" level disaster. Instead, it was pretty enjoyable, sweet and fun.But, oh, Jim Carrey. Did he steal the show? Yes, indeed. His acting was superb, and on the level of his best movies. Just goes to prove - he should be let go and be himself every once in a while.Sonic and Jim Carrey deserved to look and act this great. What could have been a disaster of a movie ended up being a pretty nice and sweet ride. Thank you Paramount, for doing the right thing.",Sonic the Hedgehog
158,TheVictoriousV,I genuinely think removing Nightmare Sonic was a terrible idea.,5,15 February 2020,"Imagine getting a character design so amazingly, grotesquely wrong that fan-made improvements become a full-fledged Internet meme. Hell, imagine being so out-of-touch with what a joke Sonic the Hedgehog is, not to mention his fan club, that you make a movie like this in the first place (even though you should also know how video game films typically turn out). The casting of Jim Carrey, reviving the rubberman shtick that made him famous and us tired of him, as Dr. Eggman is but the cherry on the sundae.It gets better. The movie has gotten so much backlash for its supremely ugly Sonic that the version we see today is essentially a hasty re-do. Yes, they actually had to redesign their own main protagonist mere months before the film's (new) release date.People think it's so easy too. ""Oh just use all the finished animation on another model"", someone said on Twitter, even though that would look about as good and natural as when gamers mod Spongebob Squarepants onto Grand Theft Auto characters. The first movie-Sonic wasn't pretty but at least the animations went with the mesh. You guys were essentially asking for even less.The film itself is generic in a way I thought long-dead, featuring a well-known animated character, specifically Sega's famous video game speedster Sonic (Ben Schwartz), spending more time in our world than his own, thus we get the chance to see pretty celebrities like James Marsden and plenty of ad space. It might remind you of ""older"" films like Transformers and The Smurfs, where most viewers agreed that primarily setting the movies on Cybertron or in Smurfland would have made for greater adventure. The clichéd lessons of friendship and mostly played-out jokes don't help.Jim Carrey gets much of the screentime as Dr. Ivo ""Eggman"" Robotnik and he is indeed part of what makes the film so baffling. This is his first major role in a while and although he is capable of playing characters, possibly including a pompous madman like Dr. Eggman, he's just being Jim Carrey here, so there's nothing about the performance that justifies his casting as such a famous villain. His shtick makes a comeback, and it's as the Sonic bad guy. How much you wanna bet he was method-acting like crazy behind the scenes, possibly real hedgehogs?Sonic the Hedgehog doesn't do anything especially new if you know your fish-out-of-water stories, buddy movies, and E.T. copies. For kids, this won't be an issue (although they might get more out of the games), but the adults will have little to chew on outside of Sega references and Carrey nostalgia. It just feels like one of those factory-made movies, created through the concoction of a beloved brand, clichés that typically endear audiences, and trendy memes.At times the movie is enjoyable, but I won't go so far as to call it good. And this is such a boring final verdict compared to what we could have had if they'd kept the original Nightmare Sonic for the film. Alas, now we just have a forgettable live-action adaptation of a cartoon character that isn't special, outside of feeling like something out of the 90's, naughties, or whenever Raja Gosnell was still allowed to make movies - not only due to VFX.If they make Sonic 2, they'll need to up their game. We've seen Sonic feature in perverted fan art (done in Microsoft Paint by basement-dwellers who themselves long to be hedgehogs), partake in a universe-shattering time travel plot where an anime woman falls for him, and also be turned into Pikachu by diaper aficionado Chris-Chan, who is also certain that his totes original Sonichu character is a real being who exists. Long story short: Sonic has no business being this vanilla.",Sonic the Hedgehog
159,jackgdemoss,"""Top Grossing Video Game Movie of All Time"" is not yet a notable achivement",6,29 May 2020,"I hope that movie adaptions of video games continue the upward trend that we have seen in recent years. For now, there still is nothing impressive on the market. Sonic is at its best with its magnificent villain and when showcasing some of sonics moves, but the amount of filler is too much. Additonally, Sonic comes across as guilt tripping the entire film, which required the emotional maturity as a kid to initiate but the intelligence of an adult to execute, which did not fit the character.I want to give a higher rating strictly based off of the studio listening to fans and redesigning the little guy, but then who is to say that the entire stunt wasn't planned. Also, this movie becomes significantly better with the classic ""Escape From the City"" track.",Sonic the Hedgehog
160,kevinxirau,An unexpected surprise movie adaptation.,7,25 February 2020,"""Gotta go fast!"" In 2019, a trailer dropped for the live-action adaptation of Sonic the Hedgehog and BOY did it terrify us with the character's uncanny human proportions. More unbelievable was how Paramount delayed the film's release to fix up the design, something studios hardly ever do. When the new look was revealed, it was a huge improvement, but I was still skeptical. I almost considered not seeing it, but the film gained some unexpected positivity from audiences, so I went to see it.The movie is kind of an origin story for this version of the Blue Blur. He comes into our world to avoid others abusing his power. However, he catches the unwanted attention of Dr. Robotnik aka Eggman (Jim Carrey) who relentlessly hunts him with his trusted army of robots. To evade capture by the mad scientist, Sonic travels with aspiring sheriff Tom (James Marsden), the two forming an unlikely bond in the process.As tired as I am seeing the same premise of a classic character from another world coming to our own (hijinks ensues) like with He-man, Smurfs, and Fat Albert, the film is actually decently made. Sonic's reason for being on Earth is made understandable by the beginning. Despite his energetic, playful personality, he's a lonely creature. This helped with his developing friendship with Tom going through his own arc about wanting to make a difference, having a nice balance of comedy and drama given the right amount of time as they discuss what they desire vs what they need. Okay, the jokes are not drop-dead funny, but they made me smile throughout and had their moments. Jim Carrey's performance is similar to when he played the Riddler, exuding the classic comedic energy we've come to expect from him with a slight edge of menace, not to mention his cool assortment of crazy robots. All in all, he's a good Robotnik. While there are few action scenes, they utilize Sonic's abilities well (a couple of moments look derived from X-Men's Quicksilver) with the final chase being the film's most engaging highlight. Not bad, but I've seen more exciting action from other Sonic media. Also, creds to all the references and creative use of classic Sonic elements like the rings.As a family adventure-comedy and adaptation, it's fine, which for a video game movie is saying a lot. In fact, Hollywood seems to be slowly getting a better grasp on how to do them right like with ""Detective Pikachu"". While I would've preferred something grander and more in line with the games, namely as an animated film, in the end, ""Sonic The Hedgehog"" makes it to the finish line.",Sonic the Hedgehog
161,tfminfl,Great Video Game Movie...for a change...,8,8 March 2020,"405. Sonic the Hedgehog. How was this movie good? Anyone else? So we start with meeting Sonic escaping some other world by jumping through his rings, so thats what their for, he isn't just a greedy man, He finds himself on Earth now, in the heartland of America I guess you'd call it. And he loves it, loves all his new friends, well the friends don't know he's there cause he's an alien n all and they might freak out! After a while of being alone, nothing dirty...or is it? Sonic has an explosion of power that knocks the town power out, alien loneliness is different than human i guess. Well the surge of power attracted the gov't in the form of Dr. Robotnik, an amazing over the top performance by Jim Carrey!! And he's there to take this specimen in to be studied, but luckily Sonic met nice police officer Tom, who's willing to help! Ben Schwartz aka Jean Ralphio, was great as Sonic, would've been more interesting as Jean Ralphio, but oh well. It really is funny and pretty exciting, worth checking out!!

Some of the supporting characters like the police officer's wife and her sister and family have nothing to do with anything.

A surprisingly great video game based movie with a simple story and a great adaptation of Sonic thats great for the whole family and great Sonic fans like myself.Now this movie isn't perfect and it's not a movie that's going to win loads awards but for what it is its great.
a fun film that dosent take its self seriously but also manages to have a lot of heart to it aswell.Sonic is brillant the personally is done to perfection and the design of Sonic is amazing alot better than what it could been.
Jim Carrey is great and suits the role of Robotnik in this movie its old school Jim Carrey and its awesome.The story is very simple as it is a kids movie but there alot of moments that adults and old fans of Sonic can enjoy.
Really hope this gets a sequel.I do have a couple of issues I would of liked to of seen more backstory for Sonic we get a little at the beginning and it's so interesting the world building really works just wish we could see more maybe we will in a sequel.
Also sometimes the effects a noticiable but nothing that ruins the movie.Favourite moment is definitely the bar scene its hilarious and really works in this movie.
Also the post credit scene is amazing and one of my moments watching a scene in the cinema seeing that character was awesome.Verdict 8/10 a great family film that also works for adults fun simple story and great characters make this alot of fun for everyone especially old fans of Sonic like myself.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Oh, you have no idea...but I expected that. It has its heartwarming moments and tons of cute callbacks to the video games. Ben Schwartz is adorable as Sonic and Jim Carrey makes a manic, show-stealing return as Doctor Robotnik. I do wish a little more effort was put into the comedy, though, which consists of recycled, speed-oriented gags from other movies but with a Sonic skin. Like Detective Pikachu, this film is a decent love letter to its fanbase and is easygoing and comprehensible enough for those who don't know anything about the Blue Blur. It shows that Hollywood can sometimes get video game movies right...albeit with some community input. It definitely wouldn't be half the film if the original Sonic design stayed.

167,coasterdude44,Two white gloves straight up!,7,21 February 2020,"I'm a massive Sonic fan, always have been. Ever since I started watching Sonic X from renting the DVD from the local Video Ezy I fell in love with the blue blur. I would watch, play and talk all things Sonic. I have played and owned the majority of games in the Sonic franchise and I'm always excited when a new game is announced or released. So when I heard about this movie being made I was extremely excited. I did have fears that it would just be another throwaway video game movie that has very little respect in it's source material or is unfaithful to it's fans, but something very special happened with this movie midway through it's production cycle, the creators actually listened to the fanbases complaints and changed the design of Sonic's character to what he actually looks like in the video games.The Sonic the Hedgehog movie does not suck. It is actually really good and very entertaining. The actual character of Sonic himself in it is very likeable and represents an Autistic child of wonder who is also a fish out of water who feels like he doesn't belong. The design for Sonic in this movie is borderline perfect in it with his design so crisp and detailed with the trademark eyes so brilliantly done and animation that is very fluid.Sonic is a character who feels that he has no friends and is obsessed with restoring peace and justice aswell as sharing wonder to people close to him. Jim Carrey plays a very entertaining rendition of Robotnik and is very fun to watch in the movie.Overall if you're a Sonic fan and want to see an awesome video game movie adaptation, do not miss this.

It had good pace, and lots of genuine funny moments combined with creative action to keep it going.Jim Carrey was back to his old ways such as 'Ace Ventura', or 'Me, Myself & Irene'. He was fantastic, and it was great to see him rely on his comedic roots. He actually has great range, but this is the Carrey we all know and love.I'm also glad they committed to the Sonic redesign after the public outcry with his initial reveal. An amazing example of a business or company listening to their fans in order to provide a satisfying product. The redesigned Sonic is much more nostalgia infused.

Yeah.Basically Sonic lost his rings and wants Donut Lord (James Marsden) to drive him from Green Hills to San Francisco. Meanwhile, they are being chased by Dr Robotnik (Jim Carrey) and the adventure begins.It's a very fun, entertaining movie. Honestly the whole family should enjoy this. Jim Carrey is a lot of fun in this movie and I enjoyed every scene stealing scene from him.Now I couldn't quite place my finger on it, but then I realized that Sonic reminds me of the Emperor from Emperor's New Groove with a splash of Deadpool. Also if you seen Quicksilver from the X-Men movies when everything slows and he's running around being a goofball and you love that? Well there's a lot of that and pop culture references in this movie. I also like how Sonic mentions chili dogs from his animated series.Seriously it's a lot of fun and I highly recommend everyone to see this movie. Even by yourself like I did. It's a fun movie and Jim Carrey is a blast!",Sonic the Hedgehog
173,hunter-friesen,"""Sonic"" can't outrun its problems",4,6 April 2020,"It's been almost a year now since we were exposed to the horror that came with the first trailer for ""Sonic the Hedgehog."" The blue furball we loved as a kid was turned into a monster with human teeth, small eyes and freakishly long legs. After the overwhelmingly negative reactions, Paramount Pictures announced they would be delaying the movie and taking time to redesign Sonic to better fit his classic video game look. Now in February 2020, ""Sonic the Hedgehog'' has been released with improved visual effects.The story takes place in the small town of Green Hills, Mont. Sonic is living his best life there as he causes mischief for the residents and partakes in other fun activities. On one night, Sonic's actions get the better of him and he attracts the attention of the U.S. Government, who hires the insane Dr. Robotnik to track him down. Needing to go on the run, Sonic recruits the help of local police officer Tom Wachowski. The two set out on the road, getting into hijinks along the way.Directed by Jeff Fowler, ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" doesn't have enough originality to warrant its existence as a movie. The structure of the story is eerily similar to ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" as an alien creature gets stuck on our planet and must rely on an unassuming human to help him return to his homeworld. The only difference here is that after the initial setup, the story turns into a bit of a buddy road trip movie. But the road trip structure here also apes other computer-effect character movies such as ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"" and ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.""Fowler does impress slightly as two moments pop up that make for great fun, which are the moments where time slows down to account for Sonic's super speed. It's a nice comedic bit that shows off Sonic's powers, even if it plays almost shot for shot the same as Quicksilver's scene from ""X-Men: Days of Future Past.""It's also important to point out that the decision by Paramount to redesign Sonic turned out to be the right move. The new look is very well done and is more appropriate to the character.While also being a ripoff of ""E.T.,"" the script for ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" also takes a few too many ideas from the playbook of other kids' movies, most notably the self-referential humor found in ""The Lego Movie"" and its sequel. But while the Lego movies were able to catch lightning in a bottle, Sonic's attempt is impeded by a less than talented committee of writers.The producers must have needed money to fund the character redesign as it seems they sold off some of their jokes to corporate entities. Many recurring gags surround Amazon, Uber, Zillow and Olive Garden. None of these jokes land and only get more shallow as the movie goes on.There are also quite a few pandering pop-culture references to the likes of Keanu Reeves and the floss dance. Yes, Sonic flosses in this movie not once but on two separate occasions.Ben Schwartz voices the titular blue speedster. For better and worse, Schwartz is the definitive voice of the character, supplying a sly, sarcastic tone. He can be quite grating at times but it's also not entirely his fault due to the poor material he's been given.James Marsden as Tom Wachowski fares the best out of the human characters. His performance solely consists of him reacting to his furry sidekick's antics. You can tell that Marsden isn't interacting with a real object, making for some awkward scenes.Lastly, generational talent Jim Carrey plays the oddball villain, Dr. Robotnik. Carrey falls onto his usual schtick of thinking that high energy equals great comedy. He's begging you to like him as he bounces around in a similar fashion to his earlier roles.""Sonic the Hedgehog"" is about as bad as I was led to believe but not as bad as I feared it would be.What's ironic is that the best part of the movie, the visual effects, used to be the worst part. If only Paramount had decided to redesign the whole movie and turn it into something worthwhile instead of this needless cash grab.",Sonic the Hedgehog
174,MinistryofDoom,"Great fun for all ages, whether you're a Sonic fan or not!",8,13 March 2020,"First off, I wasn't expecting much from this film. Last year, after seeing the horrendous design of Sonic, I was ready to write this film off as yet another crappy game-to-movie adaption, but.....after finally getting to see it, I must admit I was wrong. This was REALLY WELL DONE. As a long-time Sega and, particularly, a Sonic fan dating back to his 16-bit days, I wish we could have seen more of his world and less of our world. You know, the zones: labyrinth zone, springyard zone, green hill zone, etc.... However, the way in which the Sonic was integrated into our world was great. It felt natural (for the story) and not at all forced upon us. Gaming fans will be delighted to know that there are quite a bit of nods to gaming culture and references; the most obvious of which is the fact that Tom, played by James Marsden, lives in....Green Hills, Nebraska? Get it? Sure you do. Even if you're not a gaming fan and have never played any of games from Sega's premiere franchise, you'll be entertained throughout this film which contains alot of laughs and action. It never slows down to the point of boredom, which is fantastic, and I didn't mind the length.But wait, we haven't even talked about Jim Carrey! While Ben Schwartz was fantastic the voice of sonic, Jim Carrey stole all the scenes in his over the top role as Dr. Robotnik (aka: Eggman). There's no way I could describe how great he really was; Carrey was made for this role! He literally brought to life Dr. Robotnik in the most extravagant and perfect way. You just need to see this film. It's fantastic for all ages, whether you're a Sonic fan or not! Sega has set the bar high.

It looked like a child's drawing of something they had seen in a nightmare.The relationship between Sonic and James Marsden is super cute too and you'd do become invested in it.It is very much a kids movie but it's nice for older people to see as it's filled with nostalgia from the Sonic games. There are plenty of little Easter eggs that people who have played the game will notice.This movie is also really charming. It has lines that are funny too.So I would watch it especially if you have any interest in Sonic I don't think you will be disappointed or frustrated at what they have done with the property.,Sonic the Hedgehog
181,elenaphysics,It is a good movie,8,24 February 2020,"This is a nice family movie. I had higher expectations to be honest.
It is fun to watch but it could be longer.
I mean it started quite slow and it was fun to watch and then I realised 50 minutes had passed and nothing had happened yet. They were still in the car talking. So the action was squeezed in the second half of the film.
Many things were left unanswered, probably because they were planning on a second film.
At the beginning,the owl who cared for sonic seemed evil and the warriors who came after her were also hedgehogs,probably trying to rescue sonic.
So I hope the next film will answer that",Sonic the Hedgehog

Ben Schwartz and Jim Carey make a great team.Ben did a wonderful voice for Sonic and Jim still as amazing as he is. Both put life and energy into their character.
And come on, Guys. Some review saying that's no depth and storyline is simple. What's u want to expect from a game that's is 30 years ago that we used to play as Sonic that we already know the plot and yet the movie manage to bring us a wonderful journey.",Sonic the Hedgehog

186,rmirchandani,Nostalgic,9,21 February 2020,"Sonic the Hedgehog is a pleasant surprise and such a delight to watch. It is immensely entertaining, action packed and fast paced. I was completely invested in it from the beginning to the end. It manages to capture the essence of the Sonic character. There is no specific target audience for this movie. Of course, it levies more towards a younger audience, but everyone will enjoy this movie. It is just complete fan service. People who grew up playing the Sonic the Hedgehog video game will definitely enjoy this movie. Sonic the Hedgehog is such an iconic character that everyone recognises him.I loved every moment of this movie. From the various huge explosions to the bonkers third act, this movie did not disappoint. Ben Schwartz does an excellent job as the voice of Sonic. Sonic's wit and funny remarks in this movie is just a joy to watch. I loved the camaraderie between Sonic and Tom. They have quite the Buddy/Cop relationship in the first half of the movie.Jim Carrey's portrayal as Dr. Robotnik aka Dr. Eggman is phenomenal. He really owned this character. Him going full on Dr, Eggman at the end and shaving his head in the mid credits scene got me excited for the future of the Sonicverse.The movie had two notable mid credit scenes that sets the movie up to ´become a possible franchise. The first mid credits scene saw Dr. Eggman stranded on the mushroom planet and donning his video game accurate appearance and seeking revenge. While the second mid credits scene introduces the character Tails who seeks out Sonic. Tails is a notable character in the Sonic the Hedgehog video game. The Sonic family could also make an appearance in the possible sequel.To conclude, Sonic the Hedgehog puts me in a nostalgic and fun mood. It has everything I could have wished for. Kudos to the visual effects crew for perfecting the Sonic character after receiving major backlash on the design of Sonic in the first trailer released nine months ago. This Sonic design is so much better. Loved the movie!",Sonic the Hedgehog
187,samyoung-82648,Superb Family Flick,9,17 February 2020,"We took the family. We had a great time. This movie is fun, light-hearted, pulls on the heart strings and is devoid of politics (which should NEVER be in children's movies).It's been a long time since i've enjoyed a children's film this much. I personally preferred it to Frozen 2 (which was very good), Toy Story 4 (which was good) and the Incredibles 2 (which was a letdown).If you want a fun movie the whole family will enjoy, sonic is a must see. Even I found some of the gags to be refreshing and got a laugh out of me.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Not award-winning by any means, but certainly an enjoyable experience",8,21 February 2020,"As of right now, I haven't seen the movie yet, but I plan to next week sometime. Then I will give a proper review here so stay tuned!But I just want to give credit where it's due: Sonic really looks good redesigned here and the fact that Paramount willingly pushed the release date further out to redesign Sonic due to fan backlash makes me so unbelievably happy. Constructive criticism is always a good thing, and it certainly shows here! This is the first time I've seen it happen, and I hope genuine criticism continues to make our entertainment even better for future movies!EDIT March 4 2020: I saw the movie last night and, I think it deserves an 8/10. It ain't a ""great"" movie by any means but it is a fun family movie with lots of action and funny jokes. There are also a couple of crass low-brow fart jokes here and there that got a lesser reaction from me. But Jim Carrey's performance was spot on perfection! Had a good time just seeing him on screen. Overall I do think this movie is worth the watch! Just don't go into it with high expectations.Good Job Paramount and everyone who worked on this movie to make it a fun experience! :)",Sonic the Hedgehog

190,schroederagustavo,Possibly the greatest videogame movie of all time?,6,20 February 2020,"So, I didn't have any huge expectations for this movie. I have never played a Sonic game in my life and video game movies are usually dumpster fires. However, I am pleased to say that I actually had quite the good time with this movie. It's not a revolutionary movie or anything, as a matter of fact, it is quite cliched and has a lot of tropes that we've seen endless times, which made it quite predictable. But for what this movie had to be, which was an entertaining film for families, it got the job done. I liked the new design for Sonic and really fits in with Jim Carrey's cartoonish character and I'm actually glad they changed it, even if it worries me a little bit to know how much power the people have over movies, but in this case, it definitely worked. James Marsden is alright, i did not like the actress who played the wife at all, I thought she was terrible in the role, but she wasn't too much in the film, so that's cool. Not all of the jokes hit and a lot of the humor is very 2020, so I don't think the jokes in this movie will hold up in about 5-10 years (except for the people who lived in 2020) and the movie has some pretty outrageous Olive Garden product placement, so there's that. Jim Carrey is also pretty good in the movie, first time I've seen him do a character like this in a long time, so that's pretty cool. And this is like 90's Jim Carrey, doing some pretty crazy things, man, I really enjoyed it.In the end I will say that Sonic the Hedgehog was a good movie for families, and a good introduction to the character. I'm kind of annoyed that they're apparently trying to make this a Sonic Universe, which they're apparently trying to do with every single franchise out there nowadays, but OK.",Sonic the Hedgehog
191,loversofmovies,Far better,7,14 February 2020,Far better than what I thought it would be. I really found this movie extremely funny. Absolutely brilliant movie.,Sonic the Hedgehog
192,theredsky,Sonic the Hedgehog Review,5,22 February 2020,"The Sonic the Hedgehog movie is incredibly fun to watch with friends and yeah it's basically one big meme but looking at the film from an objective standpoint, it's meh. It's some dumb fun to turn your brain off for an hour for. Jim Carrey is unsurprisingly the best part of the film. He brings so much charm and humor to his performance that it's almost impossible to take your eyes off him once he appears on screen. He goes back to his 90's comedic approach which is just do crazy things which work for his character. It's nice to see him go back to his roots. The rest of the performances are fine. They aren't terrible but they aren't great either. They are perfectly fine for what they were given. The humor is very hit or miss. I found some jokes and transitions funny while I cringed at others. The film does take memes and inserts them into the movie such as Keanu Reeves and Sanic which I enjoyed. Most of the humor comes from unintentional jokes. Some of the lines of dialogue are so bad that they are hilarious. Speaking of dialogue, the script is really meh. It wasn't completely awful but it wasn't that great. The technical aspects of the film were pretty bland too. The cinematography, editing, and production design were all pretty bland and boring. The visual effects were very mediocre. Sonic's design is pretty good though. 100 times better than the original design but everything else using special effects looks fine or not great. There are a couple of plot contrivances which were pretty dumb. Sonic can definitely just run to San Francisco with a map. He does not need to take a road trip. James Marsden's character is labeled as a NATIONAL FUGITIVE yet no one recognizes him. He is able to get to the top of a building in San Francisco going through security with no disguise and no one notices. How do you not recognize a national fugitive? Although I had these issues, I was never bored. Sonic was able to keep me engaged throughout its hour and 40 minute runtime. Overall, Sonic the Hedgehog is really fun and Jim Carrey is great but its script and story elements don't make it as great as I had hoped. It's ironically a 10/10 though.",Sonic the Hedgehog
193,Rino_Bortone,GOOD AND BAD: ENJOYABLE ENOUGH,5,7 March 2020,"Despite the production hell this movie went through for the CGIs, the hate and so on, it results an enjoyable movie for the family and not only. It's obviously not original, the plot is something already seen many times, regardless its own original elements, with a bit of over-acting in some scenes and filled with redundant elements like villain-drones that are still contaminating movies, robbing space for innovating ideas and it's unbelievable to not having had something better than that for Sonic. At the end, objectively it's enjoyable as said before, but is a fun that will not last that much.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Still, I enjoyed this movie, it is nice, fun and well made with Jim Carey adding quite nice touch to villain character. I missed Jim being Jim.",Sonic the Hedgehog
195,troy-daniel-bush,"Cheesy, inoffensive fun.",6,18 February 2020,"Oh, how this movie would've sucked if they stuck with the original design. This movie is cartoonish and cheesy, and it's got Jim Carrey channeling his '90's self, and if they hadn't fixed Sonic none of it would've been entertaining.Personal points, first:I like how contained the movie is.The 90's kids movie clichés makes this movie entertaining in my eyes because I grew up in the 90's. (I like to think this was intentional since Sonic is from the 90's but that's stretching it.) And Sonic was a big part of my childhood, as was Jim Carrey, so, of course, these played a big part in my enjoyment. And these were the reasons I decided to see this movie in the first place.I like the idea of Robotnik being a mad roboticist from Earth. I just find it cool.Lastly, I cannot stand product placement. I hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it!Okay, so here are the pros:The acting was surprisingly good! Way better than DP. Jim Carrey steals the show, but is that really a surprise? He fits his character well and you can tell he had the time of his life playing Robotnik. (Then again, he seems to find enjoyment in every role he plays.) In fact, you could tell every actor was having a good time and that really helps the experience.I was afraid the supporting human characters would get in the way of Sonic but they totally didn't. The movie focuses almost entirely on Sonic and the human characters are just there to help him.Sonic himself is very likable and you do feel for him. And Ben Schwartz does a good job! I was afraid he was gonna be annoying and douchie like certain iterations of Sonic, but he totally wasn't. He was energetic, kind, and hyperactive, and all of this is infectious. I also like how they bothered to give Sonic an arc. Although, it felt like it was lost along the way and then was suddenly picked back up near the end, but it was still there.The rest of the movie focuses on Robotnik, and thankfully he was a fun character to watch. And not just because of Jim Carrey.Everyone involved clearly cared about this project, despite the lack of originality. There was effort put into the writing, cinematography, and the visuals. I'm not saying these aspects are necessarily good, but I get into that further down the page. Speaking of the writing, there are several moments where I said to myself, ""That's Sonic."" And ""That's Eggman."" So good job. There was also quite a bit of attention to detail. Like when Sonic trenches the baseball field. It kinda caught me off-guard.The action was entertaining.I enjoyed the chemistry between Sonic and James Marsden's character.This movie did have some cool shots in it. And some shots would last a good amount of time, which is something I definitely did not expect.I like the whole thing with the quill.Now for the criticisms:The special effects are inconsistent. Some look really good and others not-so-good. However, they didn't look fake enough to take me out of the movie.Despite enjoying the clichés, I acknowledge the fact that them being there is a problem.It isn't made clear why Maddie's sister dislikes Tom. And she was very unlikable.I wish there was more fights between Sonic and Eggman, or at the very least the fights would go on a little longer. I mean, he has the machines and he's a determined narcissist.Not all of the jokes land. However, the ones that don't are not groaners.There are character actions that don't make any sense whatsoever.He flosses. It's annoying.The writing overall was not that great. It wasn't god-awful but... I don't really know what to call it. Like I said, there was clearly effort put into it so... I don't know. A decent amount of the dialogue was bad, I can say that with certainty. And questions were raised that didn't get answered. And James Marsden's character is declared a domestic terrorist and nothing comes of it. Also, they tried to make Sonic's separation from his caretaker emotional but it did not work because the relationship wasn't developed at all. I understand this isn't supposed to be a slowly-paced drama but come on. They should've done something else. Like, maybe a heart-to-heart conversation between Sonic and James Marsden? But maybe they should have taken Longclaw out of the picture and have Sonic say he was orphaned at a young age or something.Overall, I enjoyed this movie. It's not great but it's what I said above. I was afraid it was gonna be a train wreck but I'm glad it wasn't. We finally have a video game that can be called good.",Sonic the Hedgehog
196,timeblank,Plot Drags. Sonic and Jim Carrey Are Superb!,8,23 February 2020,"Sonic the Hedgehog. Acting is great. Sonic delivers a great performance. Jim Carrey is menacing and is always amazing as the villain. At certain times, their can be too much character development. Plot can be slow. The Bar scene could of been reduced and cut. However it kept going on and on. Always love Dr. Robotinik's machines, and the CGI is amazing. Thank you to the Director for the newly designed Sonic. Instead of the old design.

197,domtaylor,"It's not great, but it's surprisingly entertaining.",6,2 March 2020,"After the infamous first trailer and subsequent redesign, 'Sonic the Hedgehog' (2020) is finally here and, rather surprisingly, it's pretty good. It's very generic and predictable, though, and takes a while to find its footing so the entertainment value only goes so far. After a bumpy start, however, it's never less than entertaining and moves at a decent pace. Marsden is good, especially when it comes to his believability with the CG Hedgehog, and makes the most out of the generic 'human' protagonist role. The relationship between him and Sonic is one of the piece's highlights, as is Jim Carrey's Dr. Robotnik. He's in full 'Carrey' mode here which is great to see, even if he sometimes goes ever so slightly overboard for the role he's given. A lot of the humor, though, is bizarre to say the least. Most of it, in fact, is very situational dialogue-based stuff that kids likely won't get, and a lot of it relies on making intertextual references to things that kids will have never heard of. It's strange that most of the humour isn't meant for its primary demographic. Of course, it's not inappropriate (for the most part anyway), and some of it is rather amusing, but it just feels a bit out of place, especially in a film that does, indeed, feature fart jokes. The action is always entertaining for children and adults alike, though, and there are a couple of inventive 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' (2014) inspired sequences that are fun to watch. Overall, it's fun family-friendly fare that will entertain you while it lasts and then disappear from your mind rather quickly. It's certainly up there with Pokémon Detective Pikachu (2019) as far as video-game adaptations go. 6/10",Sonic the Hedgehog

200,wycherleyp-960-470658,"Sonic may be the hero, But dr Robotnik was the real star",3,17 February 2020,"The nicest thing I can say about this movie is that Sega and Paramount dodged a monumental disaster.
From the horrible first designed of sonic to the idea of a film been done that was based on a video game,
Mortal kombat, Super Mario, Doom and the first installments of Lara Croft Tomb Raider. All these were proof that video games dont make great films.
And sonic can be added to that list BUT it wont be top of the list as sonic was half decent and a couple of scenes did make me chuckle, granted they were all Jim Carrey scenes.
So now you know Jim Carrey steals the show, I can go into detail and Based on how far his character flies off the rails, with speeches perfectly synced to Carrey's physicality and timing. I get the impression the actor ad-libbed what we get on-screen. Yet even if I'm wrong, his rhythms and intensity fall into an incredible groove, as if he were teaching a masterclass on '60s B-movie villainy and we were the students.I'm glad Sonic had enough of its parts in place to get me through a viewing feeling slightly entertained. But the only thing that would get me to recommend this film over other family-friendly options is, Jim Carrey's performance.
Nothing else in Sonic the Hedgehog feels particularly exciting.
Kids will probably love it, but for people older than 12 dont waste your time with this film, do something productive like a crossword or evan better dig out your old mega drive and play sonic the hedgehog game.",Sonic the Hedgehog

204,T-ZER0,"Not perfect, but a good try",5,22 February 2020,"I naturally had mixed feelings about a Sonic the Hedgehog film because of movies like Super Mario Bros, Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat. Let's face it, Video Game movies can be easy to make, but Directors always want to do their own thing.This movie is a good attempt at a Sonic film, It's not terrible or unwatchable. It's watchable and you will have a few laughs. But I'm going to list the things I enjoyed about it first.Firstly, I know it's crazy, but I had no idea that Tika Sumpter was on it. Of course, I love Tika Sumpter, and I'm glad they added her onto the film. But answer me this, Why is she always playing a kind woman that has a sister who hates her boyfriend/husband? Don't know what I'm talking about? Watch Mixed-Ish. It's exactly the same thing. Her role is not that different. I like the concept of the rings in the film. Yeah, we who played the games know about the giant ring at the end of the stage that would transport us to the special stage to get the Chaos Emerald. Well, on this film, they transport you to different worlds. Not bad, great idea!!The way Sonic's speed is portrayed on this film is how I imagined it. He moves so fast that everything else is moving slow. Like Quicksilver on X-Men Days of Future Past. Cool idea. It looks great on the big screen.I like that they added a bit of the Green Hill Zone music on the opening, and played it later in the film again. So, I recall Super Mario Bros did the same thing with their movie, so I naturally have mixed feelings, but this film can get a pass. Because unlike Super Mario Bros, which had innuendos not suitable for children, this film can be enjoyed by families.Now for the things that were average or I didn't like::Sonic is an alien.
Yeah, Sonic is an alien.I don't like that and here's why: When you compare Sonic to Mario and other franchises. You notice that Sonic's stories and environments are on earth and talking animals on earth are not uncommon. Heck, on Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic net the President of the United States and he was human! While franchises like Mario take place in an underground world known as the mushroom kingdom, but Mario is from the real world.The world Sonic is from is NOT called Green Hills. Green Hills is the town he lives in on earth. Ok?? I also have a question, why is Sonic a kid? I know I'm asking this, but on the games, it says teenager, but that could be compared to human years, and seeing how Sonic and Friends are a different brand of hedgehog, Fox, rabbit etc. you'd think their aging would be different. And who is LongClaw?Now for Jim Carrey as Doctor Robotnik. Jim Carrey brings his usual eccentric comedic style to the character. But that's a real problem for me. Because I don't see Robotnik, I see Jim Carrey or Ace Ventura. He doesn't have a deep voice like on the games, or is fat like on the games. If he made his voice deeper I would've accepted him more. Yeah, I know he looks more like the games at the end, but still. I don't see Robotnik. I think Danny DeVito would've been a better casting for this character, because I think DeVito would've been perfect.Also, why don't they take Robotnik's theme from the original game and put it on the movie? I would've loved to hear that song on the film and be like ""OH SNAP! HERE COMES ROBOTNIK!""Roger Craig Smith does not voice Sonic. He even stated his displeasure at not being chosen. Sega, if you have a the same ""woman"" who voices Tails on the game make an appearance, why not the current voice actor for Sonic? Even Wreck-It Ralph and Ralph Breaks the Internet got it right!If I am giving praise. I will say the way Sonic beat Robotnik did give me Video Game vibes, the way he smashed into his machine reminded me of how we all used to jump on his machines when playing the video games. Hey, I gotta ask, if the government hired Robotnik, does that make them the villains? Instead of the Robotnik we know on the games kidnapping animals, transforming them into robots and trying to collect the chaos emeralds, It seems like this weird robot dude is doing his job, besides pointlessly bragging about how smart he thinks he is. I also, kind of expected to see his robots be sort of like the minions from Despicable Me. Or maybe still make his robots like they were on the actual video game. Which was animals transformed into robots. Not criticism, just an observation.So in conclusion. I guess this could work as a franchise. It's not a perfect video game film, but it's a good try. If they do make more films, they gotta put my dude Knuckles on one. I would love to see him.",Sonic the Hedgehog

This is because they try to simultaneously draw in general audiences while also changing enough to keep fans of the source guessing. However, often they find themselves ending up far removed from what made the game great in the first place. I could count on the fingers of one hand the number of films based on games that are good. Thankfully, this is one of them.
Following a teenage Sonic as he struggles to come to terms with his supersonic speed, the movie feels like the classic cop buddy movies, and Jim Carey utterly steals the show as the maniacal Dr Robotnik who gradually becomes obsessed with the speedy hedgehog. What makes this film work is the fact that it takes a great character, and adds to it in a meaningful way. Combined with loads of references for Sega fans, some genuinely funny moments and more than the odd tug at the heart strings, this is finally a video game film that everyone can enjoy.",Sonic the Hedgehog

His previous design was just horrific to look at and it makes the movie well...unwatchable, Hell, even I hate Sonic's previous design as much as everyone else does. But thanks to all the Sonic fans all around the whole world, the director and the crew behind the movie finally did everything to fix Sonic's design, right now Sonic looks rather good, his design is such a major improvement over the previous one because we already know that his previous design is awful. The writing in this movie is so good, the action is petty nice, also Jim Carrey as Dr. Eggman is just amazing and yet really well done. Sonic The Hedgehog didn't have any flaws unlike the very first trailer of the film and I am so happy that they fix Sonic's design. In the past, movies based off of video games are not doing quite well until Pokémon: Detective Pikachu, that movie was really great. Sonic The Hedgehog is another video game movie that also did really well, let's just hope that the fully animated Super Mario movie done by Illumination Entertainment (The studio behind Despicable Me, The Secret Life of Pets and Sing) will be just as good as Detective Pikachu and Sonic The Hedgehog.

When it comes to bringing beloved characters like Sonic to the screen, movie studios have to be extra careful. Fans don't want them to turn them into something completely different than the characters we all fell in love with and to take liberties that just don't make sense with the original story or game. This film, however, took the original game and added on to it without completely ruining it. There are so many references to the original Sega game and they all work out perfectly. Even the ""sanic"" meme made it's way into the film without it being a cheesy out of place joke, but part of the actual story.In terms of the story, it's not anything original or never done before. Sonic is an alien on our planet that the government wants to catch after he made his presence known, think E.T. but with Sonic and Elliot is a grown man who works as a police officer in his small town. They've written Sonic as a sort of rascal character who wants to experience life on earth rather than live in hiding and watch it from afar. He becomes friends with Tom, who he refers to as ""donut lord"" (James Marsden) while they try to escape the evil Doctor Eggman (Jim Carrey). The writers wrote Eggman as a looney FBI agent who is bent on catching Sonic to study him, you know the whole CIA and UFO kind of situation.Jim Carrey never fails and gives an excellent performance as the cartoonish villain. I'll admit he's not who I initially pictured playing Doctor Eggman, going based on the physical appearance of the character but I can't see anyone else playing him after watching the film. As ""Hop"" showed, James Marsden has good chemistry with CGI creatures. Everyone in the film is pretty cartoonish in their roles, not as great as Jim Carrey, but they're all on the same page in their performances. It took time to get used to Ben Schwartz as Sonic, mostly cos every time he spoke I pictured Jean-Ralphio from ""Parks and Recs"" talking. Still, he really immersed himself in the character and all in all it came together nicely.Now I would've rated this film at 6 stars because in, all honesty, that's really where it's at but the extra star was for the animation team that went back and revised Sonic before it was released. They didn't have to do that, they could've just went ahead and released the film with the previous scary Sonic, but they listened to the fans and made a CGI version of the character we all know and love. You can tell the team wanted to stay as close as possible to the game with every little reference they made to the original source. Even at the end of the film, the first half of the credits is done in the 8-bit style of the 1991 game, which I thought was really nice. The iconic 8-bit melody is also included in the film, a soft piano version. I really appreciated the work they put into this film, I can tell the people who worked on it love Sonic as much as the viewers do and that makes all the difference when making these types of film. I, personally, would love to see Hollywood stop making films of classic cartoons cos they fail miserably each and every time but Sonic was the rare win. Even before the film was released, the team showed us that they really wanted to do Sonic justice by fixing the atrocious character design they had originally settled on. I would say for other movie studios to take notes but the truth is, a movie either has a soul or it doesn't, and Sonic definitely had soul; something the other ""old cartoon turned to big budget movies"" lack. It wasn't perfect but it's lovable anyways. Also having a great actor like Jim Carrey on board doesn't hurt either.
I look forward to the sequel and definitely recommend this one, it's a feel good take on our favorite fast running hedgehog.",Sonic the Hedgehog
211,npjy83,Funny,7,15 February 2020,"Good storyline and explanation as to how a blue speaking hedgehog has entered the world.

212,Dello_,Fine. And that's ok,6,18 September 2020,"Sonic is a fine movie, nothing more. If I have to be honest the first part was interesting and it showed flashes of a good movie, but then it becomes only fine. The movie isn't particularly memorable and there's only one scene that left me like: ""ok, cool!"". But as I said there's no problem in being fine. The movie is short, light, fun and that's all you need if you don't know what to watch. Just keep in mind that is clear that they tried to appeal primarily the younger viewers and it could be a problem if you are expecting something even slightly more mature. If that isn't a problem for you and you have the curiosity to watch Sonic, go for it, it probably won't let you down.",Sonic the Hedgehog
213,hfreinoso,I thought it was going to suck..... WRONG,8,15 February 2020,"When seeing the original trailer and the early design of the character it was so bad that I knew it was going to be a flop. However instead of keeping and saying that people don't know anything. Paramount said OK they aren't happy we should make a change.....AND THEY DID. I am completely happy with the result. Everything from the opening they made Sonic more sympathetic than his video game counter part. You feel for the character and that what the movie should be doing. And Jim Carrey WAS Jim Carrey, the guy that acted like Ace Ventura and Dumb and Dumber. I thought this film was going to be a cash-grab for the Sonic character, like the Smurfs, Garfield, or any other video game movie...but at last... I was dead wrong it was a passion project they actually put effort in this film and I could tell. Detective Pikachu and Sonic the hedgehog (to me) are the best video game movies up to this very day. And YES I am proud of this result. 8/10",Sonic the Hedgehog
214,abalpn-99472,"Cool! Gotta go fast, gotta go fast! It's the fastest and funniest film ever! I feel the need for Sonic's speed! 👍",10,15 February 2020,"When I saw the first trailer, Sonic's first animation freaked me out. Yikes! 😱 The fans were angry about it. Three months ago, I saw the new trailer and Sonic's redesigned animation is even better. I was amazed and this is the true Sonic that everyone wanted to see in the theaters. The production of the film listened to the fans and the entire Internet.We just came back from watching the film and we enjoyed it. When I watched the film, it felt like I was playing the video game. I liked the plot and the story of this film. The action and the animation are great. There are a lot of humorous parts and the comedy is great. There are some emotional parts that make me want to cry. I felt a bit emotional at some of the scenes. There were some critics saying that they didn't like the plot and the film. The others said they liked it. In one of the TV spots, there were great comments about the film. I have a feeling that it won't win any awards but it's still good for the Sonic fans to enjoy watching. It was released yesterday on Valentine's Day and it will probably get all the time for a box office grossing profit. Ben Schwartz is cool and funny playing the voice of Sonic. James Marsden is great with his role and it's just like a buddy-cop film.Jim Carrey is crazy and hilarious as the demented Dr. Robotnik. In Batman Forever, he was a mad scientist and the Riddler; they're examples of Jim's character and that lead to being Robotnik. He was also hilariously crazy as Ernie ""Chip"" Douglas in The Cable Guy. Jim's character does his concept of slapstick comedy. Robotnik is always an evil genius in all the games. When I watch the serious Sonic cartoon (SATAM), Jim Cummings' character voice of Robotnik makes it dark and serious. Of course when I watch episodes from Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, I see Robotnik's slapstick comedy routine. Jim Carrey was the best choice to play Dr. Robotnik. He nailed this character to be demented and evil just like in the games. I like Jim Carrey and his psychical comedy. I've seen villains from movies or video games to be evil and dark. Some of the villains have the comedic formula like Jim Carrey's role of the Riddler or Mike Myers being Dr. Evil. The bad guy is always the villain whether they're dark, demented or in a comedic way.Anyway, this film doesn't have to be perfect. It's still fun for families and fans to enjoy watching. The film is rated PG and that makes it all right for everyone. This is Jeff Fowler's first film so I will give him credit for his work. Job well done, Mr. Fowler. 👏👏 I don't care about what the negative critics say about this film. Sonic is still my favorite video game hero of all time. I give the film a thumbs up (👍) and 10 stars (OR RINGS). That's my opinion and point of view. The sequel is coming soon and I can't wait. Tails is coming to join Sonic. I just heard that Knuckles is going to be in the sequel so I can't wait for that as well. Gotta speed, kid!",Sonic the Hedgehog
215,TheGreatMarkukini,Something wrong with the movies for children,4,12 April 2020,"I remember the storm that rose when first pictures of Sonic came out. It was a complete disaster. And then happened a miracle: the studio actually fully changed the design and here we have an amazing character that brings back warm memories from my childhood.The ultra fast hedgehog is undoubtedly the core of the story. A unique, one of a kind creature that comes to our world to discover its infinite possibilities and probably make some friends and enemies. The childish amazement to a tiniest thing shows you the small pleasures that can be found everywhere and it really cheers you up. I fell in love with this blue speedster immediately.What about other characters? Well, here comes a ""surprise"". Goofing is completely normal if you are cartoonish, but for real human beings it seems oddly inappropriate. James Marsden did a decent job but the writing somehow made his role too childish at some moments. Jim Carrey on the other side seemed to incorporate his signature goofing by himself. I don't remember how eccentric Dr. Robotnik was in the games but here the levels of adequacy were almost nonexistent. I literally wanted to skip his entire performance, and would rather enjoy Sonic running around doing random stuff than fighting this self-obsessed fake doctor.Once again I reassure myself in the fact that modern movies for children are becoming dumber every year. I would appreciate a solid plot that doesn't rely on actors playing the ape and expecting that the viewers are stupid enough to laugh at it.",Sonic the Hedgehog
216,careybrandon-41144,As expected,5,11 April 2020,"I really didn't think much of a sonic movie, and didn't even get into the drama of the characters re-design. I knew he looked awful and nothing like the original, but I don't care for video game movies. That being said this has to be one of the best video game movies ever made. Sonic is a pretty likable character for the most part and Jim Carrey is absolutely INSANE in the movie, every scene he's doing something hilarious and crazy. Over all, most kids, which is where this film is entirely aimed at, will love this film, and is quite watchable for parents and fans of the blue hedgehog.",Sonic the Hedgehog

218,refordgarry,"Keeping things as Blue as ""The Boys""",8,7 March 2020,"Despite having few original themes (Sonic excepted) it's still entertaining.
That ""baddie"" type who answers to Dr Robotnik, for example is 100% Dick Darstedly, or English actor Terry Thomas from 60 years back. But that's the whole point; it's not meant to be taken that seriously, and for this reason it's thoroughly entertaining. You can see the production staff did not start with a clip-board of tick-boxes for ""wokeness"", which, in a year of indigestible movie releases is, at least a change for the better.
There were one or two flat moments during the drama, but those did not impede the story-arch too much. Not that the audience were in much doubt as to where this one was heading. Good all-round family entertainment, with no lectures attached, thank God. Other directors TAKE NOTE.",Sonic the Hedgehog
219,CriticalOfEverything,Surpassed all of the negativity surrounding it; A genuinely fun movie.,6,15 February 2020,"Everyone knows about the old design, the terrible first trailer and all of that so I won't waste any time on that, but this movie was so much better than expected. It's obviously not a fantastic film, but as a fun fuelled kids film that respects the franchise and character of Sonic The Hedgehog, it's a pretty entertaining ride. There were quite a few jokes that worked, Jim Carrey stole the show as expected, Sonic himself was very likable and entertaining, and the film itself is just a lot of fun. Silly and corny at times, sure, but it's not a bad film by any means. The CGI was also pretty decent, minus a few scenes that could've been polished up a bit, but after the original design was revealed we were all bracing ourselves for the worst quality film possible. Thankfully, this movie did the impossible and trudged through all of the negativity and responded to the negative feedback very well. Even without the redesign (although it does make the movie a lot more cute and charming), the movie would still work as a competently made flick. And judging by the surprisingly great end credits scene (Not spoiling), we could be getting a sequel that I'd totally be down for.",Sonic the Hedgehog
220,valen060,Was I Satisfied? That Would Be An Understatement,9,15 February 2020,"What could I expect out of the famed SEGA mascot? Plenty! Sonic the Hedgehog proves to be the fastest critter in the land speeding his way around right into our world at the same time trying to save it from the evil Dr. Ivo Robotnik and his mechanized creations. As a kid who grew up in the 90s playing the classic games on the old 16-bit SEGA Genesis and even watching some different incarnations of Sonic on TV (including the early 2000s anime), I was stoked that a live-action film adaptation was already on its way.Casting Ben Schwartz as the voice of the speedy, blue hedgehog was something I didn't expect (since his involvement in Parks and Recreation is still fresh in mind) with good, cocky humor. His companion Sheriff Tom Wachowski (played by James Marsden) adds to the human side of Sonic longing to have a true friend in the human world. Seems Marsden has a penchant for being paired with CGI animated sidekicks in some of his movies and that's impressive.I've heard so much out of the hideous initial design shown several months prior to the final cut and I have to applaud the crew at Paramount for actually listening to we the fans on how awful Sonic looked (even the original Sonic Team in Japan weren't thrilled by it). The redesign sure helped plenty and it sure wasn't a waste of time. I also liked the nods to the original SEGA games because it provided a nice touch in the small town Sonic makes himself home within: ""Green Hills."" Seriously?Jim Carrey is an odd choice in playing the villain Robotnik. Granted, this is his own approach on the character and is not meant to be an actual physical resemblance as in the games. Yet, his quirks and eccentric personality is something Jim has done before in his past work. It's like he made Robotnik a cross between the eccentric Ace Ventura with the strategist and enigmatic Riddler. A genuine scene-stealer in my opinion. He stands out.Overall, I liked the entire setup of Sonic's world intertwining with Earth thanks to his signature rings. And the music soundtrack by Wiz Khalifa with his fellow music collaborators titled ""Speed Me Up?"" It's a catchy tune that sounds motivating and exceptional. I was also curious on where this film's story would lead next, judging by the ending (of course, no spoilers). There were fellow longtime fans like myself in our local theater, who went nuts in that auditorium, so it's safe to say that it can also lead newcomers to Sonic too. This is a video game movie that measures up in terms of a good family action comedy. It really puts the so-called ""video game curse"" to rest since Sonic now joins Detective Pikachu as more than just film adaptations to video games, but have proven themselves worthy to what could possibly lead to a... cinematic universe (Eh, Sakurai)? Fingers crossed. That thought still looms in my own mind...",Sonic the Hedgehog

had my doubts on this film but I was wrong it way better then detective pikachu that movie board me to death but this was made to be family friendly so glad it wasn't bloody and violent and Jim Carry as the bad guy robotic was perfectly portrayed this is how you make a video game movie and other film makers should take note and the human people you get to love unlike Godzilla king of monsters",Sonic the Hedgehog
223,drawlife,Finally a decent film based off a video game.,6,15 February 2020,"I never played SONIC, for me CRASH BANDICOOT was my thing, but my girlfriend is the SONIC fangirl so we went to go see the film for Valentine's Day. I went into this movie thinking it would be dumb and a waste of my time, but to my surprise I found myself entertained. Color me shocked, we finally got a decently made film based off a video game.Firstly I want to acknowledge the studio and the VFX artists. I know there was that huge uproar over his appearance in the first trailer and the studio heard and fixed the problem. I want people to understand that it's not easy to just redo an entire look of a CGI character. It takes blood, sweat, and tears to model, rig, composite, and animate a living, breathing character so bravo to the VFX artists who probably lost a lot of sleep over this.Ben Schwartz is great in voicing the character. He brings a lot of energy and charm to Sonic. There's a sense of loneliness to him which makes him somewhat endearing. Plus he's got a lot of wit and self-awareness.Jim Carrey however will entertain the adults who can't sit through the child/family friendly vibe. He is all in on his performance and it was kind of a return to form for him in many ways. He out-cartoons the cartoon, and shows that he's still got it. I quite liked it. Rest of the cast, James Marsden, Tika Stumper, etc. are quite good as well.Is the story innovating, no cause it does heavily rely on tropes to the point that every development is predictable from a mile away, but nothing is particularly done badly, but none of it stands out either. Felt like some of the subplots were lacking material, like for example Marsden's character Tom is accused of being a domestic terrorist as he is aiding Sonic escaping Dr. Robotnic, and later on as the film progressed it's never really explored or have a huge impact in the story.Again, the film is very tame, and very harmless. Action sequences are fine, they have a been there and done that feel, but it still works. A lot of foundations are in place so going forward I would expect a less formulaic plot.To sum it up, it's a nostalgia trip for the fans of the 90's video game icon plus a vintage Jim Carrey performance that will kill 100 minutes of your time. A pretty by-the-numbers movie for kids that does the bare minimum, but there are clearly enough people working behind the scenes trying their best to elevate it.For the SONIC fans, stay after the credits. My audience seemed entertained and I suspect that this will be a decent hit critically and financially to warrant more films.6/10",Sonic the Hedgehog

The movie understands what it is, and doesn't try to be something it is not, which is good. It doesn't take itself too seriously. There are some problems in the logic, as there is never a sense of real urgency in Sonic as he travels by car to San Francisco (even when he can clearly run properly again). Tom being all over the news never has a real impact in the plot.
The conflict in the movie is actually there and keeps it interesting. Sonic is very charming and fun to watch. Overall, the movie is enjoyable and good.Oh, and Tails cameo was so great. Made me super excited.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Tika Sumpter and Melody Niemann brought more touching moments. Neal McDonough had one scene and he was the stock Neal McDonough non-lead character for that one scene.The movie is light on action and more about comedy and the warm fuzzies.I'm really glad they did the redesign. It's really easy to love this Sonic.Jim Carey does not ruin the movie.The movie has like 2 epilogues before the credits and one super-awesome mid-credits scene, but if you stay to the end of the boring section of the credits, there is no post credits scene there.

Needless to say, I am a big fan of Sonic the Hedgehog and I was really pumped and ready for this movie!I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I really enjoyed how Sonic was given a back story on his home planet. That was a different side of him that was really interesting to see. He was really talkative, but it was in an exciting, curious, and comedic way. The visual effects of how Sonic looked and moved were on point; I have no complaints there. On the other hand, I was not too happy with what was done with his notorious Spin Dash signature move. The Spin Dash looked amazing, but it sounded underplayed.Dr. Robotnik was entertaining. I was hoping to see a little more of him on screen though. I am hoping if there is a sequel, there will be more of a clash between both Dr. Robotnik and Sonic.The movie was humorous, but it was more kid humorous than it was adult humorous.

232,TheCasualReviewer,Jim Carrey back in form!,6,3 March 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Police Officer, Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) helps Sonic (Ben Schwartz) escape from the evil technological genius, Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey)REVIEW:
This was definitely an enjoyable experience. Yes, it's clearly made for a younger demographic, but if you go into it thinking otherwise then I'm not really sure if there's much hope left for you.
I'm so happy that this wasn't one of those extremely corny-made kids movies. There's definitely jokes that are corny in this, but it wasn't unbearable. You have those kids films that you sit through and just by the way it's made, as an adult you're just itching to leave. I didn't feel that at all. James Marsden was a great compliment to Jean Ralphio as Sonic (that's a Parks and Rec reference for those who don't know). Then you have Jim Carrey who is just absolutely, positively delightful as Jim Carrey. Not a typo. He's actually back to being Jim Carrey and I love it. This movie hinted at a sequel and I'm excited just to see him again. I really hope he does his thing again, but also for other films.
If you have kids, if you're a fan of Sonic or even if you just want a fun popcorn experience, I recommend this film. 6.5/10.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Story actually wasn't bad either. Great chi and Jim Carrey was great. As a huge fan of him, this was the perfect role for him. A great excuse for him to step back into this wacky style of acting. Since I'm not a fan, when the first trailer came out I didn't seen a problem with sonic's look. Now after the movie, there was definitely a problem with his old look. Its definitely much improved.

Like you had fun, it was awesome while it lasted but when it's finished it's like really? I admit I liked this movie, but as much as I liked it there's a lot I didn't like. I liked the pace, the chemistry between sonic and the side character, I liked how they handled the story. The jokes can be funny sometimes, other times they don't land and just seem very corny. I thought Jim Carrey as robotnic was ok just felt they should have actually casted someone that looks like him. Sonic comes off as a creep, spying on people, Hidding from them for like YEARS. And for some reason, when he ACTUALLY needs to hide, he doesn't, for a guy with super speed he also can't dodge a tranquilizer bullet? I mean the entire movie shows him dodging missiles and bar fights, but he can't dodge a tranquilizer bullet? A lot of the logic just doesn't add up.

Yeah, it was predictable and has that ""old-generic-simple-story"" but I had a good time watching this film. I think we can all admit we only went to see the movie to see Sonic's redesign after that ""disaster"" of that #1 trailer, but does recreating Sonic's looks makes the movie better?(These was my thoughts, by the way). Sonic is the movie was actually pretty good. He was always energize, funny, and sometimes a little emotional, too. The human characters were okay, but I just really wish film studios would stop bringing animated characters on live-action screen. The only character that stole the show in this movie is Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik/Eggman. It really does have that 90s Jim Carrey's charm to it and I find his character, crazy, funny, and threating. Although, is a good film with annoying cliché plot that's aiming for kids.",Sonic the Hedgehog
237,juliendussault,Awful,2,28 April 2020,"I had high hopes for this film. With the success and the surprising detective Pikachu in 2019, I thought that said that might have take a note from detective Pikachu and actually tried to make something that was both funny, and actually good but obviously that was a total failure.Not only is this movie incredibly stupid, it's a gear towards children and not the real fans of Sonic the Hedgehog which are adults by now, but they wouldn't appreciate this film at all, and Jim Carrey was horrendous as Dr. Robotonic and a embarrassment.This movie is all around horrible and I couldn't even make it though 30 minutes of it and you won't either if you're sane.",Sonic the Hedgehog
238,MovieWarfare,Another step in the right direction for video game movies,7,15 February 2020,"I don't want to review this movie the same way I review other movies as this is a kids film, clearly aimed at kids.Video game movies tend to be horrible. The only remotely decent video game movie has been Detective Pikachu which was not great but a step in the right direction. Likewise, Sonic the Hedgehog continues this step in the right direction but is not great. The movie itself is an enjoyable time and will keep you having a good time for its 90 minute runtime.I am not a huge fan of Sonic but I have played a fair amount of Sonic games to know enough about him. I can with confidence say that this will no doubt satisfy Sonic fans. It feels really clear that the director and people behind this movie actually care about Sonic. This movie in no way feels like a cash grab (especially considering they delayed the movie and redesigned Sonic to satisfy fans). Some of the things I enjoyed in this movie include Ben Schwartz as Sonic who completely embodies the Personality of Sonic. Additionally, the other best part of this movie is Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik. Seeing Jim Carrey give a performance that is reminiscent of his earlier days was as enjoyable as you expect it to be. James Marsden also does a good job and delivers some good chemistry with Sonic. Overall, the human characters are actually all okay which is surprising as usually in movies with CGI characters as focus; the human characters tend to be really bad (looking at you Godzilla King of monsters). The action scenes are fun and enjoyable, especially when Sonic does his slow mo scenes.The movie has flaws but it might not really matter that much considering it is a movie aimed at kids but adults who grew up with Sonic will no doubt watch this. The story is very simplistic but there are so many things that happen in the movie that don't seem to have any consequences. For example, the amount of destruction happening seems to result in no consequences. The movie also uses a lot of cliches that have occurred in so many movies by now, it makes the movie very predictable. The movie also has so many weird product placement that are so blatant that it genuinely makes you wonder (you're going to come out of this movie thinking about Olive Garden for sure...). Finally, kids might not enjoy this movie cause at the Cinema I was at; there was a kid who couldn't focus or bother keeping their eyes on the movie so that might be saying something.In the end, Sonic fans are going to enjoy this movie, people who grew up in the 90s are going to enjoy this movie, fans of Jim Carrey are definitely going to enjoy this movie, and kids/families are going to enjoy this movie (most kids anyway). You are going to come out of this movie having a good time and isn't that the most important thing for a kids movie anyways?",Sonic the Hedgehog

And to say it's whole shtick is nostalgia it didn't tweak to nostalgia heartstrings enough.I was a Nintendo guy anyway!",Sonic the Hedgehog

241,Clank_Zoka,It Could of Been A Lot Better..,6,16 February 2020,"I have never been a fan of Sonic, I never played any of the games or have that much knowledge on the franchise, but I know it's pretty big in terms of fan base, now with this 2020 Live-Action adaptation directed by Jeff Fowler who directed the Oscar nominated short film ""Gopher Broke"", ""The Goon"" and was also part of Spike Jonze's ""Where the Wild Things Are"" in the visual effects team, we also got big names like Jim Carrey and James Marsden, along with Ben Schwartz as the voice of the Blue Hedgehog, so it sounds like it'll be quite a entertaining and fun film for the family and maybe for Sonic fans, since Fowler and the Paramount team listened to the feedback of the first teaser that made sonic look scary as hell, but now they changed his design and it looks pretty good, so I saw the first yesterday and.... ehh it's fine, nothing amazing or anything terrible, just kind of bland and nothing special, so let's talk about it.Sonic (Ben Schwartz) comes to our world as fast as anything, however he is on the run from the evil Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey), so he has to stay low and avoid getting caught or worse destroyed, so he comes across Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) who is a sheriff, they both have to stick together and avoid Dr. Robotnik, now.., this sounds kinda fun on paper, in execution however..., it could of been a lot better, the story feels like it's just an entire cliche, using lots of really dull and obvious jokes which most of them don't even land, most of the scenes are just filler to fill in the run time, which makes it long, not very funny and kind of pointless, the action is fun I guess but it's kind of nothing special, it just feels like another basic kids film that doesn't do anything new besides fan service and to keep their attention, however it was pretty funny at times mainly because of Carrey and Schwartz' performance, also I did find some of jokes a little funny and at least I wasn't bored, so there's that.., but it's really not enough to get in engaged with, it tries too hard to make you care about what's going on, but you know exactly what will happen, so why bother?, Jeff Fowler seems to have some care for the franchise, but this film doesn't show that much of the effort or heart that could of made this so much more enjoyable, but it's far too safe, not that funny or interesting, kind of bland and dull, but at least it has cool action and decent comedy, but it's still not good enough to make this film go as fast as Sonic.The visuals are nice, the CGI is actually not too bad, Sonic's design is awesome, it stays true to the original design of the character, the fur texture, the expressions, this is what it should of been throughout the production, instead of that scary as hell old design, the CGI on Robotnik's robots are cool looking even if they don't look very convincing, they have creative and nice designs, Robotnik's costume looks almost like the Video-Game villain's suit, but with some slight changes, the visuals also help make the film more exciting and fun to watch, the rest however are... um... ehh, they are basically nothing special but it's decently shot and it looks fine even if it's a little bland looking, so I guess the visuals are the best element in the film, but again, it's also nothing special or outstanding, but the team did the best they can with what they can could with the visuals.The characters are a mixed bag, some are funny and memorable, the rest are pointless and forgettable, the ones I like were Sonic and Dr. Robotnik, both are hilarious with personality and charm, they both stand out from the rest, because the other characters are pretty generic and boring, Tom, Maddie Agent Stone and a few others are really forgettable, they do get a giggle a little but nothing else that stands out, however even if you like or dislike the characters, the acting is actually really great!, Ben Schwartz is an excellent choice for Sonic in the what he talks and how fast he talks also, Jim Carrey is just having a absolute blast with his role as Dr. Robotnik, James Marsden is pretty great as Tom, same can be said with Tika Sumpter as Maddie, everyone else is fine but Schwartz and Carry stand out the most with their role.Ya know there's a part of me that wishes this film was a lot better, but then knowing how much backlash this film got and how long we waited for this.... eh, I guess it could of been worse, Sonic the Hedgehog is a perfectly serviceable family film that has good CGI, a great cast that fit their roles quite well, Sonic himself is quite likeable and charming and Robotnik is devilishly enjoyable, I like the cool action and the humour is decent at best, but despite the positives I have for the film, it still suffers from unfunny modern, toilet, reference humour, a few characters are bland and uninteresting, the plot is a big cliche and it's very predictable, so.. I guess if you love the games, you'll either love or hate this flick, however this is mainly a kids/family film, I'm kind of in the middle with this, this could of been a better Video-Game movie, but I am glad I saw it, so hopefully it's sequel (if it ever comes out) may be better, but hey, who knows.I'm afraid to say that this film gets a 6.2/10.",Sonic the Hedgehog
242,Rayofsun71,Took me by surprise,9,15 February 2020,I honestly thought this was gonna suck. But it didn't. Resident Evil was definitely a change for video game movies. The franchise had its good and bad movies. Then came Rampage which was actually entertaining. And now we have Sonic the Hedgehog. I have been a fan of the games for a while and loved this movie. I am very willing to see it again. I think the curse of bad video game movies has officially been broken. 9/10,Sonic the Hedgehog

They laughed through the whole movie. I found myself laughing multiple times. The story was charming and funny. Jim Carrey was, well, Jim Carrey.

244,curzon_dax,People that give it 4/10 or lower are exaggerating.,7,8 March 2020,It was a fun little movie that did what it aimed to do relatively well (it was light humor targeted to people wanting something simplistic and it did that relatively well). I'd give it a 7 (or more strictly a 6) because it must lose some points for lack of originality and a few jokes being too forced and not all of the performances being great.,Sonic the Hedgehog

252,Abranth-d,Was a lot of pg 13 fun !,7,28 February 2020,"Here's my review of Sonic the hedgehog . So unless you've been living under a rock or if you don't use the internet to scroll past memes on Facebook ( yes , it's a meme platform than a social media now ) then you very well know about the initial reactions for the Sonic trailer. When the first trailer for Sonic came out an year ago , the design for Sonic was criticized heavily cause he looked more like a hedgehog if he was in that God awful cats movie. So the makers postponed the release just cause the internet wasn't happy about it , which I thought was really great about them , cause the movie was meant for the fans. And an year later Sonic's better than ever. I've played a couple of Sonic games growing up and I liked how they were able to build a story around a very small lore that the game had , like in the game , Sonic's going around collecting these rings and in the movie they are portals , also the map from the game is his place of origin here , they even made a little origin to his red shoes and a lot else that I really liked. The story is set in this little town where Sonic is living among humans out of sight in his crib which looks like bugs bunnys . He's lived without interaction from people for a very long time . He runs too fast one day and causes a blackout which brings in Dr robotnik played masterfully by Jim Carrey while balancing the fine line between comedically evil and eccentric to go after Sonic. So Sonic teams up with James Marsden ( aka cyclops from x men ) and goes on a buddy road trip with him while having a bro bonding involving bromance , some neat dialogue and a lot of kids movie fun ! . The cgi is used very well in this movie and had shades of the Quicksilver slo mo scene from days of Future past. The movie was fast phased , had witty dialogue , a cool soundtrack , pop cultural references and jokes which land. In the end Sonic the edgehog is a kids movie which also strikes nostalgia for retro gamers and aims at being something rewatchble without having such a huge story to tell , like space jam and Spy kids.",Sonic the Hedgehog
253,Ingrouille181,"This movie was completely fine, but great for kids.",5,18 February 2020,"A YouTuber I watch put my thoughts together perfectly by saying ""It's a movie that made me not hate it"". Closest I got to being a Sonic fan was playing Sonic Heroes on the original Xbox when I was much younger. Great game btw. I completely skipped Detective Pikachu last year, and I was gonna skip this, but I wanted to see a movie and it was either this or Birds of Prey.This movie tells the story of Sonic, a hedgehog from another world who can run faster than the eye can see. One day, after losing control of his powers, Sonic pursued by the evil mad doctor Robotnik who wants to capture him and harvest him for his own power. Sonic needs the help of a kindly ambitious police officer Tom Wachowski.Let's talk about Sonic first: Glad the studio fixed the look of Sonic, and made Sonic look like Sonic in their movie about Sonic. Ben Schwartz is also a good choice for the voice of Sonic, it reminded me of Sonic's voice from the Sonic Heroes game, so good job. I like Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik. This is a set up movie so he doesn't look a lot like the characters' iconic self, but (Spoiler) he does end up looking close to his video game character. I like the look of Robotnik's gadgets too, . I also liked how they visualised Sonic's teleport rings in this. The movie employs little slow motions scenes, like Quicksilver from Days of Future Past. The way that Sonic's body looks when he's generating electricity on it looked pretty realistic.The movie is funny here and there for the adults, but it's definitely more geared towards kids. The plot is very simple and you know what's gonna happen. If you wanna shut your kids up for 2 hours, this does the trick. This movie was pitched as a Sonic movie set in the real world, but it would've been better setting it in the otherworldly environments we got to see at the beginning of the movie. Robotnik should've been like Dr. Sivana in the Shazam! movie; have him be this young genius who wants to go to this magical world where Sonic lives and have that be his origin ark for the following movie, at least he wouldn't come across as another bland moustache twirling villain, which he LITERALLY was in this. I will say though that Jim Carrey looked like he was having a BLAST playing this character, and I admire that. As for James Marsden, he's completely fine in this. Don't know if he's a fan of Sonic or he just needed a paycheck.old school Sonic fans will enjoy it enough, but I don't know if they'd want this movie to be the start of some Sonic Cinematic Universe thing. Overall, this movie is perfectly fine, not bad, not great. I would've preferred this movie to be something more myself, but I'm not a Sonic fan and I won't lose any sleep over it. I get the feeling that Detective Pikachu will give me more, but we'll see. For now I'll give it a 5 out of 10.",Sonic the Hedgehog

255,impendingdd,Fun family film,7,21 March 2020,"Video game movies have a high chance of sucking. This movie managed not to. Carrey is the best he's been in years, the CGI was well done and not overused. The film has great family values and not overbearing with adult jokes or pop culture references (There are just a tiny few). Sonic is rather funny and even cute. I had a blast seeing this in theaters, it's a sweet little film. To state the obvious, yes they saved this film with the redesign. Many kudos to them for making the change. Ultimately, a pretty good movie for the family, and I would imagine it does very little to disappoint a lifelong Sonic fan. I imagine the sequel will delve more into Sonic's world than the human world. Could have been a disaster, folks.",Sonic the Hedgehog

259,Otuoacheampong97,Emotional and sentimentally strong,7,24 March 2020,"Sonic the hedgehog is one of the best video game adaptations starting this decade. The film stars Ben Schwartz as the voice and main character in the film. He is hunted on Earth by Dr. Robotnik a technology and robotic freak played by Jim Carrey, as he tries to capture, assess and terminate Sonic.
The plot follows Sonic a blue hedgehog with a super fast gifted speed. His speed was given for one reason to run. Running from enemies and hunters with the aim of capturing him and knowing the source of his power or just because of mere jealousy.
He once evaded capture through a magic time travel coin. Sonic finds himself on Earth a place called Green Hills where he blends in but in shadows. Loneliness is killing this colourful, adorable and funny alien hedgehog. However, his time on Earth is shortened when a freak robotic scientist Dr Robotnic, is hired by the United State government to investigate a high grade power cut. Sonic needs to do what he does best, to run and escape to a different world. The series of his escape crossed him with the path of a local police officer Tom played by James Marsden, whom Sonic admires. The officer helps Sonic, and the two are hunted by Dr. Robotnic. Would Sonic accept his loneliness life on Earth and escape this time or this is just an opportunity for him to reveal himself to the people of Green Hill?
The film is set in a typical green vegetation rural area which gives it a sense of reality from the video game.
The video effects are electric and a pulse heater. This makes the film awesome and speedful.
One aspect worth praising is the theme song. Which makes the film rhythmic and enjoyable.
The performance from Jim Carrey derserves laudable praises.He was able to milk the best of comedies for his character. At a point in time his role stole the show and took the film to a different unexpecting level.
In all, Sonic the Hedgehog was emotional, simple and colourfully brilliant.
I strongly urge fans from the 90's to stream and enjoy the best video game character of our time.",Sonic the Hedgehog

262,films-22537,A really good video game movie.,8,20 February 2020,"This movie seemed doomed after the first trailer dropped, but the studio listened to the fans and the redesign was great. The movie went by at sonic speed. It was funny and true to the source. Jim Carrey was on his A-game and the open-ended final scene worked on me because I'd love to see a sequel. The negatives would start with the script, it's bad, clichéd at points and uninspired at others, there also seems to be a lack of direction in the genre they're trying to commit too. Also, the chemistry between James Marsden and Tika Sumpter, there scenes together were distractingly bad. Tika was fine with the scenes with her sister, albeit neither had a lot to do and Marsden had more chemistry with the CGI Sonic, which if the latter weren't true the movie wouldn't have worked. Context matters and coming off of the disastrous first trailer, the bad reviews and low expectations for video game movies all factored in to me highly recommending this, but if your expectations aren't as low going in, you may not feel the same way.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Go in piece. I have no background with this character or its franchise and I did not find that the movie engaged me on any level. I like Jim Carrey but he was being a standard Jim Carrey character with nothing new there. The animated character was full of trite observations that are standard wiseguy cracks, also nothing new.I'm not going to dissect the plot such as it is because why bother? It'll just make it look like I expected plot, character development, any kind of logical cohesion, etc. I'm not sore about it, just uninvolved.All I'm saying is that it wasn't for me. If I had a couple of interested grandkids, I'd've cheerfully kept my mouth shut except for the popcorn spillover. All I'm saying here is that if you're not into Sonic, you won't be into this flick.

266,thomasmitilis1995,I'M SONIC. A LITTLE BALL OF SUPER ENERGY IN AN EXTREMELY HANDSOME PACKAGE...,5,3 May 2020,"~The voice acting of Ben Schwartz is brilliant and gives Sonic a lovable personality.
~The design of Sonic is good (it's definetly a huge improvement over the awful first design).
~Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik is over the top, something that fits within the content of this film. In other words, he embraces the silliness of his character and his dance segment is fantastic.
~Nice chemistry between Sonic and James Marsden's character.
~The jokes that are related to the power and the nature of Sonic such as the ping-pong gags, the antithesis between Sonic and a random turtle etc. are delightful. However, the most entertaining part is the bar sequence and especially the slow motion moment (similar to that of Quicksilver from X-men in this case).
~Nice fun service like the cameo of Tails, the way that Sonic acquires his red shoes or the sound of the rings.
~The subtle pop culture references such as the love about Keanu Reeves and the comments about Speed and Fast and Furious.CONS:
~The story is generic and formulatic and the general audience may feel bored at some points due to the lack of tension. (it's a movie for children after all).
~There is no consistency in the plot. For example, in the beginning Sonic hides his existence from the world but after a while the film forgets about this. Furthermore, he and Tom (Marsden) never try to hide from the villain and the government.
~Some logical issues. For instance, Sonic spends most of the time in a car but his main power is speed. Moreover, at some point he should go in the top of a building to reobtain his rings but he doesn't think to go up there with his powers.
~The whole friendship stuff isn't interesting at all and the moments when Sonic feels sad aren't effective.
~The final showdown is underwhelming and the CGI is sloppy.
~The fart joke is unnecessary and the references to Olive Garden are forced.",Sonic the Hedgehog

BEST MOVIE EVER!
Everything about this movie was awesome and it had a lot of references to the old games. The script was solid, the characters were spectacular, and I think everything fit together nicely.The only drawback for me coming from a guy who has played the sonic games for a long time, was the fact that it had too much Pop culture jokes in it. I mean for it being a sonic movie I was hoping for more sonic lore and less of this becoming a ""Shrek Clone"".Other than that, this movie was impressive coming from Jeff Fowler's first theatrical film on the directors chair. It was great and I really think it's movie worth watching.One word of advice, stay behind during the credits for a special surprise character.. you won't regret it 😉😉😉",Sonic the Hedgehog

It's family friendly, fast paced and has a few laughs for adults and kids. Jim Carrey plays a great Dr. Eggman and Ben Schwartz is a good voice actor for Sonic. Sonic's new design is quite charming and his character works. The whole establishment of friendship of Tom and Sonic and the plot from getting to California seems very rushed and some logic wouldn't make sense to the average moviegoer.

Sonic was a big part of my childhood from the games to the show sonic x so when I heard that they were making a sonic movie I was worried and after the first trailer I had lost all hope with this movie because of the horrible design and just how bad the movie looked. But after the second trailer came out and had an updated design for sonic I had some hope that this movie was gonna be good and I'm happy to say that sonic the hedgehog is a great movie. The cast in this movie from Jim Carrey as doctor eggman to james marsden as Tom everybody in this movie gives an great performance but the main star of this movie is Ben Schwartz as sonic he completely embodies the personal of sonic and his performance is fantastic. This movie is also extremely funny and had me bursting into fits of laughter at many times. This movie also has some really heartfelt moments which is surprising for a sonic the hedgehog movie. The movie also has a great message. The pacing in this movie is great to and there is never a dull moment. The music in this movie is great too. The only problem I have with this movie is the product placement which is extremely not needed in this movie.

It is a film for kids and has silly things, but you have to get into the story (which is quite simple) and you enjoy it a lot. The best scene is at the bar with the Quicksilver/Flash one moment.

271,ivo_shandor,Rather see a sequel...,3,2 September 2020,"It's odd that Sonic the Hedgehog is a big hit at the box office, the best opening for a video game movie ever they say, considering that I was in a mostly empty theater. After seeing the big box office numbers, you start to see the cracks in the facade. The movie feels like the worlds biggest practical joke, like an evil mastermind plan by Doctor Robotnik himself. So brilliant, yet so diabolical, and everyone fell for it. You start by releasing a terrible trailer, watch all that internet hate, negativity and drama roll in, ""fix"" the movie with some slight CGI changes, but nothing else, say to the fans that we heard them loud and clear and that we respect them, then just sit back and watch all those haters come crying in droves to see it. The public perception of the movie changed on a dime, just like that, just as fast as Sonic is. They were tricked, thinking they changed things for the better, desperate for respect and to be treated for the better, blissfully ignorant to anything to the contrary. Perception plus desperation equals box office domination. Even with all the ""fixing"" going on, everything else that was bad was left untouched and left to rot. We get an incredibly generic plot, nothing exciting, lame jokes, blatant, annoying product placement, ripoffs of far more entertaining movies, and only hints of things that would have made for a much more entertaining movie. As far as positives, Jim Carrey is actually pretty fun and is easily the best thing in the movie. People would probably think it's sad and annoying that he's trying to recapture his 90s glory days with his overly comedic chops, but it's surprisingly refreshing and it seems to work. James Marsden is doing the best with what he's given. Everything else is run straight into the ground. Clearly it wants to be a buddy road trip, but considering one of them has super speed and could solve the plot within seconds, we have to drag everything out. For being a movie about a super fast hedgehog fighting robots, there's nothing exciting whatsoever, nothing of note or worthiness to be called a real movie. Our only hint of joy comes from other Sonic characters being there for a sequel that could be infinitely better than what we got, with a proper Robotnik, and a much more interesting set up. This is the rare occasion where I feel that a sequel would be much more fun to see.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Bringing to life the blue energy ball that is Sonic.This origin story has enough material to draw from for the producers to not only make it their own. But to create an iteration of this SEGA franchise that doesn't change the fundamentals. That of a supersonic hedgehog and his friends who work together saving the world from an ""egg-centric"" scientist bent on creating a robotic paradise.The characters were very well cast and humorous. Jim Carrey was his usual stellar self and made Dr Robotnik into a very interesting antagonist with alot more personality than his video-game counterpart. Sonic was Sonic!

But what a turn around, Sonic looks brilliant and is quite lovable as a character, and Jim Carrey is as expected brilliant as Eggman. The movie has some good action scenes and made me laugh a good few times. There's also a lot of fan service or lore that didn't seem present in the initial reveal, even the smallest things like Sonic dropping his rings as injured.
There's one or two other exciting nods to the franchise that I can't mention, but in all an enjoyable movie to watch (and no wonder it beat Birds of prey).
It's worth noting nearly every movie that's a video game adaptation is awful and strays from original material (awful resident evil movies, the infamous street fighter etc) this is the only other video game adaptation movie I've seen that I can't fault (the other being Silent Hill).",Sonic the Hedgehog
276,kellindil-759-448828,real fun animation,9,8 November 2020,"Not only for gamers, whole movie was really fun and I enjoyed it from beginning till end. I don't get the poor scores, it was all how it was supposed too for sonic fans",Sonic the Hedgehog
277,huntersmithx,A fun family film that could've been a whole lot worse.,7,19 February 2020,"In some ways; ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" aka ""ADHD the movie"", appears to be one of those standard family films that would've came out in the 2000's; except that now in 2020 it has better production values and a bright, harmless script to save from what could've been a disasterous video game adaptation.Ben Schwartz excellently lends his voice to the loveable Sega console icon Sonic. Joining him is everyman actor James Marsden, in a fun spot as the speed trap sheriff who assists him in his journey in escaping the diabolical Dr. Robotnik, played by Jim Carrey in a joyous return to form for his 90's/2000's roots.The story is formulaic and not all of the jokes land; but nevertheless enjoyable in the right ways, this could potentially be a sign for strong video game based movies in the future.Grade- B",Sonic the Hedgehog
278,prietoheitor,The fans will love this I'm sure!,8,16 January 2021,"Sonic the hedgehog had everything to be another bad video game adaptation, but in addition to the new remake in the protagonist's convincing look, the characters are great, (no comment) Jim carrey acting as Dr Robotinik is hilarious and the plot is decent, standards those familiar movies, but enough to please everyone who is a fan of the character that is a milestone in the history of games!",Sonic the Hedgehog
279,piggulu,Surprisingly well done,8,15 February 2020,"Like most when the first news and trailer broke, I was dumbfounded at how they could make a live-action movie, given the track record of such game films. I remained skeptical right as the movie started, but it had won me over not too long after. Is it faithful to the series? Definitely not, but it does it's own thing pretty well.The plot is nothing special, and you'll have to just overlook some things (like how Sonic knows a ton of pop culture references despite basically being a hermit and somehow doesn't know what a ""bucket list"" is, and the obnoxious product placements), but the action and majority of the comedy is done well, although Sonic himself gets a little overly hyper and annoying sometimes. But despite initial reservations, it didn't feel too dumbed down for children. Jim Carrey shines, of course, although he exuded too much Ace Ventura than I thought suited the character. Everybody else is good.There's some good fanservice with minor nods to the franchise, as well as an awesome end credits. Overall, definitely entertaining and worth a watch.",Sonic the Hedgehog
280,bharath-karthikeyan,One of the better video game adaptions,6,27 April 2020,"This movie would have been easily added into the trashpile of flop video game adaptions if not for Jim Carrey as Dr.Robot, period.
I appreciate that the movie makers listened to critics and redrew Sonic the way fans wanted to see in the big screen, so some stars on my rating duly added for that fact.I sincerely don't understand why a movie on Sonic a platformer video game really had to be made. We all know SEGA and SONIC are legendary but not every legendary character needs to be on the big screen unless there is this epic back story which needs to be told. Resident evil and silent hill had one, definitely not sonic.My rating of 6 stars is totally justified for a story I actually forgot after I started writing this review for a movie I watched 2 days ago. Good couch popcorn material.",Sonic the Hedgehog
281,robinhio84_,Surprisingly good,8,25 December 2020,"This is a good watch why?First of all, Sonic looks good (after all), the humor is cheesy, but there are many relevant cultural references in there. And most of those actually land really well.
The story is bit chewed out, but somehow it doesn't turn into a drag. It was entertaining throughout.They probably could have gotten a bit more into some characters, but for that there are sequals.Don't forget to watch till the credits are rolling ;-) Sonic is good until the very end!!",Sonic the Hedgehog

285,chrisrs123,A Whole Lot of Fun,9,24 March 2020,"I don't think anyone expected the Sonic movie to be any good but it actually is! It's fun, it's fast paced and it has a lot of heart. James Marsden is instantly likeable, Sonic is well realised and Jim Carrey is playing Jim Carrey with a moustache. It's exactly the right level for kids to love without annoying their accompanying adults. It's heartwarming and exciting. Carrey is predictably show-stealing and as insane as ever in the best way. It's not exactly groundbreaking but I didn't just enjoy Sonic the Hedgehog, I'm actually excited for Sonic the Hedgehog 2!",Sonic the Hedgehog

288,Golightly678,Tried twice. Just can't watch this,4,14 April 2021,"I gave it a good effort. I enjoy Carey and the sonic story entertained me when younger. This is a big pass. The story makes no sense, echoing the other review that points out that humans just fall in line with this characters antics. The Sonic was done well but i find it overly annoying. I don't know why children's characters must be annoying to everyone else. I got so many when i was little that i still enjoy 35 years later. Oh what Hollywood has come to. $$$
I wanted to like it. But eventually I gave up trying with this one. The over enthusiastic reviews make me raise an eyebrow. (Production houses often have these padded to their advantage) that further makes me want to not watch this. Why trick us into believing it's worth the effort? Just makes viewers feel jipped.",Sonic the Hedgehog

290,RuriGokou,Sonic the Wokehog,1,13 March 2021,"I just watched Detective Pikachu last month so I sort of had a feeling that this movie was going to be a turd as well. I was right. A lot of stuff happens but it's all very boring. It's just the same as every other guy and his CGI buddy movie. Did the people making this movie know anything about the games and the Sonic universe at all? I grew up playing the Genesis and Dreamcast games, and this movie has nothing to do with those games at all.I hate what they've done to Sonic's personality. He's supposed to be cool and have an attitude. But the Sonic in this movie is just wimpy and acts like a 12 year old.This movie didn't need human characters. Just love how they shoehorned in the typical mixed race relationship for some of those wokeness points.Maybe small children and women might like this movie, but if you're a fan of the older games you'll be scratching your head in confusion over who this movie was actually made for.",Sonic the Hedgehog

292,deothor,boring and childish,3,15 March 2020,"Ok I know 'childish' is kinda lowblow of an argument, considering movie was made only for kids (unfortunately), but it's ""I farted, now laugh"" kind of thing.
Unfortunately Jim Carrey is bad in here.. I dunno if it's because of his jokes or his characters personality, but watching him was seriously annoying.
He plays as whacky-serious genius, yet it feels that if you removed the whacky part he'd be much much better. He'd be intimidating... Ah whatever.The story is also quite meh. It starts with Sonics past and then it follow the plot of B/C rate movie.This could have been something pretty good, but that wouldn't bring as much money, so instead we have idiotic movie with bad humor...",Sonic the Hedgehog
293,legonerdy,Design Was Not the Problem,2,14 February 2020,"They fixed the Sonic character design. Too bad the real problem was the script.The inciting incident has absolutely zero meaning, the conflict makes NO sense, the B plot is asinine, and the only good character in the whole movie is relegated to roughly a half hour of screen time.If you have kids, they'll be entertained. Otherwise, save yourself the pain.",Sonic the Hedgehog
294,Here_2_Review,Go see it!,7,16 February 2020,"By no means is this movie some Shakespearean work of art, but is a very good video game movie and is good as a Sonic movie. Had a lot more emotion and sincerity than I thought it would, had me emotional in a few points. The target audience is two kinds of people: obviously kids and anyone of any age that enjoyed the Sonic games.Gives this one a chance!",Sonic the Hedgehog
295,Andy_MJD,"Aww geez, I guess",5,5 March 2020,"This film is painfully bland in just about every regard. Just because it's a kid's film doesn't mean it needed to be so unremarkable.The movie gets a bonus star for going through the incredibly difficult process of reanimating its main character because fans were unhappy.Upon reconsideration a few months later, I think kids will thoroughly enjoy this film, and I suppose that's really it's goal. That doesn't mean it gets a free pass on a lot of its moderately lazy writing, but I did enjoy certain elements.
I hope Hollywood can someday do a movie for a video game character that isn't about that character interacting with our world - just embrace the video game, you nerds",Sonic the Hedgehog
296,dwaynemayo60,Great kids movie,8,7 April 2020,"Just finished watching with my 7 yr old, that's a clue to future viewers and reviewers...it's a kids movie. It's not there for adult fans that played years ago. There is some stuff thrown in to entertain adults but it is for kids. And my Kid loved it. I have not read any of the other reviews yet but with the low rating I saw there must have been some really picky reviewers.
Sonic looks great the acting is good and although it's a little predictable for an adult who's seen a thousand movies, it isn't predictable for kids. And that's who the movie was for. They did a good job of a storyline to integrate sonic into the real world. The Roles were a little one dimensional by adult standards but not for kids because really it's all about Sonic.
I have to say that after the trailers I thought Carey's character was stupid but after watching the movie, I see his portrayal was perfect.
All in all a really fun movie to see with your kid or kids 10 or under. If you're watching with your GF, buddies or your Teenager, it's not really that kind of movie.",Sonic the Hedgehog
297,prithiviramthirupathy,Decent Entertainment - Completely Adventurous - Treat for Kids,10,13 March 2020,"This film reminded my childhood days. I was a die hard fan of cartoons. Sonic was one of my best. Really excited to watch this film.Fast paced screenplay. Sonic scenes were extremely spectacular. Good Story. Gigantic and mastery visual effects kept our eyes widely opened. All artists did their portions well, especially my favorite Jim Carrey. Best Technical works. Enjoyed the movie well. Applause for the entire crew. Big holiday's treat for Kids. Sonic must impressed everyone of us. Thumbs up!",Sonic the Hedgehog
298,Randy_Dreammaker,Almost There,5,5 May 2020,"Sonic the hedgehog was on par with most movies made for kids, or Saturday morning TV. The weakness of this movie involved the aspects of the story involving live actors, the cast selection and their resulting acting was just average, those parts of the story were generally boring, even though they were used as bump points to advance the story. Jim Carrey pulled off another lack-luster performance. I was really hoping for a Carrey comeback, but this isn't it, he's just not that funny or interesting anymore. He should probably stick to acting in depressing movies, he seems pretty good at those.
I gave Sonic The Hedgehog an IMDB rating of 5 stars. This movie probably should of been done completely in CGI animation, because Sonic the character was really enjoyable, unfortunately his live acting cast were not. I'd like to see more of this Sonic, either with a better chosen cast, or just our 100% computer animation. I'm generally not a fan of cgi movies, but the Sonic character and voice actor work really well together. It's now on my ""pretty good movies"" list, which are movies that were just above my ""stinky baby farts"" list.",Sonic the Hedgehog

302,kmjnhh123,Thank God For The Redesign,8,26 February 2020,"So yea ill start off by saying thank the heavens they decided to listen to the community & redesign Sonic, his original design was hideous to say the least, but the new cuter version of him is way better & the right thing to do.This is a weird decision to say whether the film is for kids or adults, some people think its for kids, some think its for adults, well i think it is a bit of both because there are more childish parts in the film but then the film in general is cool for people that are into games like i am, so the kids just want see Sonic himself rather than us older people who are really happy to see their childhood game character on the big screen.The film does go along at a fair pace not getting bogged down in to much story but it has enough story to make sense of what is going on, there are various laughs throughout the film although some are a bit more for the younger audience & i was sitting there listening to some of the jokes that weren't good but then more adult type jokes & humour came through so it has bit of both. Unfortunately it has that stupid dance from fortnite in the film which i just cringed at, that needs to stop. Sonic himself is likeable & the main characters are to, Robotnik is a awesome fun guy to watch in the film played by Jim Carrey, cant wait to see more of him.There are some bits i could pick apart in the film like when Sonic's legs are working again they take the car rather than him running again when they are meant to be in a rush, also the fact that Tom was all over the news & being hunted down didn't seem to lead to anything else but the kids won't point these bits out so i will be fair.Overall though it is a good watch & cant wait for the 2nd one!Age - 25

305,monsterhunt-94296,Harmless family adventure,5,31 May 2021,"This is basically just a harmless family fun movie with familiar plot points and story beats. The standout here is Jim Carrey who adds an element of fun to the movie and keeps it entertaining. Without him, this film would probably be boring for anyone over the age of 9, but he makes sure you're entertained. The film got some chuckles out of me, some humor felt forced but most of it was fine. The characters are likeable, but once again they're nothing mind blowing or brand new, it's just all very familiar. The film doesn't really go deep into sonic mythology or anything, it mainly focuses on doing its own thing and that's probably why it works better than most video game movies.

The CGI was on par. The sets were decently varied and the editing seemed okay. The characters were decent besides James Marsden I don't really like him as an actor. I thought Jim Carrey was hilarious. They did an okay job with the Sonic character but sometimes his dialog was a little cringy. But the main weakness was story. That's a really important part of the film. It was kind of slow and cliche. A feel good stereotypical story with some laughs. If you're into that sort of thing then go for it.",Sonic the Hedgehog

The best parts of the film Jim Carrey he is the best Eggman or AkA Dr. Robotnik in which James Marsden pretty good chemistry with Sonic (Ben Schwartz) and funny scenes with Jim Carrey.Thank you Jeff Fowler and Paramount for changing the design and listening to the fans. The first moment of the movie shows us Green Hills literally both in the game and in the real world here we meet the adorable baby Sonic and longclaw (I did some research and longclaw comes out in the original sonic movie but as Old Man Owl Same species different name he's a blind owl that serves as a messager ) I do like the design even though it didn't get changed but it still works cus I didn't feel , off by it.

As a person who loves video games, I appreciate that this movie wasn't terrible. It wasn't like super fantastic either. The humor is ok and the story is easy to get along with with an ok message. Jim Carey was fun but it just seemed like he was just acting how he does in any of his craziest comedy rolls. You could say he was pretty much evil Ace Ventura with a twirly mustache that has like 5 PHDs. It was fun, but it didn't like blow my mind.",Sonic the Hedgehog
312,mwcanadian,"It exceeded my expectations, but I had few issues with it",7,27 June 2020,"Let me start by saying, this movie was so much better than expected. Usually movies based on video games get 4 or less from me. Mario was complete trash. However, Sonic did surprisingly well. The story wasn't bad, Sonic was a decent character (though I'm sure kids loved him so that's where it counted).
For adults, I'm SURE everyone got a kick out of Robotnik played by Captain Comedy himself, Jim Carey. He was my MVP, he wasn't scary, but he was clearly having fun. He did his expressions perfectly and reminded me a lot of his Ace Ventura role. He deserves an award for this movie.
The other main characters were good too, the sister in law was ""shut up"" annoying and the one scene kids love (and adults hate) didn't make me happy and that lowers the rating for me, but Robotnik, Sonic's surprisingly cute appearance and Tom (played by James Marsden) give this a 7 and if Carey appears for the sequel (if they make one) I'm all for it",Sonic the Hedgehog
313,WillsFilms,"Sonic the Hedgehog Should Speed Up a Bit, but It's Approaching Full Speed",7,21 February 2020,"Sonic the Hedgehog is quite an adequate feature, which is surprising considering the concept and the history of video game based movies. Sonic's relationship with James Marsden's character; Tom Wachowski is done very well and delivers some fantastic dialogue and humour. The two characters are also very likeable and have fantastic chemistry, developing through each other as the movie progresses and forming quite a heartwarming friendship. However, this is Jim Carrey's movie. Every second he's on screen, Carrey is a joy to watch. His screen presence is outstanding and you get completely lost in the pure insanity of his performance. The movie also has incredible visual effects. The effects are bright, colourful, fast paced and exciting, which is perfect for its targets audience of children. However, this movie does have plenty of flaws. A lot of the humour is immature and doesn't always land. Sometimes, it's the kind of humour you'd stop being amused by once you reach the age of 7. Also, there are a few moments of extremely poor writing that prevent this movie from achieving greatness. However, overall, I'd say that Sonic the Hedgehog is a good movie. However, unless you have a child, or grew up playing the original SEGA games, I'd suggest waiting for it to be released on home video.",Sonic the Hedgehog

I grew up playing the original Sonic series and they had enough references to and in jokes to keep me amused.

After he causes the power of the entire city of Green Hill to go out, a mad scientist, Dr. Robotnik, comes in to hunt him down. Tom Whachowski, the sheriff of Green Hill, finds Sonic in his shed and he agrees to keep Sonic safe from Robotnik. From there, the adventure begins.I'm not going to lie, I originally had no interest in seeing this film, despite being a Sonic fan. When I saw the first trailer back in April, I thought the movie looked really bad and I hated the way Sonic look. I was very surprised when the director announced that the Sonic movie was going to be delayed to fix Sonic's design after the backlash. That is when I got curious about the film, because it showed me that the people behind it really cared about making a good Sonic movie. Even with improved trailers and a much better Sonic design, I was still worried about seeing this because of how video game movies usually turn out. However, I saw it today and I have to say, this might be one of the biggest surprises in film in the past few years.This movie is way better than it has any right to be and I am actually really happy about it. Let's start with Sonic himself. He is great in this film! He had a very fun personality, he was adorable, and his speed is captured beautifully in this movie. Ben Schwartz voices Sonic and he does a fantastic job capturing the blue blur's energetic spirit. They did a great job with Sonic's character. Jim Carrey delivers a delightfully villainous performance as Dr. Robotnik. He is energetic and evil in his role and held nothing back as usual. He was a very good fit for Eggman's character and he showed it with his zaniness. James Marsden does a pretty good job as Tom Wachowski and he shares good chemistry with Sonic. I didn't know how to feel about him at first, but he got better as the film went along. The rest of the cast give good performances. The story is fun to follow, but it is nothing to special. The writing does a great job of characterizing Sonic and how he interacts in this new world. The humor lands more than misses. I was laughing pretty hard at some of the scenes and jokes. The visuals were surprisingly slick. Sonic's design is so adorable and expressive in this movie and the effects look clean, but not too realistic. The action scenes are a ton of fun to watch and they utilize Sonic's speed perfectly. It helps that they are beautifully shot and edited. Also, this movie now has my favorite credits sequence ever. The soundtrack is pretty good with some nice remixes.The movie is far from perfect however. Many jokes land, but there are a couple of cringeworthy fart jokes in this movie. Seriously, some were pretty bad. The human characters were okay, but they were be a little generic aside from Eggman and Tom. Some of the emotional moments were pretty cheesy to say the least. There are some that work pretty well, but it usually felt a little too over-the-top for me. Nonetheless, the good definitely outweighs the bad.Sonic the Hedgehog is an entertaining action-adventure flick for the whole family and it is easily one of best video game to movie adaptations out there. It does a great job capturing Sonic's personality and speed. He is just so lovable and charismatic here. I never thought the movie would be this good after everything that happened with it in production, but I am very happy with how this movie turned out. As a huge fan of Sonic, I thought it was pretty darn sweet!
Oh yeah, and stay through the credits.",Sonic the Hedgehog

And that's how 2019 was going to get to the Sonic movie, but for technical reasons it had to be delayed until 2020, so here ""Sonic the Hedgehog"". This is about how Sonic will have to travel to our world, for details that are not worth detailing, then after the government realizes the existence of this, Sonic along with the Sheriff of a town would have to avoid being caught . The film manages to be outstanding, if we talk about video game movies, because it is known that these types of movies are bad, but it manages to stand out by finishing, being fun. Sonic is not a movie that pretends to be a masterpiece, it is a movie aimed at children and families to have a good time. This can be seen a simple view, when you see that your script is somewhat loose in the sense that it has many holes, the development of the characters is too simple, and if the film feels like the typical cliché of family movies, is that How many times have we not seen the typical story of beings traveling to our world and embarking on a journey? And that is Sonic in a nutshell. A strong success of the film is Jim Carrey, which makes Jim Carrey which is very good because it is his thing and the very natural sale, every moment of Dr. Ivo Robotnik, is funny, he steals the scenes, technically Jim se Load the movie, because let's be honest the movie would not be the same without it. But the bad thing about this is that, since Jim steals the movie, he loses interest in the other characters, to the point that you don't mind even a little. Speaking of the bad, the handling of the sequences is very loose and predictable, there are many ways in which Sonic could reach San Francisco without Tom's help, I also consider it a real challenge to write to a character who is the most intelligent man a lot, but for the scriptwriters none of this was a challenge because, although previously I said that Jim did well as Dr. Robototnik, he does nothing impressive to prove that he is the most intelligent man in the world, outside of send drones and say that he is the most intelligent man in the world, there is no time when he stops to think of an extremely intelligent and detailed plan with low chances of failing, how is it possible that Sonic a hedgehog with a child's mentality, have defeated the smartest man in the world? There is no time when the character speaks for himself and demonstrates that he is what he says he is, the same can be applied with Tom when he says that he is being wanted for terrorism, the writers wrote it without thinking, because there many moments in which Tom is in public places and this for unrealistic reasons is not stopped, I just say that it is impossible that no one has recognized him or that such a fully exploited cliché of making you believe that the character died when not, would have been much better , if Sonic will really die, that would have raised the quality of the film, but of course, that would have prevented a sequel, which is clearer than the water that will come. In conclusion, ""Sonic the hedhehog"" is a film that despite all its defects manages to be fun, with a very simple plot, a level of respect towards the audience for changing the character's design, but as I mentioned with many holes in the plot, and flat characters that have nothing to say.",Sonic the Hedgehog

He acts like a human being at least - over the top, hyperbolized, but consciously so, appearing as a persona one could meet in everyday life. The problem is, he's most likely not the character film wants you to emphasize with - he's the bad guy of this story, but so-called ""good guys"" are so obnoxious, so fake and flat, and outright disgusting in their actions, that, well, there is not much choice left. It's, of course, not the issue of acting, but the issue of terrible writing and cinematography. First twenty minutes or so movie at least tries to present itself as, well, as something cinematic, but the further to the end, the further it doesn't care. And when this embarrassment of a film is finally over - then it downs at you.

341,rg79912,Jim Carrey ruined it for us.,1,23 August 2020,"I figured this would be cute like Detective Pikachu. I expected to like it after reading a couple reviews, but Jim Carrey was just so cringe. Sonic was cute I guess and the main actor did fine compared to Hop. It was just hard to get into because Jim Carrey would enter a scene and act like all his characters from the 90s, and he would kill the fun mood. Myy kids would go from laughter because of Sonic to confused boredom with Robotnik's scenes. I watched their mood towards the movie go from enjoying it, to wanting to watch something else because of Jim Carrey. We finished it, but my kids didn't laugh at a single scene of his, and they find just about everyone and everything funny. At one point I asked my 8 year old what was wrong and he shrugged and pointed at Robotnik and said that guy isn't funny. My 12 year old agreed and said he's cringe. They loved Sonic though, he was cute and funny in their eyes. Such a bad casting choice though for Robotnik, so unfortunate and disappointing. Jim Carrey ruined it. This isn't the 90s and he isn't funny or enjoyable to watch. I really hope he retires and no longer ruins kids movies.",Sonic the Hedgehog

343,luningyuan-23687,"There is no logic in the storyline, which causes a terrible story narrative.",3,24 August 2020,"After a series of remakes, the Sonic movie finally came out this year. You probably still remember the behind that scene story, when first trailer came out with that weird version Sonic. Disappointing wouldn't be enough to describe it. But after the remake, thankfully the production company gave the team a second chance to modify the character model, a 3D Sonic appears on the screen this summer.With the finally got it right Sonic, Jim Carrey, James Marsden and Tina Sumpter, a very good cast, you probably think there is no way that the movie could go wrong, however, it went really wrong.As always, there will be spoilers in the following text.Whatever characters do, they need to follow the logic, which is an important part that compose a story. Having no logic in this story makes every character lack of motivation and weaken the links between every chapters of the movies. In another word, the story goes like ""because the director said so"" not because in that situation what the characters did in the movie is reasonable.For example, there is a scene that a meeting in the Pentagon, generals are discussing what they should do about the huge blackout. Why the head general chooses the Dr. Robotnik, who is he, what's the relationship between him and the government etc. Director and writers left so many questions about this one scene and keep telling next chapter without any explanation about this scene. Left a black hole in the logic line, making the whole story doesn't make any sense. A problem like this I can keep going, all those problems making the remake of Sonic model in vain. 'Cause even a real-life real Sonic cannot save the movie, if the story is a bad apple.But yes, for fans, watching your childhood hero running on the big screen, might still let you have goosebumps, well, about that I didn't.",Sonic the Hedgehog
344,kyleyork-10043,Saved from the disaster it could have been,7,21 February 2020,"With modest expectations, Sonic ends up being a decent movie all around. It's a predictable story and there are a few cringeworthy scenes here and there, but it satisfies on other accounts like giving a little something to all ages in the audience. One of the movie's greatest creative choices is not taking itself too seriously (it's a fast blue hedgehog, we don't need Zack Snyder for this one) and Jim Carrey's goofy & great performance proves that. The movie by itself I'd give a 6/10, but it deserves an extra point for doing the unthinkable and listening to consumers. If the studio hadn't changed the design, it could've very well ruined the movie, as well as the future of video game adaptations in general.

I find it hard to believe that this is an accurate overall score. At least Rotten Tomatoes accurately shows it as ""94% Fresh"" rating for user reviews. I enjoyed the film a lot more than I thought I would and I generally dislike video games movies. And...what do you know? Most written reviews on here agree! Hmm...10/10 to balance out the bots that are reviewing this with a 1. It's clear that it's not our reviews and I feel like it may be a way to dissuade attention toward the Unusual Mind of Mr. Carrey.

353,zaidmnomani,"Not Bad, Not Good",4,22 August 2021,"In anticipation for the second Sonic movie, I decided to go back and watch the first one. Sonic the Hedgehog (2020) was primarily known for its horrifically designed Sonic. It wasn't the worst CGI film of that year (Cats will take that unflattering title) but the backlash was so severe that Sonic was completely redesigned, and some bizarre musical choices from the trailer were changed. But ignoring all that added context, what's the film like?This movie falls into the ever-growing (sub-?) genre of: weird CGI creature meets a down-on-his-luck human. The two dislike each other at first but over the course of the film become friends. Wacky fish-out-of-water sequences are not uncommon. There are a surprising number of films that follow this formula; The Smurfs Duology, Alvin and the Chipmunks Quadrilogy, Hop, and Peter Rabbit (sort off) to name a few.Because of the rapid-fire pacing, very few of this film's emotional beats are properly built up to. For example, we get less than three minutes with Baby Sonic on his planet before some echidnas kill his owl mother. This is one of the most important moments in Sonic's life, and him running off to Earth is what defines his entire personality for most of the movie. And yet, it's over in a heartbeat. Honestly, the whole sequence felt unnecessary, especially since Sonic explains to Tom what his life used to be anyway.The main plot of the film kicks off once Sonic accidently unleashes an energy wave that blacks out Green Hills and inadvertently alerts the government. It's implied that he releases blue energy when he's feeling strong emotions, and during the baseball scene he's particularly lonely. However, I find it hard to believe that he has never once before released an energy wave that could have alerted the government in the ten years he spent on Earth. When he was a child and was forced to flee his planet; didn't he feel strong emotions then? I just find it incredibly bizarre that this is the moment when he unleashes his powers; and not any other point in his life. And if he did, then how come the government didn't discover him before?The way Sonic and Tom end up on a road trip together is also incredibly stupid. Sonic notices soldiers near his home, but wastes a lot of time not using the ring to Mushroom Planet. He leaves his cave with all of his stuff instead of just teleporting out of there directly. No one knows his cave's location, and Sonic has no reason to believe anyone does either and should just leave. But instead, he goes to Tom's shed, where he gets tranquilized. Since Sonic's shown to be able to slow down time on a whim and think as fast as he can run, it's baffling that he got shot by Tom at all.Tom just happens to wear a San Francisco shirt, which Sonic just so happens to read out loud, which opens a portal that drops all the rings to San Francisco. And because Sonic doesn't know the way, he has to ride along with Tom all the way to San Francisco. Add to the insane plot-conveniences, I don't get why Tom doesn't just give Sonic a map to San Francisco instead. We know he can read, so why doesn't he just do that, or better yet, get a GPS? Like I said, all this is what kicks off the Buddy-Cop adventure between Tom and Sonic. The entire movie wouldn't happen without this insane set of contrivances.There's also the incredibly rushed conflict between Sonic and Tom. Tom wants to leave the city in pursuit of a new job, but Sonic doesn't want Tom to go because 'he'll leave the people he loves behind'. What? We do not get a single scene of any town person showing appreciation to Tom at all. He'll move with his wife/girlfriend, and there doesn't seem to be anything important at Green Hills. Despite the fact that Tom is motivated to save lives, he just saves Sonic's and says: 'well, I saved a life, that's what I always wanted to do'. Tom literally ignores a chance for a better life of his own and the opportunity to save others because of some vague 'you can't leave your people behind' advice from an alien he met just two days ago.The government not only forgives Tom, but actually rewards him. Considering Tom was a fugitive for a few days that abused his cop license, helped keep a valuable alien secret, and trap one of the government's most useful people, you'd think he'd face some repercussions. But the whole scene exists for another Olive Garden gag.Sonic himself is more open and friendly than in any other iteration, but his personality traits stop at: I want to have friends and explore the world. The movie barely does anything beyond the surface level. There are some interesting character traits, such as Sonic's tendency to run away when things get bad or to spy on people, the latter of which could be a character flaw. But the film barely explores these traits at all, and instead the majority of his screen time is dedicated to his friendship with Tom.Said friendship is extremely rushed, with the two spending a single night together before becoming best buds. Maddie's fine, if a bit unnecessary. I do find it funny that she baked two cakes for Tom depending on the outcome of his promotion.Eggman is probably the best character in the movies, and he also gets a large chunk of screentime. He's highly egotistical, but also intelligent enough to be a decent threat. We don't get much screentime with him and Sonic talking to each other, and their rivalry isn't that well established. Overall, Eggman's the character I'm looking forward to the most in the sequel, especially with where he ends up by the end of the movie.The acting was surprisingly weak. Ben Schwartz does a solid job as Sonic, but there are some lines that feel off. James Marsdan (Tom) seemed to half-ass his way through the film, and Natasha Rothwell (Maddie's sister) was terrible. At time it felt like she was in a high school play. Jim Carrey on the other hand, adds a lot his character, and I'm quite happy with his casting choice.The ending to the film with Eggman was interesting, and Tails' cameo was a nice touch. It seems like the sequel will be more similar to the games (it even has Knuckles!), after the almost universal dislike for the human characters. This film isn't that terrible, and there are some fun aspects to it. Honestly though, it feels like a waste. I'd much prefer a fully animated Sonic movie, made in the same style as the Sonic Mania trailer. Unfortunately, Hollywood seems allergic to animated films as off late, and almost every adaptation has to be live action. While I didn't hate this film, I do hope the sequel is very different. Would recommend if you're a fan of Sonic or Jim Carrey, but if not, there's not much to enjoy here.",Sonic the Hedgehog
354,aboodakram-48692,"A decently made, quite re-watchable and rich picture that defiantly delivers",7,9 March 2020,"Starting things off with the plot, it is OK and by saying that I mean that it has the potential of being great, but they decided to actually make it similar enough to any ""object-finding"" movie. The theme however supports the plot very well with the family and friendship factors mixed with the idea of fighting against loneliness type of stories and that's a big plus. The big minus though is the score and uniqueness, both of these elements doesn't deliver too much, but what delivers too much is the acting and by saying acting I mean the legend himself Jim Carrey, welcome back my lord of laughter. Editing wise, the movie was decent enough same with the directing wise, a good start for Jeff Fowler.

Once Paramount Pictures redesigned Sonic, the movie looked much more appealing and RESPECTFUL to the source, which is all the fans really wanted. The CGI is well done, the acting is good, and the action turned out to be pretty cool after all.The movie maintains a good balance of seriousness without being overly comedic, kiddy, or childish. The comedy is sprinkled throughout the film in just the right amounts. Jim Carrey's performance felt intense at first, but when it was time to be funny, it was like watching vintage Jim straight out of the 90's. Excellent performance.If they decide to do a sequel, hopefully we get longer, more action-filled sequences that truly bring out more of Sonic's abilities from the video games. It would also be nice to see more of the worlds, or levels, from the games, similarly to how Paramount's 2018 film Bumblebee did with Cybertron.Over all, I really enjoyed Sonic the Hedgehog and have happily added it to my personal 4K UHD Blu-ray collection after watching it in theaters. Gotta support the filmmakers on this one - they really listened to the feedback on the internet and tried to do right by the fans and the source material.As you can probably already tell, I'm excited for a sequel.",Sonic the Hedgehog
367,Tinmancr,"Sonic ""Must go fast!""",8,2 March 2020,"Yep its fairly continuity friendly about as much as can be expected.
Jim does exceedingly well other cast members could have been anyone.
Voice of sonic is ok general attitude done well.
It made money and alludes to a sequel following the game general story line.
Runs circles and loops around Warcrapt, SupMario, Ratchet, Hangry Birds.
Also its pretty family friendly but adult watchable with some stuff kids wont get.
Bottom line from a Sonic fan I would watch again, but probably not in theatres.",Sonic the Hedgehog
368,janjeltes,Superb family film,9,15 February 2020,"Many of us hark for old school films. Where we can immerse ourselves in a fantasy world of heroes and villains and the good guy wins from help of friends. This is that film. It features solid humour, some emotional scenes and relatable characters who ""make sense"".
I don't think I've seen such a well crafted children's film in a long time, except probably Klaus (Netflix's sublime Christmas film).
If you're looking for a feel good, happy, well adjusted film for young children and teenagers alike, I highly recommend this film. You might no think Hollywood can make a decent and lovingly crafted film for young children & teenagers... this film will restore your faith that Hollywood can make worthy content.",Sonic the Hedgehog
369,XpocalypseSurvival,Jim Carrey's mustache alone.,7,7 March 2021,"I love Jim Carrey. I'd recommend this movie for his mustaches(s) alone.There was nothing groundbreaking about this story. it actually reminded me of the Smurfs: blue creature from another world, befriends a human, and together they battle an evil maniac...but that is okay. it is a classic story and they executed it well. The production values and effects are excellent, and the acting was very good, especially the main character. It isn't always easy to portray a convincing relationship with another character who isn't even there, and I thought he did a fantastic job.There seem to be two types of people who don't like this film. Those who aren't big fans of Carrey's and those who have a strong affinity for the original Sonic and felt like this movie didn't stay true to it. I have no such affinity, and love Carrey, so really enjoyed this film.My one criticism is that it is unclear to me what audience they were really targeting. In some ways it seems too old for young kids, and in other ways, too young for older kids, while me in my 40's liked it just fine. Point being, I'm just not sure how kids will like it. For me, I'd give this an 8, but knocked it down to 7 for that reason.Survival Lesson: It is unlikely that an emotional outburst from you will generate an EMP that will wipe out power for 100 miles, but a lack of emotional control, in a survival situation can still have serious consequences.

I even had a few chuckles during it. It was a little childish, and corny at times, but I'm not it's target demographic.The story was well done. The actors did great.

I grew up playing Sonic on my Sega mega drive back in the 90's so this was a little dose of nostalgia for me. Jim Carrey is simply brilliant as usual and of course adds the comedic element to the movie. The guy is a genius to say the least. Thank God they reworked the visual effects; it certainly paid off. The VFX are brilliant. In a lot of films that combine animation with real life, it can be hit and (mostly) miss. But this works! Definitely worth watching regardless of age. Now, can we get an Abe's Oddysee film please?...",Sonic the Hedgehog
376,piercedinsmore,Surprisingly an amazing movie,10,1 March 2020,"So, there were two things that raised me as a kid. Hop, (another kid movie) and Sonic. Now, imagine both of those things in a movie. Well, that's Sonic. Now, I saw this movie expected a stupid plot with horrible jokes, but this was so much better. There were times where I found myself laughing, and the plot was actually good. Now, I know that most people watch these superhero movies to find something relatable, and if that's why you want to watch this movie....then I'm not sure. The movie isn't as relatable to some people at first, but then after the two protagonists meet you feel a connection to the characters. Also, the plot is extremely easy to follow and understand, so it's a good movie for all ages. And, there were lots of Easter eggs in the movie connecting to other characters, (but I can't tell you those, go watch the movie for yourself) the music was classic, and if you've played Sonic, the areas Sonic is from and goes to should ring a bell.",Sonic the Hedgehog

I can't stress this enough but the Sonic redesign had a HUGE impact on the whole movie in every single way imaginable and I'm glad the designers listened to the fans. I hope the fans are supporting the movie by watching this in theatres because it really ended up being a solid movie. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the whole run time and even if it isn't groundbreaking or particularly anything new, it was amazing for what it set out to be. Extremely likable Sonic voice, really likable humans and a Jim Carrey-esque villain with tons of reference and easter eggs are just few of the standouts. A very formulaic film but it does its best to standout with the familiar and tested formula. And here I thought it'd end up being a generic cash-grab dumpster-fire. Really glad it is performing well in the Boxoffice even though the studio responsible for the redesign was shut down.RATING: 8.5/10",Sonic the Hedgehog

The story was pretty shallow, characters also not very deep, and the score was unimpressive. So if sonic had kept that stupid humanoid face, it would've been a train wreck. There were a few good lines and few interesting scenes, and some exciting action moments. I actually really enjoyed the significance is Sonic's coins in this one. I can't recall if they were used for teleportation in the video game series, but I thought it was unique and even a really cool concept.

393,emailme123,Good movie & worth your time.,7,2 April 2020,"If you like Shrek, you will like SONIC. I only knew him from my kids' cartoons as a cute little character, but Sonic has style and is very likable. James Marsden is an excellent lead man and he is a very capable, multi level, talented actor. (He is very likable too)
The story is good, detailed and well written. (Which is more than I can say about a lot of Hollywood films in the last few years) The animation is great.
Jim Carrey is ""himself'. He is the same in every movie and at this point, its definitely repetitive and annoying. In my opinion he is played out. Since when is it popular to be over dramatic, physically contorting and freakish.. forever? I don't think he can DO any other character.
He is only a part of the movie though. I hope they have a SONIC 2, and I hope they have a NEW villain.
I absolutely recommend this movie. It's a quality distraction from life. You can watch it with your kids, and it will entertain you.",Sonic the Hedgehog
394,letande,Yet another Garfield-like movie. Now with cheesy Internet memes.,2,17 February 2020,"Predictably bad. They may have changed Sonic's design, but the script still has the old smell in it. Long story short, it's yet another one of those ""a young couple and the CGI creature"" stories. You know... Garfield (2004), Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007), The Smurfs (2011) and so on. All those movies share the same exact story and it's really, REALLY hard to find the real difference between them. Well, surprise-surprise... here comes another one.The biggest difference this time is... memes. ""Gotta go fast"", ""Sanic"" artwork, it's all there. As well as the references to various popular movies and actors. Because why freakin' not, right? In this exact matter, this movie is almost as bad as Ted (2012). I mean, come on! How hard it was to actually write an interesting story instead of adding tons of old and cheesy memes to the formula that nobody ever liked to begin with? Good grief...Jim Carrey is awesome, though. No, seriously, even though he won't really look like his character for most of the movie, the man does miracles. But honestly, so what? So did Hank Azaria as Gargamel. Did it save Smurfs? Nope (even though it's probably my favorite movie of the kind and I do believe that it's better than Sonic). Same here. Carrey alone just can't save shallow characters and painfully generic plot that was re-used for a million time. Sonic movie is boring, Sonic movie isn't fun for about 99% of the time and it feels like a waste of both time and money. At least because we've seen all this for a million times before.Can't say it's completely unwatchable, though. If you'll be able to see it as a part of your subscription, then, well... it's something that probably won't make you vomit while playing somewhere on background, while you'll be doing some home stuff. But paying to see it on big screen, or Blu-ray and actually watching every single minute of it is just... painful. And since we're talking about one of the most iconic characters in video games history? It feels like a freakin' crime. At least Mario movie tried to be creative. This one? This one didn't even try.",Sonic the Hedgehog
395,registers-944-48791,It's better than Mario movie,5,14 July 2020,"I came to watch this with very little expectations. For the tradition of game adaptations being bad and for the 2019 fiasco. They redesigned Sonic and reprocessed all his animations, but I was doubting they'd reshot all human scenes and therefore any flaw on plot would remain.The good points is that there's no huge plot flaw and there are many fun references to Sonic games and other games. Jim Carey as the top actor also didn't took the attraction of the movie, which kept focused on Sonic and his relation to Tom.In the end, this movie convinced, it's not bad. But there are still too many bad points. There are changes on the game plot, as Sonic having lived most of his life on Earth, there's Longclaw who never existed on the game.So many new elements were added and so few elements from the games were used, that it becomes basically a generic movie about a generic cartooned animal who can talk and has special powers that makes friendship with a generic human, who starts not believing he exists, then decides to help him on a burden, to then take him as his best friend. It's the generic plot used for weak main characters who the wide casual public wouldn't like by himself and needs a human partner to represent this public meeting that main character and being skeptic so enough events can happen to get them closer until the partner and the public get to love him.The plot is also slightly inspired on Superman's plot, of an alien with superpowers that flees to Earth and has to hide so he's not captured. All this makes Sonic games seem too weak and superficial to be able to fit on a movie, which is a shame. This seems to be the inheritance of original production team, who knew nothing about Sonic and didn't care to.Will they make the promised sequel? Well they do make lots of signs that they want the franchise to have it and maybe become a trilogy or more. This movie was made to be episode 0, showing Eggman's past and how he met Sonic. Episode 1 will probably be him learning how to travel to other dimensions and becoming a a threat to the whole multiverse, while Sonic's homeland has some issue to be solved, which brings him back home to save it and fight Robotinik. If episode 1 is done, I hope that Eggman also captures all animals from there to fuel his machines and Sonic has to save them. I wonder if they'd take Tom with him, as his best friend, or if Miles would take that spot. I don't see how they both would fit together.Episode 2 would probably bring the echidnas as new enemy with Eggman coming back, following Sonic 3 plot of Knucles starting as enemy to become friend.",Sonic the Hedgehog

The performances were all done very well including Schwartz and Carrey who owned their roles as Sonic and Robotnik. The film does have it's flaws particularly in the script department as there are some inconsistencies in the writing as well as a few repetitive elements in plot points and humor and the score was forgettable albeit with the exception of one incredible scene with Robotnik.

2/13/2020It brings me no joy to give Sonic a bad review, which brings the total joy Sonic gave me to zero.Please read the next paragraph with increasing speed as you go along, on your mark, get set, GO!When his home planet is attacked by, uh, miniature Sonic/Predator things Sonic escapes to Earth using magical golden rings that transform into portals to other worlds. He lands in Green Hills, Montana where he spends years creepily stalking the residents of the small town. He watches movies through their windows, he has conversations they'll never hear and he keeps little trinkets in a dank, underground cave he calls home. One night a game of 1 person baseball (which you have to see to believe) gets out of hand, a frustrated Sonic runs the diamond so fast that all of the power on the West Coast shuts down; triggering alerts to the government that something weird is happening. The government hires Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) to investigate. Then a small town cop aspiring to be a big town cop Tom (played by James Marsden), discovers Sonic in his garage. Tom shoots Sonic with a tranquilizer gun, he accidentally drops a magic ring which open a portal to San Francisco, and then he accidentally drops all of his rings into the portal which leads Sonic and Tom to take a road trip to San Fran to recover his rings, with the evil Dr.Robotnik trying to capture them both.Take a deep breath.The effects are actually decent, Sonic the Hedgehog is competently shot, technically, it's a well made movie but the writing, the writing is so incredibly painful. It's like the writers looked up every trending Reddit post, meme and internet trope that was PG appropriate and threw it in the script. We have Keanu jokes, iPhone jokes, Amazon jokes, big stupid Toyota and Chevy ads, and MULTIPLE Olive Garden jokes. None of it has any heart, any resonance or any actual creativity. There's no real humor just a 2019 Internet Joke Yearbook. It'll be absolutely and spectacularly irrelevant in less than a year.No kid's favorite movie is going to be Sonic the Hedgehog, because it's not even a Sonic movie. Aside from the 2 minutes we spend on his home planet, nothing makes this story about Sonic. You could swap him out for Mario, Donkey Kong, Samus, Pikachu, a Digimon, a Furby, anything, because this story doesn't care, at all. It's a road trip movie about a man who is annoyed with his sidekick.So, how's Jim Carrey? It kinda sucks to watch him do stuff like this. Carrey used to be able to make anything funny and vibrant and entertaining. From Dumb and Dumber to Ace Ventura to Batman Forever and The Cable Guy, I mean even if the movie wasn't good you could at least say ""Golly Ma, wasn't that Jimbo really sunthin'?"" To be fair Carrey had the most interesting scenes due to his unpredictability as a villain but his silly rubber face wasn't enough to make me forget the lifeless, corporate corpse of a family film he's trapped in. I don't get why he did this? Is he out of Republicans to paint?Actually that's maybe the best thing I can say about this McRib (my phone wants to autocorrect this every time I type movie, so I'm keeping it), by hiring Carrey, it's safe to assume this entire production was Anti-Trump which is a great cause. So actually, ya know what? Forget it, go see this movie, it's wonderful.",Sonic the Hedgehog

It sets out to be a family and kid movie, and the adults will certainly enjoy it too. Very entertaining and enough scenes to make you laugh without being an all out comedy, but to keep you having a good time.",Sonic the Hedgehog
416,joshkroitor,"Jim Carrey ""carried"" this movie.",5,21 February 2020,"There was nothing special about the movie in and of itself. It was a cookie cutter copy of Detective Pikachu. The only redeeming thing about the movie was Jim Carrey. I enjoyed his performance of Dr. Eggman. But removing him from the picture, it was so dull. It was 2 hours of r/fellowkids-esque material, fortnite dancing, and a cheesy scripting. You really don't have to go see this movie. People will stop talking about it in a month.",Sonic the Hedgehog

We've seen that act and he's a flop. He's not funny anymore. The same old tired routine and someone thought to hire him for this movie? It could have been so much more with another actor.",Sonic the Hedgehog

From a filmmaking perspective, it wasn't a complete dudd, and Marsden was perfectly OK as the lead, but the sonic voice over artist was flat and it spoilt much of the movie. Additionally, Cary does his schtick but always seemed out of place in the film. Not terrible, but not great. It should (just) make a small profit if it scores better than $350 world wide, but don't expect to see a sequel.",Sonic the Hedgehog
419,westerfieldreviews,"""The Hedgehog with Heart""",7,29 February 2020,"""The Hedgehog with Heart""Jeff Fowler after over a decade of not sitting in the director's chair returns with the insurmountable task of creating a film for one of the most beloved nineties mascots of all time. ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" brings the twenty-nine-year-old icon onto the big screen for his first feature-length film that is an entertaining ride from start to finish. With Ben Schwartz voicing the titular character of Sonic and Jim Carrey acting as his legendary rival, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, these two expertly steal the show as they wonderfully bring these classic characters to life in fresh and exciting ways that pay homage and feel familiar to their original depictions. However, not all is well within the land of Green Hill Zone as ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" features an empty plot that goes nowhere fast until a third through the film's runtime as several vacuous jokes plague the pages of the script and do no favors for the overall quality of the film. ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" is a children's film at heart that will surely entertain audiences throughout the course of its hour and forty-minute runtime that brings Sonic back into the mainstream consciousness for all of the right reasons.
""Sonic the Hedgehog"" immediately introduces us to a young Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) as he frantically runs away from a pack of tribal echidna that are hunting him down. Sonic meets with his guardian, Longclaw the Owl (voiced by Donna Jay Fulks) who senses trouble on the horizon. In an act of selflessness, Longclaw gives Sonic a pouch of rings that act as gateway portals to other planets and dimensions; she uses one of those very rings to send Sonic to Earth. The plot jumps forward ten years where during that time, Sonic has grown accustomed to his life of secrecy near the small town of Green Hills, Montana. During his stay, Sonic has grown to appreciate the work of the local sheriff, Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) so much that he spends nights outside of Tom's house as he watches films and relaxes with his wife Maddie Wachowski (Tika Sumpter). Despite Sonic taking part in the joy of being around others he adores, when he retreats back to his shelter and reflects on his own personal life, he can feel the deep internal loneliness that eats away at him every waking day; gifted with the ability to be everywhere at once, but cursed with the inability to show himself. Then, in a moment of sorrow, Sonic runs at a supersonic level causing a massive shockwave of energy that causes a blackout all across the Pacific Northwest. The United States government is unaware of what energy source could have knocked out that much power, and so the Defense Department decides to enlist the help of the mad scientist himself, Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey). With the stage set, Sonic employs the help of Tom as the two travel to San Francisco in a race to recover his long lost rings, while the sinister Robotnik tracks them down in an effort to capture the hedgehog and extract his source of power to build an army of unstoppable machines.
""Sonic the Hedgehog"" is a film that relishes in its silliness from scene to scene that finds a good balance between being goofy and heartfelt. Still, the overall plot of the film is tremendously thin and for the first thirty minutes, a number of pointless sequences take place that are solely used to garner a few laughs out of the kids in attendance. But, where ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" shines the brightest, is in its characters, more specifically, Ben Schwartz as Sonic and Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik. Carrey digs into his bag of absurdity harkening back to characters such as Ace Ventura and The Mask to put on a show that only he could pull off. Carrey masterfully reinvents the stale old villain by delivering his lines in such an exaggerated fashion that is amplified by his wacky movements and overall demeanor to play a refreshing villain that has not been seen in a while. Had any other actor stepped into the shoes of Dr. Robotnik, the character's awkward dialogue and childish nature would have not been fully realized. Although Carrey delivers an excellent performance, it is the title character of the film that ultimately excels above the rest; Ben Schwartz is not just the voice of Sonic, he is Sonic. The character of Sonic has always been designed to be the ""edgey"" rival of Nintendo's super mascot, Mario; Sonic listens to rock and roll, who knows what Mario listens to, Sonic is all about speed, Mario lightly jogs and jumps, Sonic wears stylized crimson shoes, Mario wears blue overalls. The two brand icons have always been at odds (they've even faced off in the Olympics) but as time moved forward, the two diverged fruther; the Sonic series added guns, explosions, and medieval fantasy while Mario continued being cute and family-friendly. No matter how much the Sonic series altered over time, the one aspect that always appeared to remain unchanged was Sonic's overbearing confident personality that always had one leg in the present, and the other firmly planted in the nineties. Schwartz clearly understands the character of Sonic and lets the audience know with every line of dialogue he reads. Regardless of whether Schwartz is telling a joke or sharing a sincere and emotional moment, he perfectly encapsulates the essence of the classic Sega poster child. The character of Sonic could have been completely annoying and one note, but Schwartz's performance represents Sonic in a way that everyone, no matter age can rally behind and enjoy. At the end of the day, Schwartz's own enthusiasm about the project and the character is truly infectious and will grow on audiences with every comment and retweet he shares.
The origins for a ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" film can be traced all the way back to 1993, where at the time, Sega CEO Tom Kalinske refused to go forward with the project given the critical failures of other video game film adaptations, most notably 1993's ""Super Mario Bros."" and 1994's ""Street Fighter"". With rumblings of a Sonic film popping every few years, it wasn't until 2013 when Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired the rights to develop and distribute a film that things really began. After several years passed, in 2017 Paramount Pictures wound up with the Sonic film in their laps ready to finish the project. On April 30, 2019 the world got their first look at ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" and it was a disaster no one was prepared for. Every corner of the internet sounded the alarms as the world finally got their first look at the abomination they were calling Sonic. The blue hedgehog was designed to look like a semi-realistic animal human hybrid with a taller body, no connected eyes, lifelike fur, no white gloves, and human teeth. Needless to say, Sonic was absolutely hideous. This new depiction of the character lacked any ounce of soul the classic character once had; it was a design no one could support. In spite of Sonic's awful design, it also did not help that the original reveal trailer was just simply put, flat out terrible with a weird tone and odd music selection. Thus, the internet unanimously agreed that Sonic looked monstrous and boy did they let the studio know. On May 2, 2019, Fowler announced that the film would be delayed until the calendar year of 2020 and would now be pushed back nearly four months from its original release to do Sonic the justice he rightfully deserved. Then, on November 12, 2019, the ""New Official Trailer"" was released and the world rejoiced; Sonic was perfect the world cheered. However, the glorious new redesign came at a tremendous cost; the jobs of dozens of talented animators at the Moving Picture Company (MPC) Studio in Vancouver. No number on how many people were let go is known, but what is certain is that this should not have been the final outcome. Those animators worked tirelessly to ensure that the film would meet its new release date, painstakingly going through frame-by-frame fixing everything; and so for the entire studio to be shuttered just days before Christmas, it is truly tragic. Unfortunately, this is a story we have grown all too familiar with within the film industry as several other VFX studios have been overworked on a project, to then be demolished shortly thereafter. It is a cruel fate that makes me believe Sonic's redesign was nowhere near as important as the jobs of those animators.
""Sonic the Hedgehog"" is a video game movie that gets it right (or at least about as close as you can get). The film is an enjoyable watch that will no doubt make older fans of the series smile while also creating a new wave of young Sonic fans. ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" is not for the ""Oscar"" crowd, and nor should it be. The film will make you laugh with the wild antics taking place on screen, but still pull on your heart strings when needed. Fowler and company craft a well-made entry for the Sonic series that can only be greatly expanded upon in the future with new installments (of which there will be many) that can introduce new characters and locations but will only succeed if they employ the same strategies laid out here, within ""Sonic the Hedgehog"".Final Verdict: C+",Sonic the Hedgehog
420,maxstenner,A rather good video game movie,9,30 March 2020,"Even though the 'cartoon animal goes to real world and meets humans' story is not my cuppa tea, Sonic the Hedgehog fails to disappoint.Humour - Not great but not that bad either
Action - Legitimately great slapstick
Story - pretty good.
Acting - Jim Carreys performance of Robotnik is amazing. The other actors are ok",Sonic the Hedgehog
421,stebird-25957,Super-Sonic? No I don't think so,3,8 August 2021,"Where do you even begin, perhaps with a face-palm and a shake of the head?The first question that needs to be asked is why, why did anyone feel that a film version of ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" was needed? It really is what you'd expect from a video game adaptation, it struggles to find its voice, any voice in fact, and seems to be held back by its limitations, that being it's of course based on a video game.Possibly it could sit well with younger viewers, but as an adult I found the film to be lackluster and a bit insulting to my intelligence; Disney have shown how to make ""kids"" films enjoyable for adults, so there's no real excuse here for ""Sonic"".The only saving grace for the film is nostalgia, as a child I enjoyed playing Sonic games on the old Sega, and the film at least whisked me off somewhat down memory lane which was kind of nice.Altogether though the film is passable and carries no real weight.",Sonic the Hedgehog
422,SimonsRants,Wow,4,22 February 2020,"The fact that this currently has a 6.9 is laughable. I read somewhere someone saying that the person that doesn't like this movie went into it not wanting to. Methinks doth protest too much? Because I think the only people who like this movie are the ones convincing themselves it's not bad. Now, it's not The Room bad or Hop bad, but a 4/10 is totally justified. The logic of this movie can be summed up in the trailer - Sonic can yawn at the thought of missiles and bullets pointed directly at him, but gets hit by a dart. But it takes that ""logic"" and creates a whole plot filled with that kind of logic. The humor of the film is also summed up in the trailer... Um... Meow? I think the Sonic personality was completely miscast. I grew up with Sonic X though, so maybe I don't understand what his personality is supposed to REALLY be like, but he was just annoying in this to me. And not in the way he normally is, but in a kiddie way.
Jim Carrey was the only one in this entire production to seem to give a damn and actually want to try to make something worth while and man did he try. It didn't work 100%, but maybe about 75% of the time. Not Carrey at his best, but he was still easily the best part of this movie and it would have lost a star without him.
I almost wish the animation was never fixed because we would have had a shot at a 1/10 movie and those are always enjoyable. However, the version we ended up getting was silly and stupid and makes you facepalm a couple times, but ultimately is just really forgettable.",Sonic the Hedgehog
423,renanbin,Crap,1,29 August 2020,"Not that I was expecting that much but Sonic is definitely no good. The only good thing in it are the 16 bit movie moments at the credits. Don't waste your time, this is super crap.",Sonic the Hedgehog
424,danhuiner,Better than everyone will expect,9,14 February 2020,This movie was so much fun. I was very skeptical going in but I laughed a lot in this movie and enjoyed myself. Jim Carrey was a perfect casting choice for Robotnik and Ben Schwartz did good to mix it up from his other voice works. Also I really hope it gets a sequel because of the pre and mid credit scenes!,Sonic the Hedgehog
425,elijahbutler-40119,"Really enjoyed it, especially as a Sonic fan! Best video game film so far!",8,16 February 2020,"Let me explain my background on this character before jumping into this review, I am an early 2000s person who grew up playing, watching and all around loving Sonic The Hedgehog, so I was really sceptical when I heard this movie was first announced, especially when the original film design was leaked around 7 months ago. However, Paramount fixed Sonic's design and brought light and hope to the film. I walked into this film hoping that it would be a good video game adaptation and it really surprised me from start to finish. This is by far the best movie adaptated from a video game. James Marsden does a really good job as this cop named ""Tom Wachowski,"" and I also really liked Ben Schwartz voicing Sonic, and their chemistry and friendship was one of the highlights in the film that I thought were portrayed really well. I can't finish this review if I don't mention my background on Jim Carrey. I've loved this actor for years and he really knocked his performance out of the park and I really thought he was a perfect fit for Dr. Robotnik. The comedy was also surprisingly decent and sometimes goes off as cheesy and silly, but you can tell that Jeff Fowler knows the background and the universe of this beloved iconic video game character and his vision and direction brought a lot of love and care into this film. If any of you go to check this film out, stay for the 2 post credit scenes. Without spoiling anything, they tease a possible sequel, and you may fall in love if you're a Sonic fan like I am. I had a blast with Sonic The Hedgehog and I was pleasantly surprised on how good it was. If you're not a Sonic fan or you don't even know the franchise very well, I recommend that you don't even see this movie, cause it would just waste your time, but if you are a fan, you might actually love this one!",Sonic the Hedgehog
426,Sabaher,Pleasant road trip movie with Jim Carrey,7,16 February 2020,"Sonic the Hedgehog is a pleasant, unassuming road trip movie. It's consistently fun from beginning to end. It doesn't overstay it's welcome and it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's great to see Jim Carrey doing comedy again. He has not skipped a beat. His particular rubber faced set of skills fits perfectly with his character. At times it can be very funny and there's two mid-credit sequences which are worth watching. On the negative side, the movie takes place almost entirely on Earth. Loop-de-loop worlds and pinball worlds are traded for Montana which I think isn't an upgrade. Also a bunch of things that make Sonic the Hedgehog franchise unique are abandoned and replaced with road trip cliches. Still it's a fun road trip movie with likeable characters and a pleasant return to form from Jim Carrey.",Sonic the Hedgehog

428,parkecha,Quite simply the best video game movie ever made!,10,4 April 2020,"I am a pretty big Sonic fan already, but this movie was seriously the best video game movie adaptation ever made. It tells us a nice story about Sonic, a hedgehog living on Earth, who is forced to stay hidden so that no one tries to take his powers. However, when Sonic causes a blackout across the small town of Green Hill, he must team up with officer Tom Wachowski to stop Dr. Robotnik. The story is nice because Sonic has some nice character development that shows us that he is lonely and wants to make a friend, and stop being hidden. The movie is also funny, fast paced, action packed, and heartwarming. And the voice actors... do I need to say more? In this film, Robotnik is Jim Carrey at his best for sure. There's so much about this movie that is so interesting and entertaining, I don't even think 10/10 is enough for this masterpiece. I give it 100/10. Great job Sega. Best video game movie ever. Can't wait for the sequel.",Sonic the Hedgehog

432,prestonm1993,This was a Triumph,10,8 March 2020,"Well, after years of anticipation I FINALLY got to see it! I've been hyped to see the Sonic movie since before the release of the first trailer. It was hilarious, fast-paced, and action packed. Sonic was my childhood favorite superhero, and he is fighting a villain played by Jim Carrey - one of my biggest acting heroes of all time.The special effects were superb, the acting was great, and the director was doing his job well. Those do not always come together so well.We are given an origin story of how Sonic got from Mobius to Earth. The film also provides some back history on Dr. Ivo Robotnik's upbringing and his occupation. The story essentially paints Sonic a fugitive on the run from Robotnik and the government.He is aided by Tom (a cop who Sonic nicknames the ""donut lord"") and his wife Maddie (who Sonic calls ""pretzel lady"") in his search for golden rings, which allow for travel in Sonic's world.The chemistry between James Marsden's Tom and Ben Schwartz's Sonic as budding buddies is so fun to watch. The same can be said for Sonic and Jim Carrey's Robotnik as foes.Longtime and newcoming fans of Sonic will love all of the subtle and not so subtle references to past games. And baby Sonic is undeniably cute. Just saying.Sonic the Hedgehog as a gaming franchise has had a number of ups and downs with each game, but as a film, this was a triumph.I cannot wait for the sequel.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Ok...ok...calm down...we've still got secondary roles, cast as much diversity as you can possibly muster! If there's a god damn neutral gender purple alien, I want it cast!!!!!So start with the Wife, the only reason they cast her was for the stereotypical fat, negative black sister, with the usual 'Hell nah!' 'Left his ass' & 'You don't knoooow me!'But then there's Jim Carey who literally holds the entire movie on his shoulders, every poor casting, every poor performance, every endless clique it bears heavy on the comic god & eventually it buckles his jaw dropping performance, the straw that breaks the camels back? The inconsistency of Sonics speed, can be so fast he can seemingly slow time to a stand still yet a dart can get him, just a god awful, spineless cash grab.",Sonic the Hedgehog

The film heavily relies on stories and references from other films all of the time. The acting was terrible and not believable, the characters were overused and cliche.
I respect the VFX department for changing Sonics look to be a little more normal and realistic looking, but even then the CGI wasn't that good.

442,MatthewCherrier,Very Charming & fun - a pleasant surprise,8,29 April 2020,"I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. Ben Schwartz is ridiculously charming as Sonic, he perfectly captures the whimsy & energy of the classic game while making the character his own & giving sonic new modern persona. Jim Carey, per usual, is over the top, charming & crazy in the best way, making Dr. Robtnik a modern evil genius type villain with a seemingly unlimited supply of super smart (and honestly super cool) gadgets & weapons that keep getting better as the film progresses. The only negative thing I'd say about the film is Adam Pallys as an idiotic deputy cop, I'm all for a ""fun dumb guy"" character when done properly (for example Chris Pratt in Parks & Rec) however He just came across as stupid in the worst way & a waste of a great actors talents. It's definitely more than just a kids movie, The X-men-esq scene where sonic moves through the bar at super speed is one of the best sequences in the film. I hope there is a sequel, I can't wait to see more of (SPOILER) Dr. Robotnik exploring & ultimately escaping the mushroom planet to get revenge!",Sonic the Hedgehog

444,Constantine306,Redesign was the right thing to do.,8,3 April 2020,"I actually got to see this in theaters. I was one of the many upset fans who gated the design of Sonic rom the original trailer for this film. I decided to see the film solely on the fact that the studio was willing to fix the design to please the fans. So I went in with quelled expectations, it being based on a video game and all. But I walked out with a smile. It was fun and a complete treat to see Jim Carrey in top form again. I didn't realize how much I missed that about him. I enjoyed the easter eggs for the fans and I'm looking forward to more. Hopefully Paramount won't go all Transformers on itself with this franchise.",Sonic the Hedgehog
445,kgborrell-34146,Would be better without Jim Carrey,6,11 March 2021,It was actually an enjoyable movie but Jim Carrey was terrible in it,Sonic the Hedgehog
446,kobrakai-1,Jim Carrey back in top form.,7,17 February 2020,"After the buzz about the terrible design of the title character and the effects team needing to get into crunch time to rework things to satiate disgruntled fans, I'm pleasantly surprised to say that as a cynical adult, I actually had a good time with this movie.A big part of that is in thanks to Jim Carrey turning back the clock and putting in a not-quite-prime-level-but-close-enough performance as Dr. Robotnik. He's clearly having fun with every scene he's in, and he does get some pretty good zingers in when the movie lets him do his thing. Though of course he doesn't get to go quite all out like he would have back in the 90s (this is still a family film, of course), he's still great at chewing up the scenery if you've missed those performances of his. Obviously if you never were a fan of his comedy, this movie won't change your mind.That said, Ben Schwartz does a pitch perfect job voicing Sonic. I had no problem rooting for him even when the character has his sketchy moments with the way he treats his human traveling buddy (played well enough by James Marsden). A lot of that has to do with Sonic actually being quite vulnerable and having a few moments where he needs to ask for help or is hurt. Of course, things never get too dark and the action is very much geared towards the younger audiences. Still, given the more dull family options that have been pushed out there lately (I'm looking at you, Dolittle), I think this one is paced just well enough to keep the grown ups awake and the kids laughing along throughout. I also have to give credit to the studio for listening to the strong backlash they received and instead of standing firm in pushing out a terrible product, they went back and reworked things, and it really does show in the final cut.One little nitpick, though: I do wish movies would stop with this growing trend of opening in the middle/toward the end and having that whole ""record scratch, freeze frame"" moment where the main character starts off telling the audience, ""You're probably wondering how I got into this situation..."" This movie really didn't need that, it's as linear and straightforward a film as can be.Also, yes, there is one fart joke and I could have done without it, but at least they kept it to one. Overall the humor sticks the landing more often than not.",Sonic the Hedgehog
447,loganstarkiller-37628,Fun and Adventurous,8,23 February 2020,"Wow. This was actually really good. I actually wanna sequel too. How do you take a fun video game and turn it into a good family film? Why by having Jim Carrey starring as the delightfully fun and evil Dr. Robotnik and a dyanamic duo with James Marsden and Ben Schwartz. Ben Schwartz playing the fun blue little hedgehog does an excellent job portraying the character by making him likeable and you enjoy every bit of his journey. James Marsden does a decent job as Tom. And then there's Carrey. Holy crap folks! This man has a made a great comeback. The best ever since his portrayal as Ace Ventura and the riddler combined. Funny, and a good comedic villain at the same time intimidating by the 3rd act. Best of all, you actually care for Sonic. The character development is there. The comedy is there. It's amazing.
The only problem: it may be hard for some people to get invested in Marsden's character as Tom. Because while the duo is amazing once Tom meets Sonic, you don't know much about him. All you know really about Tom is that he's a cop and he wants to leave Montana. That's really it. But it's probably because the main focus is Sonic. Sonic however you actually feel for him if you can relate to loneliness in your life and especially attached of you played all the video games. Oh, and the Olive Garden product placement. Dear God! Aside from a few issues, this is actually one kids and adults will enjoy, and SEGA fans don't have to worry. Especially after Sonic's redesign. Boy, did we need that!",Sonic the Hedgehog

At any moment I was expecting him to start rattling off lines from Batman forever or the Gringe or Liar Liar, any way you get the point. Not a fan of him. At one time he was funny and entertaining but he was just obnoxious in this.Maybe if someone else was cast as Robotnic my opinion would be different but here we are.",Sonic the Hedgehog
457,wakka_chakka,massively better than the rating,8,4 March 2020,"I am not sure who has given Sonic anything less than 7 stars as it meets every single criteria of being a family movie.
May be the critics are just off that the company redesigned the hedgehog, listened to the uproar across the globe and then gave us such a fun movie.The movie had everything and Jim Carrey .. a good story line (may be a bit generic) which will certainly make you relate to Sonic. Sonic has a certain flow to it which is not that common these days (specially with the new superhero movies)I am yet to find someone in person who has said that this movie wasn't fun .. because it is 100% fun .. go watch it.",Sonic the Hedgehog
458,maxwelloreocookie,"Very underwhelming, but I guess decent for a kid's movie.",6,19 February 2020,"This movie is pretty much exactly the same way I felt about Detective Pikachu. Pretty much ""MEH!"" all across the board. It feels like this movie was written and directed by the same guy who made Detective Pikachu. Both these movies have extremely similar vibes.But I give Detective Pikachu the slight edge over Sonic the Hedgehog because it was a little funnier and had better visuals. The comedy in Sonic ranged from mediocre to funny, with mostly being mediocre. I only slightly laughed in some parts.One of the best part of the movie was probably the character arc of Sonic. The movie gives him a little more background than the games do(at least more than the earlier games, because I haven't played much Sonic games after Sonic 06. Oh God, the game was atrocious). The games generally give Sonic zero character arc. He just acts ""cool"" the entire game without really leaning anything or changing at all. However, the movie gives him the similar care-free fun-having personality, but they actually make him become lonely, which I'm pretty sure has never been in any Sonic games ever. This worked surprisingly well for me, and the emotional moments weren't as awkward as I would expect.Too bad the plot itself is very short, bland, and basic, but I guess it works for an extremely kiddie movie like this. I know it's a kids movie, but so is something like Shrek or Mulan, which is amazing for both kids and adults. Most Sonic fans are adults now, so it would've made more sense to make a Sonic movie I'm that vein. Why are most kid's movies so overly kiddie nowadays? What happened to kids movies like Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Not saying the Sonic movie should be that dark, but just saying. But Detective Pikachu would've actually been way better if it was in the vein of Who Framed Roger Rabbit.It's also kinda dumb how Tom becomes fugitive and all over the news, but everything is okay for him at the end and does zero jail time, or no fighting it in court. Sonic also sends Robotnik all alone to another planet. Don't get me wrong, Robotnik was evil and mean, but that punishment is still way too harsh. The government also just forgets about him and act like it's okay one of their men just disappeared off the face of the Earth, WTF? I know it's a kids movie, but that was so dumb and makes no sense.As for Jim Carrey as Robotnik, he was just okay. I enjoyed most of it, but just wish it was better. He pretty much did his 90s schtick, except a little more tame. But Robotnik isn't supposed to be like Ace Ventura so it's okay.The action scenes are one of the best parts of the movie. My favorites are the slow motion scenes where we see everything from Sonic's perspective. It's almost exactly like the Quicksilver scenes from the X-Men Movies. The Quicksilver slow motion scenes are better, but Sonic slow motion scenes are still amazing. If the Sonic sequel every comes, there's always gotta be at least 1 slow motion scene upping the previous movie's, but don't want to have too many slow motion scenes per movie, then it gets tired. 1 or 2 per movie is perfect.One more little complaint is the blatant product placement of Olive Garden. I've seen tons of product placement in movies, but this was on the worst and most obvious I've ever seen. When they talk about Olive Garden, it sounded straight out of an ad, not how people talk in real life. I don't mind product placement when it's just logos or items in the background, because it's actually realistic that way anyway. Product placement is only horrible when they talk about it like an ad. It almost took my out the movie even though it was only like 10 seconds every time it's mentioned.Sadly, this movie has not broken the video-game movie curse, just wasn't good enough. I'm still waiting for a exceptionally and objectively amazing video-game movie. Hopefully the sequel will be way better because there is actually potential here surprisingly. I'm 100% sure there's gunna be a sequel, because the end left it open for a sequel, and this movie is doing amazing at the box office. Tails looks amazing! Actually better than Sonic.",Sonic the Hedgehog

460,JuniorTorres720,Sonic Hits the Big Screen and It's Great!,10,21 February 2020,"Definitely fresh! Sonic the Hedgehog was so fun to watch. I loved all the characters involved. Jim Carrey was at his absolute best, giving a performance that was reminiscent of his early years. I can't imagine anyone else playing a better Dr. Robotnik. I'm excited about the evolution of his character. Tom Marsden was great and looked so natural interacting with the Blue Blur. He made a great protagonist alongside Sonic. The Donut Lord jokes were so freaking funny! Ben Schwarz was perfectly cast and his enthusiasm and youthful energy brought Sonic to life.I thought the movie did a fine job of paying homage to the original video game lore. The opening shots with the stars on the Paramount logo being replaced with rings was a nice touch. The Sega bit in the beginning with video of their classic games was also nice. Sonic was brought to life in excellent fashion. I'm glad they redesigned him and kept him looking more like the original character. He looked great! Cute lil booga.I enjoyed the plot of the movie, the humor, the action, and the characters. The cat and mouse hunt between Robotnik and Sonic kept the pace and tempo of the film at a thrilling pace while slowing it down at the right times. The scene at the bar was really cool. Sonic moving so fast that everything else seems to freeze was a great way to demonstrate just how fast he really is. I loved the movie and am looking forward to more Sonic! Gotta go fast!",Sonic the Hedgehog

I urge all of you to watch this as it's a good family movie and very enjoyable.",Sonic the Hedgehog
462,sjw1029,"Good for kids, not as much for adults",5,6 April 2021,"Like many children who grew up in the 90s, I was a big fan of Sonic. Making a good movie out of a video game has proven difficult. This one isn't bad, but not that fulfilling for adults. There are some laughs here and there. The plot feels stretched out, even though the movie is barely 90 minutes. It's harmless, just not particularly good.",Sonic the Hedgehog
463,tyler063097,Nostalgic & Average,6,20 January 2021,"Being a huge fan of the Sonic franchise growing up, this was a highly anticipated movie for me. I should add, I was more so anticipated once they changed the disastoruous look that was Sonic.Recently I was able to go into this, and finally give it a shot. I enjoyed all the actors and their roles. Ben Schwartz does a good Sonic, Jim Carrey was a great Robotnik, etc.. And I felt nostalgic throughout.In all honesty, that was really it for me. It's a terrific family movie. It's goofy, fun, and doesn't take itself seriously at all. An easy watch. But it's nothing to write home about. Jokes don't really land hard besides a couple times that I chuckled. The plot is OK. Its overall a childhood ride to give you the motivation to go back and play the classic games. With all that being said, I will be watching the sequel. And I am looking forward to taking another trip down memory lane.Overall, I'd give this a 5/10. I feel it's quite average as a movie alone. But it gets bonus points for the studio taking the time to go back, and make sonic match what hes supposed to look like.",Sonic the Hedgehog

I highly recommend it if you haven't seen it.(My review only)A+ 9.8/10 IMDb 🍅100%🍿5.0/5.0Best sonic adaption than modern games lol",Sonic the Hedgehog
466,TreeOfWolf,As amazing as it looks!,8,28 February 2020,"(Maybe spoilers about characters' motivations, well, how I understood them)Jim Carrey finally have a role that lets him shine. I haven't enjoyed him that badly since the mask, he's so intense and evil in a very intimidating yet fun way. I felt admiration, terror, and sympathy. I loved his back story, he became evil for a good reason. It's my favorite morale: Bullies shouldn't harm the weak to have a fun power trip, they can grow into overpowering enemies later... and it can unleash an enraged evil into the world.I was rooting for Robotnik. And Sonic too, Ben Schwartz made him sound adorable. (Sonic is kinda ADHD but maybe that's a misunderstood superpower). I'm very grateful that they changed Sonic's Design from the first trailer. When we are used to the videogame and anime culture, big cartoonish eyes look more realistic. (Asians have small eyes, so we all seem to have huge eyes for them. Maybe it fascinate them so they draw eyes overly bigger, or maybe it's just easier to see expressions.) Sonic is an alien, he's not supposed to look human (but it was well made though)I liked that many races were represented in the movie, not just African Americans. It would have been wrong not to show Asians because SEGA is a Japanese videogame company. There's a funny dark joke where many races wait together for an elevator, side by side, it was nice.Robotnik' tech was absolutely amazing. Better than the bat mobile (but don't raise your expectations too much.) The villain looks different than the game, but it was for the best because he's more intimidating. (Fun fact: Hitler's moustache used to be curly like that, until he was forced to cut it to be able to wear gas masks as a soldier... he shaved the sides too much, I guess to be passive aggressive.) So his moustache looked scary to me. We briefly see Robotnik look more like the videogame, so we had the best of both designs.His loyal butler was very nice too. Robotnik is such a misanthrope (mistrust and hate in humans), it's weird that he didn't build himself an AI or robots like Iron Man... But the movie is about loneliness and making friends... (sorry if that's a spoiler) It's not just about Sonic, I think Robotnik is lonely too. Maybe he doesn't wants Sonic's power just to stay on top of the world, but to have a worthy challenger to play with and stimulate him intellectually. I noticed that villains often have the occasion to kill the hero easily in games and anime, but instead they brag about their plots... maybe they just want someone to talk and play with... It's the hero who send them to their death without an after thought... So who's really evil? I'm totally rooting for villains and Jim Carrey made an awesome one.The movie was super sweet, blew my mind, and gave me thrills. It was awesome in many ways and movie genres. Animation, comedy, science fiction, maybe some horror... Slow moments don't last long. The movie sure was exciting!I wanted to watch it in theaters twice in a row to keep the fun going. I'll see it again another day. If you like animated movies and/or ever loved a Jim Carrey movie, you have to see it at least once. I was very pleased on so many levels.I sure hope for a sequel! You must! I'll pay for it!",Sonic the Hedgehog

There is plenty of diversity, but the refreshing thing is that it's entirely organic. There are even white men in positions of power, and none of them are evil, or dumb (apart from Robotnik, of course). No women talk down to men. All the roles are written to serve the story, not someone's political agenda. You'll smile the whole way through and have a few laughs along the way.

476,dalks78,Surprisingly Entertaining,8,27 December 2020,"Compared to most other video game adaptations (which let's be fair are usually absolutely abysmal), Sonic The Hedgehog is a pretty good family film. There are some very good comedic moments (the bar scene being a highlight), and Sonic himself as a character is funny and charismatic enough to not drag the film down. Marsden plays a decent enough foil to Sonic. Carrey being Carrey as always steals the show as Robotnik with his usual hyper performance. All in all considering it's base material and how we could have ended up with a Super Mario Bros 2.0, Sonic The Hedgehog is a superior video game film.",Sonic the Hedgehog
477,bradaviel,Super feel good inventive movie with a lot of well used references,8,6 March 2020,"When the first trailer got out, I though to myself ""wow, this is going to be fun"". So much so that i didn't even see the problem with Sonic's design. Thank Father Christmas everybody else did, because the new design is really doing it. Which begs the question : Aside from the obvious ""we need to make America part of it"" (the little towns, the bars, the human diverse actors, San Francisco, etc.. and was one word in japanese enough of a reference to the country this game came out of ? maybe i don't know), how could they design it so poorly the first time, while the plot is so amazingly on point ? Well, maybe there was already discontent from the creative minds behind the curtains, and that's why it didn't take too long for the production to agree to a change. Let's face it, those who wrote and directed this really LOVE the games. The character is SPOT on in his humour and reactions, the plot make good use of a lot of things you think about when you think Sonic, and all the cast kills it -I was so happy with some of the smaller parts-, with Jim Carrey front and center using all of his inventive and genious craft to make a perfectly insane Dr Robotnik ! (the way he goes from one side to the other of the spectrum of mood swings during the course of one single sentence was amazing). I won't spoil in details what you'll find here -I spent time waiting for things to happen like they did in the games, and most of them did-, just know that if you can go past the fact that this doesn't happen in a far away land with furry animals transformed into crazy robots, this is a really fun and enjoyable experience. The end credits even give you hope for even more respectful material, would a sequel come our way in the near futur (part of it even makes you wish they would make a 2D+ adaptation for your dusty Megadrive/Genesis). Hats off to everyone involved, I would love to see more adaptations this respectful of the source material again, given the inescapable fact that is has to happen in a human world, in America, for it to be anything else than an anime adaptation-. I trust every retro video game loving kid, big or small, will have a kick out of this !",Sonic the Hedgehog

I kinda figured he would be over-the-top like in The Mask and ACE, Pet Detective but, for me, that wasn't the case. Marsden played the kind of character he usually plays. He was solid. He and Sumpter (dear god she is gorgeous) had great chemistry. Schwartz was a good fit for the voice of Sonic. Plenty of LOL moments and it didn't get bogged down too much.

Credit to the studio for listening to the feedback and to the animators for redesigning Sonic after the first trailer dropped. He actually looks really good now. It was well worth the delay and the movie is so much better for it. Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic is perfect, matching the character and, as basic as the script is, it's surprisingly funny.Without a doubt, Jim Carrey steals the show as Dr. Robotnik. People might wonder if there's such a thing as too much Jim Carrey but this film shows that too much is just enough. From the way he talks to the way he moves to the way he dances, even when he's just there, he radiates hilarity. With some solid CGI and action set-pieces, this is a thoroughly enjoyable film.

But I Really enjoyed this movie, James, tom and Jim all did a great job with their roles. Loved the story and the rest of the characters. Was great to see eggman take on a more iconic look at the end and loved seeing tails, made me keen for a 2nd with the rest of the gang, maybe with shadow as well idk, hoping he was gonna go gold as well but too much for one movie plus no gems so makes sense either way I'm keen for a 2nd,Also big probs to the understanding of fans and doing the re design!!

I have never been a sonic fan to begin with and this definitely won't make me one. There are way better movies to take your kids/family to like Toy story 4, how to train your dragon 3 and Frozen 2.
Overall, it has some fun moments, the design of sonic is good and i enjoyed Jim Carrey in the movie.",Sonic the Hedgehog
485,zhenwenho,Nothing new but all fun if you like sonic,6,21 February 2020,"My Rating:
6.7/10What seemed like heading for sure disaster has proven itself to be a rather enjoyable movie. So, a Sonic movie where its target audience is children but it does not forget that it must cater towards the older audience as many of the Sonic fans are probably above the age of 20 by now. Well, this isn't an amazing movie but it isn't a bad movie either. It's just, good. I'd say that it is just above the recent Detective Pikachu movie. It has a generic plot, with close to none plot twists.There isn't much to say about this movie but I was surprised that James Marsden was willing to take up this gig as I believe that he has quite a talent in acting; but then again I've not seen enough movies with him in it to be a judge of his range. However, the chemistry between Sonic and Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) really feels natural and this is mainly due to the dialogue which is cute. Jim Carrey is Jim Carrey at his well craziest and it is an absolute joy to watch him go nuts with his character.I believe they do these characters justice with each character as they are not boiled down or simply some form of studio interruptance in the movie so that it has some form of SJW message. It's just a joy to watch honestly.In the end, the movie was pretty fun and I mean do go watch it, I think the jokes were pretty clever too even though they were for a younger audience, I believe fans of this character would be happy with the portrayal of the character and the design because, my gosh, what were they thinking with that 'original' design.",Sonic the Hedgehog
486,gwsteinmetz,Decent,6,14 April 2020,"Olive Garden, the ever watchable Jim Carrey, fan service that I'm sure sonic fans will love, and a decent kids movie with a half-baked message, it's about what I expected.",Sonic the Hedgehog
487,bssonicspeed,GOTTA GO FAST!!!!,8,23 February 2020,"Do I really need to address to backlash the first trailer got, sonic looked horrifying, but thank god they actually took the criticism and decide to redo the design. Was the movie good though? Well if you're not a sonic fan, you'll find this movie to be entertaining, but as a sonic fan, I thought this movie was amazing. And I'm gonna say this, from what I've seen from the movie is that I could tell that the filmmakers of this movie do not care or respect critics that are not a sonic fan, they actually respect the fans, I don't really see that from most video game movies, and I am very thankful for that. Most video game movies are trying to be too similar to the games and is telling the same story. That is not the case with Sonic, this movie is its own thing, it actually has a different story.Ben Schwartz's performance as sonic is amazing, he had the same personality as sonic, hyper and energetic. There were times in this movie where sonic was having a mental breakdown over how lonely he was, and I really felt something from that. And I gotta say the Cgi with Sonic (not the character design) is very impressive, hell, all of the cgi was amazing.Hands down the beat part of the movie is definitely Jim Carry as Dr. Robotnik. But he wasn't portraying robotnik in this movie, it's just Jim Carry playing as Jim Carry, but that is not a bad thing at all. He had a separate personality from Eggman in the games, but it was honestly more likable than eggman in the games.I was expecting the human characters to not be good, but James Marsden's character, Tom, is honestly good in the movie. He had a lot of comedy, a lot of heart, but most importantly, the chemistry between Sonic and Tom, which is very impressive, there chemistry is very touching majority of the times, and the comedy is really great. Tiki Sumpter's character is not really important in this movie, she doesn't really show up a lot.Let's talk about the flaws. The comedy in this movie was great for the most part, but there was a little bit of kid humor thrown into this movie, so it shortens it by a little bit, also there is more adult humor in this movie than I expected. Throughout the movie there were some pacing problems, but it wasn't that bad. There was some product placement in the movie, but I decided just to forget what it was since it's no big deal. My biggest problem with the movie is a few plot holes that's been really confusing me.Conclusion: As a sonic fan, this movie really made me happy by giving me the sonic and robotnik I want. This is the perfect movie for families to enjoy, and I feel like a lot of movie goers will enjoy this. This is a good step in the right direction ever since detective Pikachu, the trend for good video game movies is starting to increase. This truly is the best video game movie, but that can just be the sonic fan in me saying that.",Sonic the Hedgehog

490,thurstanjohnston,Very pleasantly surprised,8,19 March 2021,"This is the first actually good video game movie. Throughly enjoyed this and it's a good film. Sonic is great and thankfully not annoying, Jim Carey is superb as dr robotnik and the rest of the cast are fine.
It's definitely a kids movie, but plenty of adult jokes in there.It's not high brow or anything,but it's a fun, amusing and entertaining family movie.This is how it's done !",Sonic the Hedgehog

492,naturenomad,GHASTLY and HORRID,1,14 February 2020,"Wow, my roommate dragged me to go see Sonic tonight at 10, judging from the near empty theaters, it looks like people are being smart and avoiding this trainwreck of a family flick. Jim Carrey needs to retire and resort to back to his ANTI TRUMP, he tries so hard but fails on every level. Sorry Jim, you've lost your magic touch a long time ago. He was cringe inducing and embarrassing to watch.Marsden is serioulsly typecast in these bland thankless roles, he needs a new agent. The movie is nowhere as bad as CATS however it is bland, boring and dull like CATS. This is made for TV netflix flavor of the week fodder and anyone that forks over hard earned cash will be fooling themselves that this movie is entertaining. AVOID like the PLAGUE",Sonic the Hedgehog

In general , not a bad movie",Sonic the Hedgehog

499,punyerd,Disappointing and stupid,5,19 February 2021,"This film's strengths and weaknesses are very obvious, so I'll put them in a list.
I have kept it as spoiler free as possible, but there are details which would normally be considered spoilers, but since this is an adaptation, these are things you would expect to happen.The positives are:
Sonic's design looks great (massive improvement from the original abomination)Special effects are enjoyableJim Carrey is greatJim Carrey is trying his hardest to save the movieCan't really think of any more positives. Other than me babbling about Jim Carrey being pretty much the only good part of the movie. The negatives of this movie are:The movie is very childish. No one over 10 will appreciate this movie. There are a ton of stupid kiddy tropes and fart jokes that stand out in a bad way.James Marsden is the stupidest, gayest, most idiotic living meme after Tom Allen. He's a pain to watch for even one minute of the movie. No wonder this Sonic chooses to spy on him. And no wonder he hasn't been in any major motion picture until this.While the design of Sonic is great, the design of Super Sonic is very lazy. It's just Sonic with small blue electricity that people can barely see around him. At least make him yellow. He's yellow.No other Sonic character is in this other than Sonic, Eggman and one cameo from Tails in an end-credits scene. We need these characters to have main roles. Who did we get instead? Weird, stupid, human characters that are completely irrelevant. Literally just there so that James Marsden can get money.The movie sets itself up for a sequel. Let's hope there isn't one. It's awful.It's fun and kids will love it. But only kids will love it. It's an awful adaptation that's almost as bad as the street fighter movie.",Sonic the Hedgehog
500,luiet,A Great Time!,8,27 February 2020,"There's no better critics than an 8 year old & his 10 year old brother! Both, amazingly, huge ""Sonic"" fans & have been since they were toddlers! Jim Carrey, as usual, is outstanding as ""Dr. Eggman""! We, three? Can't wait for Part II! A great film for kids & adults! You will laugh!",Sonic the Hedgehog
501,stiansmerud,I want to see more,7,17 February 2020,"I joked with my friend when the movie started: Oh they are going to make a SEGA universe - because of the Marvel Universe looking intro before the movie started.
But after seeing this movie, I truly would like to see a sequel or another in-universe movie.
This is truly more then we could hope for. I mean, I went because they did the redesign. The first design looked like the Smurfs all over again. But there was no guarantee for the movie.
The redesign really helps, because some moments would not have the impact they had with the other design.
This movie starts great, have a great. middle and actually builds up at the end.
It had some moments that brought it down for me personally, and therefore I give it my honest score of 7/10, but I have no problem seeing this being a 8 to 10/10 for some people.
Thanks for listening to the fans Jeff Fowler and thank you Paramount for letting them redesign. I want to see more.",Sonic the Hedgehog
502,kratoslncool,"not the best movie, but a good movie",7,29 April 2020,"Visual: 8/10, could have been better, but could have been worse, remember the first trailer design, yeah, it could have been like that but the movie studio went out of their way to fix this and please the fanActing: 7/10, Jim did his role well,almost every other characters play their roles right, there are some cringe moment but in generals, it please to watchWatching with your kids/family/friends/ etc: 9/10 Dump fun movie, possible to watch with anyone.Stories: Bascially not anything new, cliche, dumb fun, ""huh huh friend family Fast and Furious Cliche huh huh"". I dont hate it, but it is not something I would recommended for anyone wants some quality story content.Overall, dumb fun movie, go watch it, or get the dvd digital version, pretty pleased to watch.",Sonic the Hedgehog
503,Luvstagrind,Good movie but some very questionable writing,7,25 May 2020,"This movie is probably one of the better video game movies made yet. That being said there are some moments that make me questions some of the decisions written in the story.1. I find Sonic freaking out about Tom moving to the city to be rather childish. He compares Tom moving from small town to the big city to his situation but they are totally different scenarios.2. Sonic couldn't run up the building to get his rings? The writers do know how fast he can run, right? He should've been able to scale the building in seconds, grab his rings, and been back in time to use them.Now these are just story gripes but all in all it was an enjoyable movie",Sonic the Hedgehog
504,chearn-09739,Pretty Good Little Family Movie,7,9 March 2020,"Took my sons to see this. I liked it! It was hilarious. And touching. And hilarious. And well done. Jim Carrey was a lot of fun.

505,ArchivedScene,Animation saved it.,6,14 March 2020,"It tries so hard to have a laughable humor but the theme of the movie is good. The redo of sonic's animation surely is good.

506,allenlopez-16028,Sonic the Hedgehog is a damn good time!,7,14 February 2020,"Redesign... sonic past few years... blah blah blah. I'm reviewing the movie on it's own merit. Quick. Easy. Simple. The movie is tons of fun. It suffers from being a bit predictable, but I did not mind for the most part. 70% of the jokes hit, and hit well. It's competently shot, with great uses of practical effects and CGI. The human characters were surprisingly great. The stand outs are, obviously, Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, and Ben Schwartz as Sonic himself. They're both absolutely fantastic and well deserving of praise. Watch. This. Movie. (Stay for the mid-credits scene. You won't be disappointed.)",Sonic the Hedgehog
507,nickysofficialchannel,Gotta go fast!!!,10,17 February 2020,"I saw Sonic the Hedgehog at AMC Palisades 21 with my mom. It was cool, fast, and really funny! Before that, Back on April 30, 2019, When the Sonic fans were watching the trailer of this movie, They raged about Sonic's terribly CGI redesign! They wanted the director, Jeff Fowler, to redesign him. I hated Sonic's old redesign because it gives me the heebie jeebies. But 3 months ago, When the Sonic fans were watching the newer trailer of this movie, They cheered for Sonic's greatest CGI re-redesign! Jeff Fowler finally redesigned him. For today, I now like Sonic's new redesign! And for the movie, My favorite part is when Sonic was getting chased by Dr. Robotnik, They chased around the world using the Magic Portal Rings. It was really really funny! At the end of the credits, Tails' came to Earth! And he's going to meet Sonic. If you played the Sonic games, Then go see the movie! He's the fastest thing alive!I sure hope I'll look forward to a sequel of this, really soon!I give this movie 11.0/10.9.",Sonic the Hedgehog
508,jcurtis-27126,"Had low expectations, but it came out better",8,14 September 2020,"Normally I don't like watching shows less than a 7. But my family insisted on this one so I got it. I must say Jim carrey made this show. Normally movies below a 7 I expect something weak out of it. Either cheesey moments or bad acting or bad plot or flow (like the last star wars movie). It wasn't a perfect movie. But it was entertaining. If Jim carrey wasn't in this, then I would've rated it lower. The movie wasn't bad, and it wasn't inspiring like inception, but it fell in that middle ground. It was worth watching once.",Sonic the Hedgehog
509,jafhate,"It's Fun, Wild and It's Sonic!",10,14 February 2020,"Before the redesign of Sonic, I had my doubt that this movie is a flop. After the redesign, I still have my doubt regardless of the better Sonic look and character design. However, when I watched this movie for valentines with my Wife. OH BOY! We were blown away by the comedy, action and references from the original game. We laugh and enjoyed the movie from start till finish. The only downside about this movie is that it ends. Now Im really hoping that it will release a sequel soon cuz damn the end credits got me gooooodddddd! Now this is Sonic! Thumbs up for the animator for their hard work in making Sonic....

511,phanto_m,A.L.F. meets the Smurfs,5,14 November 2020,"I'm not even sure what to write about this movie. I just wanted it to end really. I don't got kids at an age the movie was made for, which might be the problem. I grew up with sonic games and loved them. Which is too bad. Since this movie is not at all aimed at sonic fans older than 16 but only at kids of older fans, who don't necessarily know sonic at all, but are all in for mainstream American blockbuster movies.There's nothing wrong with this. The acting is good, there is popular music, there's alot of action, cgi is great. It's just that this movie doesn't need to be about sonic. It could be any character really. Its story is actually the same as in that A.L.F. movie. The humour is the same as in any angry birds/Lego/minions animated clip. The whole ""fantasy-character meets the real world"" reminds me of the animated smurf movies.
Why is everything so exchangeable right now?Even if I would be okay with all of the above stated, I'm not okay with the screenwriting.
Sonic can run at Lightspeed and can emit emp shockwaves which could easily end the movie in seconds (emp vs robots = win, getting to San Francisco by running = seconds). But he ends up in an all American roadtrip with Marsden, eating chili-dogs, talks about farting, dances alot and leaves fighting robots with a flashlight to his new best friend Tom, his wife and his cute dog.
I can only accept this since it may be funny to kids and the fact that this movie is not about the game sonic. It's about an alien lifeform that is left lonely on a new planet and is up to find a new home on earth having to deal with the good and bad aspects of human mankind searching for friendship and family. Yep, this is 2020th ALF.The best about this movie to me is Jim Carrey as robotnik. There could've been no better cast.As you can tell by now, I'm well disappointed with this movie. There should have at least been more fan service. The 2 minute intro of sonics world is way too short. Where is that classic music and sound? Why is there only 2 sonic characters. Who is that robotnik sidekick? Why is the end credits the only real sonic moment in this movie? It's not easy to write this, but even the Super Mario Bros. movie tried harder!
At last, I'm glad they changed Sonic's look during production! This barely ever happens!If you're with kids who are alright with massive use of weapons this movie might be for you. If you are in search for a well made game adaptation with massive fan service - don't bother watching.",Sonic the Hedgehog

No, i didn't though it's going to be terrible, i though it would be just okay, but it turned out better than just okay.

But don't go in with high expectations.Having just watched Sonic, I can say that it was an enjoyable movie. Many of the elements that make up the movie has been seen before but the movie executes them well enough for them to be justified and certainly funny.Standout from the cast is Jim Carrey, who steals the show, especially in one scene in which he is experimenting with something that belongs to Sonic.Visual Effects and Sonic himself could have done with a little more polish but its adequate.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Jim Carrey steals the show as you'd expect, Sonic's VA is great in the role and his human counterpart plays well off him. Works well for kids and nostalgic adults alike.

526,jacman2084,Really Don't Understand the Ratings,8,30 April 2020,"What are people expecting from such a movie? Someone has mentioned - it has it's moments, some funny dialogs and decent action etc. and rated it a 5!I mean what more do you need from a movie that was inspired by a video game for kids? It has its moments, funny dialogs and absolutely decent actions. It even gives homage to the video games, sets up the platform for a sequel etc.My only quirk at the beginning was that why they choose to make Robotnik a skinny person when they had Jim Carey playing the part. He could've easily transformed to the fat, moustached comics version of Robotnik if they'd wanted to. Then I realized what they did. So no complaints there.The movie went by quickly (just like that blue devil) and I really enjoyed it from start to end. Kids will enjoy it too. Yes the story might have been told many times before but it wasn't that big a deal and it did not affect the enjoyment part.I'd take a scene to scene adaption of Justice League animation if they could make a movie out of that (comparing to what they actually did).With that in mind, Paramount has made a decent flick out of Sonic the game. I would easily give it a 7 or more. We shouldn't expect an Inception like movie for Sonic. The ratings simply are not fair.Forgot to mention, the voice actor for Sonic did an exceptional job. It's not easy to lend voice to this character convincingly!",Sonic the Hedgehog

533,keonir,So much fun!!!,7,23 February 2020,"So like many people I grew up with Sonic but maybe not as long as other people seeing how I'm 23. But the games I did play always stuck with me cuz how can you forget that blue hedgehog with a big personality. After seeing the first trailer I was 100% this movie was going to be another video games movie flop, cuz the premise doesn't isn't that interesting; bring the video game character into our world & see how they react. But after seeing the whole movie... it actually works.... what??? Yeah the premise actually works for the character. It felt like they took the idea and really played to the advantage of what could happen in the most interesting way. Jean-Ralphio surprisingly make an excellent Sonic, (kinda disappointed they never like to use the orginal voice actor) he sounds very close to the video games & has some funny lines. Cyclops plays Sonics guide & buddy & does a good acting job. The stand out though of course is Ace Ventura as Dr. Robotnik oh my gosh he is great to watch in the movie & I can't wait to see more of this character. I have to mention the redesign & I'm so happy they did it. It really helps the movie & Sonic looks so good with the new design. The movie shouldn't have worked & was gearing up to be a flop but it turned out to be a great & fun movie. It already maybe something like 60 million at the box office & is looking to make even more so if they make a sequel I'd be happily looking forward to seeing it especially with what the after credits bring. So if you're looking to take the family out or your just wanna go see a fun movie with your friends I'd highly recommend this to anyone",Sonic the Hedgehog

Now surprisingly it was every fun and clever little film. Though the jokes don't always land, when they do their funny and cute. The characters were also great too like Mardson's character and definitely Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik. Sonic as a character is easily sympathic and you root for him all the way through and dang does that character have a lots of emotion thanks to studio team who animated him. It's not perfect, but as a Sonic fan I was satisfied and a sequel was announced which I'm excited for.",Sonic the Hedgehog

536,deathwishryo,Sonic the Movie is the feel good film of the year,8,5 March 2020,"There is so much to like about Sonic the Movie, it's so loveable and full of charm.
It is an absolute breath of fresh air, in a thoroughly depressing climate of events globally, outside of film.Every good film needs a great bad guy and Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, is hilariously deranged, as the unhinged mad scientist, on a one man vendetta to try and hunt down Sonic.
He is amazing in this, we're talking prime Jim Carrey here.The camararderie between James Marsden and Sonic, as a sort of cop and buddy dynamic, is very sweet.
Indeed there are a few touching moments, playing into the loneliness of Sonic having such powers and having to keep himself off the grid.The other side characters are nicely done and add to the film, rather than get in the way. Good examples of this, are Tom's wife and Robotnik's assistant.
Both add something and compliment an already decent cast.
There are so many funny moments and great one-liners.
Indeed even non Sonic or SEGA fans would take something away from this film, as it has lot to offer comedically. For example, fans of the likes of Family Guy and perhaps Ted, may really find that a lot of the humour running through the film, resonates with them.
There is a lot of sharp witted humour but also plenty of hilarious slapstick.It is not surprising that many Sonic fans have gone to several viewings of Sonic the Movie.
Indeed, the greatest critics of most things, are the fans themselves. And the fans have spoken, with Sonic the Movie being a resounding success.
Both technically and commercially, the latter, in taking over $200 million at the box office.
In doing so becoming the highest grossing video game film of all-time.As such, Sonic the Movie is highly recommended for all SEGA and Sonic fans. It will no doubt have a major positive impact in numbers on the already dedicated Sonic fanbase.Never failing to raise a smile, Sonic the Movie is the feel good film of the year and a love letter to SEGA and Sonic fans globally. A real resounding success.Go see it!",Sonic the Hedgehog

542,rr-56811,Fun,7,3 April 2021,"Viewed on: Hulu.Live action film adaptation of the classic video game series that sees the titular speedy blue hedgehog hiding out on Earth (he's depicted as an alien on the run) until he slips up, and now he needs the help of a small town sheriff to track down his lost rings (collectables in game, their role here is interplanetary transportation devices) before he's captured by eccentric government scientist Dr. Robotnik (main antagonist in the game series, played here by Jim Carrey).For better or worse it doesn't stick to the continuity of the games (to be expected, there's just a limit to how much that can work with these ""escaped to our world"" live action affairs), but if you can live with that, this provides a pretty fun time. The action itself in terms of the speed effect reminds me of ""the Flash"" tv show (but with a larger budget), I enjoyed the bar fight scene, and Jim Carrey hams it up as... himself, but that's alright.",Sonic the Hedgehog

As a dad of 30 who grew up playing the original Sonic games and watching Carey movies, I had waves of nostalgia running through me as I witnessed classic Jim Carey come back from my childhood. I took my own kids to watch this movie and expected some half arsed Alvin and the chipmunksesque money spinner and I was wrong. James Marsden does a brilliant job of being believable as a guy who discovered a funny shaped/coloured CGI character. Yes it's completely unrealistic but what movie is these days? Say what you want, this film is a gooden. Go see this instead of 'Birds of Prey'. If you are a fan of old school Jim and fun family movies, you won't be disappointed.",Sonic the Hedgehog

555,nvanche,story needs major help,8,20 February 2020,"While it was amazing to see Sonic animated in a 3d film, I found the story very lacking and cringe-worthy. The characters go to great lengths to stand still and explain every part of the storyline to each other and sometimes even their thoughts without giving the audience time to put any pieces together for themselves. I am not a parent but a single young adult who likes adult humor and even I found it very very odd that in a movie aimed at kids and even with a kid character (sonic) they decided to have a major scene in a bar of all places. Couldn't they have some other location for deep character development??? A bar with beer and adult behavior? Seriously??? There are some nice throwbacks in t his movie. Sonic's race car bed. Sonic nicknaming things and people. I like the tie in to Dr. Eggman, and the crazy chainsaw guy at the end was a nice funny touch. I find it hard to believe Tom dropped his life on a split second to save a funny alien animal and barely asked any questions. Human beings while protective don't just adapt naturally to situations like that. I was also really disturbed by sonics random emotional reaction to Tom's decision to leave the town. While he is a child and change is hard I work with children and I just found that really really weird. There could have been a better way to do that. At times Sonic seemed very much adult and had common sense thinking and other times he was completely acting like a child, I feel like they should have picked one scenario and stuck with it. Yes sonic can be immature and goofy but it seemed a bit much at times. Especially the excessive talking to himself...that was borderline physco. I would however like them to make another Sonic movie, stick to the same animation design and work more on storyline this time. Storyline was personally 4/10 for me. Picture and animation was 8/10. I would watch it again because I grew up loving sonic but I'd be embarrassed to admit it to anyone I knew because of the horrible storyline.",Sonic the Hedgehog

559,justintravis,Great family movie,8,14 February 2020,"What kills me about new movies that are targetted towards the whole family and usually younger audiences is they slip really lewd and inappropriate jokes in for adults that usually fly over children's heads. Not this movie. It was definitely enjoyable, there was little bits that made me laugh that were a good nod to the sonic memes and the older fans.The best part is theres usually some political message being pushed but there was none of that. This is truly a great movie for the family and for fans. Not a masterpiece by any means, but it's really good. I cant wait for the sequel.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Jim Carrey is great, he carries this movie alot, but that doesn't make it a better movie just because of the design.",Sonic the Hedgehog
561,venomlifeguard,I appreciate the redesign but...,4,5 April 2020,"The movie starts really well and it's fairly exciting with consequences set up early on.What happens next is typical Hollywood in that they forget what the title of the movie is and shoe horn in a bad human story. I don't understand the need for movies to pay multiple actors like the girlfriend in this movie, she could have easily been removed as she added nothing and they could have saved three paychecks there with that character.It's hard to like James Marsden as he seems to play characters as really soft. His Cyclops was a really poor beta and he left that role to be a third wheel beta in Superman returns. He then plays a beta robot in Westworld and here he is again as a beta character. His story is pretty poor and it could have and should have been more streamlined to fit Sonic in.Carrey gives a good performance and that's about it really, he delves back into Riddler and Grinch territory but it's ok.It's tough to say this as I know he's a fan of the character but the voice of Sonic just doesn't fit, it sounds like John mulaney's character of Andrew from big mouth. I don't understand why they didn't use Roger Craig Smith.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Sonic, who has been portrayed as an insufferable fratboy for a long time now, was a charming delight. Carrey, who I thought would be miscast as Robotnik, was hilarious and perfect for the role. Sumpter and Marsden are a really lovely onscreen couple and Marsden and Sonic have a great chemistry.It was awesome to see so many references to the games (classic and modern) woven into a fresh new story.Looking forward to the sequel!",Sonic the Hedgehog

571,taniaewatkins,I'd rather watch the super mario brothers film over this any day,1,10 August 2020,"This movie was just all over the place. The story line was blandly generic (but to be expected so I don't really mark it down for this) but it was so incredibly poorly told I couldn't follow it. And it was the most basic of basic story lines!!!Sonic was an immature kid essentially, and this was done so poorly he just came across as not even being able to resonate with his target audience (5-12 year old boys who still think fart jokes are the funniest thing in the world) because the immaturity was just excessive even for this kind of movie.There was no wow factor in anything. Dr Robotnik is supposed to be over the top but Jim Carey did a huge disservice to the character.This movie was so bad my 5 year old (target market for this movie) got scared when the robots started shooting at the cop and sonic then got bored and asked to leave about an hour into the movie. I had been looking at my phone for half an hour as I was bored two seconds in.Overall, just a bad film. One star is extremely generous. I don't walk out of movies on principle, but honestly couldn't wait to get out of this one.",Sonic the Hedgehog

579,k-60298,Mediocre family film but great video game adaptation.,6,17 May 2020,"Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2020 action-adventure comedy film based on the video game franchise published by Sega. It is directed by Jeff Fowler and stars Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog and Jim Carrey as Doctor Robotnik, as well as James Marsden and Tika Sumpter. Sonic grossed $306.8 million at the box office.First off, I'm so glad they redesigned Sonic, the first trailer of Sonic looked no where near as good as this one, it just shows how public backlash can impact a movie so props to Paramount Pictures for redesigning him. Video game adaptations have never been a huge success with audiences and critics but Sonic quickly became the highest grossing video game adaptation and won over its audience with a likeable cast and many jokes that worked.James Marsden is a very likeable human lead and it's great to see Jim Carrey going back to his comedic roots after his role in Dark Crimes, as he is great as the antagonist in this film.Sonic the Hedgehog works as an enjoyable road trip movie and that's the best aspect of this for me as it's fun to see what they do, this movie had some genuine laughs in it with the puns and pop culture references it includes, but easily one of the best things for me is the soundtrack, it works so well with the film and was a joy to listen too.Sonic the Hedgehog is a fairly average family adventure comedy film but it is comparably a good video game adaptation compared to others in the genre. This is a good first live-action portrayal of the well loved Sega franchise and it succeeds in what it was meant to be, a somewhat enjoyable family film.However this film missed so much of its potential in its interesting source material by trading it in for a road trip movie, granted the movie does work as a road trip movie but it would have been so much better if it showed more of the other worlds and other interesting characters in franchise for even a small cameo. The movie could have done with more time to establish Sonics world before rushing to Earth and the wife's sister hating the husband is an overused trope in movies but is funny at times.I've never been the biggest fan of kids movies in general but this one was enjoyable enough to watch, it had some genuine laughs and the cast worked really well together which leads to the film having a satisfying ending. Hopefully the sequel will include more iconic Sonic characters but the and the end credits and post credit scene of this movie were also fun to watch.Sonic the Hedgehog marks the start of Sagas shared universe and it's a universe I'm intrigued to watch play out. Out of the movies that have been released in the disastrous year of 2020, this is one of the better ones but it's still far from perfect.",Sonic the Hedgehog
580,windozze,no one asked for this movie,1,18 March 2020,Utterly underwhelming and boring movie with predictable story and for the entirety of it you feel like you're waiting for it to develop into something interesting or show you some excitement but all it does is move meaningless and underwhelming scenes one after another that by the end credits you feel like meh,Sonic the Hedgehog
581,lnyron,Now all we need's a somewhat decent Mario movie to spin grim decades of videogame movies.,6,29 August 2020,"I am a lone adult male. I dont have a family, but I grew up playing Sonic and came into this movie with little expectations.The trailer was so bad it was hilarious. I think youtuber Dunkey put it best; Mario set's the bar for the video game world and in the movie department he set it very low.This movie has beaten the odds in just about every conceivable department for video game movies. The acting was alright, pretty relaxed. Overall relaxed tone actually.I'll keep this brief and just say, great visuals, pretty good story and screenplay and even the Olive Garden promo thing they did was acceptable. Jim Carrey playing Jim Carrey was nice to see.It's hard to see where you'd go with a Sonic movie and I think they did pretty well. Moving forward I'd like to see Sonic in some more exotic, videogamey world's closer to where it starts, or to where he lives in the games. Still, like I said, having low expectations I was pretty happy, the movie world and the videogame community are all satisfied, so they've hopefully set the bar a lot higher than videogames have in a long, lomg time.",Sonic the Hedgehog
582,toolongdidntmovie,"Funny, Wholesome!",7,13 October 2020,"Judging by the ratings I was having double thoughts whether to go with it or not but it was quite worth it.

So watch the movie and do let me know how you liked it!",Sonic the Hedgehog
583,peytoncanaan,Very Surprising!,5,22 February 2021,"This movie surprised me. I am a massive Sonic fan and this movie surely delivers. It's not a ground-breaking film, I wouldn't even call a good. But for a movie that is dedicated to fans like me and families across the world, it surely delivers. Sonic the Hedgehog is a super fast lightning speed hedgehog who comes from another planet. Not named, we do get a glimpse of an island that looks very similar to Green Hill zone from the Sonic games (it is) but what I really like about this movie is how well paced it is. I never got bored a single time. Sonic was true to his video game counterpart, he is a cool dude with an attitude. There is Tom played by James Marsden is a cop for the small town called Green Hills. Both characters together make this movie shine because Sonic and Tom work so well off each other. The live action with just the human characters never bored me. The action scenes were really well done, I just wish there was a bit more. But here is the biggest A+ the movie has to offer. Get this. Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik. I wouldn't have thought of that but he does a really good job. He has his own impression on what Robotnik should be like, and it works really well. I would've loved if there was more interactions with Sonic and Dr. Robotnik. My only gripes about this movie are how some of the jokes are hit or miss, the blatant product placement (especially Olive Garden), how there are some plot holes in this movie like when Tom is a fugitive, that's why him and Sonic run away, and this scene where Tom literally shows his police ID to a lady. What? She must be very stupid because Tom was on the news. I feel there are times where Sonic gets pretty annoying, but there aren't a lot. And the road trip trope is in this movie, which sucks but it's Hollywood. This is a great kids movie and it is definitely a great Sonic movie.",Sonic the Hedgehog

589,marcogiulio-camurri,Ace Ventura meets Ted - And it's not a good thing,5,28 July 2020,"It's always hard to find a decent story to put behind a movie based on a platform video game. Unfortunately whoever wrote this script completely missed the spot.In the first twenty minutes of this film there is a massive line up of nonsense. Things happen too fast, look like stupid decisions, and they have the sole purpose of placing Sonic on a road trip to San Francisco with his new best friend forever. How nonsensical the whole thing is becomes very clear when Sonic manages to run to the coast in two seconds but goes back to Tom saying that ""he can't do this without him"". A weird Ted-like friendship is then created between Tom, who is on his path of growing up much like Mark Wahlberg's John, and this fluffy and sometimes cute hedgehog that behaves like Ted. There are some decent comedy skits here and there, but all they really have to do is to walk into a building in SF and then they are teleported back to a cheaper filming location outside town.The bad guy in the movie is Dr. Robotnik, a neurotic super genius that is given too much power without a reason by some army generals that have less brain than Commandant Lassard in Police Academy. Apparently Jim Carrey ha d little script ad was given all the freedom he wanted to ad-lib and act out this character as he wanted. Unfortunately, he decided to turn this foe into Ace Ventura: same jokes, same movements, same noises, and I don't mean the good ones. The very few good jokes are lost in an ocean of useless movements and pranks that distract the viewer. It must be hard, as an actor, to be told that you'll be the third most important character in a movie where the star is a CGI furry animal, but he deliberately tried to be the star of the movie and the result is just confusing.So.... leaky plot. Badly written characters (or not written at all). The movie is mildly entertaining but could be so much better. I'll give it a 5/10. I hope that if there will be a part 2, the writers will put an effort and do a better job.",Sonic the Hedgehog
590,ChrisRemix,Definitely a great family movie,7,15 February 2020,"I walked into this movie with the same expectations I had with Detective Pikachu and I have to say: I thoroughly enjoyed it. I used to love Sonic through my childhood and to see my favorite game character on screen with Jim Carrey, whom I also grew up with, definitely brought some emotions out. The movie succeeds in giving the character something he hasn't had in over a decade: depth. They show the audience a side of Sonic we never got to see in the games. Jim Carrey delivers the best Eggman I've seen since the Sonic Adventure series. He's crazy with a dark side and I love that. If you're looking for a heartfelt comedy with action packed sequences then definitely go see this. You won't be disappointed.",Sonic the Hedgehog

The characters suck, the visuals blow, the action is just copied and pasted from better speedster movies. Everything good in this film is just borrows from different movies. Jim Carey is just doing Ace Ventura; the action is just Days of Future Past, and the plot is ET, Bumblebee, the Iron Giant, ETC. With all of the egregious product placement, the movie it reminded me the most of was ""Mac & Me."" For those of you who are unfamiliar with Mac & Me, it's a shameless RT ripoff that was almost entirely paid for. But I came out of that film more fulfilled than when I came out of Sonic.

And then Paramount Pictures announced that they're gonna do a live take on Sonic the Hedgehog, and I was freaking out like ""Yes, I want this"". But things became a let down when they had the simple design that ruined everyone's reputation ever since the teaser poster and the trailer dropped. Everyone was angry, myself included. But all this has changed when the director Jeff Fowler tweeted that Sonic will get a redesign. I sighed in relief. Until today, Paramount gave us a Sonic the Hedgehog we all know and loved, and it's so cute that I just wanna jump straight into the movie and hold him in my arms. The movie filled me up with video game energy, and I felt like I wanna run around with my arms out, running like Sonic. This movie is perfect, and really tops Tomb Raider, Detective Pikachu, Angry Birds and that awful Super Mario film. This is the very film that will lift the video game adaptation curse",Sonic the Hedgehog
601,olivermobile,Good with cringe.,7,15 February 2020,"This is a humorous good movie if you want to go put with family or friends. Sonic feels like sonic in this movie. They went with a safe movie plan, I felt at times it was rushed ir boring. But my favourite part was jim carrey as robotnik (eggman) he in my eyes stole the show, really well done. He really acts like egg man and shows how incredible he is with that role.",Sonic the Hedgehog
602,alqqqy,Absolute PERFECTION,10,29 February 2020,"There's nothing like this movie. I haven't experienced pure joy like this in my entire life. The actor for Sonic the Hedgehog should recieve ALL the Oscars, BAFDAs or whatever stuff you give to famous people. In my home country of Zimbabwe, we are not allowed to watch films at all. So to watch this masterpiece is an honour in and off itself. I had to be escorted out of the premises after sticking by 12 minutes after the movie ended. Then I got arrested by the South African police (my neighbouring country where I went to watch the movie)To cut a long story short. The poor slums in my area could use the extra money SEGA for me to write this review.God bless America.",Sonic the Hedgehog
603,mail-95391,Sonic's movie career to be better than Mario's,7,3 May 2020,"I enjoyed the Sonic the Hedgehog movie. Well, most of the time I couldn't stop thinking about all the actors having to act with absolutely nothing. Here, look at this. This right here is a little blue creature running around. And of course the whole story about how they changed the little blue creature. I think they definitely changed him for the better. But the real thing I couldn't stop thinking about when I watched the sonic movie is what a better movie career Sonic is going to have than Mario and what a surprise. What a beautiful way for Sonic And Sega to enact their final and, albeit small revenge against Nintendo for the loss of the console wars. The Sonic movie is definitely better than the Mario movie, although that was years ago. And it's better than the Mario TV show too.Jim Carrey is fantastic is Dr. Robotnik, and I expect him to be even better in the sequel, Sonic is actually likable as a cartoon character, and the rest of the human cast do a fine job supporting him, similar to any Garfield movie. I really enjoyed the sonic movie. I'd suggest watching it. Thanks so much for reading this review. I hope you liked it.",Sonic the Hedgehog
604,JKBlohm,Yes. Just yes.,10,19 June 2020,"No hyperbole here, Sonic has been my hero since I was six years old. My very first video game was Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on the Genesis back in 1996. I've seen the highs and lows, and I gotta say, it's so heartwarming to see my boy done right on the big screen. I even got my family in on it, and knowing nothing of Sonic, they had a blast watching it. It's fun, light-hearted, fast-paced, it's honestly all I could ever have asked for, especially give his ""unique"" original design from last year. This is it, this is my favorite movie of all time, no doubt at all. From Jim Carey's over the top performance as Robotnik, to Sonic's journey through loneliness and gaining a family, hell even the product placement with Olive Garden got a genuine laugh out of me. 10/10, 100/100 rings, five out of five stars. It's perfect.",Sonic the Hedgehog

611,ejdpecina,GOTTA GO see this FAST!,8,14 February 2020,"As a hardcore sonic fan, I appreciate this movie so much. It's both enjoyable to fans and casual goers and I would think delivers a right amount of fan service to please everyone. The redesign definitely made this movie look x10 better and makes you appreciate the extra effort & work put into the film. The movie had a somewhat basic plot but filled it up with lots of hilarious jokes and wicked action sequences. Most jokes where pop culture references but for Sonic's character perfectly. Whenever there's action be in for a treat because it is really outstanding and beautiful. Jim Carrey is perfect as Dr. Robotnik and I can't wait to see this persona again hopefully again. It's quite clear that there are not only 1 but 2 post credit scenes, so stay seated and wait. There most likely a sequel coming, but for now my fan service has been quenched so much especially since we got to see",Sonic the Hedgehog
612,vanwel-98077,Did I watch a different movie?,3,11 April 2020,After seeing all the positive reviews for this movie I decided to give it a watch. I get it's supposed to be a kids' movie but it was really disappointing. The humour was terrible and the dialogue was even worse. I honestly don't get what people saw in it and sadly this will encourage hollywood to make more bad movies that nobody asked for. The only reason I didn't give this movie 1 star is because if the character redesign.,Sonic the Hedgehog

617,luchoarrau,Excellent adaptation from the Classic videogame,9,21 February 2020,"One of the best videogame adaptation ever made. A movie that either adults, kids and fandom would enjoy. Jim Carrey returns to its own formula.",Sonic the Hedgehog
618,Capstivel,Overrated AF,5,26 February 2020,"What a disaster movie. I am a HUGE fan of Sonic since the 1st game, so I was really hyped for this movie, even more with the announcement of Jim Carrey as Eggman. So, I bought the premiere tickets in a local cinema and when the day camed, I went to the cinema, hyped, and then, when it finished, I exited angry. It's the typical movie of a boy that meets an alien (in this case, it's a man child) and the government is searching for him to experiment with him, but OBVIOUSLY, the man child helps him. A lot of movies are exactly the same, LOTS of movies. This movie is really cliche and the ""jokes"" don't makes anyone to laugh, are really bad jokes. I hoped that this were an adaptation of the game, but it's a movie for kids with bad jokes that maybe will make kids laugh. In conclusion, don't watch this movie if you want a good adaption, it's a movie for kids. The reason I'm giving this a 5 out of 10 is because it has a good animation, 2 good acting's (Jim's and the man child) and because they will introduce Tails in the second part. But, don't watch this if you are a fan of Sonic, it will disappoint you...",Sonic the Hedgehog

My 8 year old son has always loved sonic and he was desperate to see this fim and he came out saying how much he loved it and smilied throughout.

629,mofulous,Hilarious and the ultimate family movie,10,13 February 2020,"I spent a while debating whether I should give this film 9 or 10 stars. In the end, I decided to give it a perfect score, and here is the main reason why. I had an absolute blast throughout the entirety of the movie, and there was nothing that had me feeling disappointed or wishing a scene was over. It pulls you right in with a riveting pace and hilarious humor, and the entire movie is loaded to the brim with jokes that had myself and the whole audience laughing. I know everyone has a different sense of humor, but for me, it had me laughing until I was crying!That is not the film's only good point, though. The action is fun to watch and never even begins to get boring. It doesn't take up an excessive portion of the movie, but the action scenes ARE creative and entrancing to watch. Some of my favorite scenes were getting a POV of Sonic running, and any scene in which the world was in slow motion while Sonic was at top speed.There is some emotion to the movie and and a theme anyone can relate to: Loneliness, being an outcast, and fear of abandonment. Oddly the movie didn't make me cry, only shed a tiny tear, despite me being easily moved by fiction. But I do admit a few scenes were very touching and I felt my heartstrings being tugged at very strongly.A lot of people say Jim Carrey stole the show but Sonic himself was the most fun to watch on screen in my opinion.People are going to compare this to Detective Pikachu. Though I loved that movie, I have no doubt that Sonic is the superior movie. I could rewatch Sonic again and again because it doesn't rely on twists. Detective Pikachu was boring to me on the second watch. Also, the human characters in Sonic are far more appealing and have way better acting.A few more thoughts. I was happy to see that the humans don't take the spotlight away from Sonic the Hedgehog. Even with small roles, most of them were enjoyable characters. You shouldn't expect any twists or a complicated plot in the movie; the fun and thrill of what's going on more than makes up for it. It is pure fun and can appeal to anyone and sometimes that's all a family film needs to be in order to be its best.Kids will love it. Sonic fans will love it. Everyone else should have a great time, ESPECIALLY if you're a child at heart. It put me in an amazing mood that I'm sure will last with me for a while. Go watch the movie expecting nothing more than to have a BLAST and laugh, and you won't be disappointed. Depending on who you are, the movie will likely exceed those expectations too. :)",Sonic the Hedgehog

Jim Carrey is in this, and it's one of his best performances in years. They let him do pretty much anything he wanted, and his uncontrolled talent shows beautifully. James Marsden does fairly well, as does Ben Schwartz. Their journey is predictable and cliche, but it's still very fun.
My only problem with it was the product placement, which was distracting and horrible. It wasn't the worst thing ever (not as bad as BVS) though, and it didn't distract me so much that I wanted to die.

653,ienosretep,Is the video game movie curse starting to lift? Sonic the Hedgehog sure makes it seem like it,8,20 May 2020,"Ever since Super Mario Bros. back in 1993, there's been a video game movie curse. You know, like the pirate movie curse, or the odd-numbered Star Trek movie curse. However, in recent years, things seem to be improving. The Angry Birds Movie did okay, I think the sequel did a little better. Detective Pikachu went over well, and now Sonic even exceeds that! I think the curse may be starting to lift. This could bode well for Illumination's upcoming animated Super Mario movie. But I'm talking about Sonic right now. So here goes...
So, we all know the story of the Sonic movie's troubled production. I'll tell it anyway. When the first poster was released showing a silhouette of Sonic, everyone's expectations plummeted. Later, the first trailer released, and they fell some more. This wasn't Sonic we were looking at. This was a horrific monster, unfit for human viewing. The outcry was so bad that it got the attention of the studio, and work began on redesigning him. This resulted in yet another delay (the movie was originally scheduled to be released in 2018), but it was worth it! And better yet, the movie actually turned out pretty good, miraculously.
Synopsis: Sonic (Ben Schwartz) is an alien who has been running all his life from people who want his power. If one world becomes unsafe, he uses a ring to teleport to another. He particularly enjoys his life in the small Montana town of Green Hills. He likes hanging out with his friend, Donut Lord (James Marsden), and Donut Lord's wife Pretzel Lady (Tika Sumpter). It's like a nice little family... except they don't know Sonic exists. Eventually, one night, he hangs out by himself thinking about how lonely he is. He has no real friends, and he's been afraid to admit it. While going for a run, he accidentally causes a power surge, catching the attention of the US government, who call upon egotistical scientist Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) to find out what caused it. Sonic sadly decides to move on to another world, but the teleportation goes awry, leaving Sonic in Green Hills and sending his rings to San Fransisco. Enlisting the help of Donut Lord, he sets out on a road trip to retrieve them, with Robotnik in hot pursuit.
So, the movie is good. Now, it's not at, like, Disney's level or anything; it's not going to win any Oscars, but it's good. It's a nice kid-friendly action comedy. It's really funny, and it's got a nice helping of heart, with Sonic's loneliness as well as Donut Lord/Tom's planned relocation to San Fransisco from Green Hills making for plenty of emotional conflict that manages to be somewhat important to the plot without feeling too forced. And it's just a heck of a lot of fun!
Naturally, Jim Carrey stole the show as Robotnik. He's back to his old over-the-top '90s self, which is fun (although the only other Jim Carrey movies I've seen are The Truman Show and Horton Hears a Who, so don't take my word for it). Robotnik's not exactly a people person. His personality can best be summarized in a couple of his lines. First: ""You know what I love about machines? They do what they're told. They follow their program! They don't need time off to get drunk and put the boat in the water!"" Second: ""You know what's hard about being the smartest person in the world?"" ""Everyone else seems stupid."" 'Nuff said?
I think one reason I liked it so much was because I found Sonic surprisingly relatable. Like Sonic, I enjoy my life pretty well. I have fun. I have friends. However, most of the friends I do have aren't really that close, so it gets a little bit lonely sometimes. I'm just like him. But you're not my therapist. You don't care. You just want to hear about how good this movie is. So, moving on...
There are some cons. Before I go into those, let me warn you: I'm better at complaining about what was wrong than explaining what was right, so don't let this turn you off to it.
Admittedly, the story wouldn't suffer if Sonic were replaced with a generic alien.
There are a couple instances of setting expectations that were not met. First: Not far from the beginning, a wonderful celebrity cameo is made: Sanic Hegehog! (For those of you who are not familiar, Sanic Hegehog is a meme, in this case a poorly-drawn version of Sonic the Hedgehog in Microsoft Paint.) Whoever had that idea definitely knew de wae. Now, this is actually a pro, but it had an unforeseen side effect. As it was early in the film, it got me all excited, as I suddenly found myself expecting a self-referential, fourth-wall-breaking-but-not-really style of comedy akin to The LEGO Batman Movie or Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Such was not the case. Don't get me wrong, it was funny and I liked it, it just wasn't the style of humor Sanic led me to expect.
Second instance of setting an expectation that wasn't met: In the end of the first trailer, a shot of Robotnik sporting his classic look, bald head, large unkempt mustache and all. This would lead some to believe that he would take on this new look in the film, probably near the beginning of the third act or so. Again, such was not the case. He does not have this new look until the very end, in what some might consider a mid-credits scene. I don't call it a mid-credits scene, though, because it's before the credits. (I don't consider this a spoiler because it's in the trailer) It makes sense to get people excited for the more accurate look, but if it isn't even part of the main story, the trailer editors need to seriously rethink their strategy.
There is one character in the opening minutes whose existence makes no sense because there is absolutely nothing in the games to my knowledge that she could have been derived from. She could have been somebody. Instead she is nobody. She could have been Tikal! That would have been cool. Oh well.
I also would have liked to see more taken from the games. Basically all that there is is Sonic, Robotnik, rings, Green Hill Zone, echidnas, and {SPOILER}. The games have enough world-building, character development, etc. to fill an MCU-sized franchise. Now, it's not at all likely that it will get to that point, but supposing it could, there would be enough to work with, so there is little excuse for having so little. I would at least have liked to see G.U.N., but oh well.
This one doesn't really count, because it's not a flaw by any means, just kind of a missed opportunity. In fact, I didn't even realize it was there until I heard someone else point it out. There is one scene in which it could seem as though Robotnik were about to create Metal Sonic. Spoiler alert: he doesn't. But I don't count this against it, as disappointing as it may be.
Also, there's a lot of painfully obvious, super forced product placement deals for some reason. Fortunately, some are played for comedy, and even the ones that aren't are fun to notice, or at least poke fun at, so I'm okay.
So, yeah, it has its flaws. But it's still funny, it has heart, and it's fun. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but even masterpieces have their issues. In short... it's a good film. Yes, I recommend it.
By the way, one more thing: Is it a problem if the movie gets you more excited for the probable sequel than it does for itself? Because it does. Please stay for the mid-credits scene. I won't spoil it, but MAN, I hope we get a sequel in a couple years!!! The final scene, mid-credits scene, and the box-office gross combined (especially considering the COVID-19 pandemic cut its run short) make it highly probable. We'll see.",Sonic the Hedgehog

I didn't think it would be good, no way this would have worked with the old design for sure, but I went to show my support because they listened to the fans. Jim Carrey nails Dr. Robotnik, Ben Schwartz is the perfect voice for Sonic and James Marsden certainly surprised me with a great performance. It has some great animation as well. The plot and climax was far better than I anticipated and the end credits scene makes me excited for a sequel. Plus it had some good comedy. I strongly recommend giving this movie a chance.",Sonic the Hedgehog

657,loveandsonic,"Cute,Heart Warming But Way Past Cool",10,15 February 2020,"You only know the Sonic movie is really good if you played over 5 Sonic games, watched 2 or more different Sonic shows, and read over 3 Sonic Comics.Seriously....you guys think is a problem with the movie...what is wrong with some of you guys?This movie deserves nothing but all stars....because the company paid attention to the Sonic fans and worked super hard to remake Sonic and than possibly rewritten it and may add extra bits.... That's the whole point....They worked hard and corrected there work by listening to criticism....The movie companies who made ""Super Mario Bros The Movie"" nor ""Dragon Ball Evolution"" didn't listen and fix the designs and story. Maybe if there are powerful fans with a voice like us Sonic fans, it would be fixed. Just imagine if you dislike or was very unhappy with a movie based on a game or story you like and they fixed it. It doesn't make anyone immature or sad if fans ask for something in the movie to be corrected because you will avoid yourself from not enjoying it and being unhappy about it. Plus it saves there money and from getting low ratings.Suprisingly this movie is higher than Detective Pikachu. Everyone who trolled Sonic for being a character and prejudged the movie has missed out plus is shameful for saying ridiculous stuff like the Super Mario Bros Movie will be better than Sonic for those few people who know who said it 😂.Some say the movie is too childish. Hello? This is a 1991 video game character this also appeals to the 30 year olds and 40 years olds who were young adults/teens playing the game. My mother played this since she was 19 and than she passed it down to me and I enjoyed the classic game on the Sega Genesis. And well if is too young, corny, and not too serious...well jeez look at sega character Rouge The Bat. Than they have a game called Shadow The Hedgehog which is edgy but they made the game and made them say mild words like hell,damn, and dammit. At least they are trying to appeal maturely...but Sonic is 31 years old (2020).I can tell the movie has an influence or ideas from Sonic CD, Sonic The Hedgehog The Series and Sonic X. They really paid attention to the Sonic fans. They also referenced and used Sanic, the meme in there movie! And jeez is a problem when they use humor? At least they acknowledge the funny and interesting stuff that make us proud and excited. Can Sonic not be funny and say cool stuff like Deadpool? Or be corny?Jim Carrey is perfect for the character Eggman and I like it when he becomes more insane and evil when more bad things happen to him and the rivalry rises between him and Sonic.Eggman is a funny character sometimes so I don't see why Jim Carey will not fit his role.Even though I wish it would be Jaleel White or Jason Griffith voice acting...Ben did a great job. The writer and the voice actor made sure Sonic sounds like Sonic and talk like him.In this film is like another universe or story of Sonic...but I highly respect there work and twist of a few different things. Is better than Sonic Boom😂. They made Sonic very cute, funny, and innocent in the beginning. But when the story continues... he learns how to be a stronger character.Anyways who cares about interracial relationships being in the movie or not? Is in there but is not entirely important....people immaturely wants to be upset because Officer Thomas is married to a Chocolate woman. This is not worse than finding the movie bad because of the humor.....and how Paramount made the character.Like the Youtuber ""Lost Chaos"" says...When will you guys give the video game character a break and stop being prejudice?....There are other games worse than Sonic and other characters worse than Sonic like Big.Like Chill.Overall the Film again isWay Past Cool. I can't wait to order the movie digitally.",Sonic the Hedgehog

And it was a little slow at the beginning.

If you love sonic and you've played the games like me, you will enjoy this film. The actors are pretty low key, but sonic is pretty much the main hype of the film, so no need to worry about all that. Jim Carry as Doctor Robotnic/Eggman was an excellent choice, his humor made this movie part comedy in my opinion and he will entertain you throughout the film if you love Jim Carry.

671,shutupandcolour,Jim Carey made me rewatch this,8,28 August 2021,"First, this movie seems to have a sad magic about it, because it's the last thing we saw in theaters before Covid hit. I wasn't happy about being dragged to a kids movie (I'm a jerk, I know) and I probably wouldn't have complained as much if I would have known the world was going to flip in a few weeks. I did laugh at several of Jim Carey's scenes, which made me think I should rewatch this without such a jaded view. I'm really impressed with how the company listened to everyone and changed Sonic's design into something more befitting and less grating, and I loved the character dynamics of everyone involved. I still think Jim Carey makes this movie, and I'm not a particular Jim Carey fan (again, I'm a horrible person), but he had me cracking up again and I'm looking forward to the sequel. There was the perfect balance of comedy, action, and kind of ""drama"" in it that made it worth watching again. I actually went and bought this on Blu Ray recently because I wanted it in my collection and, as stupid as it may sound, as kind of a reminder how quickly things can change and to enjoy the the time you have with your loved ones.

Yes, it could have pulled more from Sonics source material, if you go into it expecting nothing, this movie was really cute.We really enjoyed it and actually look forward to a sequel if they make one.

683,toyotapepsi,I'm glad I watched it.,9,26 February 2020,"I have been interested but unsure about this movie since the first trailer. I was happy to see Sonic's redesign. Sonic 2 came with the Sega Genesis my parents bought me when we moved into a new home because they worried I would have a difficult time making friends.
Watching this movie was like meeting a new but familiar friend.
Ben Schwartz was a perfect fit for the voice of Sonic. He brought all the attitude and didn't come off like a jerk. He had so many great lines like, ""What year is it? Is The Rock President?"" which had me smiling the whole time.
At first I was not sure Jim Carey was not the best fit for Doctor Robotnik with all his hair and small moustche, but now that I've seen his performance, I am wondering if anybody could have done it better.
It's been 3 days since I have seen this movie and the strong theme of friendship has stuck with me in a significant way. I am very grateful for this movie.
My wife liked it too.",Sonic the Hedgehog
684,belindatagoe,This movie should've sucked! It should've failed! What the heck happened?!,8,8 April 2020,"Synopsis: A super-fast alien hedgehog baby escapes a group of dangerous captors (and, sadly, leaves his beloved home world and guardian owl behind). He then ends up on Earth and remains incognito for 10 years. When he loses control of his powers one night, this hedgehog's comfy, but lonely life of isolation comes to an abrupt end. Now, after teaming up with a small-town sheriff who's tired of his boring and mundane job, he must outrun a crazed mad scientist who's been hired by the US government to hunt him down and dismember him.Review: Yes, the subject is meant to be entirely ironic. Usually, we're excited about a movie. We expect it to be great, only to be let down. But, this movie is unique. It's the other way around because, unlike what I expected it to be, this movie is surprisingly fun to watch! I've now watched it twice in the past 2 days. It's not a ground-breaking or thought-provoking movie. It's a Sonic movie. Its goal is to be a fun, entertaining movie starring Sonic the Hedgehog, and it excels at that.What makes this movie work so well is the complete and utter absurdity of it. This movie doesn't take itself seriously, for the most part. Jim Carrey does what Jim Carrey does best: having a crazy sense of humor while being legitimately disturbing and menacing as Dr. Robotnik. His zany, manic personality and references to his troubled childhood ]make him a fun villain, especially when he messes around with his doormat, Agent Stone. I enjoyed the scene where he's testing out one of Sonic's quills to give his machines special electromagnetic energy. The music in that scene was great. His obsession with technology only serve to illustrate how truly insane and misanthropic Dr. Robotnik is. I used to dread Jim Carrey being in this movie. Not anymore!What's also fun is Tom (the sheriff guy). His own goals, namely to actually save lives rather than help ducks cross the street, are amusing and relatable because a lot of people have boring jobs. One might complain that Tom is too generic of a protagonist. But, I think that actually helped make the movie funnier. The other main characters, namely Sonic and Dr. Robotnik, are shown to be very be very over-the-top ridiculous. But, Tom is perfectly normal and average. He gets dragged into these insane situations because of his two oddball co-stars. He stands out because he's so average.Plus, Tom is like a stand-in for the audience. He expects one thing to happen, that is, to become a street cop in San Francisco. Instead, he ends up getting chased by a technocratic egomaniac scientist, befriends a newly-discovered species of giant hedgehog from another planet, and gets pushed off the top of a skyscraper in slow motion. It makes you think, ""Life is so wonderfully strange and imperfect"". This movie embraces the absurdity of the video game that it's based on.The best part of the movie, however, is Sonic himself. I think we all remember when producer Jeff Fowler attempted to make Sonic ultra-realistic. We all remember when Sonic looked like some creepy alien rat monster with human teeth and all the amusing memes that popped up from that.Well, poof! That version's gone. Now, we're treated to a cartoonish Sonic, complete with wide, expressive eyes, round cheeks, and a round nose. It helps make Sonic look like a stuffed doll. He looks cute and cuddly, and therefore, sympathetic.Most of this movie's success hinges on the audience's ability to sympathize with Sonic. He's a nutty, hyperactive teenager, and he acts like a child. He's pretty annoying (in a charming way, like a little boy). But, that's the end result of 10 years of loneliness and social isolation. His plight is relatable because, well, who wouldn't go insane being isolated like that? Sonic isn't asking for billions of dollars or a palace or whatever. He just wants to be loved. He just wants some stability in his life. When he meets Tom, the sheriff, Sonic starts out as a creepy, kind of stalker-ish character. He calls Tom ""Donut Lord"" and his wife ""Pretzel Lady"". It's amusing, but it illustrates how fascinating humans are to Sonic and how much he wants to socialize with them. I liked that a lot.The movie mostly involves Sonic going on a long road trip with Tom. Some of the best parts include Sonic gaining more confidence in his powers as he stops Dr. Robotnik's machines, a crazy bar fight, and then a final fight scene with Sonic vs Dr. Robotnik. (Oh yeah, there's a hotel scene where Sonic lets off a disgusting fart)Although there aren't tons of obscure references, the references they did include were great for a Sonic fan. For example, early on in the movie, we see that there are loop-de-loops on Sonic's home planet. There's a dangerous group of echidnas who look very similar to Knuckles who chase Sonic and his guardian, Longclaw. ""Crazy Carl"", the first person to see Sonic in the flesh, has a drawing of Sonic that looks uncannily like a popular Sonic meme (Sanic). Sonic seems to have the ""Time Stop"" ability that he had from Sonic Adventure 2, in which he stops time temporarily (that comes in handy during a bar fight, obviously). That's great stuff.Having said that, I have a few issues with this movie. The product placement was pretty obvious, but that's not the issue. I actually wish this movie had been just 30 minutes longer. This movie is enjoyable enough that I was thinking, ""Gee, I wish this movie was a little longer"".In addition, there are few lapses in logic with this movie. I know I praised this movie for its absurdity, but one thing that surprised me was how Tom and Sonic were able to get a hotel room without the hotelier calling the police on them. Tom is a wanted fugitive and a supposed terrorist, thanks to punching out Dr. Robotnik in one scene. Sonic is seen as this mysterious, potentially dangerous alien life-form that the government wants to capture and kill. How come the hotelier didn't call the cops? I guess Tom must've paid them handsomely.The biggest pet peeve I have, however, is the fact that this movie wasn't animated. This movie is absurd and goofy enough that animation would've done wonders for it. Real-life actors just can't replicate the same whimsy that can come from animation. It's a road trip movie about cutesy alien hedgehog, his human friend, and a crazy mad scientist. That alone sounds like a cartoon that'd pop up on Cartoon Network. I would've loved to see how Pixar or Disney Animation Studios (who've actually animated Sonic before) would've done this movie.Overall, this movie is a delight. I'm happy I gave it a chance and saw it. There's a reason this movie did so well at the box office. It was a video game movie that was not only good for a video game movie, but also good for a movie in general. Of course, it also helps that Sonic has lots and lots of fans.Now, how about that sequel featuring Metal Sonic? And, maybe another sequel featuring Shadow the Hedgehog as the main villain? A Sonic movie based on Sonic Adventure 2 would be a real treat. I'm ready for it, Paramount. Do your thing.",Sonic the Hedgehog

699,haripushkas,I don't know what you've been doing if you haven't seen this movie yet!!!,10,18 February 2020,"Sonic the Hedgehog isn't perfect. Then again, it isn't trying to be. Jim Carrey is back to his 90's self and a delight throughout the whole movie. Also, Ben Schwartz was a delight as Sonic the Hedgehog and James Marsden and Tika Sumpter were perfect in their roles. However, like I said, this movie is not perfect and was filmed in a way to acknowledge that it isn't. It is simply a good, family-friendly movie that you can take your kids to see and have a blast with them with. The critics need to stop treating every movie like it's a contender for the Oscars. They did the exact same thing with Joker, need I remind you, and the critics were the ones that lost because the film won 2 Oscars so the critics can suck it. The same with Sonic, which was predicted to only make about $30-40 million at the domestic box office but surpassed those expectations by wheeling in $57 million over the three-day weekend and those numbers going up to $70 million, leading it to unseat Detective Pikachu as the highest grossing video game film of all time. It also crushed Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey, which struggled at the box office after Ewan McGregor's woke comments. This movie does not have any agendas or identity politics in it. It's just a family-friendly kid's movie that caters to its audience. I don't know what the Birds of Prey fans were thinking in trying to tank this movie BEFORE IT EVEN CAME OUT!!!! This movie is revolutionary and, given the fact that it topped the box office, goes to show that good things will come to directors who listen to their fans and take their opinions into account because they know that it is the consumer who is going to be buying the tickets and the customer is ALWAYS RIGHT!!! Companies like LucasFilm and Marvel Studios should take notes and follow the example set by Jeff Fowler in actually LISTENING TO CRITICISM!!!! If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend this to you. It is worth the watch.",Sonic the Hedgehog
700,gamegargle,Rating an 8 cause they listened to fans,8,12 April 2020,"Saw the film and it was a lot of fun. The movie adaption for Sonic on the big screen, was fun for both kids and adults. It was a little generic, but the polish and attention to detail for Sonic fans was there. Definitely worth watching once, even if it's what you're expecting. Originally was going to rate a 7, but I remembered that the studio listened to fans and changed Sonic's design, for that I commend them!",Sonic the Hedgehog

702,lerrom,Not a total train wreck after all.,8,19 February 2020,"I really expected this movie to completely blow. Boy, was I wrong.The comedy is actually decent for the most part. The design is more than phenomenal now instead of the thing we got the first time (ugh).And the actors were all great. Jim Carrey especially. He really captures that craziness of Dr. Robotnik, similar to the games. And the fight scenes, especially the bar fight and the final battle, were all-around amazing.And to top it off, all the easter eggs (the name of the town, the signs, the rings, etc.) are all very well placed throughout the movie.'Can't wait for the sequel, which is hinted at after the credits where who shall appear, but Miles ""Tails"" Prower himself, just like Sonic 2.",Sonic the Hedgehog

The special effects were great the acting was pretty solid I was expecting there to be a lot of fan service but surprisingly the movie kept that to a minimum and I appreciated that.The worst scene in the movie is by far the flossing scene but other than that it was great the jokes were pretty good (except for one fart joke) but i love this movie!.

An extremely fun movie. What can I say, I enjoyed it far more than Detective Pikachu..
I think I'd give it a 7/10, but to hell with it, they can have an extra star for listening to feedback and fixing Sonic.",Sonic the Hedgehog
713,jchealey-1,Not the Sonic movie I wanted but definitely one I enjoyed,6,17 February 2020,"Whenever I watch a film, I often think of how I would've made the film. In this case, I probably would have made Sonic the Hedgehog to be closer to the source material; more specifically, the first Sonic game on the Sega Genesis. I'm glad the film didn't go that route, because I am sure that would have been a boring film.This film, instead, is a film with personality that leans heavily on Sonic's voice actor Ben Schwartz and a lot of visual gags, mostly centered around Sonic's trademark speed. A lot of these gags are borrowed from previous films with speedsters in them, but Sonic gives them a more playful vibe to it. What can I say? It works.A film's story is often only as good as the villain is, and Jim Carrey's Dr. Robotnik is quite the villain. He's not sympathetic. He's evil for the sake of evil and the film leans heavily on that. It's surprising then that Carrey's portrayal makes Robotnik the most animated character in a film with a computer-generated blue hedgehog.The rest of the cast are more grounded characters, but they find themselves roped into Sonic's adventure anyway, causing them to bond with Sonic and in effect, tether Sonic to a more tenable reality that the one he had been living.The story isn't mind-blowing by any sense. It really is just one short story that boils down to essentially a road trip. Don't expect a game changer. This won't innovate the cinematic media like its original did with video games.It is enjoyable while it lasts but probably won't remembered long after. It is a step in the right direction for video game adaptations, what with this and Detective Pikachu. I just think we're still a few steps away from video game adaptations being taken as seriously as any other cinematic adaptation.",Sonic the Hedgehog
714,rodriguez-jonathan11,"Honestly, just a really fun time.",9,14 February 2020,I had higher hopes than I probably should have for this. But it delivers. It's a fun movie everyone can enjoy.

716,highdefinitionsound,Definitely better than Detective Pikachu 😍,10,13 February 2020,"Well done Jeff Fowler. This movie is a roller coaster of emotions, adventures, laughs, drama and nostalgia. Sega did well on this one and can't wait for the sequel.As for the dark side of reviewers, Sonic started in 1991 and it did not have any lure or story. Just a blue hedgehog chasing Eggman to free the poor animals and to collect all power emeralds. The movie did not take Naoto Ohshima's original design for Sonic (1991 - 1997) and took Yuji Uekawa (1998 - Present) instead. I loved that they changed the original movie design (2018) because it was really horrible and took Yuji's instead.",Sonic the Hedgehog
717,sleewok,Cheesy,4,24 February 2021,"Sonic makes a bucket list and acts like a child the entire movie. The jokes were not great, and it was hard to watch because Sonic's entire personality was immature. I was hoping for something more serious.",Sonic the Hedgehog
718,trustrup-399-980069,Suprisingly decent,8,22 May 2020,"So is this a cash grab exploiting our childhoods? Yeah, it is, but they actually made a decent game to movie.This is an action family movie, which theme is friendship, is it really about Sonic, and more about the Sheriff? Maybe, I will say when it was done, I had some heartfelt moments, nostalgia, fun, and all in all it was just well done.Zingers, stupid jokes, and feel goodness. I was entertained.So 8 stars for listening to people when they said the first design was horrendous, making an actual decent game movie, and treating my childhood with respect.Please continue this trend.",Sonic the Hedgehog

It was funny, wholesome and led me back to all those Sonic games on SEGA's 16 bit entertainment system.

721,Aggiemba95,Carrey? Really?,6,17 February 2020,"I would have given this movie a higher rating, except, I felt like we got Ace ventura thrown at us after he should have retired. Typical Carrey, his acting is limited to the same character he seems to always put on the screen. If you eliminate his scenes from the movie it could have been better.The animation of Sonic is spot on, and the rest of the cast does a great job.If you are a Pet Detective Fan you will love Carrey in this movie. If you aren't, the movie is still a fun ride, sprinkled with some very painful moments from Carrey. It is worth the price of admission.",Sonic the Hedgehog

725,sysop-22199,Failing to deliver,2,22 February 2020,"I enjoyed the video game. The cartoons were good to, from what I can remember. However this attempt at brining Sonic to the big screen has failed, very well. The back story was short and left you wondering. The relationship between characters was rushed and felt lacking. It was as if the scripts were written by a 12 year old. Jim Carry was great and is probably the only reason this movie has held together. I've heard it said it has done better than Detective Pika Chu, but I fail to see how that is possible. Sonic does not deliver any of the mystery, excitement, nor emotional draw that Detective Pika Chu had.Wait for this to come out to your favorite streaming site. Then watch it from a friends account. Do not waist any money on this movie if you can help it.",Sonic the Hedgehog

730,jennifercasco,I'm giving it an extra star because they redesigned sonic,8,16 February 2020,"Honestly this was a movie I was never really planning to see. I thought it was another cash grab at our nostalgia. But when the initial trailer came out with the original sonic, I partook in the hilarious and frightening memes and joined in on the criticism. When I found out that they were redesigning Sonic due to the backlash - I was shocked. I never thought a studio would listen to our voice, and oh was our voice heard.So after I saw the second trailer I thought to myself, well, I guess I gotta go see it now. ""Put your money where your mouth is."" If the studio took the time to do this for us then I will gladly pay my money to see this.And I'm glad I did. It's a fun movie. It's not perfect by any means, but it's an enjoyable film for the family. I love the new Sonic, I love the cast, Jim Carrey is spectacular as always. It was a fun movie from start to finish. And it was really entertaining. I love the voice character for Sonic too, I think he fit perfectly. I would've given it a 7/10 but like I mentioned before, an extra star for caring about the fans and the audience.",Sonic the Hedgehog
731,pw-60824,Way past cool!,8,16 February 2020,"Sonic the Hedgehog on paper sounds like a silly idea for a live-action film, but somehow Paramount has managed to make an amazing movie based on the games, Ben Schwartz really nails the cocky persona associated with the Sonic character and manages to bring a huge level of emotion. Jim Carrey as Robotnik is what you would expect; The Mask, Ace Ventura and The Riddler mashed together. But the thing that won me over was Junkie XL's orchestral/16 bit synth music over the Paramount logo. Go see it in Cinemas it's Way Past Cool!",Sonic the Hedgehog

(already happy with it before the Redesign even!)
Still, when the Redesign was announced, I was SURE I was goin' to love it, still, you never truly know!But havin' seen it...
yes.
This is the Sonic Movie I've been waiting for 20 years!
IT'S ALL I EVER WANTED AND A LIL' MORE!!My favorite character (Eggman/Robotnik) was portraited PERFECTLY by the always Amazin' Jim Carrey,
Sonic? was lovable as ever! he had the Ego that I thought he would lack, just a Lil' subdued for his earlier years!
The extra characters made me care 'bout 'em! and this is a big thing a movie can do!
The Badniks even just bein' robots, were Masterfully designed and used throughout the movie!The Story is not a new one by far, but it was told in a unique perspective and had a LOT of Emotion and Soul poured into it!
Some predictability is not bad now and then, and the movie used it to its advantage!for me... 10/10, my favorite Game Movie EVER Made (thus far)
Can't wait to see it again, always bringin' in someone else to experience it with me!I really hope this does not get a Sequel, but becomes a Franchise!

Jim Carrey blew it out of the park. All the supporting cast was amazing as well, all the characters were interesting and likeable.",Sonic the Hedgehog
744,HumanBean555,Okay,6,22 March 2020,"It is rare to see a video game movie not do terrible at the theaters. This honestly surprises me. This movie has a lot of nice references to the franchise, and Sanic made a brief cameo! Despite all this, there are a few problems that set it back from being completely enjoyable. First off, Jim Carrey is far to over the top playing the role of Doctor Robotnik (or Eggman as he is called nowadays) and he honestly annoys me at times. There also seems to be a lot of advertising for Olive Garden, specifically their endless pasta, which I honestly thought would become a meme. There is also the fact that none of the other characters in the Sonic franchise besides Sonic himself.
But overall, it is a decent movie, it is not great or anything, but it is not bad. Recommended to Sonic fans and for people who want to watch a passable family movie.",Sonic the Hedgehog
745,jnazander,Jim Carrey was the only good part,3,12 May 2020,"I watched it just for the Robotnik scenes, and skipped most of the rest. I mean, the movie is probably aimed at children, but as an adult, I don't get amused by scenes of a CGI cartoon awkwardly interacting with real people. And why is Sonic in a human world anyway? Shouldn't he be in Mobius running through upside-down loops? And the whole formula of ""alien/monster appearing in human world and befriending a single human while others are out to get him"" is tired and clichéd as hell. Do they not have any new ideas!?",Sonic the Hedgehog
746,lunncaleb,Not much of a plot,5,20 February 2020,"""Sonic the Hedgehog"" was one of the few games I remember from early childhood. The fast paced action in areas that I now know all too well was very exciting for a younger kid like myself and the idea that one of my favorite video game icons was coming to the big screen really excited me. However, I felt that the movie was somewhat of a disappointment. The movies main flaw, as I saw it, was a lack of character. Despite being titled ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" it felt as though any other CGI character could have replaced Sonic and it still would have made sense as a stand alone movie. Along with the lack of character, the plot progression was also off for me. Granted the movie was only an hour and 40 minutes, the way that the story progression came out made it feel much less shorter than it actually was. Aside from those flaws I noticed, I enjoyed the movie. While the characters felt bland, I felt kind f connected to them simply because their interaction was enjoyable to watch. And as most of the other reviews likely say, I have to give credit to Jim Carrey for his outstanding role as Dr. Robotnik, as it was one of the several enjoyable parts of the film. Don't even get me started on all of the references, there were several in the movie and I enjoyed all of them, specifically the scene where Sonic drops his rings after getting hit. In short, the movie , in general, was pretty OK at best, but good character interaction and good acting caused it to overcome the several flaws that were present.",Sonic the Hedgehog

750,oliviajmakar,"Sonic farts, fortnite dances, becomes unlikable....",6,15 February 2020,"2 fortnite dances, 3 fart jokes, and a failed character development. That is the reason I'm rating this movie 6/10. I think this movie is just ok. This movie can't decide if it wants to be serious or comedic. It tried being both, and failed. I understand Sonic is a children's game and the movie is a ""family"" movie, but I feel the people behind this movie failed to realize it's true demographic...the now adults that grew up with Sonic. Let's be honest, not many kids today play sonic and the theater was about 70% filled with adults, how did they approach the appeal to children? They add cheap child humor found in most children targeted movies. The movie is ABSOLUTELY GREAT in the beginning. The story development, animation, and the cinematography is just right. A small detail they added is the ""sanic"" drawing and it just tells me they understand the depths of the sonic fandom. I love that they use it, and lose it, not dragging on about it making it seem like they're proving a point. In the beginning I felt a emotional connection to sonic with him getting upset at the baseball field. You feel sorry for him, you build this emotional connection with him. After the bar scene, the story telling and acting plummet. Sonic does a complete 180. Fortnite dancing, making cheesey jokes, farting, etc. Last thing I want to see is sonic ripping. You quickly loose liking to Sonic's character in just the way he acts. I hate movies that resort to using cheap, played out, tactics to keep a child interested. It RUINS the moment for everyone else. You can make a family movie everyone can enjoy without making a joke there, fart joke there. Tom's acting also diminishes. Also after the bar scene, his acting looks and sounds as if he's talking to an empty space instead of a hedgehog. For some reason Tom's wife doesnt have much of a freak out reaction to Tom when she sees him with this ""blue alien hedge hog"" also the fact her husband is all over the news. Her acting is so strange and unrealistic. Jim Carrey had the best acting in this movie hands down. He never broke character, he stuck with his character and Dr. Robotniks passions. You truely felt like he was a villan. He dances in the movie, but never resorts to fortnite dancing. You don't need to fortnite dance to prove you are a likeable character to children. The end scene increased in quality, sonic was actually sonic. You again felt that struggle and emotion for sonic. You see Dr. Robotniks descent into madness. It's visually beautiful. I am glad this production company took the time to completely re-animate Sonic's character, I just wish they took that time to also make a better story in the big middle of this movie. I grew up with video games, I never personally had a big connection with sonic, but I've played the games. I wish this movie took place more in the sonic universe, it doesn't. In the beginning when sonic is little your shown different places on the island and it looks epic, however it only runs for maybe 5 minutes, then the rest of the movie is live action. I wish I saw more of Sonic's universe. Anyways, thats my honest review. If you see this movie in theaters there is an end credit scene that is worth seeing.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Simply put, Sonic the Hedgehog is a good time! The banter between the characters feels organic, engaging, and honestly funny most of the time! My wife and I have always loved Jim Carrey's performance in the movies he stars in, and it was wonderful to see him return after a few silent years. Simple plot with cool shootouts to the fans, perhaps not as much as others could've hoped for. It's got good heart too, and nothing felt super cringy. It was nice to see a film that wasn't trying too hard to push any agendas or heavy morals, just a good-old fashion buddy trip film, and I really needed that.

757,ccbrookseight,Loved the final product!,10,30 April 2020,"I was sceptical when I saw the first trailer, but after they redesigned Sonic, the final product was noteworthy! My husband and I enjoyed this film as much as our kids! Jim Carey was the perfect fit for Doctor Eggman and the voice of Sonic was spot on! My boys (5yrs and 19yrs) were in tears with laughters and we all can't wait for a sequal with Tails!!",Sonic the Hedgehog
758,yikdbhqz,Watched over and over,7,5 April 2021,My 3 year old son loves this movie. We have watched in a hundred times already. Personally the movie is just whatever for my taste but I still don't hate it after viewing it all these times. I will say though that I LOVED JIM CARREY in this movie! I almost didn't recognize him. I'm not usually a fan of his but this role was great!,Sonic the Hedgehog

760,volvom,"Not bad, actually.",8,13 September 2020,"I was never in to Sonic fandom, but I was curious to see this more just because jim Carrey was in this one and I actually got surprised positively, that this movie was actually good!
Also good job animators, you really listened fans and changed Sonic's horrible appearance to be more like it should be.
Jim Carrey was amazing choise to be as Dr. Robotnik.Worth to watch!",Sonic the Hedgehog
761,KevinYamagata,This is an unexpected good film!,7,25 September 2020,"I enjoyed this film from the beginning to the end and i didn't expect that.
I think they made a great work.
Sonic's solitude has hurt me and i felt bad for him. I think that aspect was explained very well.Also Jim Carrey did a magnificent job in the shoes of Dr. Eggman.
I want more films like this one.

766,khwq,Killer throwback to the 90s,8,22 February 2020,"I'm a 34 year old mom and I was laughing out loud pretty much the whole film. The awesome weird soundtrack completely makes the movie. Jim Carrey's character is perfect; my favorite scene is his hilarious and twisted Evil dance. His Lebanese assistant (who makes amazing lates) is hilarious, too. Sonic's character is really well done. All main characters are relatable and develop as the movie progresses. Hilarious side characters as well. Not your classic plot, in the sense that it didn't have they typical ""I learned my lesson and I'm sorry"" scene (thank goodness). Also it was great to see a strong black female character. Plus the main couple is married, instead of the typical two white single people that fall in love and kiss in the end. One of the best and most enjoyable movies (of any genre) I've seen in a really long time, definitely not just for kids. I'd say it's up there near the Lego Film and Get Out, for me, just in terms of how much I enjoyed it and in the sense that it felt like a unique experience and like the writers/directors were really thinking out of the box and how I wouldn't get bored even if I watched it a dozen times.",Sonic the Hedgehog
767,sam-e-wilkinson,It's good,9,8 March 2020,"This is a better than average kids movie. Jim Carrey steals the show and it's worth a watch just for his performance. For a movie about a video game it's probably top tier in my opinion, they don't shove themes or actions from the game down your filthy throat. Things like Sonic losing his rings when he gets hurt or him spinning to go faster surprisingly happen organically. Wonderful. I gauge kids movies on if I could tolerate them after the 20th viewing, and I rate this one ""I could"".",Sonic the Hedgehog

I would not recommend it.",Sonic the Hedgehog

774,doug-ballantyne,I was wrong!,8,19 February 2020,"When I heard about a film being made based on the Sonic games, I KNEW it would be another poor poor video game-to-film cash in, and would be terrible. When the first trailer was released, I felt very smug, and certain I was right. After the redesign of Sonic, I felt less smug, and more curious, so I took myself to see it. It turns out that this is a FUN film, with a couple of genuinely FUNNY moments....(running with the tortoise
& waiting for the lift with Sonic in a bag). Jim Carrey was back to his crazy best too, big plus for me.
All in all, pleasantly surprised, and I'll definitely watch the sequel.",Sonic the Hedgehog
775,czardesign,Not Sonic,1,17 February 2020,"I don't know what the people who reviewed Sonic the Hedgehog POSITIVELY were on, but I wish I was provided with an overdose of it before sitting down. And the optional horseblinders and earplugs that they were given. This isn't a movie. It's a string of pop culture references strung together in a trenchcoat with the IP name of Sonic slapped on top. Don't be fooled by the name; It's not a Sonic movie. It's a movie about a middle aged white cop and his black girlfriend? Fiance? Wife? Who stumble onto a mysterious alien and for (no good reason that any normal human being would take) put themselves in immediate danger to try and keep him out of the hands of scawy ""government officials"" who want to do ... scary stuff.. to him. Probably. Characters don't talk to each other, writing inconsistencies abound, the stilted acting and weird casting choices for what's ostensibly supposed to be a kids' movie rob it of any relatability it might've had. It doesn't even manage to cash in on nostalgia, because it completely ignores the IP it's built on. I'm a casual Sonic fan, and this movie reads to me like it was made by people who were ashamed they were even touching the series with a yardstick. I had almost no expectations and still managed to be disappointed. Don't waste your money or your time by seeing this; you and your children will be bored to tears. Or maybe you'll laugh from embarrassment.",Sonic the Hedgehog

778,pallavnishchaya,Quite a joyride. 2 extra stars.,10,13 June 2020,"This is one of those movies where you watch the movie to simply have a good time and not to nitpick things, unless its your job. LOL.All the actors were great. The chemistry b/w both the lead characters was superb and convincing. The end credit scenes were surprisingly good. Can't wait to see more of 'those'. Graphics were also neat.1 extra star because they heard the fans and pleasantly redesigned Sonic which definitely worked. Full marks for the effort, intent, time and money invested to get things right.Another extra star cuz the collective rating should be somewhere around 7. This is too low imho.Waiting impatiently for the sequel. If end credits are a hint then it will hopefully be even more fun and bigger than this.I really hope they create a Sonic universe, bringing in all the characters over time.Tl;dr - Highly recommended if you are looking for a movie to have good times with your family. If you have kids around you, make sure they watch it. They'll love it. :)",Sonic the Hedgehog

781,ormmmk,Fun and friendly film here!,6,29 February 2020,"Just an innocent, friendly and well made film adaptation of old-school video game. Don't expect too much from CG or the complicated plot, but do expect to just relax and enjoy the cute story about friendship and an adventure, things like that.

785,lwalsh-575-72746,Better than I had anticipated,8,2 May 2021,When I saw that this was going to be taking sonic the hedgehog into the real world to go on a buddy movie road trip formula I was expecting not to like it. While it is guilty of following this trope it somehow managed to succeed in doing it well. Some of the jokes are laugh out loud funny. I've watched some of the Japanese produced sonic the hedgehog cartoon shows and expected sonic to be portrayed as this very serious character as he had been in those but his lightheaded naive nature in this version is endearing. Jim Carrey really carries the film as the perfect origin of Sonic's nemesis. I can't wait for the sequel.,Sonic the Hedgehog

The story was nice. Jim Carrey was good as Dr. Robotnik and his character got better throughout the movie. Some of the jokes were noticed but weren't all that funny, but it's a kid movie so. One scene was complicated and stretched out for time (Sonic had to get in top of this building and he simply could have run up the building but of course, they didn't have he do that). But it was a nice, heartwarming movie. Sonic was awesome throughout! The Sonic voice actor was great! The new design made me love the movie even more.",Sonic the Hedgehog

I was a little skeptical going in to the movie as I didn't hold it to high hopes. Boy was I wrong! The movie isn't aground breaking cinema or anything but definitely worth the movie ticket. Surprising it was actually pretty good. Jim Carrry as Dr. Robotnic was a great take on the Sonic villain we all remember from childhood. And best of all, my son loved it!",Sonic the Hedgehog

I would say this isn't too bad an attempt at a game>movie
there are much worst out there.
Treat it as light entertainment and you wouldn't be disappointed! Catch it on a lazy night. Jim Carrey does what he does best, and the re-edited Sonic is near perfect. The 'Cameo' at the end seals the deal for me, for a casual gamer who once played many Sonic games as a kid, I couldn't ask for more.You got to understand this has to suit little Children as well. Its too bad, (and I really do feel sorry for them), that they probably wouldn't and would never know the significant of SEGA nor Sonic at its prime back in the 90s.All Good fun!

790,marshmanben,Way more fun and heartfelt than I was expecting with a fantastic message for kids,8,30 June 2020,"Being a cynical 24 year old, this movie weirdly brought out the fun, carefree kid in me.
I sat back and just enjoyed a character I haven't been with in so many years
This sonic doesn't try to be anything different and I really love that
I'm not here for some deep storytelling but it doesn't treat the audience like an idiot
It's a weirdly heartfelt story about friendship and finding where you belong, a really fantastic message for kids in a year that's brought a lot of hardship
I really think alot of the internet memes have made people forget sonic is for kids
I'm really excited to see what the future holds for this version of sonic
Also
It's so fun to see Jim Carrey just being himself again
He really enjoys his time in this movie and it really shows",Sonic the Hedgehog
791,Ty1986,Fun movie.,8,26 September 2021,"Fun movie. Lots of funny pop culture and social references. Some one is rate bombing this movie because of the Azerbaijanistan joke early on in the movie.

792,graphicsgod2,Cute video game movie based on a cliche story..,7,25 February 2020,"I heard all the positive reviews about this film, so I had to go see it! And I was pleasantly surprised! This movie gets you in the feels from the beginning and is a non-stop romp to the end. Maybe it was the three rum & cokes, but I actually shed a tear at the end of this film. I also want to thank the director for going back and fixing the CGI of this film!! I don't think I would have cared as much for the original Sanic, then I do for this Sonic. Good job!!It's your typical alien gets stuck on earth, government wants him for ""study,"" and he needs to get to his home planet! But in this case, he just wants to go anywhere away from danger. This movie is about 90min., but it felt like it was only 30min!!Jim Carey is ham'ing it up as usual, but I was expecting him to be more crazy in this. He's more like the Jim Carey from Pet Detective (the first one).Long story short, it was a cute buddy comedy that doesn't takes itself serious (and neither should you), that goes by so fast it will leave you wanting more! I'll definitely get it on blueray. Easy 7 out of 10!",Sonic the Hedgehog
793,andersonnjr,Go see this movie,8,14 February 2020,"My only complaint about the movie was that, at times it had some less than spectacular CGI
But it never took away from the pure enjoyment of this film.
Not only is it a great kids film, it has a bunch of jokes that will have the old people in the room laughing as well.
The creators of this movie Listened to the fans criticism of the trailers and instead of attacking them they used it to improve it for the better, and for that alone you should support this movie so Hollywood can see the importance of criticism and how it can be used to improve a product.
Support this film, you will not be disappointed",Sonic the Hedgehog
794,fucciflakes,Not a steaming pile of garbage.,6,15 February 2020,"Defiantly not a taint in the video game gene, it's family friendly, fasted paced action and has a few laughs to it.
Pro's Jim Carrey does in fact play a good Dr. Eggman, Ben Schwartz is a great voice actor for Sonic! Prefer him over Rodger Craig Smith if I'm going to be honest here (Not that Rodger is a bad voice actor but he doesn't make a great Sonic) Sonic's movie design (besides the blue arms) are very cute and lovable, his character personality is very charming and not cringey with no cringe inducing one liners like Sonic Boom had.P.S Stick around till the end credits of the most of the movie! Best part in my opinion! 🦊Cons. The owl from the start of the movie. Just stands out from all the rest of the anthropomorphics from Sonic's world, the whole establishment of friendship of Tom and Sonic and the plot from getting to California seems VERY rushed along and feels like a road trip rather than a Sonic Movie. Sonic doesn't have a friend from his world, nobody! Would think it would be quite the opposite instead of everyone trying to go after his power and why IS everyone after Sonic's power in the movie? (Including from what it looks to be the Echidna tribe) Do they just take what they want? Was that established in SA that I'm missing here? Rings used as universe transportation devices? Makes a little sense since they transported Sonic to special stages in Sonic 1, CD, 3 and Mania but are they capable of continuity travel? Kinda urks me a little. There's a little gas humor in the movie, but thankful it only happens once, but still shouldn't have happened at all. The end song ""Speed me up"" By Wiz Khalifa Ty Dolla $ign, Lil Yachty & Sueco the Child was a massive mistake! Should have gotten someone more talented for a featured end song.Overall the experience was enjoyable (nothing great) but was fun to watch and doesn't make you want to gouge your eyes out!I'll give it a solid B- or a 6.9 out of 10.",Sonic the Hedgehog
795,Bryce_Carmony,Low Speed and Stakes,5,23 February 2020,Sonic the Hedgehog was a mixed bag. Tactically the film hit a lot if the right notes the game references were for the most part pretty subtle and actually enjoyable but on structural elements of the film hold it back from being a great movie.Sonic doesn't change at all in his Arc. The human protagonist Tim doesn't grow much as a character. No one has any flaws and I don't expect a children's movie about a video game to be a probing exploration of the human condition but something in the form of dynamism would be welcome.The nice feels small and is setting up a more ambitious sequel so maybe we will see something better. The movie showed a fair bit of talent just not a overarching world view that inspires.5/10,Sonic the Hedgehog
796,armandcad,Following the lore,9,20 February 2020,From all the games becoming movies I think sonic is the best. I felt in a lot of moments like playing the game. The bad guy for a first time looks very much alike the game and sonic moves also are identical to the ones of the game.

801,ChaosControl_VA,A true tribute to the Video Game Icon,7,27 February 2020,"The movie was a really fun adventure for all ages, making it the perfect family movie. And it's pretty nostalgic too, with all the references to the games. And I bet the sequel will be better than this, as Tails appears in the final credits scene; and with the fate of Longclaw and the Echidna's true intentions for Sonic still in the air. The only things I have against this movie is how it felt rushed (but it's a Sonic Movie, so I guess it makes sense), and the few seconds of Eggman pole dancing. Still a pretty good and funny movie though. As a regular movie, I'd give this an 8/10. But my Sonic fan review is 10's across the board, baby!",Sonic the Hedgehog
802,djphakt,The worst film I have paid money to see,4,19 February 2020,"Terrible film.Felt like an effort to watch all the way through. Typical tropes, film starts at the end and flashbacks the entire movie. Implausible world building. Film makes a big deal out of an EMP, shows us the effects and yet, mobile phones still work............... Clear and obvious promotions throughout the movie too.
Jim Carrey hams it up and doesn't even slightly resemble Robotnik til the very end.James Marsden finding himself recast as ""straight-man sidekick to lovable animated CGI character"" dude. Again. HOP anybody?After the originality of Detective Pikachu I had really high hopes for this movie, I love Jean-Ralphio Saperstein (Ben Schwartz), Jim Carrey is a legend..........but it just sucked.Ignore the shills, this movie is like a throwback to all the generic kids movies of the 00's.Waste of time.",Sonic the Hedgehog

807,moonshells,"Appealing villain, unappealing protagonist, strange message",6,23 February 2020,"Nice entertaining movie, colorful and kind of well-paced, though mildly engaging.What troubled me, is how bland and unappealing the protagonist was, he was coming short of evoking emotional response and wasn't really much fun no matter how he tried. Human actors were definitely carrying the film, especially Carrey.And it is radically different to the past year's Detective Pikachu (also based on Japanese game franchise), where the actors were super-bland, but the title protagonist and other creatures were great, pleased the eye and carried the movie. And it made sense! Story-wise, Pikachu is way ahead too. It's hard to think out something more generic than what Sonic writers created. Having a vast IP on their hands, that's what they came up with? My condolences.The message of the film seems to be ""Curb your ambitions, be happy and helpful in your backwater"".. Well..........I don't look forward for sequels, unless it's a full on Dr. Robotnik spin-off.",Sonic the Hedgehog
808,culleyharless,Gotta review fast,7,2 March 2020,"The live action Sonic movie is a lot better than expected. Fans ( like me ) can watch it and catch all the neat references and Easter eggs ( such as Tails appearing in the mid credits scene ) while non fans get a good introduction to the speedy little hedgehog. The story however, isn't much to right home about. It's pretty much a buddy road trip movie with only a little new things added to it. The presentation is fantastic. Sonic looks fantastic and the other effects look good too. The characters are neat. Jim Carrey as Robotnik was a treat ( although I didn't see him as a show stealer), Sonic was great, I really enjoyed how they portrayed him, Tom ( aka Donut Lord ) was alright, and the rest I can't remember that well. All the actors brought in a good enough performance. The sound was also pretty good. Overall, it's a good movie, not great but just, you know. I give this movie 7/10 stars.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Took my kid we both smiled the entire movie was a mix of comedy & buddy flick. Was really enjoyable funny & kept you interested. The only downside is that Jim Carrey is a mix of his usual tropes, he's even kind of enjoyable as long as you like pet detective/ fire marshall Bill. It leaves you wanting more.

When the first trailer hit, it was horrific. Sonic looked worse than your worst nightmare. Thankfully they listened to the outrage and brought in someone who knew what they were doing and made sonic sonic.Jim Carrey did a fine interpretation of robotnik. The guy is totally insane; but did a good job acting out this role. Was quite intertaining to watch.There were little easter eggs here and there which were much appreciated as a humble sonic fan. I do wonder how much of sonic mythos will truly be brought in.(Sonic having lightning crackling off him as seen in the trailer shows they did some interpretation of sonic's abilities, but I found I didn't mind that touch.)Lastly I honestly thought the supporting characters would be pretty mediocre. But they were very likable, sassy, and had character.I liked the simplistic and fun nature of this movie, and would definitely recommend this to parents wanting to take their children to the movies. I myself went to give Paramount money as reward for correcting their mistake. Sonic fans should also like it, based on what I saw from reactions seeing the sonic redesign.",Sonic the Hedgehog

When me and my friends saw this in theaters on February 13th I had a blast right from baby sonic and longclaw running from the echidna tribe to sonic tom and maddy sitting on the bed it was all amazing. The one this that does not make this movie perfect though it is the lack of sonic characters if the movie had a finale ending of sonic knuckles and tails fighting dr. Robotnic it would have been probably one of the best movies of 2020. The one problem with the movie it self Is that it's not really a ""sonic"" movie you really can put any fast character in this movie and have the same result. Jim carrey was just the icing on the cake with the movie this movie would not be as funny or entertaining with out jim carrey and that tails post credit seen made me jump out of my seat. Overall this movie is a good watch I bought the dvd for it so I can watch it as much as I want because this is a good movie.",Sonic the Hedgehog

834,rgmwjm,100% not a waste of your time,8,18 February 2020,"The Sonic the Hedgehog movie has blown my expectations out of the water. I went in to this movie with a mindset that this was going to be just another normal kids movie that was only alright but that was not the case with Sonic.The first thing to point out is Jim Carreys amazing performance as Dr. Ivo Robotnik. He absolutely killed it in his role to no ones surprise. James Marsden and Ben Schwartz had some amazing on screen chemistry, even though they were never even technically on screen together. .It is also very important to point out that everyone should at least give this movie a shot just because they listened to the fans and changed the design of Sonic. If Sonic had not been redesigned this movie would probably be about a 6 or a 5 but Sonic looks very clean.The movie also stays very true to the Sonic video games and other Sonic pieces. There are lots of Easter eggs to previous things Sonic has been in/ what he does such as in a scene where Dr. Robotnik is listening to music you can see a playlist of Crush 40 songs, there is also an animation that is one of Sonics moves in the video game Super Smash Bros.All in all this is an extremely fun movie that you can bring the whole family to.

Which is really hard to pull off with any fan base. Sonics voice by Ben Schwartz was amazing. Almost meant to be. And I haven't seen Jim Carrey be Jim Carrey in a long time.

876,EnvySenvy,Bizarre,4,29 February 2020,"As family movies go, this SHOULD do the trick. Fun, child-friendly comedy; solid, exciting action sequences full of colour and dynamic CGI. The problem I had with Sonic the Hedgehog were the very bizarre tonal decisions made by the scriptwriters that make me question who they were trying to write the movie for.One the one hand, a tale about an excitable blue hedgehog seems perfect for an adventure comedy for kids. On the other, a movie about Sonic the Hedgehog will draw in viewers like me, adults who grew up playing his videos all throughout the nineties and early 2000s. That's the only reason I can figure out as to why there'd be jokes about Sonic farting in one scene and others about drug dealers and colonoscopies in the next.I get the feeling that the writers were trying to go for that Pixar philosophy of 'appeal primarily to kids but slip in some innuendo for the adults'. But in the moments they tried to employ this philosophy they went waaaay overboard, and it ended up being uncomfortable to watch.Aside from that, Jim Carrey is Jim Carrey, and I can't help but feel that this is another nostalgia tickling money grab. I'd say it was good way to distract the kids for a couple of hours, but, unless you want them running around the house pretending to be a speedier-than-sound hedgehog for the next two weeks, I wouldn't bother.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Some forced but successful gags and comedy routine between Sonic and James Marsden can't make up for the fact that the story is plain ridiculous even in the context of a kids movie.
At times seems to try to reach for the charm of Detective pikachu but pulls back from too many comparisons. The worst part of it is, inevitably, the walking face-palm that is Jim Carrey: overracted, not funny, barely watchable. The other side characters are hardly used and feel like ornamentation rather than a necessary part of the film, you could edit out all scenes with actors other than Marsden and Sonic and it wouldn't even be noticeable.
Ben Schwarz does an OK job of voicing sonic but doesn't lend any wit to the animated hedgehog, relying on the slapstick and written jokes, and ultimately leads you to wonder why they went with him instead of a more reliable voice actor.

891,midiancorrea,Good Sonic Movie,8,7 March 2020,"Yes I have played the game since it came out, but like others say forget a bit about the whole game concept and then this becomes enjoyable.

892,lookforme56,This could have been so much more...,4,16 February 2021,"I know complaining about this film is a completely pointless hill to die on, as I'm not exactly the target audience for this, but when will I have the chance to share my thoughts on this with anyone...? I assume this movie was made so that people who played the original Sonic titles on Sega - who are now adults - could go see this in the theatres with their children. Killing two birds with one stone right? But adults will only notice the completely vacuous plot and ill-timed gags and children would be bored out of their minds half the time when Sonic is not on the screen. I feel this movie would be okay as a collection of cutscenes to a modern Sonic game. But as a standalone full-length feature film? No way Jose. The screenplay is basically: ""Sonic ends up in the real world and a menacing guy chases him"". Tell me if there is something I've missed because this is exactly how empty it feels to me. I complain a lot about modern movies building a universe instead of focusing on the story, but this film does neither of those. This is just another example of why I think that shows/series are beginning to emerge as the new lifeline for providing high-quality entertainment. I'm kind of frustrated about this because they didn't have to go down this route. And by that I mean just because it's a video game movie, they didn't have to just huddle a bunch of scenes together where Sonic does wacky stuff hoping it would somehow stick together as a finished product. And if I want mindless entertainment, there are movies which do that better, so right away it misses on both counts. There is zero development, zero immersion, zero anything. The characters apart from Sonic and Robotnik are cardboard cutouts that serve as mere props to an underwhelming storyline, and they don't contribute anything apart from being the hackneyed John/Jane Does, who are wound up in a predicament. The only actor I kind of felt sorry for is Carrey, he desperately wants to make something of a horribly written, underdeveloped character, but he fails, inevitably. I just see an older Jim Carrey doing Jim Carrey stuff. James Marsden on the other hand just doesn't care, not even the slightest, but who can blame the guy - he talks to what I assume is a green cushion with some dots on it for the majority of the film. I think the only redeeming factor in this whole shenanigans is the animation team and the voice actor behind our main character (reminiscent of Ryan Drummond's performance in Sonic Adventure), but why invest millions of dollars into reanimating a cartoon hedgehog and fall flat in all other aspects of filmmaking? You know that they intended this movie to be a blatant one-man show... They thought that the Sonic brand will carry this movie on its shoulders, absolving the producers from obvious deficiencies. It's the exact same vibe I got from Disney's Wreck-it Ralph. Bottom line: pick a stance. You don't have to use a film as an excuse for a marketing stunt. Don't exonerate producers from misusing what is essentially legendary gaming culture embedded in the public consciousness. I thought that audiences learned that for good when Lucas's prequel trilogy came out.",Sonic the Hedgehog
893,akavi8tn,Not the worst video game to big screen,5,21 February 2020,"I loved Sonic and of course Jim Carrey, but I felt there wasn't any chemistry between Tom (James Marsden), Maddie (Tika Sumpter) and Sonic.

I'm a diehard, original Sonic gamer and I thought this would be an okay way to pass an afternoon with my kids. I thought it'll disappoint because I loved the game so much. It absolutely did not disappoint. Start to finish, I was hooked. There were small nods to the game throughout the movie, so people that said there wasn't much to tie it to the game, are ridiculous. The actors were spot on as was the actual voice for Sonic. The fact that the studio actually listened to the OG fans and redesigned Sonic was amazing. One of the end scenes to me, was visually beautiful. And the surprise at the end confirms a sequel.

898,missalaska,"Landed a home run, hi-fives all round",8,14 February 2020,"Can't really dive into the review without mentioning first the massive turnaround that's taken place across the last several months. When the initial trailer hit back in May showing the old design for Sonic, I was planning to see this movie with friends and enjoy it in a 'so bad it's good' kind of fashion. Visual catastrophe aside, it just didn't seem like a very inspiring movie. But then maybe I was distracted by the disarmingly hyper-realistic take on Sonic.On the announcement that there would be a delay to redesign Sonic's appearance from ground up, I thought the effort was a pleasant surprise but I still didn't expect anything great by the end of it all. We reach November, the second trailer drops and the new Sonic design is revealed. Guess they made me eat my words.And now having finally seen it, it's nice to have a happy ending. After all the work that's gone into this movie I think it's well earned at this point.This film isn't redesigning the wheel. This is an E.T.-esque / buddy road trip / funny CGI character in live action world movie that's been done before. But Sonic the Hedgehog is a film that does it well while giving its own charming flair to the story.The central friendship between Sonic and Tom starts off reluctant, develops naturally, encounters some high points and some challenges. By the end of the film, they make a great duo and you really don't want to see Sonic leave behind this new life he's discovering with his sheriff pal & co.Jim Carrey's fantastic as Dr. Robotnik. Hilarious visual comedy paired with a sinister bit of unhinged genius characterisation made every one of his scenes a treat. James Marsden works great in his role, and has some genuinely funny parts too. He's really likeable and has a bit of attitude as well to contend with Sonic, so they bounce off each other very well. Ben Schwartz as Sonic's voice and capture was on-the-nose perfect. He can be funny, witty and wise-cracking in all the best ways. But he's also excellent at bringing out the right emotions during the more serious parts. A major theme for Sonic's arc is loneliness, and the movie doesn't shy away from showing those sad low points just because kids are in the demographic.There was maybe one or two jokes that didn't land with me, and the opening sequence set on Sonic's island feels rather quick. But it's one of those times where I enjoyed so much of the movie the smaller flaws hardly bother me. Who knows, maybe lingering too long on those pre-title scenes would have overstuffed the plot. I think they cut the film down well and it's a neat package that tells the right story, hitting all the beats.An easy one to re-watch, quite a fun adventure film with a lot of heart.",Sonic the Hedgehog
899,billymarottalax,Great Fun and great Graphics,8,19 February 2020,"I was not excited for Sonic when the original trailer was released but the fact that they took the time to change his entire look really showed how much the studio cared for the project. I was pleasantly surprised at how funny, and enjoyable the direction was the whole movie.

I'm finally happy I have a movie that caters to me and actually can't believe it, the movie is fantastic; makes me laugh, makes me smile; makes me sympathise AND understand the character along with many other emotions I've never felt before.In fact, it's left me in shock that I'm still unable to believe a movie like this exists, because it's the only one that I can say that I truly enjoyed to give it a perfect 10.",Sonic the Hedgehog

I knew some basics of sonic but the more I watched the more nerd came out of me. (It was amazing). Watching this flim aroused me in so many ways I fell in love with the movie. I stole Dr Robots hand from the billboard and I put it in a class case and I pray to it everyday saying ""Sonic Sonic Sonic, Gotta Go Fast, Gotta Go Fast, Love All, Speed All, Blue Devil"" ""Amen"" I haven't felt this much love for anyone in awhile and I have a girlfriend.

909,disney-11024,Loved it,10,16 February 2020,"I really enjoyed SONIC THE HEDGEHOG. It's funny, heartfelt and features some wild action sequences (one of which involves a high speed pursuit with an enemy tank that won't stop transforming into smaller vehicles). Jim Carrey threatens to steal the movie as Dr. Robotnik, a brilliant but deranged scientist obsessed with harnessing the power of the supercharged blue hedgehog. This is classic Jim Carrey in his element just bursting with familiar energy. We missed you, Jim!
It also seems that the controversial decision to redesign the character, which delayed the film for several months, ultimately works in the movie's favor. The filmmakers have successfully brought a recognizable icon to the big screen and a wave of nostalgia along with him. There are a ton of surprises for fans of the video games and even the original theme song manages to sneak its way into the film at one point. Voice actor Ben Schwartz gives Sonic some real personality and a mischievous edge while still making him lovable. Sonic has some great comedic moments throughout the movie including a barroom brawl where he moves so fast he appears to stop time. SONIC may not be a game changer but it's light and funny with a great big heart. It's a wonderful family adventure and most definitely one of the best video game adaptations to hit the screen. Stay put for a bonus scene midway through the credits that sets up a very interesting sequel.",Sonic the Hedgehog

I laughed throughout and was forced to admit that she was right (several times) after the movie. Decent writing and acting really brought this story, and hedgehog, to life. I was particularly impressed with Jim Carrey's take on Ronotnik. While he could have gone over the top and given us just another inept, bungling cartoon villain, instead he delivered a truly formidable protagonist for an adorably animated and acted Sonic. Speaking of, the original design for Sonic would have ruined the film. Big thank you to the studio for listening to the fans and redesigning our favorite blue speedster!

Seeing him back is really pleasing.. and in fact: HE STILL GOT IT.I'm really happy to know that there's gonna be a second movie or maybe a sequel. Loved the post credit scenes.

916,texruski,"Far better than Warcraft, but not the best movie ever",7,22 February 2020,"I wanted to give this a higher rating due to the much needed redesign on Sonic, but a few things about this movie ruin the immersion factor for me.
Disclaimer: I've never played a single Sonic game or watched the T.V. series based on them.
I laughed a lot while watching it, had alright dialogue, and loved the references that it made to the games and even some of the memes like ""Sanic."" It also didn't overly rely on the lore.
Here's a breakdown of what I didn't care for:
-surplus pop culture references. It felt like like a large portion of the side characters' dialogue had a reference to an old show or movie every other sentence, such as Men in Black.
-Product placement. It can be unavoidable...but im 100% sure Olive Garden and Fit-bit are benefiting from this film significantly.
-Mature themes, namely Suicide and Divorce. The sister-in-law to the supporting character constantly brings up that he and her sister should divorce. Really? I know this is a comedy but it's largest audience is KIDS. Same with the ""suicide jumper"" bit.
-Plot holes. I know, its a movie aimed at a young audience while giving service to franchise fans. But uh...1) the giant owl? 2) How does Tails know sonic if sonic left home at a very young age 3) what about Amy? Knuckles? the rest of the characters? Hopefully a sequel will fix that.
-the dumb cop cliche. got a bit old.Overall I did enjoy it, though it felt kinda short. Its a good buddy-comedy story with plenty of action and thrills. It excelled in areas where Detective Pikachu didn't, especially at the box office. As a video game movie it's definitely a success, especially when compared to Assassin's creed, DOOM or Warcraft. As a family/kids movie it was par for the course, though. There are definitely moments aimed more at an adult audience, with enough action and wit to keep kids entertained. I'd give it a 7.5/10 if I could.",Sonic the Hedgehog

925,viro_veteruscyx,Was alright,7,18 February 2020,"Alright, just got back from watching the movie so, being a big Sonic fan, guess I'll talk about it.Story was 99% predictable, so predictable that I called out every thing that would happen in a live-action Sonic movie years before the movie itself was conceived (I'm not even joking). Oddly, the 1% of the movie that was most interesting was the beginning of the movie and I would have been very for seeing more of that.Honestly, the film itself was a very by the book movie. The human characters were really unnecessary outside of Dr. Robotnik whom Jim Carrey did a very good job in the role. I feel that the film could have been very different in interesting had it used that 1% as the base of the film than the ""Toon character in our world"" cliche. Tom was alright as a character but some of his development was rushed. His wife didn't really add anything to the story and was just kinda there... same for Stone. No idea why Sonic needed an energy gimmick but okay... Everything else was pretty much a checklist of what ""Toon to live-action"" movies do. Also surprised of the lack of Sonic music in the movie. References were fine.Because the movie was so basic I can't say it was bad but it wasn't great either, just meh... it's a 7/10 movie cause 8 sounds too high and 6 feels too low.

928,doctorcalebwho,Great! But could've been incredible.,9,4 September 2020,"If you are a fan of Sonic you should love this movie. The redesigned Sonic is amazing to look at, the special effects are the best that Paramount can make and the acting is great too. However, this movie takes place in an alternate Sonic Universe as Sonic's backstory and setup are very different from other versions. This isn't a problem and it actually goes smoothly in the movie, but there are plot holes in Sonic's backstory, along with little information about certain characters or the places in the backstory. Another issue with the movie is the random Childishness that comes with Sonic's personality. I know that Sonic has always been childish, I mean he is a kid/ teen, but still, even in Sonic X, Sonic isn't as energetic and annoying as he is in the movie. Every time Sonic is in a dangerous situation where he or someone could be killed he always has to crack a joke, especially ones that aren't funny. Sonic also randomly says or does things that are obviously done to make the younger audience laugh, like when he is playing baseball or when he dabs, which was changed in the trailer to trick us. And finally, the main thing that I didn't like in this movie was Maddie's sister Rachel. From the moment we see Rachel, we can tell she has a terrible personality, she keeps trying to break Maddie and Tom up for reasons unknown, she overreacts about everything and is so bad to the point where she has to be tied up to a chair.

Sonic's character was also perfect! (except a few very childish jokes that are kinda cringe) It's just that I feel like they could do so much more with this universe (I wanted a super sonic scene sooo bad)

Let's just say that I was never disappointed with this movie (except when Sonic does a Fortnite dance :)). What I like about this work of art is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.

Sonic looked great and the voice acting was perfect too.
And Jim Carry? He's Jim Carry y'know. He was brilliant in he's role.
The only thing that bothered me was Marsden's acting. (Or it was just his character) It was not the best. Like a highschool drama studs first apearance. Just smile and wave. I'm not saying it was so bad, but his character could have been much more. 6/10 for it, and 9/10 for the movie.

Sure, it wasn't a groundbreaking and it had a few meh moments, but honestly I was expecting worse.
And I'm happy I was, because once the movie kicked off I was hooked and really enjoying myself.

It really worth the money I gave I want to watch it again. As a grown up Sonic fan I'm pretty okay with this movie.

971,lachlanveivers,"The enjoyable experience we have been waiting for, from a video game film!",8,14 February 2020,"Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) is in hiding on planet Earth in the small town, Green Hills, Montana, because of being forced out of his own dimension due to his surprising speed. Dr. Ivo Robotnik (Jim Carrey) has been alerted by the government for his help to track down the mysterious case of the blackout caused by Sonic to be experimented on. Because the government knows about Sonic, he's once again running away to stay safe. He now needs the help of, Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) a police officer he has been watching for the past couple of years, so he doesn't get captured and whilst on the way making a first friend.This movie speaks to the fans and delivers in every way possible to make them happy. However, even being a family member or parent, this movie is for sure to give you a few crack ups here and there. The action is fun, the family friendly humour is guaranteed to give you a laugh and the morals are heartwarming. Having been a Sonic fan from a very young age, I've always connected with until the modern era of his games. But this is truly the return of the 90s Sonic that we've been waiting for. Just being a casual moviegoer, the will be lines or references that might make no complete sense, but if you are a hardcore fan of the franchise, you are for sure to be filled to the brim of Easter eggs and nods to the games.Moving onto the special effects. For a movie targeted generally to younger viewers, the effects are truly stunning. Nothing that is revolutionary, but still looks like it could hold up for a very long time. Because the movie is set in a real world environment, Jeff Fowler (movie's director), has done a fantastic job to incorporate Sonic into a real world atmosphere without looking too off putting, and exploring with the possibilities of this situation. There are some nods to other 'fast paced' characters in films such as Quicksilver-esque moments which at times could feel a bit dated or overused, but nevertheless provide a good laugh.Knowing that the script of the story is a bit simplistic, it's a safe move that is absolutely paid off at the end of the films screening. My main issue with the film is the limited run time and the overall pacing. Being an animated film, it's understandable why the run time closely resembles Detective Pickachu's. However, this is where the pacing suffers almost feeling a bit rushed and not fully used to it potential. But once again, this is understandable being Sonic's debut to the big screen. If there is going to be a sequel, I would love to see the story to be expanded and the character's development overall.Ben Schwartz provides great lines throughout the whole film, but Jim Carrey steals the show with his return to his 90s form. I couldn't have asked anymore from him and believed that he gave it his all to really be the character the audience came for. James Marsden is also doing a great job playing his character. Him and Sonic have such a deep bond throughout the film which you can really connect with. Maddie Machowski (Tika Sumpter) plays a nice role, but only really fills like a background character whenever Sonic and Tom are on screen. But Tom and Maddie are great together when they are alone, and do give a decent performance.In conclusion, this isn't any groundbreaking film to get excited about and it does have its flaws in the pacing and lack of character development except for the main protagonists and villain, however it still provides much needed enjoyment from the video game film genre. This film pays much respect to the source material, but also expands on it making its own unique thing like Detective Pikachu. This film should be the foundation or reference material to make future video game films. I couldn't have been more fufilled than I already am, and that's is why I am rating 'Sonic The Hedgehog film 2020',8/10

972,crapsh00t,"If you've ever seen Hop, you've seen Sonic.",1,13 February 2020,"Mumbling soundtrack aside, this movie really tried hard, but ultimately failed. Sonic was less interesting than I expected him to be and found myself often daydreaming through his predictable dialogue. I was then hopeful for a resurgence of the OG Jim Carrey, but he failed to show up. Moreso just dim shades of his former glory. I then looked to James Marsden (the king of talking to animated animals that aren't really there) and felt he nailed his typical empty role, fully believing in himself all the way. By halfway through, I was hoping the movie would actually speed up and finish. Not the review you were hoping for.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Is has a simple story, for kids, to know about the importance to have friends and it's good, anyone likes to be alone and need to teach our kids to welcome people, to be kind and educated, to unite the people.
For fans it has many references and little things everywhere and I know, although the different origin story from the games, they'll like the way the way it goes. Sonic is SONIC, that one we know from games and comics, and it's really funny.
Jim Carrey is perfect. We know that he's not physically the same from the original Robotnik but the statements, the movements and even the humor is Robotnik and Jim made it well.Remember, it has two after credits scenes, so stay after the first credits to see the final and incredible one.",Sonic the Hedgehog

But in this movie, Sonic's strong emotions & desires are depended from his superpower and he will have to find out his true path trough his journey.Jim Carrey as the Doctor Eggman was interesting to see the funny side of the character, he did a good job as always on the movies he participated, even if the levels of jokes were meant more for kids, it still so funny.All this made the movie extremely interesting and funny.

Sonic was my favorite character when I was little so I was mostly doing it for a few laughs but didn't expect much. Surprisingly the film was very competent, a lot of the humor managed to land (admittedly a lot of it also missed) and it's clear that the dialogue was written for children. Regardless of it's flaws it's a fun film, performances are all good and I found myself emotionally attached to the characters.

That was a great movie. I really did think that Jim Carrey was gonna be the best part, but even then he wouldn't be that great but every part of this movie was almost as gold as those rings. Jim Carrey egg man, and yes they called him egg man thank god. To the after credit scene with tails. Holy moly. Sonic was great. A bit annoying at times. But great. Tom was pretty good and his character arc felt rights. They did a great job making him already married, I don't think I'd be giving it 9 stars if he ended the movie proposing to his wife. The only thing keeping it from ten stars is that I felt lead on when Robotnic was messing with the strand of fur. I thought he was gonna create shadow the hedgehog. And I would have cried. But I suppose you need something for the sequel. In the end. I'm gonna recommend this movie to everyone I know, from 40 something sega fanboys to young children this movie has something for everyone. Everyone knows who sonic is. And now they can know a story about him that works in Almost every piece of sonic media that's happened in the last 20 years, from chili dogs, to meme culture.

1016,lego-60865,"Terrible, outrageous, complete failure!",3,24 February 2020,"I didn't have high expectations and yet I was really disappointed!
I've been a Sonic fan for almost 10 years and I like everything related to the franchise so much that I decided not to trust my intuition and give this movie a chance even though I knew perfectly that it won't be good. I went home and couldn't believe I refrained from leaving on the 15th minute of the screening. I stayed with the hope that eventually the movie would get better or at least that I would find something in it that would bring me with joy. I went with two friends of mine and every 3 minutes we were commenting on almost every scene with disgust and all the absurdities which made us cringe. My father who still doesn't recognise the main characters and calls them the yellow Sonic, the red Sonic, sadly, is much more informed than the people who made the movie. Everything starts with a scene, which has nothing to do with everything we know about Sonic's childhood. Sonic is one of a kind and was raised by an OWL?? Then some characters appearwho are similar to the Knuckles clan who attack Sonic and he has to escape to the world of humans. Why? This clan was ancient, centuries before Sonic was born and also they wouldn't attack him without a purpose. They do it for money and Sonic doesn't seem very wealthy. And according to the movie, they want his superpower, which is an absurd notion since they can't steal it. And what is his superpower? ELECTRICITY! Since when? So many games show that electricity is even dangerous for Sonic and now he is its lord and has control over it. He can stop the power in a whole city and make explosions with electric waves. This is similar to Silver but we talk about Sonic now... Then, even more hilarious, we see Sonic stopping time. Yes he may be fast but he can't do such a thing. And at the same time, with all these exaggerated powers, Sonic would completely lose them and instead of spin dash and destroy robots, as he has always been doing without a problem, we see him absolutely helpless so the human policeman has to fight f while driving a car at high speed. Looks like the creators of the movie haven't understood the hedgehog's powers at all. He runs fast but it doesn't mean that his whole body is fast. Here's proof - when he runs, his arms fly behind his body. During the whole movie they say that Sonic is lonely and doesn't have a single friend. Just because they didn't think of adding even one more Sonic character. I thought that the movie would be fine because the creators took into consideration the fans' opinion and they changed the disgusting first design. After all there was almost nothing to please us the true Sonic fans.
So I don't know who the movie was made for, since my friends who didn't even know who Sonic was, left disappointed too. For years we fans have been saying that we don't want the other characters to be neglected. There are 50+ Sonic characters and the screenplay forgot about all of them and made Sonic a desperate loner. A human policeman is the only character we get, without even wanting him. And of course Eggman, as always. To keep it simple they left just Sonic and Eggman. Before I went to the movie I expected to see Tails, because of the rumors I had heard. I found out that he really did appear but after the ending credits, in a scene which is a spoiler for the next movie (I will be surprised if there are masochists who will go and watch it). Every time Sonic was complaining about not having a best friend I had a hard time not shouting ""TAILS"". If the movie had been made by Sonic fans, it would have been much better. I can't imagine how SEGA approved it, obviously they cared just for the money.
To make things worse, Sonic's personality was completely changed. He has always been a brave, daring leader, ready for anything and in the movie he is like a tender scared kitten, lonely and desperate. I can't believe they made Sonic so pathetic. He might be cute but that's not him. The Sonic I've known the one in the movie are two completely different characters. Instead of being cool he is helpless and needing protection. He is even stupid. The people in the movie likewise acted inadequately like big fools.
Most of the time Eggman didn't look like himself either. I just can't imagine the evil genius, who makes perfect robots to be driving a truck. And Sonic the fastest creature alive, driving a car and being scared that he won't be able to escape. Why? He is so fast. Why does he need a car? As for Eggman - how hard was it to remember his name? In the scene where they asked him about his name, he said: My name is DOCTOR. Yes, it's so hard to remember the name Ivo.
Actually, there wasn't anything special about the Sonic movie except for the name. It was too much of a parody and the mistakes were numerous, there were not any familiar settings, music, the easter eggs were hardly enough. Its wasn't even funny and I am a person who laughs easily. Why spend so much money to achieve a result which will not please any true Sonic fan?
The only part of the movie which made me happy was the SEGA intro nut it was so short.
The movie didn't convey the magic of Sonic, as true fans understand it. Sadly it won't renew kids' interest to this character. We won't be seeing kids running around pretending to be Sonic.
If there is ever a sequel, please recruit people who care about Sonic as consultants. It is pointless to make amovie about a beloved character if the people involved do not have the slightest idea what's essential for this character.",Sonic the Hedgehog
1017,mmayorgafica,Best Videogame Movie Ever,10,24 February 2020,So The Sonic Movie Is Great Because Of The Effects And The Music Were Great So It Was Great When Tails Appear In The Post Credit Scene,Sonic the Hedgehog
1018,tcamyuntoldartist,It is everything a video game movie could ever hope to be.,10,24 February 2020,"For some reason payed critics feel like judging this movie by standards of all time top 100 pieces of mastery featuring deep philosophical messages and drama. But it is not the flippin' Godfather for crying out loud.For what it is, for what it should be, it is pure brilliance, only slightly hindered by sparse spikes of capitalism (product placement that at certain points actually seemed like parodies of product placements as they were so direct and said out loud), a very strange cut at around 3/4 of the movie featuring Donut Lord and Pretzel Lady (you WILL know what i'm talking about when you see it), an entire ONE cgi side shot of a one wheeler robot that is actually rather nasty (it is like a good second long), and original (pop-ish...) music that is not that memorable even if strangely fitting most of the time.I feel the movie is paced excellently. Starts out as cute, and fun, then quite emotional, and just then, when you already feel this is great so far, enters Robotnik into the picture... and elevates things up to 11. Sonic can feel a tad bit too coked up sometimes, but when you start feeling he's a bit much, something happens that slaps him to turn more serious or downright knocks him out for a few minutes. Or we are suddenly given a very cool, once even quite lengthy slowdown scene that play purely on the visuals and not the talking. The way Robotnik utilizes Sonic's power for himself at one point was just a fantastic idea. From the trailers by the way you'd think this is going to be an other freakin comedic road movie, with plenty of clichéd hijinks happening along the way, but the move from Green Hills to San Francisco was unexpectedly sudden, and short lived their stay was as their return right back to Green Hills was quite an expedient one practically by free fall.This is the kind of movie that is OBVIOUSLY for kids, but not in the usual condescending way, that immediately locks out adults, or should i say... 'big kids'. Seriously if you look at something like this, and dismiss it saying ""you are beyond things like this"", you lack the kid in you that should never truly die.If you ever liked playing a Sonic game, preferably one from the golden era of Sega (1991-2001), you WILL like it, and many of you WILL love it as well.I only hope now for a more classic story for the at least as halfway decent as this was sequel, about the Eggman Empire in Sonic's land, and as a Sega diehard i can die happily. Oh and do not drop Jim Carrey from the cast, he was the best idea ever for Robotnik, and now you are stuck with him i hope you realize that!",Sonic the Hedgehog

1021,victoriahawk,"Sonic the Hedgehog, Will Be Remembered",8,26 February 2020,"I know nothing about Sonic the Hedgehog Lore, I couldn't name a game and yet I found myself in seats to see this film where the only other people were children and there moms.
Within the fist few moment of the film Sonic feels like a kid you can trust. I liked the main character of the film, he was trustworthy and someone kids could relate to. I wanted Sonic to win. Sonic, ADHD, and having multiple personality disorder makes him a voice for minorities and a good example of someone coping with such things.
This movie has about as much action as Terminator 2. I loved the chase scenes and Mr. Robotnicks gadgets. Sonic traveling faster than bullets and actually seeing the movements he made was really cool and entrancing.
Moving on to Jim Carey, he acted liked Jim Carrey, not much to say about it. No matter what Jim Carrey does he is entertaining, funny, and filled with character. I suppose I would have liked more dialogue from Carrey. He had a lot of funny bits, and hinted his background but I wanted to know more. My favorite scene was his solo dance number. THAT WAS AMAZING!
I don't have anything to say about Tom. He is a boring unfunny character that was used to show off Sonic. I thought the movie should have gone the route where he follows his dreams, isn't that the whole point of the movie building that story line up?
One con I will say is the cohesiveness of the storyline was off. They never explained where Mr ROBOTNICK come from exactly, or why the army needed him. The movie also completely brushes off that Tom was a wanted terrorist... wouldn't he be needed for questioning?
Right after the movie me and my friends were JAMMING to the soundtrack. They songs are good and match the movie so well
Product placement was so common it was a joke.
The Sanic meme they showed was a needed pop culture reference
Sonic farted and it was weird. He also flossed. That was weird.
Anyways, Sonic was fun and me and my friends talked about it all night. I want to see it again and would advise anyone to at least check it out, you will get someone out of it .",Sonic the Hedgehog

Or has this just become the norm in our society?Unpopular opinion I guess, seeing how everyone else is throwing 10/10's at this movie. Popular modern cinema is in a very sad state indeed.Oh, and Sonic still looks awkward and very weird, sorry to say.Aside from all that, the story is boring/unoriginal, Jim Carrey is okay, the music choices are the same as in any other crowd-pleasing movies for the masses (Queen five mins into the picture... yikes) and the CG is mostly bland as usual.Yawn, 3/10.",Sonic the Hedgehog

I'm a life-long Sonic the Hedgehog fan; and I thought the movie was going to be a bit deeper and more serious than it turned out to be. For a little while, I just couldn't see what everyone else loved so much about this film. But as I thought about it a little more, I realized that my expectations were probably a little unrealistic. The film did make me laugh in certain parts. Jim Carrey showed that he hasn't lost a step in his portrayal of series villain Dr. Eggman/ Robotnik; and Ben Schwartz did a decent enough job voicing Sonic. But the best part (for me anyway) was that by the end of the film, both of them were starting to act and sound a lot more like their video game counterparts. And that gives me hope that the sequels will take a much more mature approach while continuing to tell Sonic's story. All-in-all, in my humble opinion, Sonic the Hedgehog is a decent little family film which is hopefully setting the stage for something bigger.",Sonic the Hedgehog

But eventually, I thought it was great and would definitely recommend. Sonic's design in the movie was better than the one in the very first trailer and captured Sonic's design in the video games very well. I remember growing up playing Sonic on the computer (especially using the Genesis emulator) and I also like how the Sonic Mania soundtrack, ""Friends, was used during the Baby Sonic sequence. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to go see Detective Pikachu (which I heard it would've been good) but I went to go see this in a Saturday night, and it shows. There are also cool action scenes like the film's climax when Sonic fought Dr. Robotnik and sent him to the world of mushrooms. Oh, did I mention that Sanic (a well-known meme) is shown is this film? It's also possible that there would be a sequel (although I wasn't able to stay through the credits) as Tails was in the post-credits sequence. Sonic had a pretty interesting backstory and I did feel bad for him that he was lonely after his owl mother was killed. There are also funny moments and you could name a few if you'd like.

Jim Carrey is back at it finally & did a absolutely phenomenal performance playing the role as Dr. Ivo Julian Robotnik (Aka The Eggman) Robotnik/Eggman is my favorite villain in fiction aswell. Robotnik is a goofy, whacky hilarious comical evil cunning scientific genius mastermind extraordinaire with a iq of 300, whose bent on world domination! Getting him played by Jim Carrey is so amusing & satisfying not to mention Paramount Pictures did a smart move having the mad doctor as jim carrey, as it's quite fitting & suitable. Ben Schwartz is the movie voice actor for our iconic & beloved badass speedy hero Sonic! Spoilers!Sonic was on his own planet/dimension know as planet moebius/South Island. The particular part of the planet they showed off was of course Green Hill Zone. Sonic was a baby at the time & was being taken care of & raised by a owl named long claw. Then a horde of supernatural echidna tribe came out of nowhere & attacked Sonic & Longclaw. Longclaw gave sonic a bag of portal warp rings, where in the movie Sonic goes a to b in, running around the world from Dr. Robotnik & his Badnik Army. Then 10 years later Sonic joins forces with a cop in a small town in Atlanta named Tom wachowski (played by James Marsden) throughout the movie Sonic refers tom as the donut lord because he's a cop who talks to donuts & eats them if they get out of line. Tom wants to help someone in a life of death situation, & that someone is obviously, Sonic the fastest thing alive. & than the movie goes on from there where Sonic & the donut lord travel across the whole tire planet trying to recivive Sonic's lost teleportation warp rings, which are hidden on top of the San Francisco building. Sonic finally gets his bag of rings back, to finally say his last goodbye to tom, & head to a safe planet that's literally filled with nothing but mushrooms. However Sonic is interrupted with Robotnik's high Tech & advanced Flying Badnik Drones, that Sonic Calls ""flying eggs"" Robotnik also appears after his badniks in his egg o matic mobile which is his hovercraft, that he flies around in almost every media & pop culture of Sonic. Robotnik's egg mobile is equipped with a laser beam cannon, that he straight up murder's & kills innocent lives with, in the city & other different destinations during his chase while trying to catch & defeat Sonic. During the battle, chase fight with Sonic & Robotnik/Eggman they go to places such as Paris, china, Egypt & back to Montana. Which brings it down to the final fight scene. After Sonic is a little banged up from the laser of the egg mobile Tom tries an attempt to stop Robotnik, Pushes him off his hovercraft. Robotnik goes on & rambles about why he has no freinds & wonders why tom would just simply throw his life away for Sonic, then Tom responds saying "" he is my friend"" Sonic quickly gets up to finish the fight, as everyone gets out of the way So that way Sonic can beat Robotnik. Robotnik using laser sights & missiles to fire away at Sonic but ultimately misses & fails. Sonic quickly jumps & completely god stomped Robotnik & his Eggmobile, leaving it completely destroyed & ruined. After that Sonic says ""guess what Eggman? I'm not leaving earth you are"" Sonic then does a spindash attack & sends Robotnik away to the mushroom planet. Coming near to the end music stars playing of a piano version of the main theme Green hill zone, tom & pretzel lady are seen painting thier house but then hear a sudden knock. It was the military general thanking for keeping quiet about recent incidents which never occurred while giving them a ollive garden gift card. The military guy leaves & Sonic jumps on the cough saying ""so are we going to watch a movie or what?"" Tom than says you have to go back to his cave but just before Sonic leaves tom shows Sonic his new home which is in the attic of Tom's home. All of Sonic's belongings were in the room such as his bean bag & comics. Sonic was quite thrilled & jumped around with joy. Sonic thanks thanks them & than the movie nearly ends but than Robotnik turns into Eggman with a bald head & iconic massive moustache in the mushroom planet. Eggman says ""I'll be home by Christmas"" while holding up Sonic's quilt, which he used to power up his Eggmobile. After a bit of the credits are shown there is a credit scene where they have a cameo & appearance of Miles Tails Prower, Sonic's best two tailed fox freind. & so the movie ends from there, I honestly can't Wait for the sequel which does have a release date which is April 8, 2022. I highly recommend & suggest if you haven't already go watch the Sonic movie, it's a fun, laughable movie to have a good time with Freinds or if your a Sonic fan. It's the way a Sonic movie should be!!! See you on my review of Sonic The Hedgehog in 2022! Are you up to it?",Sonic the Hedgehog

1088,t-14486,Great movie to all a blue hedgehog fans,9,16 November 2020,"So I love this movie and I have watched it 7 times! And I normally don't watch a movie that many times unless it is REALLY GOOD. Jim Carrey was really funny and great at acting as DR. Eggman. When the first trailer came out I was actually a little frightened that the creators actually thought that sonic looked good because he looked like something my 5 year old sister would have nightmares from!! Thankfully they listened to use and changed him and he actually looks really cute.Quick Recap Of the movie:Sonic lived with Longclaw (the owl) until he was found. Now he lives in Greenhills, Montana. He was happy but lonely. Due to his depression of no friends or family to talk to he made all the electricity in the area blow up. Soon he finds the cop Tom and he helps sonic find his rings because they fell on top of a building in San Francisco to go to the mushroom planet because the government wanted to dissect him(gross 🤢) and discover what he is. I will not spoil the end of the movie for you because then you would know everything then.I am really EXTREMELY EXCITED 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 for Sonic The Hedgehog 2, I hear that Knucles, Amy Rose, Tails, Shadow will be I the movie. Some other characters I want to see in the sequel are Silver, Blaze, Rouge, and Tikal.What I think the plot in the 2nd movie will be: tails finds sonic to get the 7 chaos emeralds( they were featured in some of the games and SonicX anime show) but knuckles is the protector of the emeralds and if you see the first movie the reason why he went to earth was because he was being captured by a akidna tribe and knuckles is a akidna himself so he and sonic might not be friends right away. Then Amy rose comes and has a secret crush on sonic. Even though that Amy looks like a little princess, but she is a warrior and with her magical hammer she helps complete the mission. Meanwhile dr eggman comes back to earth and he takes Sonic's quill and makes a clone that is evil sonic, Shadow. Shadow works for eggman and tries to get sonic but fails. So eggman makes metal sonic and abandons shadow away with now one to help him and he does not know what love or friendship is so he tries to kill eggman but then becomes friend-enemy being half friends. Then they they defeat eggman and sonic can go home safe and happy.I do not know if this is what is going to be in the 2nd movie 🎥 but I think so. But I wish they would also add sliver ,rouge, blaze and Tikal in the movie but maybe if they do a sonic 3 then they could be in that because I do not like if a movie has way to many characters they have to squeeze them in.
They have informed us that Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is coming out to theaters on April 8, 2022.",Sonic the Hedgehog

1116,angemalta,The movie that great evolution from the teaser to the release,8,8 September 2021,"A movie that and has a great plot throughout the film, has in general a really great cgi and the actors had a really great performance, its Sonic: The Hedgehog directed by Jeff Fowler and released in 2020, the movie was based on a video game created by Sega, Sonic Team, Christian Whitehead, etc...
In this film, we have a lot of cgi (Computer Graphic Imagery) and one of them that we could see that had a really great evolution was the Sonic appearance, they teased us how sonic would look and... It was terrible... It was just not great at all... But at the end when the movie was released it just got WAY better, his appearance was not creepy anymore and then Sonic got more similar to the version from the game. The other cgi that the movie has is very well done, for example the truck where Dr Robotnik was, it is very well made, with a cool appearance, and the same as almost every effect from the cgi, they just go with the movie it is fluent. Now into the plot of the movie. And the performance of the actors was great! It could show us how the characters were feeling and they have done everything like how they were doing it in real life.It just doesn't make sense at all, the film just starts and you know that the world where sonic was is dying, and when he comes to the earth we can understand things better than before, that makes you a bit confused of what was happening. But along the movie it was a really well done plot, that sonic is alone in the world and while he is in there he spies the humans, after he gets discovered he starts getting hunted by a government crazy scientist, called Dr. Robotinik, as it starts to get hunted, he tries to go to another world.This movie has a lot of people who worked on it, so they are Ben Schwartz(sonic), James Marsden(Tom), Jim Carrey(Dr. Robotnik), Tika Sumpter(Maddie), Natasha Rothwell(Rachel), Adam Pally(Wade), Lee Majdoub (Agent stone) Neal McDonough(Major Bennington), Tom Butler(Vice Chairman Walters), Frank C. Turner(Crazy Carl), Melody Nosipho Niemann (Jojo (as Melody Niemann)), Shannon Chan-Kent(Roadhouse Waitress), Brad Kelly (Roadhouse Thug), Elfina Luk (Secretary Homeland Security), Garry Chalk (Navy Chief of Staff), Michael Hogan (Air Force Chief of Staff), Peter Bryant (Army Chief of Staff), Jeremy Arnold (Businessman).So, the movie doesn't have a great start and some of the effects, sometimes, could be better. The plot after we are introduced from the beginning, it gets better and we can understand basically everything, a great amount of parts in the cgi are really well done, the evolution of the character of the sonic are noticeable and the performance of the actors can show us what the characters are feeling and etc... So at the end the movie was really confusing at the start, but it was a really well done film.",Sonic the Hedgehog

Jim Carrey is operating at his top level, you can tell he was enjoying playing Eggman. The rest of the cast is great, unlike most cgi-lead-character movies, the humans here are really relatable and add a ton to the actual movie.
The story is simple, yet very well executed, this is the way you should introduce a video game character in a live action film.
As a side note, props to everyone in the movie production, specially the director, who took the fan critisims of the first trailer and instead of rant or make excuses, they went back to the drawing board and gave us a picture perfect Sonic.
On top of all that, this movie has TONS OF HEART.If you are a fan, you will love every bit of it (wait for the mid credit scene), if you dont know Sonic and want to have 90min of fun, go watch it, you will enjoy it more than you think.",Sonic the Hedgehog

I can honestly say we had so much fun with this movie. It made us laugh throughout, looks great, sounds great. As everyone here has said, Jim Carrey nails it as Robotnik. It feels like the first time in forever that we've got a movie where he's allowed to do his own thing comedy wise, and it really pays off. Unlike the recent Star Wars films, you can tell the producers have really payed attension to everything from Sonic's rich history - the games, the various classic cartoon series, the comic; There are references and callbacks littered throughout the entire film. To see that so much passion for the character go into this is fantastic and as a consequence I absolutely can't wait for the sequel.",Sonic the Hedgehog

I grew up playing sonic and watching Jim Carrey so seeing him play his 90's comedy in this role was perfect and really nostalgic, also the writers threw in some good stuff for those who played the game way back when.Ben Schwartz did a good job with voicing sonics emotions and sonic looks like how I would have hoped.The lesser stuff: Sonics personality is super annoying, I always pictured sonic as cool, maybe it's just a personal preference but his personality doesn't at all match what I had in mind. He acts like an annoying tween in this but I am guessing the movie wasn't made for 31 year olds.Plotholes, no big deal but they are there.Flossing occursSo overall, if you're an old sonic fan who has a child then I think this is for you.",Sonic the Hedgehog

1203,ephesiansas,Fun for all audiences!,10,19 February 2020,"Sonic the Hedgehog kicks off the SEGA cinematic universe debut with an action-packed, family fun, comedic good time. It was a surprisingly heart-felt with a great message.*Spoiler Free Review*
Sonic zooms into theaters with an entertaining story that brings hope for a strong future in video game movies. Like Detective Pikachu, this film brings one of our favorite characters to the live-action scene in a well-articulated fashion. If you weren't aware, the original design for Sonic was heavily ridiculed online and honestly was a horrific sight compared to the Sonic we know and love from our favorite SEGA games as kids. After the internet's backlash, the creators pushed back the original release date of Nov 2019 To Feb 2020--and for good reason. This resign looks much more natural and fitting for a live-action adaptation. Redesign success aside, the acting in Sonic was a lot of fun to watch. Jim Carrey makes his comeback to the comedic scene as an outlandishly hilarious evil-doer that attempts to thwart Sonic's plan to have a normal life on Earth. Ben Schwartz voices Sonic and does an incredible job with his quirky style, impulsive attitude, and unexpected emotional delivery. I highly recommend going to see this film even if you don't know much about the Sonic video games. The story is easy for anyone to follow along, and it's great for the family!Taking a page out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's book of success, there is one scene right before the credits begin and stick around for a must watch mid-credit scene. Enjoy!",Sonic the Hedgehog

It's funny, it doesn't take itself seriously and it's comedy is top-notch, its puns are on spot and the action is INSANELY BADASS.I can't explain why, but this movie was sooo badass at times, especially the slow-motion scenes.I've been waiting for years now for a movie which is not heavy/dramatic, but it's fun, it's exciting, it's got action, comedy, everything. I think a lot of people needed this.For years, I've never spent so much time to discuss all the scenes with my friends after the cinema, this just proves how well this movie was done.

There is much to like about this movie and I think it was well done. There is much room for expansion of the world and plenty of story to be told going forward. This gears toward a younger audience a little more, but much to like for adults as well. The collecting of Rings from the video games were utilized in a highly creative way! The only negative that I can think of is that Sonic's personality is actually quite different. He is supposed to be a little full of himself and extremely confident, but I can see why they chose this path for him. I am a HUGE Sonic fan and was worried this movie was going to be bad, but rest assured it is a surprisingly good time. Also, even though I would never have cast Jim Carey as Dr. Robotnik, he absolutely nails it and I can definitely see where he is taking the role. 9/10 - Fred G.",Sonic the Hedgehog

He now looks and acts the way I expected true to the original video game and there was lots of easter eggs to be found for fans of sonic and sega.The movie was more than pure nostalgia for me though, it had a story similar to the masters of the universe film I watched as a kid, was fast paced and had a great soundtrack.Jim Carey was great as Robotnik, although I was unsure why they didnt make him fater.

I'm a grown woman who doesn't play many video games or watch many movies, but I genuinely liked this film. There are a lot of jokes and references for kids, and plenty for parents and older viewers that will (hopefully) go right over an innocent child's head.Don't Stop Me Now by Queen was an absolute GEM at the beginning, and had me dancing in my seat throughout the whole scene. The rest of the movie kept up with the high-energy beginning, very fitting with the ""gotta go fast!"" idea of Sonic the Hedgehog.I'm admittedly not at all a fan of Jim Carrey, so unfortunately I spent most of his scenes being annoyed by him. But from what I know about the lore of Dr Robotnik, he seemed to fit the role very well.Although the wife didn't have much screen time during the first half of the movie, it was definitely nice to see an interracial couple represented in the film. It's not often in Hollywood movies that you see a black woman married to a white man, so it's nice to see more inclusivity. On top of that, it depicted two black sisters without relying heavily on black stereotypes, something that many other films still fall into.Overall, a very enjoyable movie for children and adults alike. If you have the time and money to see it, I definitely recommend you take the opportunity. And if you do, stay for the first half of the credits.",Sonic the Hedgehog

1225,matienzocalvin,Definitely will please long time fans but will still be a good time for families!,8,14 February 2020,"I want to start by saying that I have a long history with Sonic. I have been a fan of the character ever since I played Sonic Adventure 1&2 on the GameCube and of course the Genesis titles and later games in the series. As you can imagine, the idea of a Sonic movie seemed intriguing but of course when the first trailer dropped I wasn't too happy with what I saw. We all remember the disastrous first trailer where we saw Sonic look less like Sonic and more like something meant to scare kids in their dreams. Thankfully, they did redesign the character to please us. Despite this, I wasn't sure how they would write a decent plot (especially considering that Sonic games never really had what you would call good storytelling). After seeing the film, I'm happy to say that it was better than I expected. While it is definitely not an amazing movie, there is still plenty to like. The cast is terrific, particularly Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic and Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik. The humor works for the most part and fits well with Sonic. The action is fun and overall the movie manages to keep a reasonable pace. While kids and families can have a great time with the film, I feel long time fans will get the most out of it. There are lots of Easter eggs that fans will get a kick out of seeing. I catched a lot of them on my first viewing though I'm sure there were more that I didn't see at first. As far as flaws with the movie, they are mostly minor but one that does stick out is that some subplots don't get too fleshed out. It's not enough to hurt the movie but it is something that could've been fixed. Overall, I had a great time with the movie and I most certainly hope the movie does well considering that the studio did something companies usually don't do: They listened to us and did what they could to make us happy. One last thing, do make sure to stick around for a mid credits scene. I will not spoil it of course but let's just say fans will be surprised by it. Remember, gotta go fast!",Sonic the Hedgehog

I was honestly pleasantly surprised throughout the entire movie. It was sad, funny, suspenseful and most importantly, entertaining! I almost forgot I was watching a video game movie. My family and I loved it. Jim Carrey to me was pretty great. Especially in the end I felt he really brought the character out and made me excited about hopefully seeing a part 2. Sonic was fun and was on trend with today's kids. I will be seeing it again this weekend!",Sonic the Hedgehog
1232,sonicfanatic67,"A fun, fast movie for all ages to enjoy! (Especially Sonic Fans)",8,14 February 2020,"Ever since I was a little kid, I have always wanted a Sonic movie. I have always been a huge fan of Sonic and the idea of my childhood hero being on the big screen has always put a smile on my faceI'm very happy to say that this movie hits it hard! The story, while simple, is a lot of fun and is actually written well. I like Sonic's character arc and development, and in terms of character they really NAILED it; he IS the Sonic the Hedgehog I know and love! Jim Carrey as Dr Robotnik is fantastic and I love his portrayal of the character and how he feels above everyone else because he is a genius. In terms of flow, the movie does great and exceeds in it very well, as what was a nearly 2 hour long movie felt more like 30 minutes. It was constantly fast and engaging, and it was almost always about Sonic. If Sonic wasn't on screen the section was either short and went right back to the story, was related to Sonic in some way, or had Sonic in the background viewing what was going on in the scene. This is really great, as it emphasizes that this movie is about Sonic and the struggles he goes through on earth, and I'm glad to see that it doesn't struggle with some things that other movies such as The Smurfs or Alvin in the Chipmunks struggle with; that is focusing too much on the human side characters instead of the main character. The jokes in this movie are really great too! It gets a bit cheesy at times, but for what the movie is about, it almost works in a way. I mean, the main protagonist is a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog in red running shoes and white gloves who runs at the speed of sound; it's going to be cheesy sometimes!There also a plethora of references to the games that filled my heart with joy and even made me laugh out loud. One thing even had me so excited I was practically yelling in the theatre! (Stay for the after credits and you'll see what I mean)Overall, while it is not a masterpiece by any means, Sonic the Hedgehog is a nice fun adventure for all ages with a fast paced and constantly engaging story with some neat character development and references to the franchise. Also, I have to rate it even higher because of the fact that the studio listened to the fans' outcry and changed the design to make it more appealing, instead of blocking out the opinions and having the attitude of ""well, this is my movie. I'm gonna do what I want, not what will please you"" (I am looking at you Michael Bay). I would've seen the movie regardless, but I certainly would not have enjoyed it anywhere near as much as I did! I highly recommend it if you are a fan of Sonic or just want a fun and entertaining movie to watch; because in the end, that is what all movies should be: fun and entertaining.",Sonic the Hedgehog

1236,aarynwvloo,Better then anticipated,8,20 February 2020,If you're going to this film expecting a cinematic masterpiece that is groundbreaking in all of its pursuits...then save your breath. The film strives to bring a real world adaption of the classic character and his villainous counterpart. Jim Carrey brings a whole new level to Eggman's character and Sonic strives to fit into a world where he is different. The film expands on the characters giving them depth. I loved to see the Easter eggs from the original games and to see my childhood come to life. The film strives to be just this and nothing more. Did a good job,Sonic the Hedgehog
1237,greenhouse_guy,Brings back memories,9,15 February 2020,Great movie for the kids. The newer generation of kids don't know the real sonic that we grew up with. They were unable to see the little connections that tied this live action movie with its true roots. I personally loved it.

The story solid fun fast paced and entertaining and OMG! The characters perfectly defined created moulded adapted the story is just right there. So why did I give it a 9?

1248,Snoopyloopy24,A fantastic film!!,9,15 February 2020,"Sonic the hedgehog was a fantastic family filled adventure featuring the famous blue hedgehog Sonic. Sonic is voiced by Ben Schwartz who portrayed Sonic very well, you could see the emotion put into each scene as necessary. Jim Carrey played Eggman and was brilliant in the role and stole the scene in every appearance. James Marsden as Tom Wachowski gave a strong performance as well. It shows you how good the film is when all the main characters are fantastic in every scene.The plot was decent, although there was some cheesy moments but that doesn't matter too much when the film is aimed at families. Now i will talk about the end scenes. Eggman fights Sonic and he gets sent to a mushroom planet by sonics transport emergency rings, he then attempts to get revenge on Sonic. At the end Tails appears which became a massive shock to us all as he is looking for Sonic. This brings us to the future of Sonic which will likely have a series of films planned.

The thing that really got me, admittedly as a big Sonic fan, was the amount of depth this movie was able to bring to the table. Often very relevant themes are used in a tasteful, subtle way such as loneliness, isolation, even suicide, along with ""automation"" as an antagonist. Maybe it just hit me harder because I grew up with a single father, but the father-son references were meaningful to me. The people who put this movie together *really* understood their audience.Lots of good ""feel-good"" moments, and especially appreciated was how Sonic was more ""funny"" than ""cocky"". This is a tasteful change and I think it helps adapt him to modern times without giving too much away.Jim Carrey does a great job to hold his own as a bad guy, and its funny watching him deploy some of his old gags from even the very beginning of his career. Perhaps he had flashbacks from the early 90's? The quill shocking him reminded me of that interview where he's talking rich people and dog collars.I'll be curious to see if they can add even more depth during Sonic 2 and truly round out the storyline and character dynamics. 30 years later, Sonic's fanbase is still very much alive and well.",Sonic the Hedgehog

The funny character of Sonic, and acting of jemes marsden was so enjoyable.
Altogether with the storyline the movie is a good visual treat.",Sonic the Hedgehog
1296,torosushii,A videogame movie that stands out,6,20 February 2020,"(MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD)Videogame-based movies were never too successful. The only intent behind them is to sell merchandise and give more value to the franchise itself. ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" may just be another one of these but it certainly had a lot more effort behind it. However, don't think this is a masterpiece of a movie.
The story is just dumb and meaningless. There are tons of inconsistencies everywhere and the characters are very blandly designed. In this movie, the only thing that keeps it going is Sonic himself. The rest of the characters (besides Dr. Robotnik) are there for no real reason. Speaking of, the best thing about this movie is certainly Jim Carrey. His mad-scientist performance does remind me of some kind of ""Joker"" but still maintaining most of Robotnik's personality traits. Also, Sonic's entire universe is disregarded for the entirety of the movie, so forget about seeing Amy, Knuckles or any other characters (unless there's something in the post-credit scene... ;))
I believe this movie was mostly designed for children to see elements of their favourite media and laugh at them. An example is Sonic doing the 'floss' or him mentioning actors like Vin Diesel and Will Smith.
I'll also mention how inconsistent the CGI was. In some cases it looked really bad, as if the model wasn't finished or something. Maybe it's my impression.
Humour-side, it's not so bad as you'd expect. I actually laughed with some scenes. There are some nice references that only a few may be able to catch, so that's nice to watch out for.Overall, I give it a 6/10. Began well, collapsed entirely during the protagonist's quest and had a very bland ending that not only was totally expected by the audience, but also it forgot about Sonic's original adventure and decided that maybe he should stay on planet Earth even when Tom is considered a national terrorist and dangerous person. They completely forget about that and end up giving him a Olive Garden voucher. Certainly a bad experience if you had any hope that it would represent Sonic in a good way. Maybe children will enjoy it more than I did; as soon as the credits started rolling I had an urge to leave immediately but I eventually stayed for the post-credits.",Sonic the Hedgehog

1298,fatrollfavier,Very well put together fun for everyone film,10,15 February 2020,Was worth the expensive tickets. Would watch again. My wife and kids loved it. No one complained!!!!,Sonic the Hedgehog
1299,eva_garcia-80281,An incredibly fun two hours,10,15 February 2020,"The movie doesn't really go out of its way to paint an intense arch or anything like that. And honestly, that's refreshing right now. The story is heartwarming, the jokes are funny, and Sonic's his usual confident self, but not to the point of it being unbearable. If you've got a couple of hours to spare and aren't looking for anything to serious, I would definitely recommend this one!",Sonic the Hedgehog
1300,karenkat-97312,The best movie ever!!!,10,14 February 2020,"I'm a huge fan of Sonic and I was really impress in how the manage the character develop in all the movie. If you are a Sonic fan, believe me, you will not be dissapointed. Even thou they say that the story is really simple, I disagree. When you play de games you know the Sonic background if almost not existence, you don't know anything more that the main story, but here, they explain everything you need to know about why Sonic decide to be a hero, why Eggman ends in Mobius (Sonic Planet) even, why Eggman is call Eggman! For me was perfect, and I'm waining for a sequell!!!",Sonic the Hedgehog

1302,Arun_18,"Was very worried what they would do with Sonic, fear not!",9,16 February 2020,"Long time IMDB user, first review.Massive Sonic fan, who was a kid when Sonic first came out, I was real worried this would fall into the many pitfalls associated with game to film adaptations. I can happily say my fears have been allayed.Read a couple critic reviews which said it was predictable but didn't focus on the many positives, hence my fears.If you want a negative about the film, it's that I felt it was too short but this is expected as the film largely caters to a younger audience. Many references were modern day ones, it would have been great to see some 90s references.As it is the references that are included are satisfying still.One last point; Jim Carrey.....!Go see this film.",Sonic the Hedgehog

1304,info-19392-22640,Video Game Adaptation done Right.,8,15 February 2020,"Sonic the Hedgehog is by far the best video game adaptation movie I have ever seen.There are many fan pleasing moments and that was basically the common secret of making a successful video game franchise, that all previous attempts failed to understand.Fans want to see their pixel heroes becoming alive and as true as possible they can get to the original character - no ""Hollywood-vision"" attempts - those failed miserably many, many times.And this is where the director of the film, Jeff Fowler has to be congratulated for. He accepted the criticism bravely and identified that the humanoid Sonic would have been a disaster. And thank god he listened to the fans. And the hard working animators reworked the character, close to the video game concept and brought our beloved Sonic to life.As for Jim Carrey's Dr Robotnik Character, I have only positive things to say. We saw the good old Jim Carrey coming back to the big screen. There were some fan pleasing moments, some good laughs, some decent action and in all it's a good family movie.",Sonic the Hedgehog
1305,c_mm_c,Awesome!,10,2 July 2020,Love this movie! Grew up playing the video game and this movie gives Sonic such a friendly and genuine attitude. Jim Carrey is amazing and a perfect Dr Eggman.,Sonic the Hedgehog
