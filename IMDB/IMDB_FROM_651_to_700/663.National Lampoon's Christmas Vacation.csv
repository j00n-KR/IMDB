0,MartinHafer,I have a hard time understanding the love for this film.,3,12 December 2020,"""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" is a film that is clearly beloved of many folks and they enjoy watching it each and every holiday season. I honestly am happy they enjoy it, though I myself cannot see the charm in watching it. I first saw the movie shortly after it debuted and watched it again tonight and felt disappointed.The story is about the Griswold family NOT traveling but welcoming their parents to spend the holidays with them. Then, unexpectedly Clark' scummy Cousin Eddie and his brood show up. In the midst of this, which Clark hates tremendously, he keeps his hopes up for a Christmas bonus from a nasty boss.As I watched, again and again, I just kept thinking that this isn't funny. Or, if something was funny, it could have been done funnier. In addition, I think making Clark a rather unlikable guy hurt my viewing experience, as he seemed more interested in adultery than his loving and VERY patient wife.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Silly and predictable, but funny",8,25 September 2010,"It mayn't be one of my favourite Christmas movies, but it is one of the funnier ones for me. I agree some of it is silly, and when I say silly I mean silly, and the story is really quite predictable. But it at least looks good with some nice cinematography and scenery, and the music is fine too. The script has many funny moments and the sight gags while silly are respectable. The direction is competent and the performances from Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo are likable while Randy Quaid gives some great relief as a decidedly obnoxious relative. So in conclusion, no masterpiece but it is entertaining, that's what matters to me. 8/10 Bethany Cox",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
2,Leofwine_draca,Amiable enough,6,21 December 2015,"A fun, Christmas-themed comedy movie featuring Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo. I liked this more than NATIONAL LAMPOON'S European VACATION, although I still haven't seen the original VACATION as yet. This film plays out as you'd expect, featuring Chase juggling the demands of his visiting family members with putting on the whole Christmas razzle-dazzle.The first half of this film is particularly strong when it focuses on decent slapstick moments: the whole situation with the Christmas lights, the stuff in the attic, and the bit with the staple gun, which is my favourite moment. By the time all of the old-timers show up, it does start to get bogged down a bit, although the film is enlivened by the presence of Randy Quaid's enjoyably scuzzy cousin and there are some hilarious scenes like the turkey carving.Occasionally, and especially towards the end, Christmas VACATION descends into schmaltz, but then that's down to John Hughes who can never resist inserting some sentimentality into his work (it's even there in my favourite of his films, PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES, although John Candy is so sympathetic that it works). Chase and D'Angelo are on top form here and the film as a a whole is difficult to dislike as it has so much energy and so many constant gags. Watch out for a fresh-faced Juliette Lewis in one of her earlier performances.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
3,SnoopyStyle,Griswolds in their Staycation,6,22 December 2014,"Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) drag his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), daughter Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and son Rusty (Johnny Galecki) to get a Christmas tree. It's the start of a season of ridiculous family celebration. Clark doesn't get along with his yuppie neighbors, the Chesters (Nicholas Guest, Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Clark's parents (John Randolph, Diane Ladd) and Ellen's parents (E. G. Marshall, Doris Roberts) join them. Ellen's cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn), her idiot husband Eddie Johnson (Randy Quaid) and their family pay a surprise visit. Clark desperately needs the year-end bonus from his boss Frank Shirley (Brian Doyle-Murray) to cover a cheque for the pool but he only gets a Jelly of the Month Club.There are a lot of random Christmas jokes. Some of them actually do hit well. However Chevy's shtick was getting tired at this point. Beverly D'Angelo is fine as always. The grandparents are more annoying than funny. The movie misses a great opportunity to give them some personality and depth. Honestly, I couldn't tell them apart. I don't know who are who's parents. The sets of parents could fight against each other over the kids or how Clark is doing or who the family loves more. There is a world of possibilities but they are simply lumps of coal. Even the Griswold kids are not doing the sibling rivalry that well. They're the least convincing kids of the franchise. The fact that the kids are always different could be a source of self-referencing jokes. It seems like Chevy is doing all the heavy lifting to get the laughs. Everybody is playing the straight man until Randy Quaid arrives. Cousin Eddie livens up the movie a little. At least, he adds something to the movie. Also I don't really know who Nicolette Scorsese is, but she's no Christie Brinkley. The movie has a few jokes. I love the cat getting toasted.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
4,Prismark10,Festive fun Griswold style,6,31 December 2013,"Its a fun filled Christmas, Clark Griswold style with Chevy Chase more likable and less laconic who wants to have a traditional family Christmas with his family.He goes out to the mountain to get a big Christmas tree, he puts down a deposit for swimming pool hoping his Christmas bonus will come through and wants to have the perfect Christmas, what can go wrong?Almost everything as more family members turn up including his cousin played by Randy Quaid and his troublesome dog. His neighbours are annoyed and if that bonus does not come through Clark is up a creek without a paddle.Its huge zany fun especially as some of the cantankerous elderly members of the family provide a lot of humour, plenty of slapstick and the syrupy schmaltz is kept to a minimum. Its probably the last great National Lampoon vacation film made.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
5,mark.waltz,Has this stood the test of time 30 Christmas seasons later?,5,23 December 2018,"Certainly there are many things here that movie fans can identify with in dealing with crazy families over the holidays, and there definitely are dozens of laughs to be found as well as a few poignant moments. But does the character of Clark Griswold, played with overconfident bravado by Chevy Chase really make for a likeable hero? Even in the first scene with the Griswolds family out to get their Christmas tree, Clark comes off is a pompous jerk with no common sense who makes a fool out of himself and certainly wouldn't be an influence I want my children to have, let alone the sensible wife play by the gorgeous Beverly D'Angelo.Then, there are the relatives. Doris Roberts, John Randolph, Diane Ladd and E.G. Marshall are all given unique eccentricities as the parents, with Randy Quaid returning as an obnoxious cousin who plans his dilapidated trailer outside Clark's middle-class neighborhood. Obnoxious and pretentious neighbors get the worst of it with their stereo destroyed by a flying icicle, and the stench of Quaid's emptying of the trailer toilets into the local drainage ditch. then, there's Clark's awaiting his Christmas bonus from a Scrooge like boss who barely acknowledges his existence.The scene-stealing Mae Questel comes in late in the film, along with William Hickey, as elderly members of the family who are probably celebrating their last Christmas. The cute Questel steals every moment whether saying grace or breaking into sudden song. A particularly gruesome funny moments involving a family cat may disturb some, but has stood the test of time in being one of the all-time great visual gags. Had Chase toned down his character's obnoxiousness, scenes of him watching old Christmas family films might have been more touching, but his persona is one that only holds up in small doses. Even though it isn't quite as funny on repeat viewings, it is certainly better than a lot of the garbage made today celebrating the holidays that lack any sort of heart.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
6,kosmasp,Tis the season to be ...,9,9 June 2020,"... crazy? At least at the brink of madness at times. Chevy Chase as Mr. Griswold .. not few will remember those names. I reckon some might have wanted to be in the extended and already big Griswold family alltogether. Now I might have rewatched this out of season, but I do think it works no matter what time of the year it is.And that is what makes this a great comedy. Also the actors and the script involved! Some jokes may be a bit .. well don't be too woke about certain things or too PC. Also yes some are just plain silly and there is a lot of don't try this at home stuff. It's a movie, try to accept it (like when Chevy is in the attic and sets his chair in the one spot where it makes no sense at all, other than to get a laugh out of the audience).So great cast and good natured humor. What else do you need?",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
7,gavin6942,One of the Better National Lampoon Films,7,22 December 2012,"The Griswold family's plans for a big family Christmas predictably turn into a big disaster.How do you beat this? Frank Capra III helping to direct, John Hughes writing and Angelo Badalamenti on the score? There is no way these three folks could make a bad movie. Then throw in Chevy Chase, Brian Murray, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Bill Hickey and Randy Quaid... you have an instant classic.I could maybe have done without Juliette Lewis. I mean, she has her moments, but how did she get to be in this film? Being the daughter of Geoffrey Lewis? It certainly was not her work being Wayne's girlfriend on ""The Wonder Years"". Oh well. At least she went on to do better things.Today, the film is considered a modern Christmas classic, and I would have to agree. It also is a strong third entry in the franchise, second only to the original. Ebert wrote, ""The movie is curious in how close it comes to delivering on its material: Sequence after sequence seems to contain all the necessary material, to be well on the way toward a payoff, and then it somehow doesn't work."" I have to say, I think he was wrong.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
8,lee_eisenberg,"Happy holidays, everyone!",7,10 March 2006,"It seems to me that they didn't really need another addition to the ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" series after the second one, but this one is zany enough to ensure that they still had it going (although I can't quite say the same for part 4). Portraying the Griswolds inviting several relatives to their house for Christmas, the movie portrays one mishap after another (well duh; that's what all of Chevy Chase's movies are). Particularly hilarious are the sled scene, the light scene, the squirrel scene, and Clark's rant after he finds out about his Christmas bonus.It's weird to think that among the relatives invited were the ""Prizzi's Honor"" godfather (William Hickey), the voice of Betty Boop (Mae Questel), the ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" mom (Doris Roberts), and of course Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid). All in all, ""Christmas Vacation"" is enough to put anyone in a holiday mood, even if it involves getting perpetually embarrassed.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
9,jboothmillard,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,4,4 July 2021,"The original Vacation movie was good fun, while the sequel European Vacation was alright, I had seen the poster for this seasonal sequel several times, as well as clips on TV, I was hoping it would be a good laugh, written by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone, Beethoven), directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik (Benny & Joon). Basically, Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) hopes to have a great Christmas with his entire family home in Chicago. He and his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) are looking forward to the festivities, but daughter Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and son Rusty (Johnny Galecki) are uninterested. The Griswolds drive out to the country to find a tree, only to realise too late that they have no saw. Clark finds the biggest tree he can see, and they are forced to pull it down themselves and strap it to the roof of the car. Soon after, Clark's parents, father Clark, Sr. (John Randolph) and Nora (Diane Ladd), and Ellen's parents, father Art (E. G. Marshall) and mother Francis (Doris Roberts), arrive for Christmas, but their bickering quickly begins to annoy the family. Clark, however, maintains a positive attitude, determined to have a ""fun old-fashioned family Christmas"". He covers the whole of the house exterior with 25,000 twinkle lights, which fail to work at first, as he has accidentally wired them through his garage's light switch. When they finally come on, they temporarily cause a citywide power shortage and create chaos for yuppie neighbours the Chesters, Todd (Nicholas Guest) and Margo (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). While standing on the front lawn to admire the lights, Clark is shocked to see, arriving unannounced, Ellen's redneck cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn), her husband Eddie (Randy Quaid), and their children, Rocky (Cody Burger) and Ruby Sue (Ellen Latzen), and their Rottweiler dog, Snot. Eddie later admits that they are broke and living in the RV they arrived in, after being forced to sell their home. Clark offers to buy gifts for Eddie's kids so they can still enjoy Christmas. Soon afterward, Clark's senile Aunt Bethany (Mae Questel) and grumpy Uncle Lewis (William Hickey) arrive as well. Clark desperately needs his yearly bonus to pay for the instalment a swimming pool for the coming summer, and he questions his boss Frank Shirley (Brian Doyle-Murray) about why has not given it to him. The family dinner on Christmas Eve is disaster, with Bethany's cat getting electrocuted and Uncle Lewis accidentally burning down the Christmas tree while lighting his cigar. A company messenger soon arrives with an envelope, after failing to deliver it the day before. Clark assumes it will be his bonus, but it is a free year's membership for the ""Jelly of the Month Club"". Clark finally snaps and goes into a tirade about Frank, and in anger says he wants to see him delivered to the house, wrapped in a bow, so Clark can insult him to his face. Eddie takes this literally, drives to Frank's mansion, and kidnaps him. While tied up, Frank admits to cancelling the Christmas bonuses, and Clark berates him for doing so. Meanwhile, Frank's wife, Helen (Natalia Nogulich), calls the police, and a SWAT team surrounds the Griswold house, holding everyone at gunpoint. Frank decides not to press charges and explains the situation to his wife and the SWAT leader, both of whom scold him for his decision to scrap the bonuses. Frank decides to reinstate the bonuses, with Clark getting a bonus equal to the amount the year before, plus 20% as compensation. The family heads outside when Rocky and Ruby Sue believe they see Santa Claus in the distance. Clark tells them it is the Christmas Star and that he finally realises what the holiday means to him. Uncle Lewis says the light is coming from the sewage treatment plant, reminding Clark that Eddie had been dumping sewage from his RV into the nearby storm drain. Before Clark can stop him, Uncle Lewis tosses a match used to light his cigar into the drain, triggering an explosion, which sends a Santa's sleigh decoration flying into the sky. Aunt Bethany starts singing ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" and everyone joins in as the flaming decoration flies into the distance. The entire family and the SWAT team members then celebrate inside the house, while Clark and Ellen happily share a Christmas kiss, and Clark stands outside satisfied that he provided a great Christmas for his family. Also starring Sam McMurray as Bill. Chase as the accident-prone father is on good form, as is D'Angelo as his tested wife, and Quaid is memorable as the obnoxious relative. The disaster prone Oswold family may be staying home for the holidays, but even the simplest tasks like hanging out the lights turn into overly silly slapstick fodder, it is predictable and gets sentimental towards the end, but this is one the earliest examples of Christmas going wrong in a movie, and it works relatively well, not a bad comedy. Okay!",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
10,BA_Harrison,A Christmas cracker with genuinely funny jokes.,8,20 December 2009,"If you're stuck for gift ideas for that special someone this Christmas, why not give them the gift of laughter with the Chevy Chase comedy classic 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation? Heartwarming and hilarious, this festive favourite will guarantee a very merry time.Chase plays Clark Griswold, a well intentioned family man whose plans for the perfect Christmas go disastrously wrong: the thousands of lights that adorn his home refuse to work; his in-laws argue with his parents; the Christmas tree goes up in flames; he is trapped in the attic while hiding his gifts; a sledging incident almost costs him his life; the turkey is overdone; his embarrassing hick relatives turn up expectedly for the holidays; a wild squirrel invades the home; and worst of all, his bonus cheque seems to have gone missing in the post.Naturally, by the time Christmas Day arrives, Clark is a complete nervous wreck, and when he discovers that his Christmas bonus is a 'year's membership to a jelly club', rather than the expected cash bonus, his temper finally snaps (of course, this being a good natured Christmas tale, everything turns out right in the end, thanks to the intervention of dumb, but well-meaning Cousin Eddie).Written by 80s comedy genius John Hughes, Christmas Vacation's script is bristling with very funny lines of dialogue, but it is the visual gags that get the biggest laughs: Clark somehow driving the family saloon between the wheels of a huge truck; the bushy tailed rodent clinging to Clark's back; the sight of Clark careering across a freeway on a well oiled sled. Chase gives one of his most memorable performances, making Clark a thoroughly likable character that one can't help but admire, despite his failures, and he is given able support by a superb cast that includes Beverly D'Angelo as his long suffering wife Ellen, Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie, and Juliette Lewis as his daughter Audrey.And the best thing about the film? You can watch it time after time and it'll always put a smile on your face; it really is the gift that keeps on giving.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
11,paul_haakonsen,It was an ugly tree anyway...,8,2 May 2017,"""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" is a Christmas classic, and there is no denying it. It is one of those movies that you just have to watch year after year come Christmas time. And the movie never gets old, no matter how many times you have seen it.Following in the tradition of the previous ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" movies, also starring Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo, the 1989 ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" is every bit as hilarious, enjoyable and entertaining as the previous movies. And if you have seen the previous movies, which I assume you have as they are also classics, then you will immediately love ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" as well.The Griswold family is hosting a big family gathering for the Christmas holidays and have everything planned out, from decorating the house to the grand feast. But of course everything goes awry for Clark and the family, true to the Griswold family streak of bad luck and misfortune.What works out so well for ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" is a combination of things. First of all, the storyline is good and hilarious, with some truly wonderful situations playing out on the screen. But it is also a gallery of some magnificent characters with lots of personalities and quirks, and it is characters that easily can be identified with members of your own family. And it is, of course, also the comedy that is ever-present throughout the entire movie. There are so many laughs throughout the entire movie, and it is fabulous because it is laughs that you enjoy every year as you watch this Christmas classic.Chevy Chase is of course the embodiment of Clark W. Griswold and he carries this role with grace and perfection. And Beverly D'Angelo is right alongside him in her role as Ellen Griswold, his wife. And she not only compliments Chevy Chase, but she also stands her own ground quite well. Furthermore there are great performances by Johnny Galecki, Juliette Lewis, Randy Quaid, Doris Roberts, John Randolph and William Hickey to name but a few of the performers who shine here in this movie.""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" has truly withstood the test of time and stands out as a classic movie to brighten up Christmas year after year.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
12,Quinoa1984,A wonderful comedy and Christmas movie,8,22 July 2000,"This is probably the best Vacation film to come from the National Lampoon series.  There are so many laughs to go around (thanks to writer John Hughes) that it boggles the mind (and it might be the final time Checy Chase brings belly laughs).  Here, the Griswalds don't go on a vacation, but instead the family stays in Chicago where there relatives come to town and hell will come too.  Randy Quaid makes this film a treat by having just laugh out loud moments on the screen.  Great fun for the whole family (I think).  A+",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
13,ComedyFan2010,"""Merry Christmas, the shitter was full!""",7,17 January 2014,"Clark and his wonderful family want to celebrate Christmas at home and he wants to make it as perfect as possible but there is one disaster coming after the other! This is one of the comedy Christmas classics. With a great cast and many jokes.Actually, the humor is not always my thing. I am not a big fan of slapstick comedy. Animals being hurt just makes me cringe and I need a bit more to laugh but people falling or a table break down. But it still has some good moments.One thin that bothered me the most was the lack of participation by most family members. It is such a great cast but we don't see much of them besides Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid (and both were great). I was excited to see Doris Roberts, but she basically got nothing to say or do, I felt it was such a waste.As usual when watching older movies it was fun to see actors I know in their earlier roles. One would be Johnny Galecki whom I wouldn't recognize if I wouldn't see his name.I am probably more generous to this movie than I should be. If it wasn't a Christmas movie it would probably get a 6 from me, but it is just a part of the Holiday season that is worth watching. It has the usual ""family is more important on Christmas than anything else"" message, and I rather get it from this movie than It's a Wonderful life.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
14,studioAT,"It's funny, but not THAT funny",2,18 December 2016,"There's a lot of hype around this film, it's one of the ones that people watch every Christmas. So I thought i'd give it a try.The bit draw for me was John Hughes, who of course famously gave us 'Breakfast Club', 'Pretty in Pink' etc. And there are lots of the standard things we expect from him in this film. It's broadly funny, it's sentimental, it's got some nice set piece moments.I think your enjoyment of this film largely comes down to whether you find Chevy Chase funny. I did not. I spent most of the film wondering which modern actors could do this better. Apart from falling on his face or widening his eyes, I didn't find Chase that funny.In fact the supporting case are the ones who take most of the laughs, with Doris Roberts in particular being a good example.If it's your favourite Christmas film then don't listen to me, go and enjoy it.

If Clark isn't battle scarred from putting up Christmas lights, he's contending with problems with the tree. Bickering relatives, long-awaited bonus(which doesn't turn out to be what Clark was hoping for so he could pay for a new pool), Cousin Eddie, getting locked in the attic while the family is gone(not to mention getting smacked in the face with the attic latter and falling out altogether while watching old family reels on the projector), an overcooked turkey, Cousin Eddie, a sled ride that goes terribly wrong..did I mention Cousin Eddie? With plenty of Chevy Chase zingers(his demand at the end that no one leaves when all is not well, what he'd like to tell his (insert insults here) boss who screwed him over regarding the late ""bonus"", and especially his comments about Eddie), slapstick, and one hell of a supporting cast, ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" stands the test of time as a real comedy Christmas classic worth revisiting every single year. The mayhem brought on by one nightmarish scenario after another(the tree going up in flames thanks to Uncle Lewis' cigar, the cat getting ""lit up"" when Clark plugs in the lights, Eddie filling the Griswold sewer with ""toxic s#it"", a runaway squirrel causing the family to panic, etc.)provides plenty of chuckles. Before this film John Hughes was mainly putting out teenage fare, but afterward you'd have other Christmas slapstick comedies like HOME ALONE where destruction in a cartoony fashion would erupt on the unlucky. Probably the last great comedy Chase would be a part of; the next decade wasn't as kind as the 80s.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
17,Hey_Sweden,"Endearing entry in the ""Vacation"" series.",8,7 December 2011,"Third ""Vacation"" movie finds star Chevy Chase in fine form, as perpetually stubborn Clark W. Griswold is determined to have a happy holiday at home with the family and the in-laws. What he didn't count on was the return of his cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid, full of all the expected swagger and an absolute hoot), the ultimate hick, who brings along his family and his dog in an RV.What's great about this movie is how likable it remains even as it comes up with one ridiculous (yet funny) setback after another. The in-laws aren't the only things Clark will have to contend with: there will also be an incident on the road with some redneck drivers, the attack of a psychotic squirrel, Eddie dumping his sewage into the storm drain, the inability to get Clarks' elaborately decorated house to light up, a pair of snot nosed, disapproving neighbours (one of them played by a pre-'Seinfeld' Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and a Yuletide visit by the local SWAT team!One has to admire Clark: he soldiers on, running on a lot of heart even if he doesn't quite have the brains to match, and when he loses it in a couple of memorable, hysterical rants, they can't help but feel some sympathy for this guy. Director Jeremiah Chechik, working from a screenplay by John Hughes (who'd written the first ""Vacation"" and co-written the second), does a great job of mixing some genuinely poignant moments into all of the farcical highlights. There's some very quotable dialogue, especially from Clark and Eddie.It's great fun, too, to see so many familiar faces in this large cast; lovely Beverly D'Angelo is fine as usual as the long suffering wife Ellen; also appearing are Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki as the latest incarnations of Audrey and Rusty, Diane Ladd, E.G. Marshall, Doris Roberts, Miriam Flynn, William Hickey, Sam McMurray, Nicholas Guest, and Natalia Nogulich. Mae Questel, long ago voice of Betty Boop, is a riot.Christmastime simply wouldn't be complete without a viewing of this personal favourite.

18,Doylenf,Gathering of the Griswold clan for Christmas is dangerously funny...,7,23 December 2011,"Chevy Chase lends his abundant comic talents to a tale where everything that could possibly go wrong does, while preparing his house for a gathering of the Griswold clan for a typical American Christmas. He goes overboard, believing that he's about to receive a nice Christmas bonus. The nerve-wracking turn of events that follow are enough to create havoc when he almost suffers a nervous breakdown before a happy ending.Lots of sight gags enliven a cheerful script by John Hughes, many having to do with the lights going up all over the housetop and walls as our hero prepares to illuminate the neighborhood with lights and music. Naturally, almost every attempt fails until someone accidentally turns on the main switch.Funniest moments come after the arrival of Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) who really gets into the spirit of the farce with an engaging hillbilly performance as the head of a family of rednecks. Doris Roberts and E.G. Marshall add their own bits of amusement and a senile granny, played by the woman who voiced Betty Boop, offers her own brand of clownish behavior.Summing up: Could have been better, but brightens the holiday mood with some shenanigans about eccentric relatives that just about anyone can relate to.Chevy Chase, as the fumbling and enthusiastic do-gooder, takes the Scrooge out of Christmas with some very entertaining, if somewhat improbable over-the-top antics and Beverly D'Angelo is charming and patient as his long-suffering wife.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
19,Bunuel1976,"NATIONAL LAMPOON'S Christmas VACATION (Jeremiah S. Chechik, 1989) **1/2",6,3 January 2008,"Maybe it was because I wasn't too much in the mood for this one (my mother had just broken a leg a couple of hours earlier) or perhaps because I was watching it in the wee hours of the morning, or else the fact that I found it too engrossed in the typical American working-man's preoccupationsbut, the point, is that this would-be modern Christmas comedy classic seemed to me to be little more than a mildly amusing affair. Having said that, this is only the second NATIONAL LAMPOON film I've watched – after the similarly overrated ANIMAL HOUSE (1978) – and the film itself is the third VACATION with Chevy Chase and Beverly D' Angelo playing the Griswolds.The film starts amiably enough with the amusing animated opening credits, the car chase and tree cutting sequences but slowly starts going downhill once the other members of the family come into the picture. Apart from the fact that it seemed exaggerated to me to have relatives calling at the house for the Christmas dinner from a couple of weeks earlier, Chevy's ""losing it completely"" antics after not getting his all-important (why?) Christmas bonus were pretty over-the-top as well. The ultra-illuminated house gag also outstayed its welcome as did Randy Quaid's rude Cousin Eddiealthough the fried cat bit was funny, as were the perennially ill-fated neighbors. Even so, the supporting cast is surprisingly good: Juliette Lewis (as the Griswold's daughter), John Randolph and Diane Ladd (as the elder Griswolds), E.G.

Who would not prefer Juliette Lewis over Dana Hill for the part of Audrey?It seems that writer John Hughes entered a more physical comedy stage of his career that we'd see in ""Uncle Buck"" and the two ""Home Alones."" I guess watching ""Christmas Vacation"" after the three aforementioned movies made ""Christmas Vacation"" somewhat hohum.Instead of being on the road making a fool of himself and screwing things up, Clark is at home doing that. To be fair, he did have the help of his off kilter family, but Clark is still the sultan of screw-ups. There were some laughs to be had though I felt like I'd seen much of the material before.

Clark, however, is determined to make things work and for starters he heads out into the country with his wife and two children to find the perfect Christmas tree. After trekking quite a bit in the snow they finally come upon a gigantic one only to discover that they forgot to bring an axe with them. On a similar note, even though Ellen tells him that the tree is much too big to fit in the house Clark sloughs off her remark and after uprooting it eventually manages to bring it home where, sure enough, it doesn't fit in the house. Things then quickly go downhill once both sets of parents arrive-along with various other family members who show up unannounced. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that-like the other two films that preceded it-this picture had some good moments here and there and was fairly entertaining.

23,anaconda-40658,Good Ole Fashion Family Christmas!,8,16 February 2016,"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989): Dir: Jeremiah Chechik / Cast: Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid, William Hickey, Brian Doyle-Murray: The third in the hilarious comedy franchise contains an exaggerated yet modern theme, which viewers may relate. Clark W. Griswold desires a holiday Christmas at home with extended family but everything goes wrong. Chevy Chase delivers several great physical jokes including a sled race that goes beyond fast. As Clark he awaits his bonus so to surprise the family with a swimming pool. He goes beyond standard family procedure especially when lighting the house. Beverly D'Angelo returns as his loyal and sensible wife Ellen who tries to make sense of Clark's mishaps. Randy Quaid steals every scene he is in as redneck cousin Eddie who arrives in a beat up R.V, and delivers some of the best lines. One element of concern is too many characters to really advance although William Hickey as Uncle Lewis is a steal when he accidentally burns down the tree. Everyone else is a role call of great talent with a few lines and moments but little development. Not for children due to adult humour including a controversial scene involving an electrocuted cat. This film is filled with great moments and non stop laughs while presenting a sense of normality within its setting. The result is a grand way to spend the holidays. Score: 8 ½ / 10",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
24,FlashCallahan,Eat my rubber.....,9,8 December 2012,"It's Christmas time - Clark decides to invite all the family to have 'the most fun-filled old- fashioned family Christmas', which nobody shall ever forget. When the first relatives arrive, Clark soon flees on the roof to rig the lighting. The one thing the loving father wants to surprise the whole family with is the installation of a pool, which he already ordered. Unfortunately, the bonus cheque Clark expects any minute is overdue - and tempers rise, but not only because of the cheque. A big event is the arrival of uninvited cousin Eddie with his family in their mobile home, as well as a little sledding afternoon with a new lubricant from Clark's company, or his shifting relationship with the very hip and clean neighbours. Cousin Eddie chooses to top off all presents with his very own special creation, only intending to deliver a real reason to be jolly......After nearly 23 years, this is one of the last 'traditional Christmas films' released, before we had a slew of self referential and ironic, Christmas movies.It's also easily the best Vacation movie, and in my opinion, Chases finest movie. It's hilarious and also one of the very few films that actually gives you a Christmas fuzzy feeling inside.Plot wise, there is no plot, it's just basically a series of sketches that build up to a family dinner, with a subplot of a bonus cheque waiting to arrive.The cast are great, and although it has a very eighties feel to it, it still feels very fresh when you watch it year after year, and it never gets boring.See it, and get that warm feeling inside every single time.A true Christmas classic.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
25,Aaron1375,"Funny xmas movie featuring the Griswolds...however, it gets to sentimental at times.",7,30 November 2008,"Just because it is a Christmas movie I am afraid they do go a bit heavy at times on the sentimental stuff. The movie has the Griswolds, not going on a family trip of any kind, but rather having a nice family vacation right in their own home. You know the type, the one where everyone comes together to celebrate the xmas season together as the parents of both spouses are there. You know the type, hell in your house type scenario. Why anyone would subject themselves to the kind of torture that can only come from having as many family members under one roof is beyond me. We also know the Griswolds do not have the best track record when it comes to planning that perfect vacation. Not only do they have trouble getting a tree right from the get go they also have pandemonium when the in-laws arrive. Clark has run ins with his yuppie neighbors, of course he would be living by people like this. It always seems people who like to decorate their house get stuck by the ones who like the minimal xmas and vice versa and boy does Clark believe in a lot of lights. Of course, once he gets them all put up there is a bit of a trick to getting them on. Then guess who stops by, but the relatives that are not invited in the form of good ol cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid stealing the show a bit in this one). So there you have it, a more realistic movie than European to be sure, but I still liked it a bit better and of this one the first one and European I like this one the least. Never saw Vegas, from the previews it did not look all that good to me. However, this one is still funny and even though I consider it the weakest it is actually rather strong for a xmas movie.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

Anyway, this film is great about Clark's ideal Christmas holiday with the family around. The only problem is that nothing ever goes right for him just like his vacations. Anyway, a great cast including Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo as the Griswolds. The kids are played by Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki. THe visiting family members are played by Doris Roberts, John Randolph, Diane Ladd, and E.G. Marshall. You can't forget Cousin Eddie played by Randy Quaid and his wife Kathryn played by Miriam Flynn. The film is always a treat around the Holiday season. It reminds us that no family is perfect and problems often arise. As John Randolph's character, Mr. Griswold replies ""I had help from Jack Daniels."" Of course, I can't forget Julia Louis-Dreyfus playing the snobby yuppie neighbor. I also liked watching Bill Hickey and Mae Questal as the older family relatives who come on Christmas Eve. It's always worth the laughs.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
27,Mr-Fusion,"As Christmas ""classics"" go, I'll take a pass on this one.",5,17 December 2015,"""Christmas Vacation"" hasn't fared all that well in the intervening years. It's the sort of movie you take to as a kid when you hear your dad howling at almost every turn. But it took a hefty 40 minutes of running time for Randy Quaid to mosey in and finally get the ball rolling. ""Stole the show"" is an understatement; he's the reason to sit though this.As a ""Vacation"" entry, it follows the formula to a T: Chevy Chase gets the ideal Christmas into his head, puts himself through hell getting it with a series of destructively poor decisions, sentimental lessons are learned. But the jokes are painfully forced. Cousin Eddie and Clark losing it are both peaks, but it's mostly valleys; gags that are obvious and still lack the satisfying dividends.I'm onboard with most of the holiday classics, but this is one that loses me.5/10",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
28,SimonJack,The most laughs of any holiday movie,10,1 February 2015,"Going back to the 1930s, Hollywood has produced some very good humorous holiday films. National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation has more laughs than any that I have seen. Year after year, this movie continues to regale me over the holidays. Come Thanksgiving each year, I start checking my DVD list and begin playing my favorite holiday flicks. I like to save Christmas Vacation until close to Christmas. After my children and their families have finished most of the hectic shopping for Christmas, this is a good film to sit down to for some laughs. This is an adult film – in much of the humor and some of the language and actions. We will show it to kids when they reach their teens, with explanations and reminders about foul language or disrespectful parts. There is a genius in the writing of this film that combines occasional witty dialog with side talking built around slapstick and other situations. The situations and characters are sources of many laughs. It's all built around Clark Griswold, played to perfection by Chevy Chase. This is one of those rare original films that makes a hit and lasts so long that no one would think to try to do a remake. Indeed, who could equal or top the humor of this story as given us by this great cast? I can't imagine Clark Griswold as anyone other than Chevy Chase. Or Eddie played by anyone other than Randy Quaid. Or even the yuppie neighbors, Todd and Margo as played by Nicholas Guest and Julia Louis- Dreyfus, respectively. All the cast contribute to the humor, but it all revolves around Clark Griswold. This is a wonderful laugh-out-loud comedy that never seems to wear out. Of course it might if one were to play it incessantly during the year, instead of holding it for the holidays.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

31,Smells_Like_Cheese,Merrry Christmas from Chevy Chase!,10,19 January 2004,"I don't know how anyone could ever go in life without seeing Christmas Vacation, it's one of the necessary movies you have to watch during the holidays. The reason being is that everyone can relate to this movie in one way or another. Who hasn't had their crazy family over during the holiday season? Well, that's Christmas Vacation, one of the funniest movies you will ever see. You think that Vacation topped it off with the laughs, believe me when I say that you've seen nothing yet. With an all star cast that clicked so well, you couldn't go wrong going on a great Christmas Vacation with the Griswolds.Clark Griswold has really got the Christmas spirit this year, and his wife Ellen, son Rusty, and daughter Audrey have noticed that. Clark has invited Ellen's parents Art and Francis Smith, his own parents Clark and Nora Griswold, and his Aunt Bethany and Uncle Lewis to spend the holidays at the Griswold house in Chicago. But in spite of all the good intentions and careful planning, Christmas plans start to go awry: crazy squirrels, SWAT teams, burning Christmas trees, an over cooked turkey and of course a visit from the world's favorite white trash with a heart of gold Cousin Eddie! A Christmas ride not to be missed with the Griswold family.One of the things I just adore about this movie is the little touches they put in the film: the grandparents falling asleep to an old Christmas movie playing on TV, the anxiety you feel as the doorbell rings knowing who's going to be behind it, and the little awkwardness during dinner when you hear everyone chewing their food. Chevy Chase is still such a pervert of course going for the hot sales lady instead of Cristy Brinkley this time, but you can't help but love and laugh at his fantasy in the back yard while the whole family is swimming in his most wanted work bonus: a family sized pool. He maybe a crazy pervert at times, but you feel the love he has for his family and how badly he wants Christmas to be perfect.There are some great laughs in this movie: a squirrel gets caught in the Christmas tree that Clark brings in and it attacks the family and neighbors! Clark gets upset that there is no Christmas bonus so his cousin Eddie kidnaps Clark's boss, wraps him in a bow and gives him to Clark so he could kick him in the butt! A cat chews on the Christmas lights and gets electrocuted under the chair. But if you also get past all the slap stick humor, you still feel the Christmas message at the end, that despite all the craziness that comes around Christmas, don't forget what it's really about: peace and love. A wonderful ending and a perfect movie for Christmas that I watch every year, Christmas Vacation is definitely in Santa's movie collection somewhere.10/10",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
32,blanbrn,One of the best Christmas movies of all-time. Enjoyable and full of laughs!,9,13 December 2006,"""Christmas Vacation"" has became a classic over the years, and I've liked it since I saw it! This film is a must see during the holiday season, the laughs just get you into the spirit of Christmas so much! You again have the comedy legend himself Chevy Chase returning for a third round in the Lampoon Vacation series, this time the theme is Christmas. As anybody knows when you have a Hughes film and another vacation film with Chase you will have plenty of slapstick comedy and laughs! Clark Griswold(Chevy Chase) vows his clan will enjoy the most fun-filled family Christmas ever! So oh boy get ready for the crazy mishaps, just scene after scene is hilarious, some of my favorites are when Clark gets tongue-tied in the shopping mall at a lingerie counter in front of that sexy female clerk! Also inside the home once the family gathers around the crazy scene of 25,000 lights on the roof. The family Christmas eve dinner is just a mess from an exploding turkey to cat food mixed in the jello! The living room and the Christmas tree don't have any better luck either, as the family experiences capital punishment on a cat, and a forest fire on a Christmas tree! A merry and jolly supporting cast make this film enjoyable also as Beverly D' Angelo is back as Clark's cool wife and Juliette Lewis is adorable as Clark's teen daughter. The rest of the family clan is played perfect by veterans like John Randolph, E.G. Marshall and William Hickey who all in my mind are legends. Just to mention crazy country cousin Eddie returns and he's around for the holiday as always this character is played just fine by Randy Quaid. Before her big fame, Julia Louis-Dreyfus has a small part as Clark's snobbish sexy black bra wearing next door neighbor! Overall this film is a script full of wit, and fine moments just like when Clark has memories watching old holiday films in the attic! Mainly the sheer goofiness makes people love this at Christmas time. This is one of the best Christmas films around, and this is my mother's favorite Christmas movie too, this is a must watch every Christmas.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
33,MovieAddict2016,"""Overall, 'Christmas Vacation' establishes itself as one of the best Christmas films to emerge out of Tinseltown in the last twenty years, along with 'Home Alone' and 'Gremlins'""",10,23 February 2003,"National Lampoon's Christmas VacationIn this third installment of the widely successful and popular `Vacation' franchise, Chevy Chase returns to his role of Clark Griswold, along with Beverly D'Angelo as his wife Ellen. Also along for the ride is Randy Quaid, reprising his role as Uncle Eddie from the first film.`Christmas Vacation' doesn't really take the same formula as the first `Vacation' film, but it certainly is as funny. What I mean when I say, `The formula isn't the same,' is that the original film was about a family taking a road trip across America; the humor was restricted to jokes regarding road travel. The second film did the same, but became tiresome after a while.Now, `Christmas' works in the restraints of not a road travel comedy, but of a Christmas comedy: the family coming, the frustrations and aggravations ofChristmas! But also, the film captures the pure joy of Christmas at the same time, as the first film did with traveling.Perhaps the fact that John Hughes, writer of `Vacation,' wrote this film; I feel he did so because he wanted to get the series back on track after the first sequel. In an interview once, James Cameron said of `Terminator 2': `I knew the sequel would be made; I wanted to carry it on in the right direction and not let it stray from the right path' or something vaguely familiar to that. I feel that is what John Hughes did with this film. I think, in his mind, he thought this would be the last sequel, and he wanted to end it with a bang. Of course, almost a decade later in 1997, audiences were introduced to `Vegas Vacation,' which is, in my opinion, an underrated comedy, but I'll get into that in my next `Vacation' review.Clark Griswold has finally settled in for a peaceful Christmas with his family, including children Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki). The family is coming, including Clark Wilhelm Griswold, Sr. (John Randolph), Nora Griswold (Diane Ladd), Art (E.G. Marshall), and Doris Roberts as loudmouth Frances.Only this year, Clark has made sure that EVERYTHING will go as planned. Unfortunately for him, and fortunately for us (very much so!), Clark's planning will be to no avail, as everything, much the same in the previous films, will go to pieces and this Christmas will be just as crazy as the Christmases before.Chevy Chase found his roots in the `Vacation' films; I really do not enjoy him as a regular actor/comedian, but he is perfect as Clark Griswold. He is extremely gung-ho, and has all these crazy notions and the idea of an absolute perfect vacation built up in his head, and it is more than enjoyable as we watch them wither away while he loses his cool.
Beverly D'Angelo is, as I said in my review on the first film, surprisingly convincing as a housewife. I would never expect for her to work as an average mother, but behold, she does.The kids in this new movie are good. They may not be as great as Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron were, but their attitudes fit the characters for THIS script much better: Audrey has a bigger attitude and Rusty is younger and more innocent.And in this movie, the filmmakers return to what helped make the first movie so good: Cousin Eddie. I think his lack of presence in the second film really harmed its reputation, but this film brings him back in a hilarious introduction sequence outside the house (`Eddie?!).All in all, the film has some excellent gags and parodies the Christmas season we all go through very, very well. While I don't think it is quite as good as the first `Vacation' movie, it is almost as good. The reason it's hard to evaluate in comparison is because it is so different from the original; the formula as I said before is entirely different.
In fact, director Jeremiah S. Chechik seems to give the film an entirely different overtone. The first film had an orange tint to it, in a way, because it took place in summer and the Griswold family drove through some very dry areas. In this movie, it is Christmas, and the cinematography isbleaker? Weighed down? Darker? Not in a bad way, in a good way. It suits the film. But all these little tidbits make it harder to efficiently compare the two films together because they are so different.Overall, `Christmas Vacation' establishes itself as one of the best Christmas films to emerge out of Tinseltown in the last twenty years, along with `Home Alone.' It just parodies the season we all love so well, that it has become, for me, a Christmas tradition. I watch it at LEAST once a year around Christmas, but usually five, six, maybe seven times a year. Sometime I'm going to have to buy it on DVD and stop watching a taped NBC broadcast of the film.`Christmas Vacation' gets 4.5/5 stars from me  it's a great satire.John Ulmer",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

36,OllieSuave-007,Tis the season with lots of laughs!,7,20 August 2014,"This is one of the handful of comedies I remembered watching when I was a kid. National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a Christmas comedy featuring the Griswolds trying to celebrate the holiday at their home with a joyous family get-together, but they only run into bad luck and disastrous events one after the other.This movie is one with some feel-good holiday cheer and laugh-out-loud humor. You will get dry absurdity and slapstick comic relief all bundled in one big laugh fest, including the hilarious mishaps when the family attempts to put up the huge Christmas tree in their living room to the Christmas lights decoration debacle. The filmmakers could have, though, lighten on the crude innuendos, which I think are out of place for a holiday movie.Overall, it is a somewhat fun story full of hilarious surprises and off-the-chart characters, with a touch of dramatic moments and complete absurdity. It's not a film for everybody of all ages at your own Christmas get-together, but one to watch along or with a few friends if you need some cheering up.

37,sddavis63,"My Favourite ""Vacation"" Movie And One Of My Favourite Christmas Movies",8,1 December 2011,"It may well be because going to see this movie at a theatre in the east end of Toronto was the first date that I ever went on with my now wife of over 20 years, but National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation will always own a piece of my heart! I have watched this many, many times since that first date - I wouldn't say every Christmas season, but probably most - and it never, ever gets stale. Even though there are parts of the dialogue I now know off by heart it still makes me laugh. Chevy Chase was born to play Clark Griswold. He's had the character nailed perfectly since his first appearance, and this is no exception. Clark is such a lovable guy. He's kind of irritating, he's a bit clumsy, he overdoes everything and he grumbles (and sometimes worse) a lot of the time, but he's a good guy. That side of him really comes out in this movie. Clark might grumble, but he loves having the family around him - even cousin Eddie (who thankfully returns after being absent from European Vacation) although he likely wouldn't admit it. He not only loves having his family around him, he loves his family - all of them. It's a simple scene, like the one in which he has his heart to heart chat with Eddie's little girl Ruby Sue about Santa Claus, that shows that off. He might look put off when Eddie goes overboard with his requests for Christmas presents after Clark tells him he'll buy them for him since Eddie has no money, but you know he doesn't really mind doing it. I like Clark. I'd be buddies with Clark.There's so much going on in this movie that works so well. The chaotic family gathering is really nothing more than a deliberate exaggeration of the experience so many people have in getting their families (in all their diversity) together for the holidays - which means that in a bizarre sort of way it's pretty easy to relate to. Then there's Clark's struggles with getting the 25,000 lights he's decorated his house with to turn on; the understandable frustrations of the neighbours in having to deal with this insane family living next door; the wild sled ride. And there's the cat. Oh the cat. The poor, poor cat! It's funny.Strangely, the weakest parts to this for me at least were the beginning and the end. Both seemed to go a little overboard. The battle with the truck driver at the beginning of the movie as the Griswold's were heading out to get their Christmas tree really doesn't grab me - in fact it comes across as silly (and not in a good way) - and the end, where cousin Eddie kidnaps Clark's boss and brings him back to the house just seemed too much. But everything in between is astonishingly funny and well done. (8/10)",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
38,thesar-2,National Lampoon's Staycation,6,25 December 2012,"First, they went cross-country to Magic Mountain, er Walley World. Next, Europe. What's to top that for the Griswold's? Why, they stay home, of course.I don't wish to sound negative upfront, but National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation really didn't hold up for me today. I LOVED this movie as a kid – I did watch it repeatedly back then, but after a nearly 15 year hiatus of not seeing it, it felt really dated to me.That said, I still laughed, admired the cartoonish feel they gave to these live-action characters and the scenes of genuine heart. I would still recommend it, especially for fans of Clark Griswold and his crazy antics and it still remains as my favorite Vacation movie.I'm not 100% sure there really is a plot here, but the premise is Clark and Co. are determined to have a true family Christmas, but are consistently sidetracked with annoying relatives, angry neighbors, mischievous animals and a stereotypical Hollywood ""Christmas boss.""Despite the lack of any real script, the movie does have focus and a lot of fun. It's slapstick and silly and actually tugs at your heart at times. It's not a movie to take seriously and if you just sit back and enjoy, you'll really have a good time.Side Note and Spoiler – skip this paragraph if you have not seen it: Maybe I noticed this before, but I really don't recall: how they ended the movie without even making it to Christmas Day was thoroughly disappointing. It was as if they knew the movie was running too long, and it was, and cut it short of the actual day the movie's based on. And titled as such. Sad.Side Note II: I also might not have noticed this before, but the boy who replaced the boy who replaced the original Griswold son, Rusty, was played by long time crush of mine: (just one-year-younger than me) Johnny Galecki. It was truly weird seeing someone that I've grown to like a lot since I've last see this film, as a freaking boy. Thankfully, that's not how I remember him these days.Side Note III: Speaking of the children, since this movie was released, I have been all-but 100% against seeing Juliette Lewis. I cannot stand her. Even though she plays an integral part, mercifully, she's hardly in this. In fact, Rusty, or Galecki, has more screen time. Perhaps because both his character and lines were a lot funnier.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

But even outside of that this is a very funny movie, as a well-meaning but fairly deluded father puts his children through hell to create a perfect family Christmas with a big tree, a bazillion lights, and goodwill for all, and winds up with electric shocks, a white trash trailer, and vicious squirrels. Chevy Chase shows off a lot of his SNL physical comedy skills as the father, and the rest of the cast is solid, with a notable performance by the original voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl as a hilariously befuddled relative.Even though this is very slapsticky, it still offers the sort of sentimentality required of any Christmas film, giving an underlying sweetness to the movie even as it spreads mayhem and madness.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
40,Robert_duder,One of the funniest adult comedies ever made...and a Christmas tradition!!,9,21 January 2012,"Adult comedies have changed a lot. Now you're bombarded with the all out R rated horrifying dirty comedies of nowadays. Not all of them are bad if you like that gross out comedy style. But back in the 80's, even the late 80's, adult comedy was a whole different ball game and the National Lampoon Vacation Movies pioneered many of those laughs. Christmas Vacation is definitely unique because I don't believe there were a lot of adult oriented Christmas movies out there. And no matter what anyone else says this an adult comedy. It has bad language, sexual connotations, and just general a lot of adult humour. But it works so well and this film is downright hilarious. The script is just incredibly clever and the film makers let Chevy Chase do exactly what he does best and delivers the dialogue like a comedy legend. The cast works so well together and its such an ensemble cast of wacky and zany characters and you can't help but fall in love with the entire Griswold family. Its a laugh out loud, slapstick, comedy classic.This was Chevy Chase at his best. Even now years later if you see him on Community he still delivers that awkward, gangly everyman type character that delivers outstanding one liners and hilarious dialogue. Clark Griswold is perfect and no one could do that role like Chase. You just love this guy no matter what through all his mistakes and stupid follies. I always thought that Beverly D'Angelo had a strange chemistry with Chevy Chase, they seem like polar opposites but yet their chemistry has always worked for the Vacation movies and still works perfectly in this one. She's definitely the straight man to the entire film and doesn't get a lot of the gags but she is Chevy Chase's perfect partner. Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki are the Griswold children this time around and they are good and they fulfil their duties appropriately but neither one really stand out. One of the legendary performances in this film is that by Randy Quaid as the infamous Cousin Eddie. Quaid is downright brilliant as the white trash trailer park Cousin with a big heart but no brains. Him and Chase are brilliant together and you can't help but howl at his misfortunes and stupid blunders. The supporting cast are one of the best ensembles in movie history, all bringing about some of the best laughs ever. William Hickey, Mae Questel, Doris Roberts, John Randolph, and Miriam Flynn are a few of the truly stand out performances in supporting roles. Also deserving of mentioning is Brian Doyle-Murray in a small role as Chase's money hungry boss. Two performances that are wasted and pointless are that of Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Nicholas Guest as the annoyed neighbours. There is no purpose to them in the film and they are just more annoying than anything.The film makers, led by Canadian director Jeremiah Chechik, packed so much into this movie and yet it doesn't feel crowded. It feels like the perfect Holiday slapstick comedy. You feel like you become one of the Griswold's and partake in every moment of their insane holiday. Ridiculous physical comedy, hilarious chemistry between the cast makes this an absolute must see every Holiday season or even any time. This was director Chechik's debut and its easy to see why he's worked steadily in Hollywood since then, even in Television because he clearly has an eye for making a film feel right, pacing it right, and letting the actors do what they do best. This will make you fall in love with the Griswold's and see the whole series again and again! 9/10",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
41,Lejink,Cold Christmas,3,24 December 2009,"A friend of mine called Willie swears this is one of the best, if not THE best Christmas movie ever and gave me his treasured DVD from off his shelf so that I too could share in the fun. However, given that his musical taste runs only as far as Shaking' Stevens and Five Star (in other words naff 80's music), I wasn't hopeful sitting down to watch it on a cold, snowy-outside pre-Christmas night (i.e. everything in its favour!).Having said that, my wife, who loves TV shows like ""You've Been Framed"" featuring the public falling down a lot, laughed quite a lot, but that too is no recommendation. I appreciate that it probably struck and continues to strike a chord with the American public, where massive family re-unions on Christmas Day with the house done up like the Blackpool or Vegas Illuminations are de rigeur (although the latter practice is certainly growing in the UK), but for me, who's never really latched onto the National Lampoon type of humour, I was left colder than a penguin.Chevy Chase does his best with his portrayal of Everyman USA, hoping for his big Christmas bonus from his employer, fantasising about younger women and trying to please everyone in the family, even the black sheep (although in this family, some are blacker than others!) but despite many pratfalls, explosions and embarrassing moments, my funny bone resolutely refused to be tickled.Not much more to say really, other than I'll be watching ""White Christmas"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life"" over the next two days, where I know I will be transported into the world of Christmas, but this particular damp squib, I'll leave to the very young, very American and Willie.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
42,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Staycation.,5,28 December 2020,"Essentially, 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989)' is a series of skits surrounding a Christmas-time family get-together that just keeps going wrong. There's a loose plot but not all that much of a narrative, with most sequences seeming like they could work entirely in isolation. The most major problem with the picture is that it just isn't funny. Don't get me wrong, it isn't exactly 'unfunny' either - I mean, it doesn't make you cringe with its humour or anything like that. It just isn't as successful as it perhaps ought to have been when it comes to the laugh department. It's a passively entertaining experience, the sort of thing that just unfolds before your eyes and doesn't require much thought. It isn't engaging, but it also isn't boring. It's absolutely fine. That's all there is to say about it. 5/10",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
43,bowmanblue,Still as much fun,8,22 December 2017,"I remember renting 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' from a video store back in the late eighties and again in the early nineties (until I figured it was simply more convenient and cost effective to buy a VHS copy and watch it whenever I want). I was young at the time and clearly loved its slightly dumb, cheesy humour (plus I was a fan of the two previous 'Vacation' films, but you don't actually have to have watched either of those to watch this one - you'll just not be one of us who get confused at the repeated new casting of the kids, Audrey and Rusty). However, for some reason, the film didn't survive my eventual binning of my tapes and buying everything again on DVD. Therefore, I was delighted when a popular online streaming service put it on their schedule in time for the festive season.It was only now did I realise how much I must have watched it back when I was young, as I knew the script practically word for word. So, in short, I still loved it and was in nostalgia heaven. And I could almost leave the review there if it wasn't for the fact that I was watching it now with my girlfriend who had never seen it before in her life. She hated it.Therefore, I was sort of forced to re-evaluate it and, although I maintain my love for it, try to see what some people may find wrong with it. Yes, the jokes are dumb. It's sort of like the 'American Pie' of its generation. It's definitely not high-brown entertainment and you have to accept that you're going to be watching a buffoon at work when it comes to the central character, played by Chevy Chase, Clark Griswold. I guess it could be said that some people may simply find him too annoying and stupid to root for.I suppose a few of the gags do fall a little flat and just as many are predictable, but then by now most adults will have seen so many comedy films by now that they can see 'old humour' coming a mile off. There was actually more profanity in this than I remember, including one 'F-bomb' which does mean that the film may be more unsuitable for 'all' the family than I remember.I suppose it's quite tame and, because of its age, has a feeling of being done before. However, I still maintain that, overall, it's stood the test of time reasonably well and should still pick up a few new fans here and there (especially in terms of good/funny Christmas movies). You'll definitely get more out of it if, like me, you have nostalgia on your side, but even my girlfriend had to admit that Randy Quaid was a joy to watch. Although, she still maintained that the (seldom-used) neighbours got all of the best gags!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

46,CuriosityKilledShawn,Best Vaction/Christmas Movie,10,14 November 2000,"Poor Clark Griswold, no matter how optimistic he is, his family vacations always seem to go severely wrong. First time around he went across America in a metallic pea Station Wagon and it ended in disaster. Then they went across Europe and met similar, albeit much less funny, results.For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Griswolds, Clark is food additives expert who works for a company that doesn't appreciate him. He sets high standards for holiday events that no one can live up to and is notorious for dragging his grudging family along on every painstaking detail of every scheme. His wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) is the voice of reason, who keeps the family rooted in reality and responds with frequent deadpan bewilderment to his constant disasters. The long-suffering kids, Russ and Audrey (Johnny Galecki and a very young Juliette Lewis) have turned into the living embodiment of pure cynicism, but there's no talking any sense into Clark Griswold. Ever! But now Clark just wants to stay at home in the snowy Chicago suburbs for a 'fun, old-fashioned, family Christmas' and he's going to let nothing stop him. His enthusiasm for the holidays manages to infect the audience and you'll be rooting for him the whole way. He's an anti-Scrooge and if you're having a Christmas crisis then you need to watch this movie. Any disasters can be overcome.But that's easier said than done. He didn't bargain on bickering family members (including the voice of Betty Boop, Mae Questel, as a senile old aunt), a house covered in non-working Christmas lights, a seriously over-cooked turkey, snotty Yuppie neighbors making fun of him or Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and his hickabilly family turning up unannounced to sponge some Christmas cheer off him.What stops it from being just another generic Christmas movie is a brilliant script by John Hughes packed full of hilarious set-pieces and perfect comic timing from Chevy Chase. He's a great actor but his appeal sadly declined in the 90s when he refused to evolve into more serious roles like Bill Murray did. Clark Griswold and Fletch are probably his most famous roles and this Vacation is definitely one you need to take.It's hard to pick the best moments but Randy Quaid's sudden appearance will make you grin a mile wide, a cat wrapped up in a box (with Happy Birthday paper!) that meets an unfortunate end and 'an asshole in his bathrobe emptying a chemical toilet into the sewer' are just plain brilliant. But what gives Christmas Vacation something more that makes it so much more special that all the other Christmas movies is that wonderful theme song! It's absolutely brilliant! But that ain't the only great tune the film as to offer. There are also some classic songs by Ray Charles, Bing Crosby and Gene Autry.Although not the best of the bunch (Harold Ramis' direction had an evil edge to the first film that made it just that little bit better), this film has become a Yuletide classic and must be watched every year. Since Christmas is full of annual traditions this film is definitely one you should add to the list. It would criminal to give it anything less that the highly coveted 10/10.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
47,ironhorse_iv,National Lampoon: Christmas Vacation will give you the hap-hap-happies Christmas ever! Great watch!,8,29 December 2014,"Where do you think you're going? Nobody's leaving. Nobody's walking out on this fun, old-fashioned family Christmas. No, no. We're all in this together. This is a full-blown, four-alarm holiday emergency here. We're gonna press on, and we're gonna have the hap, hap, happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap-danced with Danny f*cking Kaye. And when Santa squeezes his fat white ass down that chimney tonight, he's gonna find the jolliest bunch of assholes this side of the nuthouse. We're going to have the hap-hap-happiest Christmas ever! It's that time of year again! You can't celebrate Christmas without watching National Lampoon Christmas Vacation, first! Directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. It is the third installment in National Lampoon's Vacation film series, and was written by John Hughes, based on his short story in National Lampoon magazine, ""Christmas '59"". This movie is notable for being the only one of the Vacation series to take place at the Griswold home which gives the vacation concept, something new. Some people think as this movie as a reboot than a sequel. The film tells the story of Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) whom is trying to create the best Christmas for his family, but everything, he wants to happen, go against his favor. Can Clark Griswold make the best Christmas holiday for his family or will it turn out to be another disaster? Watch it, to find out. Without spoiling the film, too much. The movie is a great watch. Most of the humors hit the funny bone than miss to me. I love the animated opening credits with the Christmas vacation theme. Apparently even Santa Claus isn't immune to the comic misfortune. I love the slapstick humor has for Clark. Clark trying to set up Christmas lightings is probably the highlight of the film. The movie was very smart in its recycle on old jokes like the Easter eggs, Wally World Cups. Still, other old clichés felt a little overused by other films at the time such as the dog humping scene. Even, Mele Kalikimaka pool sequence was kinda overused. It remind me, of the pool sequence from 1982's Fast Time at Ridgemont High. It wasn't really funny. The fan service, Mary's (Nicolette Scorsese) scenes are hot, but it could be taken out, in my opinion as it has nothing to bring to the table. She's no Christie Brinkley. Some people might not like the dark crude raunchy humor, the movie brings. After all, it does have a cat getting killed on screen and an elderly man getting catch on fire. This movie might not be for everybody. If you got small children, this movie might not be for them with all the sex, violence and harsh language themes. A parent should judge for themselves, if this movie is alright for their children. For the most part, it felt like a PG-13. The movie is well acted. The original cast is just as good as they were in the original previous movie. Chevy Chase is awesome as the everyman father, who just wanted to give the best Christmas ever to his family, but has to fight so much to do it. In my opinion, this is Chevy Chase's greatest film. Supporting characters like Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), were alright for the most part, despite her, being the submissive of sorts, type of wife. The children, Aubrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki) were kinda forgettable as they are given little to no screen time. It's seem like in every Vacation movie, new actors are always playing the Griswold's children. It can be a bit confusing as Rusty and Audrey's age differ from film to film. In this film, Audrey tends to be older, despite Rusty being older in the previous two films. Anyways, the previous Griswold's children actors really didn't do much, after their film. At less, these actors went on to become bigger names in the industry. One of the most entertaining part of the film, had to come with Randy Quaid's character of Cousin Eddie who comes back from the original film to plays the opposite of Chevy Chase's straight man character as the scene-stealing slob. He wasn't too annoying or unlikeable. Quaid did the right amount of balance. Other people worth noting is Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the yippie neighbor, Margo Chester, whom always get accident abuse from the Griswold. She was funny. The movie has way too much elder characters to remember. Those could be cut down, or written better. The only ones, I can remember are Francis (Doris Roberts), Bethany (Mae Questel), Lewis (William Hickey) and Art (E.G. Marshall). All of them add their own bits of amusement. Overall: Having seen the previous two films in the Lampoon series. 1983's National Lampoon's Vacation & 1985's National Lampoon's European Vacation. I was delighted, this film was really enjoyable. In my opinion, it's the best comedy in the National Lampoon series as a whole. It was not a disappointment, like the sequel, 2003's Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure & 1997's National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation. Since its release in 1989, Christmas Vacation has often been labeled as a modern Christmas classic. This film should definitely raise your spirits and give thanks that your Christmas isn't as stressful as the Griswold.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

49,zkonedog,The Griswolds Start To Stale,4,5 March 2017,"Despite being a fan of National Lampoon's ""Vacation"" and ""European Vacation"" movies, for whatever reason I had not sat down and watched this Christmas edition of the series. I had expectations for high humor coming into the viewing, but was left with the bad taste of a series starting to turn stale.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase), wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), and kids Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki) hosting ""the relatives"" for Christmas. This obviously includes Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and Co. as well. Per the typical formula, everything goes to hell-in-a-hand-basket despite the best intents of Clark.While the first two Vacation-series movies seem fresh and genuinely funny, ""Christmas Vacation"" seems stale and overbearing (like all the comedy jokes/situations are ""reaches""). Sure, there are some legitimately laugh-out-loud moments in the film, but mostly it falls pretty flat.The main reason for the disappointing effort here is the casting changes. Lewis and Galecki, while both proved afterwards to be pretty fair actors in their own right, are terrible for the roles of Audrey/Rusty (key characters that provide so much of the humor in the earlier films). Maybe it was just the fact that the ""original"" Russ/Audrey can never quite be topped.Thus, while I was hoping for great things from this experience, I can say now that I won't be watching it next Xmas season (or maybe any further out, either). It just fails to capture that quirky sense of humor that its predecessors nailed so succinctly.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
50,johnnyboyz,The film almost succeeds as a non-comedy; but childish humour and all too familiar caricatures hold it back.,6,27 December 2007,"Best Christmas film ever or not, Christmas Vacation does manage to hit some high notes on the odd rare occasion but never elevates itself above any sort of good to great ground but then again, it never really set out to. Christmas Vacation is a film that deals with many a Christmas issues and binds them all together in a reasonably satisfying way even if it feels heavy handed and somewhat juvenile at certain times.At its core, Christmas Vacation is a film that challenges the American idea, or perhaps the Western idea, of what Christmas is. There is nothing religious in this film and if there is any mention of Jesus Christ, the real reason there is a Christmas, then I must've missed it. Clark Griswold (Chase) is an American who has a family; a well paid job and a 'prefect' detached suburban house with a picket fence and a people carrier. For him and his family (who are a little less than perfect) Christmas is everything: he is expected (as the man of the house who puts the turkey on the table) to risk life and limb in order to staple lights to the roof; he is expected to be able to host a huge Christmas day and he is expected to out class the neighbours when it comes to front yard decorations amongst other things.Bizarrely enough, the funniest parts of Christmas Vacation come in the form of its scenes involving animals. When the cat chews the lights under the chair and gets a shock, I laughed likewise when a squirrel gets loose in the house, the initial sighting of the animal is when the joke's at its funniest but this seems to be a concept that had worn thin by the time Schwarzenegger was chased by a Reindeer around his neighbour's house in Jingle All the Way. Christmas Vacation as a film tests that theory that family is the most important thing at Christmas because, when you pick the film apart, the over crowded house full of finicky family members at Christmas is the films overall pitch. Take away the rest of the family and the nasty hillbilly stereotypes that turn up in the form of Eddie (Quaid) and you don't have a film, you have a 'How to have a perfect Western Christmas' demonstration. It's also a shame that pure idiocy spawns most of Christmas Vacation's jokes. Clark sees fit to staple the lights to his house (how will he get them off afterwards?) in an attempt to go to extremes for his family and a mere week long holiday but doesn't take due care and attention. He also attempts to light up the lights in a big unveiling to the whole family but idiotically, doesn't check them beforehand. Again, Clark is willing to go to such a length that he doesn't even want to spoil the surprise of the lights for himself so that he can share the first experience with his entire household. Either that or he's a complete idiot for not checking the plugs.Christmas Vacation isn't pure farce but it isn't too far off. This is one of the film's plus points in the sense it remains sober in its attempt to portray humour which is clearly aimed at children for 80% of the time. Charlie Chaplin in The Gold Rush was in a home of some sort with snow and cold on the outside trying to survive the whole ordeal with two others; Clark is this in a sense. But the similarities continue in the sense of slapstick with Chritsmas Vacation containing some iffy humour in the form of flatulence and downright stupidity which are embedded into this film whereas The Gold Rush used slapstick and genuinely funny situations; probably due to the fact it wasn't aimed at children: Christmas Vacation smashed neighbour's windows; Clark kicks his model reindeer's away as he lashes out at what suburban society demands you have on your lawn; there is a lot of running around once a squirrel gets loose and an insane event which acts as reason to get a SWAT team around. These incidences may humour and entertain children but for the rest of us: come on, are we really finding this funny? The only thing I could really tag onto and smirk at throughout is the way Chevy Chase portrays Clark. His deadpan and downer performance of a man seemingly on the edge of not only his family but his work and his Westernised holiday is a good example of a performance carrying a film. For everyone else, Ellen (D'Angelo) is the submissive of sorts wife; the children are not developed beyond anything they need to be and the rest of the family fill in the blanks with good grounds for argument that there are too many of them. Eddie Johnson's character, like I said, and his family are really bad examples of exploiting a certain race/class/gender/sexuality (delete as appropriate) in a negative and demeaning light; something I'd expect a Disney film to do subconsciously.But then again, the film is cheery and fun in a way. It starts off in a way that is akin to a 'Naked Gun' film and I liked two out of those three films and despite loosing ground on quality at various stages, Christmas Vacation deals with deeper subject matter such as trying to host the perfect American family Christmas and how far one should go to achieve these things. The humour may be lagging behind its pacing and variation of jokes but the film has a charm that, let's face it; is only there thanks to Chase's portrayal of the 'man stuck in a no win situation' character; much like Keaton and much like Chaplin.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

53,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Predictable Christmas hi-jinx that you still have to enjoy,7,14 January 2009,"Normally when you can see a film's jokes coming from a mile away, it tends to take the film down a notch in most people's eyes, but in ""Christmas Vacation,"" the third Vacation film from John Hughes and the National Lampoon's crew, it still finds away of charming your pants off--or on fire.This time the Griswolds in fact are not vacationing, but invite their extended family to spend the week up until Christmas. This time, everything goes awry at their place. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect. Clark (Chase) goes overboard with the Christmas lights to find they don't work and manages to have assorted objects smack him in the face or take him out completely on numerous occasions. The grandparents are completely off their rockers and the kids can't stand it. Then of course what would a family Christmas be without their hick cousins the Johnsons, especially their father figure, Eddie (Randy Quaid) who is more reckless and stupid than ever in effort to push Clark over the brink.80s comedy mastermind Hughes (""The Breakfast Club,"" ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" the other 2 vacation movies) pretty much decided to stuff everything he included in the tons of other comedies he wrote in the decade into this film. It has everything from extreme physical comedy to wacky relatives to animals causing mayhem. That's why it's so predictable, but of course Hughes is also the master of reminding us of our family values and keeping them close (easy enough in a Christmas film). The comedy starts out rusty but once the ball gets rolling ""Christmas Vacation"" gets harder to roll your eyes at. The subtle outlandish humor and hi-jinx win you over every time.Chevy Chase remains the glue of the Vacation films. Every man feels like Clark Griswold at times (trouble at work, extra-marital temptations, putting all their effort into something to fail or be under-appreciated) and every person has or knows a dad like Clark Griswold. He's the epitome of the Hallmark greeting card ""Dad."" Without his ho-hum but quick to heat up personality that Chase nails down, these films wouldn't be as good; it would be harder to get past the predictable slapstick.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
54,southdavid,Brace your elf.,4,26 November 2020,"Get your downvotes ready people, because I don't like this one.With Amazon Prime now cycling on from Halloween Horror films towards Christmas, the irrational rules I set up to decide what I watch meant that reluctantly sat through ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" - a film I might have liked when it was released, as I was nine - but now couldn't wait for the witless, tedious, pratfalls to be over.Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) wants to have the ultimate family Christmas, like the ones he remembers from his youth. Unfortunately, disaster befalls him at every turn as his Christmas tree is too big, his lights won't turn on and his extended family arrive to argue and snipe at him. He's also reliant on an incoming Christmas bonus from his job, which he's already spent on a Swimming pool.I just don't like slapstick comedy that much and that's all ""Christmas Vacation"" is, there's no wit or jokes - there's nothing intelligent about it. It's just Chevy Chase falling over and his grandfather blowing himself up (I swear he does that the same way three times). This even extends to his neighbours (one of whom is played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus!) who must do the worst scene of 'comical' falling over that I've ever seen in my life.It doesn't help that we now know that both the male leads of the film are terrible people in real life. Nor the scenes when Clark lusts after a shop assistant despite already having a wife that is several times out of his league. Ultimately though, I just didn't find it that funny, I say again, it's just falling over and explosions. I'm not going to suggest for a moment that all these people giving the film a good review are wrong but I just wonder if their history with it is clouding their objectivity.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

61,drqshadow-reviews,A Nearly Perfect Blend of Darkly-Humored Sentiment and Christmas-Flavored Sarcasm,9,28 January 2020,"Each of the early Vacation movies nails a certain aspect of middle class family life, be it the cross-country road trip or a rare overseas adventure, and most of their laughs come from the lack of romanticism or glossy, nostalgic veneer. They dig straight into the dirty reality of awkward family dynamics, the unfulfilled promise of adulthood and the emptiness of the American dream; weighty subjects for a comedy, but the results are never all that serious. This time we're home for the holidays, with a busy household of nosy, noisy, overly dramatic relatives, in from out of town for a long, unpleasant visit. A Lampoon stay-cation, in other words, with a whole mess of awful family obligations.John Hughes is in the writer's chair again, delivering his usual high-quality, relatable laughs with just a hint of sentiment. Clearly, he's lived this life and made these mistakes, and with the benefit of hindsight, he's all too happy to share and enjoy with the rest of us. Chevy Chase runs the show on-screen, his stress levels spiked as the maligned, tormented family man who's always on the verge of a nervous breakdown. He's picture perfect as the seemingly-jolly patriarch with a devilish glint in one eye, and his visibly mounting frustrations enhance almost every scene before the inevitable blow-up.Spotted with legendary lines and fantastic scenes, the tale of the Griswolds' latest spectacular misfortune is a rumbling, tumbling wrecking ball of yule-tinted mayhem. A few of the jokes have grown dated (like most of neighboring Julia Louis-Dreyfuss's home décor), but the spirit remains rich and the broad, physical humor is timeless. I know it all by heart and I still laugh until my face hurts.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
62,smatysia,Hasn't aged well.,5,31 May 2011,"I first saw this a long time ago, and liked it a lot. On a recent viewing, I find that it hasn't aged as well as I thought. It was fun to see John Galecki and Juliette Lewis as children, and I had forgotten how pretty Julia Louis-Dreyfus was back then. I got one big laugh-out-loud moment from the whole movie, when the old aunt forgets that she is supposed to say the pre-meal blessing, and starts into the Pledge of Allegiance instead, and the whole family dutifully joins in. Clark Griswold is such a sad sack, and even though I know it is the point of the film, it's still a bit cloying. This is still OK as ""one of the Vacation films"" but if it stood alone, I think it would suffer.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
63,snoozejonc,Fairly strong comedy with Chevy Chase on top form,7,1 January 2021,"Clark Griswold plans an old fashioned family Christmas.I enjoyed this one for it's humour and Chevy Chase's hilarious performance.The story is pretty thin but contains a little nod to Dickens' A Christmas Carol with the Griswolds in place of the Cratchits and Brian Doyle-Murray playing a Scrooge-like Frank Shirley. The main focus is Clark's mission to have a big, joyful family Christmas and everything associated with this that goes spectacularly wrong.As a comedy it is reasonably strong and the jokes come thick and fast. From the start we see Clark's visual buffoonery in a plethora of disastrous actions, decisions and situations. There is a fair bit of slapstick and one-liners that worked well for me. Also the family dynamics involving the children, grandparents and other eccentric relatives are easily recognisable.Christmas Vacation is probably best known for Clark's ridiculously over the top exterior light show that he plasters all over the house. These are the strongest scenes in the movie and Chevy Chase has some of his most memorable moments here.Chase's performance for me is superb. He can make me laugh with facial expressions, physical awkwardness and one-liners. It is him and his characters that carry most of his movies and this is no different. Clark is a control freak who has everything planned out and we have the pleasure of seeing him unravel as the plans backfire. He has good support from Beverly D'Angelo and the remaining cast but it all revolves around him. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has some funny moments as one half of a couple of Yuppie neighbours.My only negatives are that it does contain a few too many recycled concepts from the original Vacation movie for my liking, such as 'the girl', the car-jump, animal death, Clarke's meltdown and heart to heart with a child. Also for me, the comedy dips in quality a bit in the second half, particularly with the protracted squirrel sequence and the repetition of fire/explosion related gags.As 'Christmas movies' go it's pretty good. How many have a cultural impact you can actually see when driving around suburban housing estates after dark during the month of December?",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
64,lukem-52760,ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS CHRISTMAS COMEDY CLASSIC,10,6 December 2020,"CHEVY CHASE IS A COMIC GENIUS & LEGEND OF CINEMA!!!!
Christmas Vacation is my absolute favourite Xmas film as it's beyond hilarious thanks to the GENIUS that is CHEVY CHASE. I grew up watching & loving this Vacation film & of Course i love all the fantastic Vacation films & pretty much all of Chevy's flicks some of my faves of the Comedy legend's are FLETCH, FLETCH LIVES, SPIES LIKE US, THE VACATION FILMS, THREE AMIGOS, MEMOIRS OF AN INVISIBLE MAN, NOTHING BUT TROUBLE & COPS & ROBBERSONS, those are the one's i grew up watching & loving.
Chevy has been a huge part of my movie loving world since little & consider him the best movie Dad character ever with his hilarious but also touching role as Clark Griswold, the guy just wants to have the best time with his family & have as much fun as possible, he's an old fashioned all American Family man & i love him for it.
Christmas Vacation is a masterpiece of Comedy it's truly hilarious from it's Awesome animated opening to it's crazy ending it's a fun filled & hilarious crazy Christmas Comedy that never gets old, i still laugh like i did as a kid watching it.
Christmas Vacation is also a really beautiful film as its drenched in the beautiful look of Christmas with lots of snow & lots & lots of lights lol & there's a real sweet innocence fun to everything & at the heart of all the craziness is a nice Family man trying to have a big old fun family Christmas & he loves his family.Chevy is fantastic here as Clark & is probably the best of the Vacation franchise & really shows why he's one of greatest comic leading men in Cinema history.
Chevy is also a real nice family man in real life too & that makes me respect him & appreciate his films even more!!! Big Nostalgic Love for Chevy Chase, i wish Clark Griswold was my dad.
A total Christmas Classic & Chevy is my favourite actor",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
65,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Demented fun,7,25 December 2015,"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is just as demented as the other Vacation flicks, which in general are pretty weird to begin with. Stemming from Chevy Chase's off kilter personality, into the antics of the rest of the cast, it's a jumble of jokes that don't always land and are somewhat trapped in an 80's humour bubble, but are also frequently hilarious. Chase plays awkward Clark Griswold, overseeing a chaotic holiday celebration at his home with his wife (Beverly D'Angelo) and kids, including a very young Juliette Lewis, as well as his extended clan, headed up by obnoxious, boorish brother Randy Quaid who assists him in his struggles with his selfish boss.

Clark invited his family (Diane Ladd and John Randolph) and his wife's family (E.G. Marshall and Doris Roberts) for Christmas. Clark is hoping to get his big Christmas bonus, so, he can buy an swimming pool for his family. As Christmas comes near, Helen's cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn) and her husband Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) unexpected comes to their home with their two kids (Ellen Hamilton Latzen and Cody Burger) and their dog. Clark's Christmas holiday is suddenly getting bigger and also turning into a mess. Nothing is sane for Clark during his vacation and especially the holidays.Directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik (The Avengers, Benny & Joon, Diabolique ""2006"") made an amusing Christmas movie that is occasionally dark but over two decades, the movie has become an modern holiday classic. Chase is certainly fun to watch in this picture, who does his best to give his family the best Christmas ever but always turns opposite instead. Quaid is great as Cousin Eddie, who steals the show, when he is on-screen.DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an good Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD's only real extra is the decent commentary track by the director, the executive producer:Matty Simmons and cast members:D'Angelo, Quaid, Flynn and Galecki. DVD also includes the original theatrical trailer. ""Christmas Vacation"" does have some clever gags, some real laughs with some cheap jokes but the movie manage to be good-hearted and it is always fun to watch the holidays. Don't miss it.

67,aidanratesmovies,"That movie where they kill a squirrel, a redneck cousin kidnaps a man, and a man has a mid life crisis/mental breakdown",8,8 December 2020,"It's a goofy and rather entertaining little Christmas flick that needs no introduction, not all of it works, but somewhere down the line, this film's peculiar and satirical nature just ends up winning you over someway or another. First off, I want to praise John Hughes for his screenwriting, cause obviously no one but him could have written this film, and make it work as well as it did. That being said, there are a few problems when it comes to gags and delivery of them throughout the film. It isn't to say the gags aren't funny, it just feels like they could have worked a lot better if given a little more time and thought into how they were delivered, but instead a few of them feel kinda rushed. The look of the film isn't anything too special, but many of the physical gags can be quite fun, and perhaps some of the best moments of the film in general. The music is fun and lively, its cast is often electric, with Chevy Chase providing an excellent comedic performance as always. I also rather enjoyed the performances of the two kid actors in the Griswold family, although it can be a bit annoying that they change up the family dynamic so often with these films. In the end, Christmas Vacation did what it promised to do, and that was make me laugh. It's an entertaining and fun little Christmas flick that may just be the best Vacation film since the original.

(spoilers)",9,26 November 2004,"Christmas Vacation is essential holiday viewing, should your holiday traditions include watching a slew of good holiday-themed movies. Add to the list one of National Lampoon's most memorable, if not funniest movie, they have ever added the name to.Join Clark Griswold's quest for a good old-fashioned ""Griswold family Christmas,"" in which, once again, despite his wife's warnings, is another attempt to make the more of a holiday than most think he ought to (see previous Griswold adventures in 'Vacation' and 'European Vacation'). And if you are familiar with these movies, you know that lots of things will go wrong before they finally go right. I think, more than the other Griswold vacation movies, this one was immensely helped by a hilarious supporting cast, including Randy Quaid showing off his great comedic talent as redneck Cousin Eddie (who shows up unexpectedly with his wife, drooling dog, and two kids in their camper), William Hickey who plays grumpy Uncle Lewis (from whom my quote is from), deaf but lovable Aunt Bethany (Mae Questel), and Julia Louise-Dreyfus and Nicholas Guest as the arrogant yuppie neighbors who have plenty of hilarious (and disastrous) run-ins with Clark.

69,TheOneThatYouWanted,Family fun and almost a timeless classic,7,14 January 2017,"This is a fun little holiday classic and maybe the best National Lampoons movie out of the lot. Anyway, it is about a father trying too hard to give his family the perfect Xmas experience but fails miserly at it and many full belly laughs are the result. The film is charming even if it doesn't seem as funny as it was when you were a kid. But whatever, usually Xmas comedies are a fail; Office Xmas Party, I'm looking at you. I hope Hollywood never remakes this.. but I would be surprised if they did remake it just out of spite and to grab people's goats and run them around the mud a bit. You know the score.

70,Sandcooler,"Clark Griswold with a stapler, it can't not be funny",7,25 December 2008,"The plot here is pretty non-existent(Christmas, that's pretty much it), but I think it's fairly smart that they decided to make a ""Vacation"" movie where they just stay home. Gags from around the house, pretty easy but it's entertaining. Chevy Chase on a ladder, Chevy Chase with a chainsaw, Chevy Chase with a squirrel, it's really that sort of thing. There's this beautiful simplicity to a tree breaking through a window. And then when those things can't be milked anymore Cousin Eddie gets his time in the spotlight, he's pretty funny I guess. But what I like most about this movie is that it's Christmas for actual people, they don't ham it up. They don't give any forced moral lessons, they don't tell us what Christmas should be all about(well maybe they kinda do, I just didn't mind), they don't even have a Santa cameo if you can believe it. I was quite surprised by that, I thought they'd screw it up near the ending. This is definitely one of the better ""Vacation"" movies, fun throughout.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
71,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Funniest Christmas movie ever made,10,1 February 2014,"The film has several references to the original National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation: opening scene, with the family singing in the car, is similar to an early scene in the original Vacation; their car flying over snowbank is similar to car flying over roadblock in Arizona in Vacation; another befuddled, elderly aunt drops in, but the movie is good enough that it doesn't become a rehash of the first film.It takes its time getting started; the first thirty minutes are hit and miss, but after that, it gets good, and the final thirty minutes are hilarious.Aunt Bethany is introduced with some funny lines (""Is your house on fire?"" she cheerfully asks upon seeing 25.000 Christmas lights on it) but filmmakers wisely avoided a repeat of Aunt Edna from the original, as this confused granny lives happily through the holiday.Speaking of *holiday*, 'Holiday Road' worked well in the original Vacation, was tired and formulaic in Euro Vacation, and was wisely avoided here, and replaced with a wonderful original score.The music, and the overall tone of the entire film, is sentimental without being overly sappy; Clark watching old home movies of his youth has just the right amount of sentiment, then it was ended perfectly with a well done gag.Uncle Lewis is a delightful Grinch, with his strangled voice and deadpan delivery of lines which could have been painfully unfunny complaints, but his delivery and timing makes them work.The kids are great replacements, upgrades, for the two awful, nitwit kids in Euro Vacation.My favourite film in the National Lampoon's Vacation series, and probably my favourite Christmas movie, also.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

The Dukes of Hazard-style airborne station wagon. The hunt for the perfect Christmas tree. The playboy centerfold salesgirl. Tacky home movies. The obnoxious relatives and upscale neighbors. The turkey, Christmas tree, and cat. (They all explode or catch fire.) Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and ""Snot"" the dog. The absent-minded Aunt. The in-laws. The wild squirrel in the tree.

Well, this one is one of the first Christmas movies I've seen that is hilarious without the overuse of crude humor and it's still just as good now as it would have been in 1989. There is the occasional crude humor joke, but those can be overlooked. Most of the movie's comedy comes from the strange misfortunes of the Griswold family, from a squirrel attack to being trapped in the attic to having Clark (the father)'s redneck cousin Eddie and his inbred family show up in a trailer parked on the front lawn. The cast was an excellent choice and the soundtrack is funny but not annoying.

76,FlushingCaps,"Much to like, some things to dislike",9,12 December 2020,"As I write this after seeing it again last night, there are 347 reviews of this on IMDB, most of which go through a good description of what happened, so I won't duplicate too much of that. My purpose is to discuss scenes I particularly liked, point out some things that weren't so good, and analyze why I think some people disliked it so much.I will say that it's impossible to truly understand other people's reviews, such as when they write: (taken from actual IMDB reviews) ""I never laughed so hard in my life""-as they give that movie a 7, making me wonder if they never saw a film so good they gave it an 8, 9, or 10. Then there's the person who wrote: ""One of the funniest movies I've ever seen, but it's not that great.""? I cannot fathom the thinking there.I somewhat liked Chase's original Vacation flick. Some scenes were quite funny, like when he got rooked on his new auto, or when the thugs stripped his car while cheerily giving him directions, but other scenes were more disturbing than funny-much of the visit with the relatives, including the aunt dying in the car and how they handled that. Overall, I just didn't laugh nearly as much as in Christmas Vacation.There is the matter of foul language. Many writers and comedians these days fail to understand they can be FUNNIER with fewer cuss words, or even none. They seem stuck in the adolescent thinking that it is really funny to hear someone cuss. Not usually.
So I understand that lots of people-young and old-complain about the prevalence of foul language. It would have been better if they had minimized it. The one time, when Clark was ranting on finding out he didn't get his expected Christmas bonus, and he included a cuss word in Danny Kaye's name (referring to a famous Christmas movie) that the word there was appropriate to his frustrated situation and was humorous. Cousin Eddie's use of vulgar words was appropriate for his character, but if he'd been restrained to, let's say two uses of vulgar terms only, the film would have been improved. Now I have seen a few films that had so much foul language I gave them really low scores. This film didn't approach those in the volume of foul language, so it wasn't nearly as much of a negative as the other films.One of the great strengths is the character of Clark. I think someone reviewed this saying that Chevy Chase wasn't a good choice for the role because we know in real life he's far from a good person. I wonder if that person would see a truly horrible film and say they thought it was great, not so much because of the script, but because they know the star is an absolutely wonderful person to his family and his community, and donates all sorts of time and money to worthwhile charities. Sorry, my reviews are based on the film or TV show, not anything I know about any of the actors' personal lives.Clark is totally devoted to being a great husband and father, truly knocking himself out to give them a fabulous Christmas vacation to remember forever. To those who say there was no ""vacation"" here, I will point out that a vacation means time off from work or school. It does not require a trip, as in every school kid in America looking forward to their ""summer vacation."" In this film, the kids during the last few days are ON their Christmas (or Holiday, if you must) VACATION-they aren't going to school. Clark tells his buddy at work a few days before Christmas that it's his last day at work until after New Year's Day, so he is taking a ""Christmas vacation"" too. That's 3 our of 4 in the immediate family that are truly having a Christmas vacation, and you could add in all the relatives who traveled to Chicagoland to visit-the four grandparents stayed several days with the Griswold's so they too are having a vacation that includes a trip.Someone wrote that this film just had recycled gags from the first in this short series. Oh? I don't recall any long scenes or short ones where Clark had trouble with any electrical hookup in the 1983 Vacation. I must have missed the scenes where his actions caused great damage to some nasty people next door to him in his motels. I sure don't remember him flying down a hill on a coaster in any way in that first film. In other words, almost everything in this one was NOT in the original. Probably that reviewer was equating the pretty girl actually flirting with Clark from her sportscar with the salesgirl innocently trying to make a sale while the embarrassed Clark fumbled over his words because she was basically exposing her breasts to him in the department store. Quite different nature to those scenes and in the latter film it was much funnier.I didn't enjoy those parts in the original because of several things connected to the pretty girl. First, pulling up and flirting while driving by is a serious traffic hazard-someone could have been distracted and killed. Second, I couldn't get why a beautiful girl in her 20s would pull up next to a man in a station wagon so clearly traveling with his wife and two kids, and begin to flirt with him. Even more so, why would a happily-married man do more than glance at the pretty girl with his wife right beside him? The believability quotient is at zero that this girl would, on different days, keep driving by the same wagon if she wasn't stalking him. Then she actually stayed at the same motel they did and seriously invited him out to swim in the outdoor motel pool with her, in the nude? That Clark would give in and go out with her does not fit the image of a man who loves his wife, or who uses his brain which should have told him he will almost surely be caught.In the Christmas film, the girl at the counter does nothing after her one encounter with Clark, where all she tried to do was make a sale. Her appearance at Clark's not-yet-built pool was only a fantasy where Clark looked out his window and fantasized about his pool and Cousin Eddie and others all being in or around it, then suddenly he started thinking about that salesgirl. He didn't actually DO anything to be with her.My least-favorite scene was when the cat was chewing on the wires for the Christmas tree lights and unplugged them, then went off camera. When Clark noticed the light were out, he found they were unplugged and on re-plugging them in, caused a distressed cat noise and we then saw a black mark on the floor with a little cat fur, letting us figure out the cat not only got electrocuted, but was virtually incinerated. It would have been far funnier to make it a more comical cat-got-singed incident but was OK after, sort of like Christmas with the Kranks where Luther sprayed the cat with the garden hose, causing it to become frozen in a block of ice, temporarily, with the cat being just fine once it thawed out. Accident or not, it just isn't funny to see someone's beloved pet get killed. If I were to copy this I would like to edit out the cat killing scene.Someone else complained about the casting changes for the Griswold children. Well, how do you have those actors who were teens in 1983 still look like young teens in a film made 6 years later. The kids who played them in Vacation were 17 and 15 then; would you want them to be 23 and 21 in this one?Someone else wrote that aside from Clark and Ellen, none of the other characters were likeable. I thought Audrey was great in her steady support for her father as he failed at getting the Christmas lights to come on. Rusty didn't whine and complain, but simply tried to help his dad whenever he was asked to. The kids' grandparents were rather likeable too, mostly. And how could you not like little Ruby Sue asking her uncle if he was Santa Clause? I like Clark's dad quietly giving him a pep talk about his screw up and how it was OK because we all make mistakes. He said some really nice things to Clark after Clark's big tirade.I thought Ellen was very nice to her husband, exasperated with him for the dumb things he did, but merely supporting him and trying to help him, instead of yelling at him about how he is making things worse. The scene where Clark got locked in the attic and knew the family wouldn't return from shopping for a long time, so he made the best of it, finding old home movies from his childhood and setting up a projector and enjoying the great memories was not only touching, but served to help us understand why he wanted so much to make a great Christmas for his family to remember. They showed it, but didn't have a scene preaching about it.When Clark learned that Eddie's financial fortunes were nil, he went out of his way to tell Eddie that he and Ellen wanted to help them make for a good Christmas for their kids by helping out buying some presents. He asked nothing of Eddie, just did so because they were family. That was another nice scene, played out with some humor as Eddie was loading a shopping cart with 100 pounds of dog food for Snots-all for Clark to buy. But overall, it was a nice touching scene.Some of the funny things were bits that weren't explained. Such as the opening scene where this suburban Chicago family apparently drove 1000 miles to an area with massive mountains to find a Christmas tree. Then they get out of their car and hike what looked to be no less than half a mile before spotting the perfect tree-never mind the fact that it's about 18 feet tall and so wide it would fill the living room wall to wall. Only when they look at the tree does anyone think about how useful it would be to have brought an ax or a saw.We next see this huge tree-roots and all, all tied up with rope-that also wasn't brought-atop the car as they drive home. Of course, they couldn't have dug this big tree up out of the frozen ground without some tools, but that's what made that part funny.There were tons of great sight gags, leading to my ranking of 9.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
77,Sirus_the_Virus,The best in the series.,9,19 September 2009,"I thought that Christmas vacation was the funniest of the Vacation films. I don't know why. I was a little disappointed with European vacation. Christmas vacation makes up for it. The reason why Christmas vacation is the best is because it's something different. Thi time we don't have to watch the Griswolds arguing the entire trip. You hear them arguing at home. This time around, the Griswolds are spending Christmas at there house, where all of their deranged family members come to visit. Clark has started to hit on a jewelry store woman. Not only do both of their family members arrive, Clark's weird cousin Eddie takes a visit also. I laughed quite a bit through the film.

78,gizmomogwai,"Christmas is never perfect, but we like it anyway",8,5 December 2010,"The original National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) is one of my favourite comedies, and has been since I was a kid. I was also familiar with and loved this third Christmas-themed movie. Here we have the Griswolds again, minus the road trip and the catchy Holiday Road theme song.Now, looking back at these movies, I can say Vacation is definitely better than Christmas Vacation. Vacation has some smarter humour and some of Christmas Vacation's jokes are recycled from the original- the car flying, Clark going on a cursing streak, the family kidnapping someone. (Last time it was John Candy, now it's Brian Doyle Murray. Ellen says it's her family's first kidnapping, which is a blatant lie.)Although the sequel borrows too much from Vacation at times, at other times I wish it had taken after it more. Rusty and Audrey look little like they did before. Audrey is too skinny and too blonde; Rusty is too short and wide, and he looks about ten. Jane Krakowski is absent, despite her classic appearance in the original as Vicki (Vicki does come back in the mostly unfunny Vegas Vacation, but with a new actress). Also missing- the nudity. Both Vacation and European Vacation had breasts.That said, there's some good material here. The jokes which make this movie worth seeing include a comically poorly chosen tree, a sign of Clark's foolish nature. The wrapped up cat is funny, and its demise is the only time an animal death in these movies was actually funny. (I've never owned a cat, and as a kid I loved the expression ""fried pussy cat."") The botched grace at dinner is funny. Clark flipping out with a chainsaw and his staircase is funny.

Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) has decided to have a traditional, old-fashioned family Christmas, and has invited his parents and in-laws to stay with them through the season.  He has a surprise he wants to share with everyone this year; with his Christmas bonus from work, he's putting in a pool, to which he's already committed the down-payment money (so the bonus had better come through, big time, or he's `in it up to here').  To kick off the season, he takes Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and the kids, Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki) to the mountains to find the perfect `Griswold family Christmas tree.  And it's only the first of one hilarious scene after another, as we follow Clark and clan through one long laugh-fest, filled with surprises and fun. 	Chase is at his best here, in the most enduring (and endearing) character he's ever done; Clark the Everyman, who only wants the best things for his family and himself, but whose plans more often than not go awry, doomed to fall just short of realization.  When he decorates the outside of the house, he uses 25,000 twinkle lights; they use enough juice to black-out an entire neighborhood, and they do (once he can get them to work).  Then when cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn) show up unexpectedly in the `RV' they now call home, Eddie asks Clark if he's surprised to see him.  Surprised?  Eddie is the last person on earth Clark expected, or wanted, to see.  `Eddie,' he tells him, `I couldn't be more surprised if I woke up tomorrow morning with my head sewn to the carpet.'  Another memorable scene involves a wild squirrel who came in with the Christmas tree and proceeds to make his appearance during dinner, only to provoke a wild romp upstairs and down as they all pursue (and in some cases try to elude) the deadly invader. 	A terrific cast was assembled for this movie, but Quaid is the stand-out, and he perfects the Eddie character in this one; forever the lamebrain with the big heart, and the one who takes the situation in hand when Clark's bonus turns out to be an enrollment in a jelly-of-the-month club.  Clark's parents are played by Diane Ladd (Nora) and John Randolph (Clark, Sr.), and Ellen's by Doris Roberts (Frances) and E.G. Marshall (Art).  Other notable performances are turned in by Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Margo) and Nicholas Guest (Todd), as Clark's yuppie next door neighbors, and also by William Hickey (Uncle Lewis) and Mae Questel (Aunt Bethany).  Rounding out the supporting cast are Nicolette Scorsese (Mary), Cody Burger (Rocky), Ellen Hamilton Latzen (Ruby Sue) and Brian Doyle-Murray (Frank Shirley).  `National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' is timeless comedy, a must for every video collection.  It can be watched over and over again, and the humor stays fresh while the laughs get even bigger.  There's a little bit of every family in here, and this movie may be just the tonic you'll need some day to get you through your own `special' holiday season.  I rate this one 10/10.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
83,rupie,a seasonal classic in our house,7,24 December 1999,"Okay, so the humor is rather broad and unsubtle, and there's a deal of slapstick as well as some crudeness, but somehow I have a real affection for this portrayal of how the earnest, ever-well-meaning Clark Griswold's plans for the Perfect Griswold Family Christmas slowly, inexorably mutate into the Christmas from Hell. There are simply too many wonderful moments of humor to discard the flick: the little wheezing sound the turkey makes as it disintegrates, the outline of the cat burned into the carpet, panic in the power plant as Clark's lights kick in, the arrival of Eddy & family, etc. etc. Reliable holiday humor, that reminds us in too many ways of many of our own Christmas gatherings of the clans. Far superior to Holly Hunter's botched treatment of the same idea in ""Home for the Holidays.""",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

86,Hollywood_Yoda,The Best Vacation,8,4 November 2018,"Ironically, the Griswolds don't go on vacation in this installment, but rather stay home for the holidays. Clark's antics still play a major role too, as he clashes with his family and the neighbors. The neighbors, Todd and Margo are played by Nicholas Guest and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Also in Christmas Vacation, we get to meet the parents of both Clark and Ellen.Again, as in the other Vacation films, the Griswold children are played by different actors, this time Johnny Galecki and Juliette Lewis. They are among the more famous names to play the Griswold kids. Doris Roberts of Everybody Loves Raymond fame plays Ellen's mother.

Yep, its the seminal classic from 1989 which proves than the more you try during the holiday, the more you screw things up. Just do what I do, and let others take the slack. If stuff goes pear-shaped, it's THEIR problem... You're just an innocent bystander.Amongst all the chaos, there's some nugget that no matter how miserable your Xmas is... As long as your family is around you, that's all that matters. Yes, but what if your 'loved ones' are the cause of your strife in the first place? Betcha didn't figure that one out, dude. Why else would you dress up like a goon, spend hours on rooftops in the snow and waste all your money on silly trinkets, if not for them. Hmm... the more I think about it, this movie is perhaps having the OPPOSITE effect on me from what was intended. Now if you don't mind, I'm off to book my desert island for next year.

89,russem31,Funny!,8,25 December 2005,"This 3rd outing for the Griswold family is hilarious from beginning to end. Whereas the first film started it all, it was only above average, and the second one just plain stunk. With this 3rd one, you get to see why Chevy Chase and his fellow actors really work well together as the Griswold family (including the extended members such as Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie). The script is strong in this Vacation and the dialogue really works well when the actors say it. You're bound to laugh throughout and it truly is a great Christmas movie to watch (which is fitting because I am writing this review on Christmas day!). Regardless, it's a great film to watch any time of the year. 8 out of 10. Enjoy!",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

91,Maziun,Griswalds and Christmas,8,23 August 2013,"This is the third movie about Griswalds . This time they aren't leaving their home . It's Christmas folks. The guests are coming and it's about to Clark (Chevy Chase) to make everything perfect. With his lack of luck it won't be easySome people were disappointed with the second movie in the series – ""European vacation"". They didn't expected much from this third part , because really how much good third movies is out there ? ""Christmas vacation"" turned out to be a really pleasant surprise. Its not only a good movie , but according to many (including me) the best in the series. I like first one , the second is bad , the forth is a disaster , but this one is great. For me it's one of Chase's best movies and one of best Christmas movies . It's a quite huge success , because most of Christmas movies is unwatchable plastic. Jeremiah Chechik is the director of this one. The kids have been re-cast again . This time Juliette Lewis is Audrey and Johnny Galecki is Rusty . I have to say that I really liked Lewis as the typical angry teenage and Johnny Galecki (Lenard from ""The Big bang theory"") as Rusty. There are also new actors and actresses who play Clark's parents and Ellen's parents and his rich neighbors. They give a decent support.Most of the jokes comes from Clark (Chevy Chase) , Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and  cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) ! Yes , he's back with his family and it's he's tour de force . He almost steals the show from Chase . The funniest moments are for me : the cartoon intro , almost every scene with Eddie , Clark talking to the sexy salesman , Clark struggling with the lamps and the Friday 13th reference. Oh , and I love the Tasmanian devil cup that Clark has at his office. And the song ""Christmas vacation"" by Mavis Staples is pretty great.The best movie of Chevy Chase.

Corny, yes, especially upon first viewing; but the gags remain fresh after several years, making this film a staple during Christmas. Watch closely and you will spot egg nog being sipped out of Wally World mugs! Final film of Mae Questel. The only VACATION movie to not feature the Lindsey Buckingham song ""Holiday Road"".

95,movieguy1021,Christmas Vacation: 7/10,7,18 December 2002,"Please note that I saw this on TV, so my review might have been different if I saw it ""unedited""Maybe the least memorable in the Vacation series, but brings us to the Griswold's house. The Vacation in the title is very misleading; in fact, everyone comes to Chevy Chase's house, instead of the opposite. Chase, yet again, plays Clark W. Griswold, bumbling food preservative maker. His wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) is seen under the radar for most of this movie. In fact, there aren't really any subplots. The yuppie neighbors nextdoor (Nicholas Guest and Julia-Louis Dreyfuss) (Dreyfuss was the second billed!) don't really count; they're just there for comic relief. Anyway, everyone comes to the Griswold's for a hopefully fun filled time. Yeah, right.Clark's Aunt Bethany (Mae Questel, voice of Betty Boop) is a hoot. ""Clark, is the house on fire?"" ""No, Aunt Bethany, those are the Christmas lights."" Of course, when the entire family comes, you can't really expect all of the people to be memorable (suffered last in Meet the Parents). Who is who? Well, there's a red-haired woman named Frances (Doris Roberts, TV's Everybody Loves Raymond), and a bunch of other people. Its family dynamic worked well, though, all had great chemistry. I just feel sorry that all of them had to be in the same family.Unexpected turns come up when Ellen's cousin Eddie and cousin-in-law Catherine (Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn), last seen in the first Vacation, decide to take their new RV to the Griswold's. Their hickish ways don't go over with the ""life in the parking lot"" ways of the Griswolds. Quaid is always funny, but Flynn, yet again, underplays her role.Clark is expecting a Christmas bonus from his boss, Frank Shirley (Brian Doyle-Murray). He wants/expects it so much that he bought a down payment on a pool. Of course, he doesn't have enough money right now, but once he has his bonus.... I won't spoil the surprise, but Clark doesn't get exactly what he wants.The kids Rusty and Audrey are now played by Johnny Galecki and Juliette Lewis, without real excitement. Before, they had had their ""vices"" and personal issues, but with so many people here, it's hard to focus on them. They also seem to have gotten younger. The movie isn't as funny as Vacation or Vegas Vacation, but it still earns high marks for taking a basic ""family dysfunction"" and making it original. Who can forget Clark's wild ride down the hill on his ""rocket powered"" sleigh? Is there anyone who can't hide the guilty pleasure laugh when Clark electrocutes a cat? Christmas Vacation could be called ""irresistible"".It couldn't be called a Vacation movie without some unlikely but touching way of wrapping everything up. This time, Shirley provides it (who looks a lot like Walley from Vacation), and it worked on me.The whole point of a movie is to take an unbelievable situation and make you believe. Christmas Vacation did wonders, making me think that Chase was an idiot (more so!) and that so many dysfunctions could happen at once. It's funny, mainly, and enjoyable.Rated PG-13 for language and some crude humor.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
96,jlthornb51,Simply the Finest Christmas Comedy Ever Filmed,10,22 May 2015,"There is barely room for discussion regarding the fact this is a Christmas comedy that's perfect in virtually every respect. Withing its running time there are some of the funniest moments ever captured on film, holiday movie or otherwise. The script is one of the most hilarious, sharp, and intelligent in cinema history. The direction is inspired and technically it is without a doubt excellent. There is something about it that so stunningly captures the spirit of Christmas and the atmosphere of a family gathering. The cast is nothing less than remarkable, with an astonishing display of incredible talent. Everyone does a superb job and their comic timing is unbeatable. As an ensemble, it is truly a fantastic group effort. This is a director's dream cast and Jeremiah Chechik puts them through their paces as if he had a magic wand. Chevy Chase has never been better and Beverly D'Angelo is utterly amazing. Randy Quaid gives a knockout performance as Cousin Eddie and the motion picture wouldn't be complete without his visit. A yearly favorite at our house and one my late wife looked forward to very much. It is a happy memory of the holidays and always managed to make us laugh even though we've seen it every season since it was first shown on HBO.

97,Horror-yo,Hugely overrated because it's a Christmas comedy,5,28 December 2016,"Where the first Vacation was actually funny with original comedic ideas and a humor more natural than forced, this here is just another volume down the conveyor belt of manufactured laugh-material, so not in rhythm, and not original, and plain not funny.If you're not American, chances are you'll look at this and ask yourself why it got so popular, for instance, the 7.5+ rating here on IMDb. The answer is simple: make a Christmas themed comedy utilizing an already established, recognizable crew (from previous films), and make sure you have all the family holiday clichés pop out randomly from everywhere to the point of bursting, and it won't matter how funny or well made the film is, culturally all the ingredients for good fun are there as the people identify strongly to the on screen depictions.4.5/10",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
98,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,More Of A Break Than A Vacation,6,25 February 2013,"The third VACATION and the second written by story creator John Hughes, Christmas is more of a reboot than a sequel, starting everything from scratch for a new generation: as if there were no other trips beforehand.Audrey's still in high school and Rusty's thirteen-years-old again. The kids and mom don't amount to much anyway, merely witnessing Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase at the tail-end of his comedic peak) and his clumsy misadventures as the host of an overcrowded holiday home: including both sets of in-laws.The only real input for family's sake is Randy Quaid's white trash Cousin Eddie. A scene- stealer in the first film given his own fifteen minute layover, Eddie becomes Clark's partner- in-crime. But Quaid seems to be doing an exaggerated imitation, turning Eddie into an over- the-top comic book character. Meanwhile, Clark's reactionary disdain for his cousin-in-law's gross personality becomes redundant after the first ten times.Most of the film's spoken jokes are limp and somewhat forced. The funniest moments rely on physical gags: the fate of a curious cat; an enraged squirrel; and Christmas house lights that refuse to work.The direction, including hand-held camera and intentionally awkward moments, flows pretty well with the John Hughes script that, as usual, mixes semi dark comedy with pathos and hijinx. While the soundtrack can be spooky and ominous, befitting what's going on in Clark's troubled mind, successfully contrasting with the old fashion Norman Rockwell house and backdrop.Touted as a Holiday classic, this is really a hit-and-miss outing. The most family oriented Lampoon venture keeps some of the blue humor hidden yet it's implied throughout.Glimpses of a brooding Clark at work in the office, hoping for a bonus check to buy a swimming pool, and the intrusion of a put-upon yuppie couple who live next door – victims of whatever Clark's doing outside – are distractions to get us out of the crowded house. Yet with these sporadic reminders of real life, we often forget we're on vacation.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

100,jhaggardjr,"Hilarious! The best ""Vacation"" yet!",10,22 June 2000,"Here is my favorite of the series. ""Christmas Vacation"" (aka ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"") is the best, funniest movie in the ""Vacation"" series. This, the third in the series, brings back the big laughs that were featured in the first film and was frequently missing in the second film. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo reprise their roles from the first two films as Clark and Ellen Griswold. This time though there's a major change. Instead of the Griswolds taking a vacation out of town, they stay at home and relatives take vacations to visit them. This was a very good idea. At least they don't repeat something from the first two films. Among the visitors filling up the Griswold household: Clark's parents Clark Sr. and Nora (John Randolph and Diane Ladd); Ellen's parents Art and Francis (the late E.G. Marshall and current ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" star Doris Roberts); Cousins Eddie and Catherine (Randy Quaid and Miriam Flynn, reprising their roles from the first ""Vacation"" movie), two of their kids, and their dog; and dotty, senile Uncle Lewis and Aunt Bethany (wonderfully played by two late longtime veterans, William Hickey and Mae Questel). Lots of big laughs here. Some of the slapstick highlights: the Griswold's trip to get the perfect Christmas tree; Clark's adventures of decorating the house with 25,000 light bulbs; Clark's bigtime sleighride after putting a slippery substance on the sled; Clark's day locked in the attic; the in-laws constant bickering at each other; Cousin Eddie's constant slobbering; Christmas Eve craziness; and so on. This is probably Chevy Chase's best film, with the original ""Vacation"" right behind. Just about everyone gets a big laugh in the film (including Julia Louis-Dreyfus of ""Seinfeld"" as the Griswold's next-door neighbor who can't stand Clark). The scene stealer is Quaid, who's naturally funny everytime he's on screen. So is Hickey and Questel. The movie also features then teen actors Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki before they reached big time roles (she in ""Cape Fear""; he on TV's ""Rosanne""). ""Christmas Vacation"" is a perfect movie to watch at Christmastime. But you can watch it anytime. Great, hilarious fun from beginning to end.**** (out of four)",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

Clark Griswald (Chevy Chase)will surely make this holiday season one to remember. Although his practices may seem unorthodox, he is just trying to make everyone happy, which isn't an easy thing to do. His parents and his in-laws will be spending the holiday's with Clark and his family, and all hell is about to break loose.Clark's passion for the holidays goes hand in hand with his obsession for over the top decorations. With his house drenched in lights and a Christmas tree too small for Paul Bunyon's living room, he's ready for St. Nick's arrival...but not cousin Eddy's.

Well, aside from the laugh-out-loud comedy, the message is clear: to get through the holidays in one piece, you have to overcome adversity and be thankful for what you have. Clearly, the comedy takes over the subtly message, but all together this is a quality film. Chase is absolutely hilarious as the fumbling, smart ass Clark. He and his wife Ellen (Beverley D'Angelo) make a nice on-screen couple that seems realistic enough.Christmas and comedy go together like nutmeg on eggnog. It's the perfect fit!

If you love B and C grade actors (yesterday I saw one with Tori Spelling AND Gary Coleman!), this would have to be your favourite time of the year. Probably one of the better ones going around though would be National Lampoons Christmas Vacation.The movie again focuses on the Griswald's, this time though they are spending Christmas at home with the extended family. Besides Eddie and Katherine, they are all new characters, none of whom are given more than a handful of lines or appearances to do anything. Clark (Chevy Chase) has about 90% of the dialogue and screen time, which is probably a good thing. The movie revolves around Clark and his aim to have a perfect family Christmas. If you've seen the other ""Vacation's"", you'll know this will prove impossible as Clark keeps goofing off and hilarious consequences abound.It's certainly not a landmark movie, but it has a few good scenes, and it scores extra purely because it's a Christmas movie that doesn't send you to sleep. It's basically more of the same of the ingredients from the first 2 ""Vacation's"", with a weaker ensemble and less material to work with.

Disaster-prone dad (Chevy Chase) discovers just how dangerous the Christmas season really is, as the Griswolds' old-fashioned holiday celebration turns out to be more ""Bah! Humbug!"" than Christmas cheer. Chase is right at home with the outrageous slapstick and often cheerfully tasteless humor, and John Hughes's script is stuffed full of classic Christmas movie references, but Randy Quaid practically steals the film as the unemployed relative with his malicious grin and mooching lifestyle. Not exactly a holiday classic and a bit spotty, but this gag-filled comedy is just obnoxious enough for the Scrooge lurking inside everyone. And fear not, a happy ending awaits all.

114,renegadeviking-271-528568,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation review,8,12 January 2020,"Guilty pleasure (n): a film that a critic shamefacedly admits to liking even though the prevailing opinion, as put forth by serious members of the profession, is that the movie is a piece of crap.Christmas Vacation is considered by many film critics to be a ""guilty pleasure"" - largely because some of the set pieces are as hilarious as they are juvenile. Unfortunately, Christmas Vacation also suffers from the malaise that plagues the other three Vacation films (1983's Vacation, 1985's European Vacation, and 1997's Vegas Vacation) - too little material to sustain a 90+ minute motion picture. At about two-thirds of its official length, Christmas Vacation might have been a joy to the world; as it is, a few too many overlong and lame scenes make us want to deck the Griswolds (Clark in particular).These days, there are really only five staple Christmas films: Frank Capra's classic It's A Wonderful Life, Scrooge/A Christmas Carol (pick a version, although the 1951 Alistair Sim one is the most beloved), A Miracle on 34th Street (the original, not the remake), A Christmas Story, and Christmas Vacation. The universal popularity of the last film is not difficult to explain - it's diverting but doesn't require undivided attention, the rights are cheap enough that almost any TV station can (and does) broadcast it, and, despite its failings, it is funny. Oh, and there aren't that many non-saccharine Christmas films that are vaguely watchable. If we take away Christmas Vacation, what are we supposed to substitute for it?Christmas Vacation marked John Hughes' final outing with the Griswolds (he was not involved in the 1997 flop, Vegas Vacation). His handpicked director, Jeremiah Checkik (whose future embarrassments include Diabolique and The Avengers), helmed the project using Hughes' script. In some ways, the antics in this film presaged the kinds of pratfalls and other physical comedy that characterized Hughes' 1991 Christmas season hit, Home Alone. The level and nature of humor in Christmas Vacation is in the same vein as that which characterized the previous two Vacation outings - sporadically amusing, occasionally uproarious, but with plenty of dumb jokes that fall painfully flat.After leaving their house to go on their two previous vacations, this time the Griswolds are staying home - and inviting the whole family to visit. While Clark (Chevy Chase) wires up the house with 25,000 colored lights, Ellen (Beverly D'Anglelo) prepares the holiday meal, and the kids, Rusty (Johnny Galecki) and Audrey (Juliette Lewis), bemoan the sleeping arrangements, the guests start arriving. The first to show up are the in-laws: Clark's mother, Nora (Diane Ladd), and father, Clark Sr. (John Randolph), and Ellen's parents, Art and Frances (E.G. Marshall and Doris Roberts). Next to arrive are Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid), his wife, Catherine (Miriam Flynn), and their brood. Finally, there are Uncle Lewis (William Hickey) and Aunt Bethany (Mae Questel), both of whom are hard-of-hearing and bordering on senility. Meanwhile, the neighbors (Nicholas Guest and Julia Louis-Dreyfus) watch what's going on next door with a growing mixture of disbelief and irritation.The reason Christmas Vacation works is that it takes situations that are familiar to most families and produces humor by exaggerating them to astounding lengths. Nevertheless, at the core of each vignette lies an experience that most viewers will be intimately familiar with. Many of the common ""Christmas situations"" are crammed into these 90 minutes: the trek to get the family Christmas tree, shopping at a department store, fumbling around in the attic, putting up the decorations, cooking the holiday dinner, and dealing with too many relatives in too little space. Of course, since our heroes are the Griswolds, Murphy's Law is in full force - anything that can go wrong, does.The most humorous sequence in the film relates to Clark's frustrated attempts to light up his life (and that of everyone else in the neighborhood) by creating one of the most tacky displays of illuminated Christmas decorations ever seen. Of course, Clark's first few attempts meet with failure, but, once a light bulb goes off in Ellen's head, pandemonium ensues. The Griswolds, standing out in the cold on the front lawn, are elated. The ""Hallelujah Chorus"" plays on the soundtrack. And the neighbors are awakened from a sound winter's nap by more than a clatter - and, when they spring from the bed to see what's the matter, they end up tumbling down the stairs.The cheapest (and perhaps heartiest) laugh occurs later in the film, when a fluffy cat fails to realize that chewing on a string Chirstmas of tree lights may not be the best way to prolong any of its nine lives. Then there's the squirrel in the Christmas tree - a sequence that results in a group of grown people running away from a small, basically harmless creature whose home has been unexpectedly moved from the chilly outdoors into someone's living room.Like all of the Vacation movies, Christmas Vacation mixes the bad with the good. Its biggest misstep is a maudlin and unpleasant subplot involving Clark's skinflint boss, who decides that traditional Christmas bonuses are extravagant wastes. Running a close second is the inclusion of Randy Quaid, who manages to be consistently unfunny. Quaid's inept performance casts a pall over much of the film's second half - every scene without him is like a breath of fresh air. His character, Cousin Eddie, is supposed to get under Clark's skin. Unfortunately, in the process, Quaid manages to get under the viewer's.One of the great unanswered questions in Hollywood is how Chevy Chase still gets work. Although his appeal is not as incomprehensible as that of, say, Pauly Shore, it's not obvious, either; ""range"" is one word no one will ever use in conjunction with Chase's acting ability. I suppose people like him because they see him as a bigger loser than themselves, and it's always nice to believe that, no matter how inept one is, there's always someone worse off. At any rate, Chase plays Clark exactly as we expect him to. That's actually a positive statement, since anything else would be disappointing. Likewise, Beverly D'Angelo is back in her largely thankless role as Clark's supportive partner and the family voice of reason.One of the ongoing jokes in the Vacation films is that the kids never look the same from movie to movie. This time around, the parts are filled by Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki - two actors who eventually rose above these humble origins. Lewis would go on to fool audiences into believing she could act with a tremendous performance in Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear remake (before reverting to form in later films). Galecki, meanwhile, would develop into a decent character actor. Aside from Lewis and Galecki, the supporting cast is top-heavy with recognizable names, including John Randolph, E.G. Marshall, Diane Ladd, and a pre-""Seinfeld"" Julia Louis-Dreyfus.For anyone trying to get into the Christmas mood, Christmas Vacation is perhaps not the best choice of cinematic fare. It doesn't go all that well with chestnuts roasting on an open fire (unless they're exploding all over the place) or Jack Frost nipping at your nose (unless it results in frostbite). However, for those who are tired of peace on earth and goodwill to men, the third outing of the Griswolds offers a reminder that, for some, the real meaning of the season has as much to do with annoying the neighbors and putting up with the relatives as it does with something more wholesome.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

Although utterly predictable, the skits shoehorned in throughout are still enjoyable as Chase plays his part well.

Christmas Vacation is actually my favorite Vacation film. It's a tradition to watch with my family on Christmas. This film has tons and tons of famous scenes. The beginning with the animated Santa, the scene with the truck driver and they are under the truck, of course the squirrel scene, and Clark's meltdown.Clark Griswold is back and this time it's Christmas. He gets a huge tree and his relatives come to his house. He sets up a lot of lights on his house that eventually work. He then gets trapped in the attic, and hurting himself when he gets down. His hillbilly cousin brings his huge rottweiler. Clark's uncle burns down the tree. When they get a new tree the tree has a squirrel in it. The cat is electrocuted and dies. Then Clark tells the family that they're getting a pool with his Christmas bonus. He then finds out that he didn't get a Christmas bonus. Clark has a meltdown. Then he finds out that his cousin Eddie had kidnapped his boss. The police and the boss's wife comes. The boss says to his wife that he didn't give his workers a Christmas bonus and he drops the charges. He gives Clark a bonus. Then Clark's uncle blows up the fake Santa and reindeer with his cigar. As it flies past the moon, everyone sings the Star-Spangled Banner.Overall, this is a fantastic Christmas comedy. You should watch this over the Holidays along with a Christmas Story. This, in my opinion, is the best Vacation film. I loved the original Vacation, so that is saying something. This Christmas comedy should not be missed. It's a traditional film. This movie should not be missed around Christmas time. You will regret it if you do not watch this.9/10Recommended Films: National Lampoon's Vacation.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

120,robert-710-767167,Could be funny but really isn't,5,1 January 2012,This movie is one of those where they take a typical family gathering and make it as funny as possible. They try to make funny scenes and have it be a comedy.Unfortunately I didn't really find it that funny at all. There are a few funny scenes but in general I dislike it. One of the first reasons is the swearing. Bad mouth after bad mouth. Not just the adults but the kids as well. Really?Second is the sexual content. It's bad enough to have a scene where the guy implies breasts... but to have a whole scene dedicated to a swimming pool where the girl who he saw at a store is in a swim suit and sexually tries to encourage the guy to 'come along' and goes as far as implying she's completely undressed is just... yeah.But in general I think the movie could have potential. But it really is ruined when I have to close my eyes every few minutes.Rated 4/10,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
121,RhapsodyReviews,Christmas Classic.,10,4 December 2019,"Review:
'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' is a Christmas-comedy film directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. It is based on a short story in 'National Lampoon' magazine by John Hughes and is the third installment in 'National Lampoon's Vacation' film series.
My family and I watch this every holiday season and it never gets old. Having Christmas with the Griswold family is our own holiday tradition.
It's Christmas time and the Griswolds are preparing for a family seasonal celebration, but things never run smoothly for Clark (Chevy Chase), his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and their two kids, Rusty (Johnny Galecki) and Audrey (Juliette Lewis). Clark's continual bad luck is worsened by his obnoxious family guests, but he manages to keep going knowing that his Christmas bonus is due soon.
Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo have amazing chemistry together in all other 'Vacation' films and this one is no different. You can feel the exhaustion from Ellen whenever Clark does something dimwitted, but you also tell that they love each other more than anything. This is also my favorite versions of Rusty and Audrey. Johnny Galecki and Juliette Lewis are a great addition to the ever-growing Griswold family.
As for my favorite movie in the 'Vacation' film franchise this may be it. I don't have a complaint about this movie. The humor is solid, both with Chase's physical comedy and his witty monologues. He also does a really good job at getting little jabs in the right spots. My personal favorite of this is when he asks Eddie if there is anything, he can do for him and as he is listing examples he suggests 'drive you out in the middle of nowhere and leave you for dead?'. It's executed perfectly.
Overall, this is a really fun movie that you could watch with the whole family, maybe put your very young ones to bed, because some parts are more adult. I will be watching this one multiple times during Christmas break.

122,moviedude1,"Oh, well, why not?",8,12 January 2009,"Chevy Chase pulls out the Griswold's characters once again in an effort to lighten up the holiday spirit. When it comes to this guy, the phrase, ""Dumber than a box of rocks,"" comes to mind.I guess it's not all bad, but how stupid can one be to staple your shirt sleeve to the eaves when you're hanging lights? To me, it's just another effort for the Saturday Night Live gang to scrape the last few remaining bucks out of moviegoers at the time (Christmas 1989). They say you should find the good in everything you do, so the good that I found in this movie was that my in-laws worked at a cinema in her hometown and we got to see this film for free. It's a good laugh if you're in the mood for something stupid (REALLY stupid), but I don't think I would consider this one of the holiday classics.5 out of 10 stars.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
123,ryan_kuhn,"""Burn dust, eat my rubber.""",7,13 February 2005,"National Lampoon's strongest effort since Animal House, Christmas Vacation tells the story of a simple man, Clark W. Griswold, Jr. (the ever swarmy Chevy Chase), and his dream to give his family and old-fashioned Christmas, not matter what it takes. The film is essentially a series of skits about the holidays and family strung together on Clark's dream to have as many people from his family in his house for the holidays. The primary thing we need to remember while watching this movie is that Clark is an idiot, but a lovable one. He wants a great Christmas, so he loads up his family, wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), daughter (a young Juliette Lewis) and son Rusty (Johnny Galecki) in the station wagon to get their tree. A tree lot? No... of course not. The middle of the woods, quite possibly in Canada (heck of a drive from their suburban Chicago home) to get their tree. With a saw? No, he forgot it. That's the first of the many sketches that make up the film. Most are funny, the funniest probably involves a squirrel loose in the house, and great-aunt Bethany adds comedic nonsense to the end of the movie. Most of the things that happen in the movie wouldn't happen to ordinary people, we aren't that dumb, but rather the film holds true to the old axiom ""what can go wrong will go wrong,"" which usually happens during the holidays. Seeing someone else have trouble during the holidays makes us feel better, and we get some chuckles out of it too.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
124,bayardhiler,It's not Christmas Without Christmas Vacation!,10,22 December 2016,"Ah, Christmas. That time of year when families come together and peace and harmony reign supreme. Yeah right! Just try telling that to the Griswolds! That lovable family who can't seem to stay out of trouble are back for the holidays, with Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) making it his personal mission to make the perfect Christmas, and failing at every turn! From looking for the perfect Christmas tree in the middle of the woods - and having to dig it out of the ground because he forgot the saw! - to not being able to get the zillion outside lights to work, nothing ever seems to quite according to plan. Add in the parents, in-laws, pesky yuppie neighbors, and Clark's crazy, but lovable cousin in law, Eddie (Randy Quaid) and you have the ""hap hap happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap-danced with Danny F------ Kaye!""""Christmas Vacation"" is probably my favorite of the ""Vacation"" movies since it's the one I watch the most, especially around the holidays. Despite how outrageous the comedy is - from the ridiculously huge amount of outside lights to the bone dry turkey -, if you've celebrated Christmas a few times, especially as an adult, you'll find there's a grain of truth to ""Christmas Vacation"". Case in point, the scene where Clark can't get the outside lights to work and just loses it never fails to crack me up, no matter how many times I see it, as it reminds me of when my dad would get bad because we couldn't get the lights and decorations to work, and he'd always go on a profanity laced tirade! The writing of John Hughes is spot on in turning the challenges of the holidays into comedy gold. All the actors and actresses hit their mark with perfection: Chevy Chase's performance as everyday man Clark Griswold who thinks he knows what he is doing but is in way over his head is one of the ages here, the beautiful and talented Beverly D'Angelo as Clark's tortured wife Ellen is a joy to watch, as is Juliette Lewis as the Griswold's cranky, teenage daughter Audrey, a young Johnny Galecki as son Rusty, plus a whole slew of support roles from the late Doris Roberts, John Randolph, EG Marshall, Diane Ladd, Mae Questal, Nicholas Guest, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Brian Doyle-Murray and of course, the larger than life Randy Quaid. ""Christmas Vacation"" is an absolute joy to watch every year, and is one of those films that's so quotable, that if you stick two fans who've seen it all their lives together and one says a quote from the film, the other will be able to respond in kind from the movie.

The cast is great, the writing is hilarious, and it is just a fun holiday movie that everyone needs to watch.I'm a big fan of the 'Vacation' films, but this is the funniest one.

She's funny in this installment as she is in the others.  Rusty and Audrey are once again played by different actors, and Rusty has noticeably taken off about five or six years off his age.  Anyway...Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki are entertaining. Randy Quaid is back as Cousin Eddie and is more enjoyable than ever.The writing is hilarious.

Chevy Chase again plays probably his funniest movie character in the bumbling family man Clark W. Grizwold. Beverly DeAngelo returns as his long suffering wife Ellen. The kids are new like in every Vacation movie but that shouldn't weigh too heavy on you because the kids always suck. Look for a pre-fame Juliette Lewis as Audrey. The grandparents are all annoying and hilarious at the same time. Randy Quaid is again in his best role ever as Cousin Eddie. This time Eddie has brought the family with him with predictable results. The whole movie is a great holiday comedy and one that I watch around Christmas time every year. It's too bad that Chevy Chase has for some reason sank into obscurity.

134,mbhgkmsgg,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,10,23 December 2020,"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation isn't just a wonderful Christmas film, it's also one of funniest comedies I have seen. It has countless laugh-out-loud moments and the absurdity of it all, makes it tremendously entertaining throughout.This was the second time I have watched this film, and I have to start by saying that I liked it way more than I remembered liking it. It has been a few years since I last watched it, so maybe it has something to do with my age, or perhaps I simply didn't enjoy it as much the first time around. However, watching it now, I had an absolute blast. In fact, I can't think of a single joke or gag that didn't work. While I wasn't in a constant state of laughter, the best bits are truly hilarious. And while I expected to laugh, I certainly didn't remember it being as funny as it was. However, the thing that surprised me the most was how Christmasy this film is. It goes through every bit of preparation that the holiday involves, be it finding the right Christmas tree, setting up the lights and decorations, or dealing with the relatives, and makes it feel familiar. Indeed, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation does a tremendous job of capturing the feel and chaos of all the things that come with Christmas. It tells a story that almost anyone can relate to, which makes it easy to laugh at.Speaking of the story, it follows Clark Griswold on his quest to have the perfect family Christmas. While his wife, and kids, feel like it's a bad idea, Clark decidedly pushes on. And while everything goes great in the beginning, it soon becomes evident that things won't be exactly going to plan. And come Christmas eve, everything ends up in chaos, and it looks like Christmas is ruined. Or is it?
It's a simple story, and it's mostly told through jokes and comedy. And while the focus is on the funniest bits, the overall feel of the story is surprisingly homey and warm, which is exactly what I look for in a holiday movie.While I always considered National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation a fun Christmas comedy, I never considered it as something that I would want to revisit every Christmas. However, having now seen it again, it has become evidently clear that it will become a part of my yearly Christmas movie marathon. It's tremendously funny, and easy to enjoy, it's entertaining throughout, and most importantly, it's filled with holiday cheer.

You want overblown decorations, visitors who never leave, the focus on buying things or the family gatherings where people can barely stand each other? It's all here but done in such a hilarious way, and with a kernel of truth, that you know you are laughing at your own holiday experiences as much as at the movie.  The Vacation series is about exaggeration but while Chase is over the top, we can all identify with him. He just needs a good script and this and the first Vacation deliver.

""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" is the third installment of the ""Vacation"" series as Clark Griswold and his family are spending their holiday at their home instead of taking a vacation elsewhere; instead is Clark and Ellen's family that are on a vacation as well as Clark's brother Eddie and his family. They are the ones who are having a vacation on Christmas, so now it seems that the filmmakers decide to go with a change of pace which is a good thing. The movie does have some good laughs, and it does have some great moments. Chevy Chase is always great as Clark Griswold, and the rest of the cast are great too. However, there are some parts of the film that aren't funny but it doesn't take away the experience as I am watching it. Also, on the DVD, when you watch the ending on your HDTV you can see the box where Santa Claus and the reindeers are flying in the air after Uncle Lewis drops the match into sewer as there are gas in it; that effect looks a bit dated for my taste. Anyway, the movie really does have that wonderful Christmas spirit and it really is a lot of fun to watch during the holidays. Overall, this is the best ""Vacation"" sequel ever made and I give it a 9 out of 10.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

138,Sunsphxsuns,THE TEMPLATE FOR CONTEMPORARY HOLIDAY FILMS,10,13 November 2021,"Although there's not a whole lot I can add to what's already been written about this iconic 1989 holiday themed film, I'll try to offer some speculation as to why fans continue to unabashedly adore this crazy movie. Heck, I even purchased a pair of the Officially Licensed Warner Brothers Christmas Vacation Moose Mugs, and by gosh I fill them with strong eggnog (or Tom & Jerry) for a spirited toast every Christmas!If you compare all of the National Lampoon Vacation movies, this is arguably the one that stands out the most. Indeed, Christmas Vacation may be the undisputed Holy Grail of all contemporary holiday themed films.What is it about this particular movie that has people of all ages still quoting selected scenes word for word? Perhaps it's the Griswold family, emblematic of all that we dare not speak of when it comes to families merrily torturing each other over the holidays? Even with the best of intentions, sometimes the holidays can get overwhelming. And when that happens, ""good tidings"" quickly evaporate and are replaced with chaos, foul moods, and unconscionable bad behavior. And from there it's down the proverbial rabbit hole for one and all.The prolific writer/director/producer, the late John Hughes, understood these complicated family dynamics very well. There's no such thing as a perfect Christmas, or a perfect family, perfect job, or perfect life. Nothing human generated is perfect. And it is these imperfections that make Christmas Vacation such a uniquely allegorical viewing experience.No spoilers here as usual, but I can reveal that the absolutely hilarious role of Clark's Aunt Bethany was played by Mae Questel, and sadly, this was her final film appearance. And for those IMDb readers who are too young to recall, Mae was the 1930s cartoon voice of the lovable Betty Boop!",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

142,Ben-Hibburd,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation Review.,5,19 December 2017,"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is the third instalment into the Vacation series. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return to reprise their roles of Clark and Ellen Griswold. As-well the children have been recast again, this time Juliette Lewis and Jonny Galecki star as Audrey and rusty. And they're the most memorable of the young actors in these roles.Christmas Vacation sees the Griswold's host Christmas with their dysfunctional extended family that have a knack of causing all sorts of mischief and chaos. Whilst Clark and Ellen act as the glue that holds both families together. This film is definitely a vast improvement over European Vacation. The story and over-all zaniness has been toned down making the film more palatable.One of the biggest issues I had with the film is it recycles many of the jokes that were done in the first two films. There were some jokes that made think seriously they're doing this again, in-particular Clark's dream sequence. A-lot of the jokes didn't hit the mark for me. However all the performances felt earnest and all the characters were likeable especially Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo who were once again the best thing about the film.Over-all Christmas Vacation is a safe film that tones down some of the more raunchier humour of the previous films. However due to the sheer likeability of the Griswolds, Christmas Vacation makes for a charming if at times slightly dull Christmas film.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
143,ernestsavesxmas,A holiday classic,8,13 January 2020,"Reviewing this film now feels... silly. What or how is anyone supposed to write that will add to ""the dialogue"" ? I suppose there is an alternate history of my life where I might publish the blog post ""Top 10 Reasons Why Christmas Vacation Needs to GTFO in 2020"" that is a testament to post-millennial trash culture. I wouldn't believe a word of it, but it would be fun to write as satire. The truest (critical) thing I can write is that the most offensive part of this movie is that, in John Hughes's warped capitalist brain, the worst thing that could happen to a white upper middle class family in 1989 is not having enough money to put in a swimming pool. This film is a hot mess of vignettes that either work extremely well or fail spectacularly in the stupidest ways imaginable. And the line between them is THIN. It's a holiday classic, which is to say you have to be a psychopath to watch this in any month of the year besides December.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
144,stebird,Christmas just wouldn't be complete,10,29 July 2017,"At this stage in the Vacation series, you'd expect a drop in the overall quality, maybe the laughs have dried up and the series is being milked too much..., oh but no, absolutely and very much no, Christmas Vacation is probably the funniest in the series, despite being the third film in the series. It's old school laughs, stuff you probably wouldn't get away with in this overly-saturated politically correct society of today, and that alone has made the film grow even better with age, as society gets worse, the film gets better.The quintessential Christmas film, for me personally Christmas just wouldn't be the same if we didn't break out the old DVD and watch it at least once, on a personal level this actually is my favourite Christmas film, the reason being because of how realistic it is, compared to other Christmas films that rely on magic, Santa Claus and fictional fairy tales to drive the story, Christmas Vacation doesn't, it instead promotes the truth......The pure and simple truth, in a comical way.It shows that Christmas is stressful, it isn't all that great, it shows that the basis of Christmas is built on money, not on magic, that things go wrong e.g. the Christmas lights that blanket the outside of the house, they won't initially work so Clark Griswold throws a tantrum, that's Christmas, that's proper Christmas.Even for unrelated people things can go wrong e.g. the neighbours, the young fashionable couple that Clark torments something chronic with all the mishaps and accidents, e.g. the icicle that smashes straight through their window without warning.We all have family that comes out of the woodwork every Christmas, and despite being somewhat exaggerated in Christmas Vacation, it still hits the nail on the head and gets the point across..., these people will descend on you and you need the patience of a saint to get through it unscathed, but just as in this film, that very rarely happens, there's always an argument, a fuss, a disagreement, a falling out of some description. And alas somewhere out there, we all have a Cousin Eddie..., an embarrassment of a family that everyone's ashamed of, but still they come, unable to see their own flaws. It's realistic, it's a send up, it's satire at its most grotesque, and this is Christmas whether you like it or not.On another note, true to form, as with every Vacation film, there's a new actor playing the son, Rusty Griswold..., the lad portraying Rusty here is none other than Johnny Galecki, most famous for playing Leonard in the hit TV series ""The Big Bang Theory""",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
145,RussianPantyHog,A hugely under-rated movie & my personal favourite comedy,9,23 December 2004,"Wow, I see opinions are well divided here. Here's mine then. Most of the ""National Lampoon"" films are pretty awful, even my American friends agree on that. Vacation was good, but European Vacation, Vegas Vacation and a long list of others are best avoided. However, in amongst all the dross there are two absolute classics: Animal House & Christmas Vacation. I LOVE this movie and it's been a part of my family's Christmas every year since 1990. I'm delighted that British TV will be showing it again in 2 days from now, December 25th. Why is it so good? Because unlike almost every other comedy it's hilarious ALL the way through. There's no let-up, no ""weak"" sections and no scene that doesn't work. From Chevy Chase driving his car under a 40 ton truck right at the beginning, to the SWAT team crashing into his living room right at the end, you'll be laughing the whole way through. We all know what a nightmare Christmas can be and this film takes the idea, wonderfully, to the ultimate. Clark Grizwald tries to give his family the perfect Christmas, way beyond anything that could possibly happen in real life, and it's - literally - a disaster from start to finish. I'm sure every husband & father in the western world will identify with Grizwald and see something of ourselves in his antics? The supporting cast are all excellent, particularly Randy Quaid as the freeloading hillbilly Cousin Eddy. I recently discovered Chevy Chase's greedy boss is played by Bill Murray's brother. yeah, I can see the similarity now. There are SO many priceless scenes in this movie it's hard to pick out the best, but if you like the thought of exploding Christmas trees, electrocuted pussy-cats, wrecking your neighbours' house and kidnapping your boss (gift-wrapped) then you'll love Christmas Vacation. I give this movie 9 out of 10 and hope everyone who hasn't seen it yet will take the opportunity, and treasure it as much as I do.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

147,alexcomputerkid,Christmas Vacation is an easily watchable movie but it is a film I would rather choose to forget than to remember.,6,25 December 2013,"During it's fourteen year run, the National Lampoon Vacation series was pretty top notch. It produced a different concept of following a family and all their crazy adventures. It was a series that besides ""Vegas Vacation"" showed Chevy Chase in his prime as a comedic actor and also many series can't say they used every rating from R, PG-13 and PG for the various films which shows it's a series that works for everyone.That said, every one especially knows about the third film in the series, Christmas Vacation. It is said to be a classic Christmas film, and is well known by non-fans of film industry. The film is something you can just find on about every station during Christmas time even though it is now more than twenty years old and I don't see this dying anytime soon. Call me crazy me though, because for me Christmas Vacation is just a merely an above average film.In the heart of Chicago, the Griswold family craziness begins during Christmas time. The Griswold extended family is here with Clark (Chevy Chase), his trashy brother Eddie (Randy Quaid) and the rest of the family. Clark deals a lot of stuff including Christmas lights, presents, a Christmas bonus issue and really everything that comes with Christmas.I could just be nitpicking and maybe the Christmas scrooge has come out from inside of me but Christmas Vacation suffers from a lack of plot. Most of film is wandering around in an 80's style house watching a family who don't know the ways of life. With the setting being just a house, it shows off the low $27 million budget, and I don't know why the movie is called ""Christmas Vacation"" because the family doesn't go anywhere. Christmas Vacation is full of sex, bathroom humor, old people and dysfunctional family jokes that are typical in comedy films.I think if a film is going to use just one setting, then it really needs to rely on the characters. The main star of the film and the father of the family, Clark Griswold (Chase) can't seem to do anything right and has numerous problems. He is an annoyance and by the end of the movie it just becomes too much. The mother of the Griswolds is Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) who is innocent in all of this and really doesn't seem to fit into this craziness. The kids are Audrey Griswold (Juliette Lewis) who is a bitchy teen who has problems with just about about everything and the younger brother is Russ Griswold (Johnny Galecki) who does nothing noteworthy. From Uncle Lewis (William Hickey) to Aunt Bethany (Mae Questel), the old people in this story are what some old people are. They are off in there own world and have no purpose or able to relate at all to the present time. The only character that really earns his keep and is worth watching is Eddie (Quaid) who's pretty funny and who has some heart. Still, none of these family members has an inch of character development.This movie has the Christmas spirit and is original to the series so I see a reason why some people call it a classic. To me though, it just has too little on substance, has big flaws on the important parts and really all I got out of it was some smiles. Christmas Vacation is an easily watchable movie but it is a film I would rather choose to forget than to remember.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
148,brownah18,Chevy Chase at his best!,8,15 December 2009,"You can't go wrong with Chevy Chase, he is a classic comedian that will give you a lot of laughs. Clark Griswold(Chase) brings his family out to no-where to pick a Christmas tree and almost gets into a car accident in the process. Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) says her parents are coming this year too and she is worried how everyone is going to get along and fit in the house and Clark reassures her and says it will be fine. Clark starts talking to an attractive girl at the lingerie area and find himself getting a little to out of hand when his son Rusty (Johnny Galecki) comes up to him. Both parents have arrived of theirs and nothing but mayhem, causing arguments between each parent. Clark finally gets the lights going on the house and Uncle Eddie (Randy Quaid) shows up with his family and it's now a packed Christmas that he wasn't expecting to have.This movie will remind you of a lot of different things, weather it's another movie, your own Christmas, or just fun times of the Christmas holiday with the family. Some parts just remind me of dumb and dumber or some of the dumb things they would do throughout that movie. Chase reminds me so much of Jim Carrey in his wacky comedies that you just absolutely laugh about throughout the whole movie. Chase is now older and in a TV show called ""Community"" which I haven't got a chance to see yet, but it looks funny. Juliette Andrews who played Audrey Griswold is currently in the movie coming out soon ""Whip It"" and ""Metropia"". Johnny Galecki who played Rusty Griswold is currently in the show ""The Big Bang Theory"" which I believe is on Monday or Wednesdays. For some it is fun to see what they are up to now and most of the others from the movie Christmas Vacation are hardly acting anymore. This is also one Chevy Chase movie that will soon become one of your favorite classic movies to watch with your family.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

Unfortunately luck is not with him as family disputes, faulty wiring and many other bad things try and get in his way. Will the Grizwalds get their good old fashioned family Christmas? I love this movie and watch it every Christmas Eve in order to get myself into the Holiday mood. The acting is passable and the comedy is quite funny. The biggest issues really come from the slapstick nature of the film. I myself can't help but flinch whenever seeing furniture destroyed or people getting hurt but I very much have enjoyed this film for well over 10 years now.

152,anchoreddown,"TBK, FBDO, PTA, Christmas vacation, HA, CS, HA2",8,4 March 2013,"It's sometimes strange how some sequels occasionally do better than the original piece. Definitely when comes to the subject of vacation, there are lots of places to take the storyline. I think for a a series like the National Lampoon Vacation movies, there's a generation gap in between the first, third and fourth film in particular. A large portion of viewers that would have seen the original Vacation film may not relate so much to Christmas Vacation simply because there's a difference of six years. Christmas Vacation stands out the most in the series for two reasons, it's Christmas and it was the era of John Hughes films that had consecutive box office hits every year, from 1986 to 1993. It gets played on TV over the holidays about eight times on a number of the major networks and more than often watched by families, even though the film in its entirety is not completely family friendly. John Hughes knew that sometimes you have to throw a wrench in some of the family-oriented pieces. That was the perfect era to do that kind of writing, and get away with it. Overall, Christmas Vacation is a perfect piece of writing that should not be missed.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
153,simplysoda_19f,I want to spend every Christmas with the Griswold's!,10,12 December 2005,"Those of you who have seen the previous ""Vacation"" movies, know that not only do they have memorable characters, but also great lines that you can repeat over and over again, and they never get old. I loved the entire ""Vacation"" movies, and not only are they brilliantly written but the acting is perfect. My favourite actors in the entire series are: Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid aka Clark W. Griswold (Chase) and Cousin Eddie (Quaid). They have the most hilarious lines, and the scenes with them are very funny. In this movie Clark and his family decide to spend Christmas at home, and invite the whole family to visit. Awwww, what a nice Christmas story. Well, Clark decides this is going to be the best Christmas ever, so he goes through tons of hilarious and side-splitting moments to make it just that. I can't tell you what all he goes through, but this movie is one of the best Christmas movies ever. Not only does it have great characters, a hilarious script, there are those touching moments as well, which as far as I know, every Christmas movie should have. I'm giving this movie a 10 out of 10, because this movie has to be the greatest movie I've ever seen. There's not a part in it, that I don't like, or maybe I think they over-did, so this Christmas if your looking for a movie to watch, make it this one, that's if you like comedies, which personally I love.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

As well written by John Hughes so you know its going to be funny.I have always enjoyed and have watched many times during the Christmas season. I think it was great to bring the Griswolds back a little after what I thought was a downer in EUROPEAN VACATION.

156,eragonbookfan,"Sorry, not a fan. Not BAD, but not GOOD either (just mediocre).",4,27 April 2014,"Glad John Hughes went on to write & direct better films during the 90's, just sayin'.'Cause this film, though supposedly centered on ""Christmas"", tries to shove in swearing & crude humor. a Christmas movie shouldn't have that! Yeah, there were a few moments where I chuckled, but there were other moments were I didn't.I think this flick is mostly popular amongst people because of the ""nostalgia"" factor, not really because of the excellent writing, directing, or even the acting. ""Nostalgic"" doesn't mean ""better"" - it just means you're more attached to it.I liked the fact David from ""Roseanne"" is in this; I like Chevy Chase that he's in here - really liked him in ""Man of the House"" with Jonathan Taylor Thomas. And Cousin Eddy does manage to get a few chuckles here and there. And especially the sledding scene was hysterical to watch! But, like typical crude Hollywood, they manage to include at least one f-word, lots of other crude language, lots of accidents happening & things breaking, weird relatives, next-door neighbors who's purpose serves none other than to be annoyed or disturbed by Clark & his family. I mean take a look at ""Home Alone"" - that film is so popular because it had effort, brought in a big studio that could take care of it, a child actor that could act, lovely music, and all sorts of elements here and there that made it liked by the general audience.With all that said, again, John Hughes went on to make better, more appropriate and family-friendly films during the 90's. And a lot of his older films were just HARD to like or enjoy. And no this isn't a ""Christmas Classic"".This film is one of those - 4/10 - little good, so much bad.PS: I'm glad I never had an ""older sister who liked John Hughes' older 80's movies.""",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

158,DrPhibes1964,I thought European Vacation was bad,2,2 January 2021,"The humour is forced and the emotions are sappy and heavy handed. This felt more like a sitcom than a sequel to the classic (and still funny) original Vacation film. Every character felt as if they were created in writer's room. What made the original film so endearing was that they felt like real people and not cartoon characters. The most annoying being the yuppy couple next door. Everything that happens to them, and the story in general, is painfully predictable. The entire film inspired not a single chuckle. This was really bad. The only moving moment was a conversation between Clark and Cousin Eddy's daughter as she has been let down by Santa Claus on previous Christmases. Clark realises the effect of the poverty she must endure and tells that Santa will be good to her this year. It is a sweet and heartfelt moment that is lacking in the rest of the film. Instead of playing the humour at a more realistic level it goes for cheap laughs. For one reason or another I only watched this for the first time in 2021. My mother loved it but I was never really inspired to sit down and watch it. I just wanted to see for myself if it was a classic I was ignoring over the decades.

164,flynnflon,Clark Finally Wins,10,6 December 2020,"As someone who went to the theatre in '89 to see this, and had it on VHS, then DVD when it was available, I still watch this every Christmas Season. It's definitely in my top 5 Christmas movies, and my top 20 comedies.So what could I possibly add in 2020, that hasn't been mentioned before? Not much.Still, as I watch this for the millionth time (thank you cable TV and legal weed), I've decided to officially chime in.After an arguably disappointing sequel, this third 'Vacation' instalment comes back with a super-clutch performance. Think 'walk off home run, in the bottom of the ninth to win the game', level of salvation.As a fan of National Lampoon during its heyday, this was such a nice 'win' for the franchise. Even though by that point, The Lampoon was past it's prime, this movie really tied a bow on the Doug Kenney (RIP)/Chevy Chase era. See 'A Futile and Stupid Gesture' for more info.Chevy deserves all the praise for this performance. It's the culmination of all his best roles-from SNL, Caddyshack, Spies Like Us, Three Amigos, and two Vacation movies. It's crazy that this is arguably the last time he is considered funny, or leading man material. The 90's and beyond were not kind to him.Although, that could be karma. The stories are plentiful and unfortunate. But that does not change his impact on American Comedy, because that is undeniable.So here he is, at the end of a decade in which he has seemingly proven to 'critics' that his decision to leave SNL for Hollywood, was the right one. Chevy in the 80's was a powerhouse, and here he is in '89, still killing it.Same goes for Beverly D'Angelo. My goodness I had such a crush on her. She is so amazing in this film, and she often steals the scenes. She's the glue of the franchise, and her on screen chemistry with Chase is never better, than in this movie. She plays 'straight' comedy and the blissfully resigned, so well.When she clues into the Christmas Lights situation, it's so hilarious...every time. Her facial expressions are next level.I mean, Ellen and Clark's scenes are the only good thing about the second 'Vacation' movie, in my opinion.I love that they lean into the circumstances surrounding the decision to have different actors portraying the kids. (See trivia section for European Vacation)As much as I love the original duo, I always feel this siblings pairing was the best. Their comedic sensibilities are fantastic.I also loved meeting the various parents, grandparents and of course, the amazing Eddie and Catherine are fantastic as usual.I love that Brian Doyle Murray is in this.I love that when I first saw Seinfeld, I said: ""That's the girl from Christmas Vacation!"".I love that the actress who played Aunt Bethany, Mae Questel, is the real-life Betty Boop.I love that rant from Clark, regarding his bonus. It NEVER gets old.I love that the ending for this movie, was the original ending in the FIRST Vacation movie.I hate that they didn't end this franchise, here.

Although many Christmas movies come close, none make me laugh quite as much as this one does.No matter how many times I have seen Christmas Vacation, I just can't get tired of it. If anything, the movie is even better after repeat viewings and I find myself laughing before certain scenes are played out. If anyone is looking to expand their Christmas viewing staple, I would highly recommend adding this one to the list. The script is brilliantly written out with loads of feel-good moments and hilarious lines, and the casting is among the best I have seen.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

This movie has a lot of good parts, some that stay part of the Christmas world for many years to come. But most if it doesn't seem to belong in the movie. They could have done a better version that wasn't rated PG-13. The stuff in the movie that gives it that ratings only helps drag it down. While I do watch it sometimes, it really isn't the best movie. It's hard to understand what the point of it is and it seems like it lacks plot in a lot of places. I don't really like movies that lack plot, but it isn't as bad as some of the other movies that have that problem are. So it's somewhat good in the end, but could be better than it is.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
167,catfarmer1358,A Christmas classic!,10,22 September 2018,"I was surprised to log on here and see so many negative reviews. This film is a classic! This is probably one of my most favorite movies of all time (not just Christmas), and it holds up well. It is not Christmas until I watch this film. I can literally watch this movie at any time of year and feel overwhelmed with joy. I will usually watch this film right after thanksgiving for the ""normal"" holiday season, but I will often sit down and watch it multiple times a year. This film is my favorite film of the series, and in fact because I had seen this film so many times before I watched the other films, it actually ruined them for me. It's just that good! This film is the only one that takes place solely in the Griswald residence and it gives us a chance to meet other members of the extended family. Although, eddy was in two of the other films as well but he's definitely the craziest in this one! Randy Quaid is one of few actors I know of who is actually less crazy in movies than in real life. This film is jam packed with tons of slapstick comedy, and epic one liners, though most of them are probably too inappropriate to post on here! This is must watch Christmas film that I encourage everyone to add to their Christmas traditions, you won't regret it!",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
168,Aphex97,A Christmas Tradition makes the heart grow fonder,8,25 May 2001,"In my home, this was a traditional Christmas movie. I can't remember a Christmas from my youth that I didn't laugh at Clark kicking the crap out of the plastic reindeer that wouldn't light up or nearly peeing my pants when Clark flies off the handle about his boss ripping him off for the Christmas bonus.Of all the Griswald vacation movies, this is the one I've seen the most. Though I think the first Vacation is the best, this movie certainly holds a place in my movie-loving heart. Chevy Chase gives another successful performance as Clark Griswald, your everyday suburban smuck trying to deal with the holidays and relatives.Like all the other vacation movies, this movie is the continuing Griswald family adventures in everyday mundane life. However, once the Griswalds undertake any project, things are bound to go wrong with hilarious results. Nothing new or original to the plot, but silly family comedies don't need a strong plot as long as they are funny. I personally find this movie to be very funny, so it works for me.FINAL RATING: 8/10  I give it a high rating despite noticeable shortcomings in plot and other areas mainly because of its ties to my childhood Christmas. In my opinion, the movie is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it to anyone wishing to see a good comedy, but it can only be best enjoyed around the Christmas season.Noob Aalox",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

However, criticisms aside, this movie has me laughing every single time.From problems on the road to the exploding sewer system, the movie is stuffed full of misfortunes and misfits. I honestly don't know why, but It's just so much fun to watch almost everything go wrong.

171,mr composer,A highlight reel of great moments,7,16 December 2007,"Why I waited until I had seen this film for what must be the fifteenth time to comment on it, I don't know. It has taken me a while to decide exactly what I think of the film. It is a movie that I can never go through a Christmas without watching at least part of it. Although it plays homage to ""It's a Wonderful Life"", it does not quite align itself as a classic, nor does it sustain itself in humor and delight as ""A Christmas Story"". This movie is supposed to be over-the-top and sometimes it is difficult to suspend the disbelief. Randy Quaid as Eddie simultaneously induces nausea and laughter. That may be the best way to describe ""Christmas Vacation."" There are maybe a total of twenty minutes that I now frequently skip in my annual Christmas watching. What can never be missed, however, are: Any scene with Aunt Bethany, both attempts of lighting the house, all the scenes with Todd and Margot, the opening scene of finding the Christmas tree, the brilliant title animation, Clark Griswold's great monologue after receiving his ""bonus"", and the payoff during the reading of ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"". This a just a great highlight reel of really funny Christmas moments.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

175,aefrench,A Griswold family Christmas,8,19 April 2010,"This is one of those movies that makes you laugh every time you watch it, and it just doesn't get old.""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" is the third installment in the popular ""Vacation"" series. This time, the Griswolds decide to stay home and enjoy the holiday, rather than take a road trip. Clark's goal is to have what he calls an ""old-fashioned family Christmas,"" and as a result, his parents and Ellen's parents show up to spend Christmas at the Griswold house. Eventually, the house is filled with more family members, with Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid, who delivers a good performance) and his brood showing up unexpectedly, and Clark's Uncle Louis and Mae Questel (the voice of Betty Boop), showing up on Christmas Eve.The family assembling is just one aspect of Clark's Christmas dream. He is a big fan of holiday decorating, so naturally the house's exterior is covered in Christmas lights, and the eventual lighting of the house leads to some hilarious moments.Clark also has a surprise gift for his family: he plans to put in a swimming pool. To do that, he is relying on his Christmas bonus, and this becomes a sub-storyline for much of the film. It all adds up to moments that make you laugh.""Christmas Vacation"" is the funniest of the four ""Vacation"" pictures. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are good as Clark and Ellen. Questel is fun as the confused Aunt Bethany, as is William Hickey as the grouchy Uncle Louis. And Brian Doyle-Murray deserves praise as Clark's boss, who is a real snob.As I said before, if you have seen the other ""Vacation"" movies, you know what to expect. However, there are some memorable scenes, like the Griswolds searching for their Christmas tree and Clark going for a sled ride. This is a funny movie, and it is one that I watch almost every Christmas. I recommend this one.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

179,mrturk182,Where's The Tylenol?,10,12 December 2015,"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation not only stands as one of the best Christmas movie staples around the holiday season, it's one of my all-time favorite movies. This is the third entry in the National Lampoon's Vacation franchise, and it follows the Griswold family setting up their house for the arrival of their relatives. Along the way, Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) encounters a few situations that hilariously go wrong. The comedy is inventively funny, as it takes some of the recurring jokes in the Vacation movies and refreshes them for the holiday theme. The acting talent is brilliant. Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid, and Miriam Flynn all reprise their roles from the previous Vacation movies, Cape Fear's Juliette Lewis and The Big Bang Theory's Johnny Galecki step into the roles of Audrey and Rusty this time around, and there are supporting performances from Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Brian Doyle-Murray, Doris Roberts, and Mae Questel. Each performer does great in their roles, especially Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie, who steals most of the scenes. And the writing is incredible, as it balances out the comedy with moments of Clark trying to realize the true meaning of Christmas. Christmas Vacation is one of 5 sequels in the National Lampoon's Vacation franchise, and it's easily the best one. It may not eclipse the first Vacation movie, but with its holiday theme, it stands on its own. It's a timeless classic that continues to hold up today, and it has managed to stand as one of the best Christmas movies, as well as one of the funniest movies of all-time.Score: 99/100Recommendation: The highest of recommendations",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

182,Warren-Watched-A-Movie,A Christmas Comedy Classic,10,7 October 2020,"Clark ""Sparky"" Griswold is quite possibly the role that Chevy Chase was born to play. Clark is Chase's signature role with Fletch maybe being his second best remembered. While he was Pierce Hawthorne on Community for four years, the former two are what come to mind first with his character repertoire. Heck, they even overshadow his career making stint on SNL.No one could have been a better Clark Griswold than him. He can go from affable suburban dad to wistful daydreamer about a fantasy life with a woman out of his league to a father pushed to insanity in an instant. Clark is a well-meaning father who at times daydreams but in the end loves his wife and kids and just wants to give them either what he had or what he feels he did not quite get when he was younger. While the outcomes may be disastrous, Clark's heart is always in the right place.A significant part of the staying power of this film is that many families have had that one crappy Christmas. There is almost always one that stands out because it did not go just right. They are going to visit relatives and things just have not worked out as well as planned. Or relatives come to them and nothing goes their way no matter how careful the planning. That is what happens in this movie, but it is taken to a hilarious extent. This is that rough Christmas amplified.Despite all the craziness and all the insanity, the film at its core is sweet. It is about the season and the quirky dynamics each family has that may seem unusual to an outsider but are perfectly normal. This is exemplified in the moment when Clark gets stuck in the attic and he is reminiscing. It is a touching moment in a very outlandish comedy. Family moments get a comedic twist throughout.There are just so many classic scenes in this movie. Aside from getting trapped in the attic, there's Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) shooting down Santa Claus. There is Cousin Eddie kidnapping Clark's boss Frank Shirley (Brian Doyle-Murray). There are the Christmas lights that Clark meticulously hangs causing a blackout. Clark and the family getting the tree at the beginning of the film. The squirrel that tagged along with the tree. That poor, poor cat. And it is all side splittingly funny. They even reference the original film with the Walley cups. Among the best and most comical is the sled scene when Clark uses the experimental lubricant. Anyone that has shot down a hill uncontrolled on a sled can relate to that scene.The Griswold children get recast as they often do. Juliette Lewis takes over as Audrey Griswold who was previously played by Dana Barron who took over for Dana Hill. Johnny Galecki takes over as Russ Griswold who was originally played by Anthony Michael Hall with Jason Lively taking over for him. Most times the kids age from film to film but not here. Could you consider these kids never aging a running gag?We meet some additional Griswold family members. All great actors that you know from at least one other thing. John Randolph plays Clark's father Clark Griswold, Sr. Prolific actress Diane Ladd plays Clark's mom Nora. William Hickey is one of those distinctive looking character acters with an equally distinctive voice. Here he is Clark's Uncle Lewis. Mae Questel, the voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl, plays Clark's hilariously senile Aunt Bethany. The legendary E.G. Marshall is Ellen's (Beverly D'Angelo) father Art. And finally, Doris Roberts appears as Ellen's mom Frances.National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation was written by John Hughes who based it on his short story ""Christmas '59"" that appeared in the National Lampoon magazine from which this movie gets part of its title. Despite feeling that this was only a vehicle for Chase, Hughes created an enduring classic that manages to be festive, have some heart, and is genuinely hilarious. Not an easy thing to accomplish under such circumstances. Factor in a change of directors from Chris Columbus to Jeremiah Chechik, it is impressive this has staying power. Those two behind the scenes things tend to make a mediocre movie at best.National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a classic Christmas disaster comedy. It is funny and well written with great characters and tons of classic moments. It is an absolute Christmas classic.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

I respect their opinion, and so I sat down to watch it with high expectations.It started out well. I laughed quite a bit at the ridiculousness of the jokes and the setup of the movie thus far. I quite liked the idea of an affectionate, but rather incompetent father. I think the part was very well played out, and up until the thirtieth minute or so, I had no complaints. However, after that, I began to get bored. Frankly, the jokes went from good to fake and cliché, and on some, I simply shook my head and wondered 'Who would find this funny?'There were some moments in the later films that made me hope that the bad jokes were just a minor lapse, and the movie would get right back on track... but apart from these rare moments of shining, the rest of the movie seemed dull and uninteresting. The plot really is no big deal: it's quite common, the incompetent family bonding at Christmas, but this film got nowhere near the laughs and simultaneous seriousness that films like 'The Ref' achieved. This movie stands on it's jokes alone, and, frankly, they aren't that good.It is not a horrible movie. I'll give this movie a 5.8 total. Round that up to a six.

Unlike the other vacation films the Griswalds don't travel anywhere. They have Christmas right at home. However just because they don't travel doesn't mean that it isn't a funny movie.The film is about Clark Griswald (played by Chevy Chase who does his role perfectly) trying to create the perfect Christmas for his family. However much like the other films things constantly go wrong or don't succeed.

189,DanielStephens1988,I DID IT!,9,10 December 2020,"Great Christmas comedy that everybody can relate with, especially if you're a family man. The one part that gets me every time is the ending when Clark looks up to the night sky with a big smile on his face and says ""I did it"". That sums up the whole film for me - just in those three words.We are all searching for success, family, friendship, and trying to make sense of this life. But Clark is the symbol that defines all of that. Throughout our lives, we go to work; we pay our bills; we fall in love; we get married; we have children; we change baby diapers. And then eventually we get to that point in our lives where everything is in place - the perfect home; the perfect job; the perfect Christmas dinner with the love ones. Clark is at the point in his life where he has accomplish all the hallmarks of a 'successful' person. So epistemically, the pinnacle of all his success is to invite all his family to Christmas, to share his love and acknowledgments. And yes, bad things happen on the way, but if you do it out of love for the sake of family, usually good things come your way.There is no greater happiness for a man than approaching a door at the end of a day knowing someone on the other side of that door is waiting for the soud of his footsteps.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
190,xx-slay-n-xx,"All Lines, No Punch",4,30 December 2020,"National Lampoon is a name that has entered into the common lexicon of classic films. One often hears it in the same breath as The Goonies (1985) or Beetlejuice (1988) in order to capture its cultural impact and hilarity. It occupies the niche in the heads of those who remember the good old days of the 1980s, when life was simpler, men were men and the president was a vindictive moron but at least kept it somewhat in the closet. As such, I came into it with high expectations, fully expecting the titular lampoonery and non-stop gags. What I got instead, I am still not entirely sure how to parse. It is a film which is one part comedy, one part slice of life and one part C-grade garage sale VHS, and yet it has not been able to do any of these things successfully.This movie is just not funny. Nearly every joke just seems to fall flat on its face with hardly an attempt at launch. Oftentimes there simply is no joke even where there should obviously be one. The comedic void left without so much as a crumb of comedy leaves one gaping with anticipation that is never quenched. I felt myself asking far too often ""where was the joke?"" and ""that's it?""I want to chalk this up to the time. The 80s were just different, weren't they? We all know that. The style of comedy was a bit less in the teeth and more on the nose. Writers didn't want the audience to do much work in getting their comedy. Films like Back to the Future (1985) and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989), while entertaining and memorable, are stuck with the hazy lens of camp that is ever present in 1980s film and television. It simply can't be taken as seriously as drama and sci-fi of the same age, and often fails to hold up to the spinning of time's wheel. On the other hand all you have to do is look at Monty Python, Mel Brooks or anything with Bill Murray or Leslie Nielson to reassure yourself that people actually did know how to tell jokes 30+ years ago. It wasn't just their slapstick silliness, but the punctuation and timing of cleverly constructed puns and allusions.Christmas Vacation suffers from all the unfortunate idiosyncrasies of 1980s film without having any of the saving graces. It doesn't have a particularly strong cast. There is only so much that Chevy Chase can do to hold up the entire weight of the film. He does an admirable job, but there is too much to support. It doesn't have particularly over the top gags. The most we get is a dad falling off the roof and some fairly expected Christmas tree gags. It doesn't have that supporting funny man who comes in with the extra oomph. Clearly they wanted Uncle Eddie to be that character, but he is the biggest sinkhole for punchlines in the entire film. Everything that comes out of his mouth feels like an unnecessary rant that trails off into the clouds.Like many nostalgia trip films, I watch the credits roll and wonder how something like what I watched could become such a staple of modern filmography. I am not saying this is Citizen Kane or that people think of it that way, but this thirty year old move was evidently popular enough to be screened at my local drive-in as a special event film. Something about it had to have made an impression on people. It could be that it's just a Christmas movie and during Christmas every film of that kind gets a special exemption from normal scrutiny. It would also be that it's before my time and I just don't get it. There were moments where I found myself saying ""yeah, I get it,"" but these moments were few and far between.I don't try to go into a theater with the intent on picking apart every detail and finding the flaws in a film. But nor do I watch without intent and focus. Some people have told me to just enjoy this film and don't think too hard about it. I want to do that. Truly I do. But this wasn't the one for me. There is almost nothing happening here. I felt like I was watching a home movie of some real Christmas dinner instead of a film with a high production, famous cast and a series of films preceding it. There's a litany of other Christmas movies to choose from, and next year that's exactly what I'll do.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

195,qubit01,Add it to your Christmas collection!,8,8 May 2013,"Every year around the end of November, I break out my Christmas Movie Collection; a very specific set of Christmas movies (mostly comedies) that includes National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (along with, to name a few, Ernest Saves Christmas, Trading Places, Gremlins, Elf, and Die Hard, hey it takes place during Christmas!, and of course all the animated ones). In fact, Vacation is the first movie out of the collection that I always watch, after cozying up with some hot cocoa and a warm blanket, with a blazing fire going. In my mind this has always been the best of the ""Vacation"" movies, and it is perfect for a Christmas movie night! Not only does Chevy Chase give his best performance as Clark W. Griswold in this movie, but the whole family is great. Beverly D'Angelo is sooooo hot in the lovely dress she wears toward the end, and her attempts to keep her sanity while dealing with Clark and all the visiting relatives are very funny, the kids are OK, but have some good moments, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (also very lovely)is great as the angry, uppity neighbor that hates Christmas. Randy Quaid gives a funny performance, too. But this movie is pure Chevy Chase, and his unrelenting determination to have the holliest, jolliest Christmas and the best and brightest decorated house on the block is what drives this movie. But when he doesn't get his expected Christmas bonus from his tight boss, he finally snaps! Plus, this movie features one of the best opening credits sequences ever!If you are fan of the great Chevy Chase and his goofy style of comedy, and if you are one of the few people left who enjoy Christmas (not Holiday) movies, then you will definitely enjoy Christmas Vacation.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

And--we watch this movie. For us, it's as much a part of Christmas as adorning the top of our tree with an angel or attending a Christmas Eve church service. We laugh constantly from onset to end and want to watch it again. Chevy Chase, simply put, is one of the funniest men ever to act. It is a sad shame that he does not do as many movie anymore.

Maybe it's because I don't understand Americans humor quite well. Though there is many hilarious moments in Christmas Vacation I'd rather call this poor comedy. Character played by Chevy Chase is was more irritating than in first Vacation movie. It doesn't made me laugh at once. More simpatico character was cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) who is stealing the whole show. Comedy writing genius of the 80's John Hughes couldn't deliver this one.

It's funny, it's cute, it's fun for the whole family to enjoy. It's ten thousand light years ahead of THIS dreck, and it doesn't even try to be so slimy.If crude obvious sexual humor, dogs humping legs and stereotypes done to hell and back even by the time it was made are your version of funny, this is your movie.

If you came from a big family that only got together at Xmas you will find something in common with your childhood Christmas in this movie. I laughed til I cried the first time I saw this movie and I still laugh as hard 25 years later. The only thing is, you can only watch it during the holiday season. It just makes it that much better. There are other great comedies out there, like Airplane, Caddy Shack, Groundhog Day, Something About Mary, but none of them have as many laughs as this movie.

The cast are brilliant,the scenes hilarious,and we can all relate to certain scenes throughout the film. Everything Clark touches turns to rubbish but he still perseveres and does not give up.

It's the perfect example of the Holidays from Hell.  Nothing seems to go right for Clark Griswold.  He gets trapped in the attic, it takes him forever to get the lights working, and the disasters just keep coming.  Randy Quaid really shines here as the redneck cousin Eddie.

Like most couples starting out I was certainly not well financially I was living with my mother-inlaw. Yea Yea I know hold back the tears.... Anyway the only advantage I had living with the bieatch was that she had HBO. Me and and my wife where nestled together in bed and started watching this movie. At first I was not going to watch this movie because of Chevy Chase (not a big fan) but the laughs started to get more and more intense as the movie went on. There are so many season in this movie that over the years they have been quieted by so many of my friends. My favorite scene is when Eddie brings back Clark's boss and the swat team busts into the house and yells FREEZE. The first couple times watching I never noticed that Beverly Deangelo gripped chase nuts. then the police officer intros himself and deangelo shakes his hand and goes back to chases nuts (classic for back then). I admit I started a tradition every year with my family (now diviorced anyone single?) and we watch this movie at Thanksgiving along with Bad Santa, Its a wonder life and Christmas story. I hope that when I make it to the golden 70TH year of my existence on this planet and I am watching this movie on my new kick ass space age surround sound equipment I will always keep the tradition alive.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
214,rifle12,Excellent seasonal film,8,17 March 2008,Funny from begging to end. Some of the other National Lampoons stuff is poor and trying to hard but this is relaxed and so enjoyable. The Griswolds journey through the holiday is brilliant from getting the tree to the Christmas day Fiasco. Watching Clarke with his precision plan layed down to a tee going wrong is classic while the world around him with the annoying but funny brother in law and extended family destroying whats left of his sanity. To me this is the film for the Christmas season and not seeing it over the holidays is like thanksgiving without the turkey. Prime scenes are anything to do with him attaching the fairy lights to the house and when he's trapped in the attic. Chevy chase at his best (unfortunately nothing else he has done since measure's up)and the beautiful Beverley DeAngelo is great (But she doesn't get naked in this one).Watch and enjoy!,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

And the other characters were funny too. The nasty father in law, the crazy, senile aunt, the cigar smoking uncle with the wig, the hillbilly relative Eddie, etc. The touching moments necessary for a good comedy (like comic relief in a tragedy) are well woven in. I almost cried when Clark was stuck in the attic and looking at old movies of when he was a child with his mother there. Of course that whole scene was funny with the boards that we plopping up, hitting him in the head. And the yuppie neighbours were hilarious. Nice touch.However, I just cannot get into this as much as the old one. It is not something I wold watch again I don't think. I might...but not like I would watch the original. The story line did not flow as well. I think it did in the old one because they had somewhere they were going. Here they did not have that, and they did not have any sense of counting down until Christmas Day. Well, funny, but not as funny, and not as well written out.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

Griswold chop down and transport a 20-foot evergreen to his 10-foot ceiling house, or hear Aunt Edna say-- er, pledge 'grace'!  My Goodness... Eddie's kids?  One with the ""unidentified lip fungus"" and the other without a tongue?  My Goodness!  These actors were hired to do a masterpiece.  Okay, okay, so it's not 'Titanic,' but, people,... 'Godzilla' got like a 7 or something like that.  [Whether 'Godzilla' actually got a 7 is not relevant to my point... really....]  All I'm saying is that 'Godzilla' is a God-awful movie that should have never been made. Crack kills and so do bad movies.Those who voted lower than an 8 should be ashamed of themselves, for they should stick to their 'It's a Wonderful Life.'Chevy over Jimmy, anyday, anytime!Classic my rear!

Language such d*ckless and f*ckin is used. I would watch out if a young kid is watching it with the kind of language that's in it. This movie is very funny. I think this the best out off all the Vacation movies, this one is my favorite. This movie is shown on the 25 days of Christmas with ABC family. This is one of the highest rated movies of 1989. Randy Quaid makes a good character too. His role as cousin Eddie is funny. Chevy Chase, Randy Quaid and Beverly Dangelo are who make the characters for the Vacation movies.

""You taught me everything I know about outdoor illumination."" They just go on and on. It will have you and the family saying them every time you watch it.

I really want old Sparky to have the perfect Griswald family Christmas and I root for him every time I watch it. The scene in the attic is priceless. Randy Quaid is a thoroughly annoying Uncle Eddie. And the actors who play the grandparents are wonderful too. Really lots of fun for the whole family and lots of making fun of everyone in the family.

And quite understandable as well.Who wouldn't have reacted similarly...All characters-really ALL-in the movie are played excellently. Yes,also Audrey's.Juliette Lewis had to play the same character as,for example,Pamela Tiffin in ""one,two three""-more or less a silly goose.It's quite understandable If you don't like such characters-but-as in the case of ""one,two,three""-why blame the actors for playing them convincingly? By the way,Griswold's yuppie neighbors also don't make a very pleasant impression- because (not although) they are played so well.For me-and obviously for many others too-Christmas without ""Christmas Vacation"" cannot be a real Christmas.I would like to watch it more often than once a year,but I have the-unjustified,many may say-fear of liking this masterpiece somewhat less if I watch it ""too"" often.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

The neighbors are also hilarious as yuppies that have to deal with the crazy neighbor with the tacky Christmas decor. From bright lights shining through their windows to a giant icicle that destroys their stereo. Julia Lous-Dreyfuss is similar to her character, Elaine, on Seinfeld. All of Griswold's relatives show up for Christmas, including Cousin Eddie. Eddie drove a filthy travel trailer up to the curb of his house.

245,jason69535554,This movie delivers!,9,9 January 2008,"One of the best holiday movies I've seen,OK a little to much, but this is a traditional movie treat for us at Christmas. You feel like you're spending Christmas with your family when you watch it. It's so realistic too. Everyone struggles with Christmas lights, in laws. The slapstick will keep you hooked. Chevy Chase once again delivers. Great job by Brian Doyle Murray as Chevy's boss. He brings that comedic element to the movie that will keep you hooked. Beverly D'Angelo does a great job too as any synthesis of Chevy Chase (the light switch scene) and you get that Christmas atmosphere watching this. This movie is a Wonderful life on steroids!! (no offense to Roger Clemens!!) Must see!!",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
246,chguenette-1,The Best Vacation Movie Period. (Warning: Spoilers),10,6 October 2002,"It doesn't matter if you watch this movie on Christmas Eve, the Fourth of July or whenever, it is an absolutely hilarious film! This time around, instead of going to some exotic location for a vacation, Clark Griswold decides to ""have a fun, old-fashioned family Christmas"" at home. So he invites his parents, his wife Ellen's parents and his uncle Lewis and aunt Bethany, who is well past senile, and later gets a ""surprise"" visit from his cousin Eddie and his family in a rusted ""Tenement on wheels"" RV.Well, the holiday goes about as haphazard as you'd might expect, pretty much not unlike a holiday any of us ever had. From Clark's gallant attempt to have a house decorated with 25,000 imported Italian twinkle lights (and nearly killing his yuppie neighbors in the process when the lights flash on and off), to exploding turkeys and burnt Christmas trees and destroyed rooms courtesy of Eddie's dog Snotz(sp?) and a squirrel, until it finally culminates in Clark receiving an envelope from his company. He expects it to be his Christmas bonus (which would pay for the swimming pool he wants to put in), instead it's a Jelly-of-the-Month-Club enrollment, which sends Clark into a hilarious, classic tirade that has to be heard to be appreciated. Basically, he wants his boss brought to his house so he can bitch him out. Naturally, Eddie obliges, bringing out the local SWAT team, who add just a little more chaos to this holiday. Eventually, Clark's boss realizes the folly of his ways, and adds 20% to what he earned that year, surely enough to get the pool and fly the whole family in for the dedication.If there was a rating higher than 10, I'd give it. Do whatever you have to do, within the law, to GET THIS MOVIE!",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

Laughter to crying. There are even a few tense.. **Scary** moments. Like when the door bell rings and the family is at the door. Most of us can attest to the horrors of having family over for Christmas. And that first nock at the door or doorbell ring send a horrific chill through your spine.

There are so many hysterically funny scenes in this movie, you will want to rewind the best parts again and again.

His particular brand of comedy appeals to a certain generation, and this movie is chock full of it. Relying on mainly slapstick humor and good comedic timing, this movie parodies the textbook family Christmas get-together. In fact, I was not surprised to learn that this movie birthed the term Griswold House--""a house or display that has been decorated with way too many holiday lights, so as to be almost blinding.""I will have to watch the other Griswold family movies before having a definite opinion, but from the sound of the other reviewers, this is the best one. I even recognized some familiar faces--Raymond's mother from Everybody Loves Raymond, and one of the nerds from The Big Bang Theory.The movie does have its laugh out loud moments, and has some memorable quotes to boot... but not enough substance to be recommended for anything other than a Christmas Eve family movie option.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

Chevy Chase is perfect playing the role of Clark Griswold. Beverly D' Angelo if funny as Clark's wife Ellen. Randy Quad is hilarious as cousin Eddie. The whole cast is outstanding. This film will not only make you laugh until you cry,(Moderate Spoiler) it will leave you feeling good and in a great mood for the holidays.

A gem!,10,5 September 2001,"The film that inspired a whole generation of exterior illuminators!Subsequent to the release of this film, houses soon began Christmas-light makeovers, which I think really adds to the atmosphere of the season. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are superb in this John Hughes classic Christmas comedy. Clark W Griswold Jnr is anxious to have the 'perfect' old fashioned, fun, family Christmas. But, as usual, nothing goes according to plan: Getting stuck under a truck in the opening minutes... becoming psychotic over the failing of the millions of lights he's added to the building... ruining the Christmas of Tod and Margo (their yuppie, bourgesois next door neighbours)...Eddie kidnapping Clark's boss because he didn't receive his bonus cheque, needed to pay for a swimming pool...a storm sewer exploding...etc... There are lots of good moments in this movie. My personal favourite is when he takes Eddie (Randy Quaid) and the kids sledging: a silicone-based kitchen lubricant his company invented is smeared onto his sledge, propelling him like a rocket! I have a selection of Christmas movies I stack around the video at this time of year. Christmas Vacation is one of them. I have seen it so many times yet I am still not bored with it. Note: There is mild bad language in the PG version, but for those with younger children, some versions have worse. I really don't know why Hughes did this; this film could be accessible to all. As is usual with John Hughes, those typical huge mansions (as with Home Alone and Uncle Buck) feature. The scenery is very Christmassy and it just might get you in the mood...10/10.

What a disappointment. I am a true fan of everything Chevy Chase, and then this disaster. Well a few years later, while working at an undisclosed laboratory a few weeks before Christmas, I along with the other employees were greeted with a message that the Christmas Bonuses for that year would not be coming. My boss decided that the lab needed a little cheering up, so he set up a big cookout party for all of the employees. There was food everywhere, placed on a table with a TV/vcr set up right at the head of the table. Guess what we would be viewing that day? Yep, we watched Christmas Vacation. We all stood around the table with our paper plates in our hands, allowing the owner to sit directly in front of the TV screen. It was a perfect setup, we all talked and carried on, with the movie being no more than a minor distraction, but as if on cue, right at the moment where Clark receives his jelly of the month club subscription you could have heard a pin drop.

I agree with others that it happens to be Chevy Chase's funniest (downhill from there on out!) and Randy Quaid's performance was on the money.

Boy I tell ya, there's nothing more funny than when he starts having a breakdown in front of the family because the lights don't work, that was good. If it weren't for Cousin Eddie in the movie, it would be down to a 4. I really thought the beginning wasn't exciting except for the store scene, but when Eddie came, the movie went up two ratings.

WE put huge expectations hoping everything will turn out fine and of course they don't. This was the 3rd ""Vacation"" film and most likely the most popular. Millions of us could relate the original ""Vacation"". The family road trip during the Summer. However 99% could relate to something in ""Christmas Vacation"". In this film it is of course holiday time and Clark wants to have a big old fashioned family Christmas. This means not only is his parents coming for Christmas but so is his in-laws/ Most importantly however Randy Quaid returns as Cousin Eddie. This film is a laugh a minute. If you don't like cussing and are prudish stay away. I have seen this film every year since 1989 and I still laugh as hard as I did when I saw the first time.

281,AYB75,That's a nice and naive pleasant Christmas movie. Yet hugely overrated.,1,21 December 2018,"Before I saw this movie I thought an IMDB-rating above 7.0 is a reliable indication of a good/high quality. That's why I decided to watch it - becuse it carries a 7.6 IMDB-rating, so it had to be good. Well, not quite so.
The movie is a genuine attempt to offer a nice light Christmas movie. I thank you for the efforts but genuine efforts and best intentions don't always result in a good final product. The end result is mediocre and the average 7.6 IMDB-rating is simply misleading. Because of this I feel I was tricked into watching it and this makes me sceptical about the whole IMDB-ratings as reliable indicators for the future.
I'm giving it a 1/10 not because it is SO bad, no, I can't say that, but this is my way to protest against this overall rating of 7.6 as of Dec-2018 which I find very strange and certainly exaggerated.

I have watched this movie at least 100 times, and I have laughed out loud every single time.  The humour never stops!

Chevy Chase is simply irresistable in this movie!  The holiday hustle and bustle and the stife to make the ""PERFECT 'Fun Old Fashioned Family Christmas"" is what we all hope to aspire.  It's nice to laugh at ourselves because we can completely relate to all aspects of this movie!  Great family fun!  We know the lines by heart!!!",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
296,rmcnaughton-1,It could happen to you!,9,20 October 2008,"The holidays are the hot time for those who love family to gather, and make merry. For the other 90% of the population it's a hassle, a burden, and frankly a pain in the butt. Without a doubt we've all experienced the ""worst Christmas ever"" but probably not like the Griswolds. This is without a doubt one of my favorite holiday films because even though family gatherings can be a pain, it's always there to (hilariously) remind me to be grateful.This is without a doubt one of my favorite Chevy Chase movies, and it puts newer ""National Lampoon"" titles to shame. If you're a ""deadpan comedy"" fan and haven't seen this movie you owe it to yourself to wait until it gets cold, start a fire, and pop in this movie.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
297,warpreactor,Chevy Chase Christmas Disaster Jolt,2,2 December 2008,"I'm a noteworthy Chevy Chase fan. Not a huge fan, but noteworthy. I'm 34 and have somehow managed to never see this flick. So when I jumped on Amazon to purchase a slew of Christmas movies this year, and ran across this ""hidden jewel"", I was very excited. Lots of good feedback on it.This has got to be the poorest performance of Chase's career. He completely coasted through all the witless dialogue. It was as if someone wrote the script over the weekend. The bloopers are very obvious, and the jokes are antiquated even for the 80s. The sets, or lack thereof, were so drab that I think they intentionally threw in the Nicolette Scorcese scenes just to distract us as much as the main character. The only actor who showed an ounce of spark was Randy Quaid, but his character was so redneck and purile that it was hard to like him.1989 was an earlier era in filmaking, a more innocent time when shoestring budgets and obvious comedy were more invisible to the viewer. It's possible I could have found this amusing if I'd caught it in it's hayday, and subsequently relegated the film to cherished memory of yester decade status. But unfortunately, I saw it for the first, and now last, time tonight. This disk is a coaster.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

Merry Christmas!, Phil x",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
299,dbrockle,"Big heart, good intentions, the Clark Griswold in us all!",10,21 December 2002,"Clark Griswold, like in the original ""Vacation"", has a way of showing that the inner male that so many of us have hidden away, is really very common.With the best of intentions and a very big heart we all screw up but when viewed with the right attitude life can be humourous. I wish they'd make another ""Vacation"" as Chevy/Clark and Beverley get older and the kids are gone.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
300,cdun44,Outstanding Movie,10,1 November 2010,"My husband and I watch this movie every year and last year we watched it every night the week before Christmas. It is without a doubt one of the funniest movies ever made. I very highly recommend it anyone and everyone. Good movie to watch with the entire family. A must see. Clark Griswold and his family have an interesting holiday to say the least. From picking out the Christmas tree, to having the family over, to having Cousin Eddie show up, is just the most far out holiday ever. The scene with the squirrel is both mine and my husbands favorite part of the movie. The neighbors also play a great bit. You don't see much of them but what little you do see it good. The end is good and the lights on the house are just too much. Everyone, rent, buy, or go to the theater to see this movie.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

302,keithdrac,"Frustrating, disturbing, and unfunny torture film.",3,1 January 2018,"I hated this film. It's disturbing and hard to watch, not funny. It's a torture film. Most of the characters are extremely unlikable, but I felt that the main character is too sympathetic for the movie to work in the least bit. I felt so bad for Clark because of how much he goes through and how much crap he takes from people. The best scene by far was when he stood up to the obnoxious characters, because I sat through the entire film waiting for that to happen. The cinematography, color, and music (by David Lynch's composer, Angelo Badalamenti) were all good. It is not an absolute waste, but it's a frustrating experience. Certainly not worth a watch. I fail to understand the popularity.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

304,tugless,"A great Christ,mas movie but............",9,23 December 2004,"This movie is always a Christmas tradition around my house. i gave the movie a (9), the only reason i didn't give it a (10) is because of one curse word. To quote another Christmas classic the ""mother of all curse words"" was used by Character Clark Griswald. I understand the frustration of the character but the word is totally uncalled for. I have three young children who ask me to play the movie every year, and every year I have to jump up and hit the mute button when he talks about Bing Crosby and Danny !@#$ing Kaye. just didn't need it, the movie would be great without it, whoever thought this was necessary should get a stocking full of coal. Still a great movie, so I'll keep on jumping up and hitting the mute..",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
305,ehgcomp,Missing Scenes,9,3 January 2005,"I believe there is a version of this with two additional scenes. One is where Cousin Eddie actually kidnaps Mr. Shirley and wraps the red ribbon around him, while his wife is screaming. Also there is a scene where Eddie and Catherine cook the ""exploding turkey"". They discuss the temperature and the length of time to cook it, as I recall something like 8 hours at 200 degrees or something like that. Can anyone tell me where to get a version that contains these scenes, or am I just imagining that I saw them? I have searched the web but I do not find any mention of these scenes. I bought the Special Edition thinking they might be in it, but alas! No Luck! Somebody please tell me I'm not crazy, and that these scenes DO exist!",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
306,sugarfreegum15,Hilarious movie!,9,11 February 2014,"Synopsis: Chevy Chase stars as Clark Griswold who is determined to have a perfect family Christmas. In this third movie in the National Lampoon Vacation film series, Clark and his family have one entertaining disaster after another. Clark's wish to have a small family party ends with a full house of bickering family members, pets and even the SWAT team.John Hughes brings another hilarious comedy to the big screen. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold accompanied by new actors as their children, Rusty (Johnny Galecki) and Audrey (Juliette Lewis).The movie begins with Clark and family going to a Christmas tree forest and ends up with Clark drag racing a beat up truck and ending up wedged under a semi. When the family finally decides on the perfect tree, they realize they have forgotten the chainsaw. The tree they choose is way longer than their car and still attached to its roots.The movie gets funnier when Cousin Eddie and family show up in a beat up RV expecting to spend Christmas with Clark. Eddie decides to empty his RV waste into the neighborhood drainpipe which leads to several explosions throughout the movie.The sledding scene with Chevy Chase is the most memorable in the movie. Clark oils his sled and takes a wild ride through the roads and forest to end up in a Wal-Mart parking lot unhurt.Chevy Chase carries the film with his comical delivery. His facial expressions and crazed actions keep the audience entertained. Mae Questal as senile Aunt Bethany keeps the audience laughing with her confused actions and comments. The scenery includes real life images. The plot keeps the movie interesting and the audience wondering what will happen next.This movie is nearly perfect and I would give it a 9. The only thing I would improve upon is having Clark's boss undergo more of a fight over the missing Christmas bonus instead of just giving in and adding twenty percent to Clark's bonus.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
307,gkgrayson,subtle funny parts,10,9 April 2005,"We watch this movie every Christmas on Christmas Eve (the whole family gets together).We laugh harder every year as we unpeel the humorous layers of this film.Watch for when Clark's wife checks out Snot's balls.It's hilarious.How about when Eddie returns with Clark's boss and kicks him in the ass as they walk up the path to the house.How about these quotes: ""Why is there water everywhere Todd?"" "" I don't know Margeaux."" The Ray Charles Christmas song during the attic scene is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard.His voice is so sweet.The eyes crossed,kicked by a mule,falls in a well comment still cracks me up.I love it when Clark's Dad says that if he (Clark) needs any help that he (Dad) will be up in his room taking a nap.How about the office scene? ""Good morning ,kiss my ass,kiss his ass,etc.""This movie is more fun to watch in a large group.Enjoy.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
308,scott-969-345299,Mildly funny....once.,2,25 December 2020,"Christmas Vacation is one of those films that doesn't get better with repeated viewings. First time through, it was mildly funny. Second time, tiresome. Third time (others in my family think it's a favourite), boring. Wouldn't miss it if I never saw it again.

309,sour471011,Christmas Vacation,10,25 September 2014,"A classic and must-see film during the holiday season is National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Christmas Vacation, released in 1989, was brilliantly written by John Hughes and directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. This laugh out loud comedy promises to have everyone entertained throughout its 97 minute runtime with performers such as Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, and Randy Quaid. Christmas Vacation is bound to entertain the whole family through its many big name performers, its surprise plot twists, and its relatability to many families. Christmas Vacation is filled with many surprises beginning to end. Chevy Chase (Clark Griswold) and Bevery D'Angelo (Ellen Griswold) want to get the whole extended family over for one big ""Griswold family Christmas."" A family dinner is planned with a highly anticipated summer surprise announcement for the Griswold family. Little do the Griswolds know though, the Christmas weekend will be a lot more work than they originally thought. The Griswold family Christmas is filled with frozen eyes, burning trees, a surprise visit from Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie), a police raid, and much much more. Can the Griswolds overcome their holiday troubles and salvage a pleasant family get-together? Christmas Vacation makes a very good connection to the viewing audience because many people can relate to the Griswold Family. This movie is a classic example of how family get-togethers, especially around the holiday season, cannot be all they are cracked up to be. Even though the Griswolds have a lot of hardships in the movie, they show how family can come together to make the best of poor decisions. Clark and Ellen Griswold make one of the most relatable husband and wife duos in the film industry. Bickering goes on between Clark and Ellen throughout the movie due to their lack of wise decisions/ ideas. However, they always end up supporting each other in the end no matter the outcome. Randy Quaid serves as the perfect example of that one annoying family member that everyone has. Pretty much everything he does in the movie ends up being a giant failure. Even though Quaid's character is not the sharpest tool in the shed though, he definitely wins the award for having the biggest heart. The director did an excellent job at making this movie relatable to all viewers through the various personalities each character possesses and through the many events that occur throughout the Griswold family Christmas.If you are looking for a good movie to watch with the entire family this holiday season, look no further than National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. The cast and director have come together to make a perfect movie that relates to everyone who ever has had or attempted to have a family holiday party. This film will make you laugh and say ""wow, our family is kind of like the Griswolds!"" This year be sure to deck the halls by watching the one of a kind Christmas special - National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
310,perrymehta1,The best Christmas movie ever made!!!!!!,10,14 January 2006,"This is the best vacation movie in the whole series. It's a lot better than the crappy 2nd one ""European Vacation"". It is also better than Vacation and Vegas Vacation also. This one did the best at the movies way back in '89. There is a reason for this. It's ******* awesome!!!! This time Clark wants a quiet Christmas at home with his family and all their relatives. That all changes when Cousin Eddie (played once again by the awesome Randy Quaid) himself makes an appearance. When Eddie makes an appearance that is when the movie gets a hell of a lot funnier. Actually the whole damn movie is funny. The part I love is when Clark is stapling the Christmas lights on the roof and he staples his shirt. I started laughing my ass off at that scene and also when the raccoon gets loose inside the house!!! There are 25,000 lights on the roof, an exploding turkey on the dining room table, and a S.W.A.T. team taking siege outside. This and A Christmas Story are the only 2 movies I watch around Christmas. I used to watch Home Alone but that was before I got into the Vacation series. Christmas Vacation is a hell of a lot better than all 4 of the Home Alone movies. A Christmas Story and Christmas Vacation are 2 of the best Christmas movies ever made!!!!!! Trust me, if you have'not seen C.V. what the **** are you waiting for?? Go to your videostore and get it now!!!!! You won't be disappointed!!! I wasn't. I've seen it 50+ times.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
311,Mons-Pubis,A masterpiece of Christmas comedy,10,21 June 2016,"As a fan of the ""vaction"" series, I can safely say that I enjoy any exposition of the Griswold family. However, I can safely say that this is the best in the series, and for many reasons. The biggest I can think of is the large amount of screen time given to Cousin Eddie. He steals every scene he is in with his good-natured, low- brow, low-IQ ways. He truly makes this movie. The duo of Chevy Chase as Clark and Randy Quaid as Eddie is pure hilarity. I also enjoy the the extended family, with performances by Film and TV veterans like John Randolph, Doris Roberts, William Hickey, and the memorable performance of Mae Questl as Aunt Bethany.Also, I would be remiss if I left out the fact the Beverly D'Angello was at her peek in this movie.to sum things up, this is a Christmas classic, and if you haven't already seen it, or even if you have a million times already, watch it. It never stops being funny.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation

There are so many great scenes and lines, from start to finish. It is pure gold from the line of ""Vacation"" movies. I watch it every year (throughout the year!). I usually have a ""holiday movie fest"" at my house where I invite people over around the holidays and we watch many different kinds of holiday-related movies from the classics to the Rankin-Bass animated stories, and everyone who has ever seen this at my house as laughed and laughed and laughed.There are so many great actors in this movie and Cousin Eddie is just the funniest!

313,JeremyallenCaudill,There Is No better Christmas Movie,10,14 July 2006,I love this movie!!!! I watch it more than once a year. It is still very funny. I hope they will continue to make more of the good national lampoons movies With Chevy Chase and quit making these perverted National lampoon movie they have at now. If for some reason you have not seen this movie don't bother renting it just go out and buy it is well worth the money you will spend laughing your head off. If you have younger children just wait for it to come on television it comes on at least once a year around Christmas time. I also suggest National Lampoons Vagas vacation also featuring Chevy chase but this one is by far the best.,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
314,preppyinpink93,excellent and entertaining,10,26 December 2005,"Very funny,I have watched all of the Vacation movies,but this ones takes the cake. Chevy Chase is one of my favorite actors and this is his best work. My favorite actor in the movie would have to be Randy Quaid. Very funny guy. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie has to see it! Chevy Chase plays Clark Griswald who plans an ""good old' fashioned Christmas"" for his family,but his plans don't go smoothly. One of the situations is a huge Christmas tree. Another is having too many people at the house. The favorite character among most is Aunt Bethany(played by Mae Questal).Aunt Bethany is an old women who forgets easily. She wraps up a cat,recites the pledge of allegiance instead of grace. This movie is entertaining and it is a classic.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
315,tubehifi-1,A Christmas classic,10,20 December 2005,"Quaid and Chase have a chemistry together that translates into hilarious entertainment. We get together with friends every year just to watch this movie as part of our Christmas traditions. It has a PG rating for some colorful language that is part of Clark Griswold's (Chevy Chase) ranting. These times are few and far between, but are there and are not suitable for young kids. The movie would have been just as entertaining and enjoyable without the language, but for whatever reason the writers felt that the script needed them. Otherwise the film is suitable for kids of all ages, as it depicts the situations arising from a holiday visit from in-laws, grandparents, and most notably, ""Cousin Eddie"" (Randy Quaid), and his family. Cousin Eddie owns us and we laugh until it hurts year after year.",National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
