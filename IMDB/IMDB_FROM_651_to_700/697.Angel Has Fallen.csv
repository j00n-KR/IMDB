0,Leofwine_draca,The series has still got it,7,3 May 2020,"The third part of the unlikely FALLEN trilogy sees Gerard Butler returning to the fold for a different type of presidential assassination; this time around, Butler himself is the focus as he's set up and subjected to a manhunt by members of a sinister conspiracy. Yep, it's another 'wronged man' type thriller, a film that goes all out in presenting a different kind of action spectacle. There are wide scale drone attacks, huge explosions in the woods, and an electrifying shoot-out at the climax that's well worth the wait. Although these films are cheesy and derivative, and ANGEL in particular employs some very dodgy CGI effects at certain points, I can't help but love them regardless. There's something endlessly earnest about Butler's gruff protagonist and the director certainly knows how to keep the pace going, even if you've seen it all before. It's fun, and that's the main thing...",Angel Has Fallen
1,SnoopyStyle,Not smart enough,5,23 November 2019,"Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is protecting President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) and facing medical issues. He and his wife Leah (Piper Perabo) have a daughter. He has been estranged from his father Clay (Nick Nolte) for many years. His friend Wade Jennings (Danny Huston) is a private security leader. The President is on a fishing trip when they are attacked by drones. Mike and the President are the only survivors. Trumbull is in a coma and VP Kirby (Tim Blake Nelson) takes over. FBI Agent Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith) arrests Mike after uncovering a mountain of evidence of his guilt. Trumbull's guardian angel has fallen.The movie isn't smart enough and the characters aren't smart enough. Of the two blowing up the White House movies, I like this slightly less. I have no problem with the action but this franchise's writing has never been quite up to par especially since it has no comedy. It has to be treated seriously but not serious enough to expect smart writing. The most obvious bad writing trope is the clueless FBI agent. Arresting Mike is an acceptable move but she needs to show that she is smarter than the obvious evidence laid out for her. Apparently, Mike has $10 million and no escape plan. When Mike calls home, I thought that he was doing that to tell the FBI (who are obviously waiting with their phone tap) the other van with the dead bodies and his suspicion about Wade. Non of that happens. So he called home simply to say Hi to his wife. Wade is not much smarter. When Trumball survived the drone attack, the obvious next move is to kill the President and not wait for him to wake up. Send in more drones. Apparently, Wade spends tens of millions on this plan but ran out of drones. It's also great that the cops line up to get mowed down as cannon fodder in that great scene. It's also very obvious that the wife and daughter are getting Taken in this story which is why a normal person would set up the home alarm. A kidnapping is still possible but it needs smarter writing. The only smart writing comes from a deep state conspiracy setting up the Russians as the bad guys. I don't know how much Putin paid but it's worth every penny. Even an action flick deserves smarter characters and competent writing.",Angel Has Fallen
2,Prismark10,Angel Has Fallen,4,13 November 2019,"I thought London has Fallen was poor. The third film is better, a serviceable action film with a forgettable plot.Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is now protecting President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman.) An assassination attempt with drones leaves al the security personnel dead. The president is incapacitated and Banning gets the blame for the attack.Evidence shows that he has been colluding with the Russians for money and he was the only survivor apert from the president.The vice president who now has executive power, plans to use private contractors to get even with Russia.Banning finds himself on the run, he heads to a remote area to hide out in the woods where his Vietnam vet father (Nick Nolte) lives. He is one of these Unabomber types. Banning has to clear his name and get the people who framed him.The film opens with Branning on a training session at a private military facility owned by his friend Wade Jennings (Danny Huston) who runs a private military company. As Huston usually plays oily villains, the twist is immediately given away.It is an enjoyable enough film as long you overlook the brain dead logic. You do have to question how effective the president's security protocols and team are. A private army of about a few dozen men easily outmaneuvered and out fired them.",Angel Has Fallen

Soon he learns that he was framed and now he has to prove his innocence and to protect the life of Trumbull.""Angel Has Fallen"" is a full of action thriller in the third film of Mike Banning's franchise. The plot is engaging but predictable and with a great cast and action scenes. The film never disappoints and fans of the genre will certainly enjoy the adventure of Mike Banning.

4,nogodnomasters,Don't worry about finding me. I'll find you.,8,26 August 2019,"The mercenary corporations lead by Wade Jennings (Danny Huston) want President Trumbull (Trump Bull would be too obvious) dead. His policy of not using the private sector in wars is hurting their bottom line. Only Mike Banning (Gerald Butler) with compressed discs, insomnia, and on pain killers can save him, except he is being framed as the man who attempted to kill Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) and is America's most wanted. Nick Nolte has a long anti-government diatribe as Mike's dad.This film is not a mystery. It is overly predictable down to the final mano-a-mano episode. High octane. I wish they had played ""Smokey and the Bandit"" theme song during the truck scene. Still time to edit.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Angel Has Fallen
5,kosmasp,Angel Butler,7,25 September 2019,"Leonidas cannot fail ... I mean fall ... right? Sorry I'm mixing up my movies here. But you can see the action star Butler going for it again - a third time. And if you thought the other movies were crazy and unrealistic ... well you were right and this one adds to that! What did you think I was going to say? In all seriousness - do not take this movie serious.Predictable story, predictable twists and turns ... and an even relatively mild Nick Nolte. But the story itself is quite out there ... really wild and really ""explosive"" (pun intended). A lot of action and a lot of nonsense ... and it can be quite some fun, if you allow it to",Angel Has Fallen
6,classicsoncall,"""You're a disaster waiting to happen.""",7,22 August 2020,"I didn't know this movie was part of a 'Fallen' trilogy going in, so the good news on that score is that it holds up pretty well without knowing what went before. But boy, you do have to stretch the imagination to consider a Vice President (Tim Blake Nelson) would team up with a private military contractor to start a war with Russia for fun and profit. That's akin to a sitting President signing off on the Iranians to develop a nuclear weapon, but I digress. There's action aplenty in this one, with an early drone attack and a rather outlandish attempt at killing the President (Morgan Freeman) by blowing up the hospital he's in. Talk about overkill. You can tell where the scriptwriters fell asleep during the scene when newspaper reporters and security agents were guarding the Banning home, so two of Wade Jennings' (Danny Huston) thugs and Clay Banning (Nick Nolte, looking even worse than his mug shot), simply walked around to the back door. Apparently 'condition red' is some sort of super secret lingo that got Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) off the hook for the assassination attempt on the President, so effective that I'm still thinking about it. As with any Gerard Butler movie, I'm always left with the impression when it's over that if they ever come around to doing the life story of Soupy Sales, Butler is the guy for the starring role. Can anyone doubt that?",Angel Has Fallen
7,jboothmillard,Angel Has Fallen,4,25 August 2019,"Olympus Has Fallen was worth watching, and London Has Fallen was okay, now comes the third film in the Fallen series, a series that has received mixed reviews, but has made a lot of money. Basically, following the events in London, Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler, also producing) undergoes training at a private military facility, overseen by his friend Wade Jennings (Danny Huston), CEO of paramilitary company Salient Global. He is recommended for the position of Director by the President of the United States, Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman), to replace retiring Secret Service director David Gentry (John Wick's Lance Reddick). Banning is suffering from migraines and insomnia with regular visits to several doctors, he hides this fact, and starts taking medication for the pain. When the President goes on a fishing trip, armed drones attack and kill the entire Secret Service protection detail, Banning survives and saves the President, but both are incapacitated, and Trumbull goes into a coma. FBI Agent Helen Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith) finds substantial evidence indicating that Banning could be responsible for the attack. The discarded van used to carry out the massacre contains Banning's hair and DNA. Thompson is also suspicious that Banning survived the attack. Banning is subsequently arrested and ordered to be incarcerated. While Banning is being moved to a detention facility, his transport is ambushed. Banning escapes after killing the assailants, he unmasks one of them and realises they are agents who took part in Banning's training exercise. Banning calls his wife Leah (Piper Perabo, replacing Radha Mitchell), letting her know he is alive. This call alerts Thompson and FBI, leading to a car chase. Banning manages to escape and reaches the woods, where his father Clay (Nick Nolte) is living. Meanwhile, Vice President Martin Kirby (Tim Blake Nelson) is sworn in as Acting President due to Trumbull being comatose. It is later revealed that Wade Jennings is the one who framed him. Banning and his father see Jennings' men on surveillance approaching the house; Clay detonates explosives, killing all the would-be attackers. Banning and Clay escape, during which Mike reveals to his father that he has a wife and daughter. Later, Leah and her daughter are about to be kidnapped by Jennings' men when Clay saves them. Kirby tells the press that Banning is responsible for the assassination attempt with support from the Russian government. Meanwhile, Thompson finds the bodies at Clay's cabin, she may now believe that Banning was set up. Thompson and another agent go to meet Jennings, but he kills both of them. Trumbull awakens from his coma and Kirby is revealed to be involved with Jennings. Banning reaches the hospital where Trumbull is being treated, realising he is not safe, but he is captured and arrested, but Trumbull orders Banning is released. Banning leads Trumbull to safety with help from Gentry and other agents as Jennings blows up the Intensive Care Unit of the hospital. Banning and Trumbull hide in a corner office of the next building as Jennings' men pursue them. After a long gun battle, Jennings attempts to escape via helicopter, but Banning destroys the helicopter and mortally wounds Jennings. Banning is exonerated while Kirby is arrested for treason due to the evidence uncovered by Thompson. Clay decides to live with Banning and his family. Feeling guilty for his failure to protect Trumbull and his undisclosed ailments, Banning offers his resignation. Trumbull forgives his mistakes and offers Banning a promotion to Director of the Secret Service, which he accepts. Also starring Michael Landes as Sam Wilcox and Mark Arnold as CIA Director James Haskell. Butler does alright as the framed hero, Freeman (who has played the US President before) replaces Aaron Eckhart and is fine in his short time onscreen, Huston is suitably grizzly as the double-crossing villain, and Nolte is a welcome addition as the hero's dad (is it me, or do a lot of third films in trilogies have someone famous playing a father?). Once again there is nothing really extra to get out of this third popcorn-fodder entry, the ""proving innocence"" storyline has been done before, there are no famous landmarks destroyed, but the father and son combo gets some giggles, and the scenes with chases and explosions do keep the pace going, an average action thriller. Okay!",Angel Has Fallen
8,paul_haakonsen,Action-packed and entertaining...,7,12 November 2019,"This movie was actually quite good, but then again, so was the first movie ""Olympus Has Fallen"" from 2013. Oddly enough, I never got around to watching the 2016 movie ""London Has Fallen"" - but I will definitely do so, especially after this movie was as good as the first one.""Angel Has Fallen"" is an action movie, and it is a type of action movie that brings you back to the nostalgic action movies from the peak times of the likes of Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Seagal, Van Damme, etc. So if you grew up on those iconic action movies and enjoyed them, then you would definitely also like the movies with Mike Banning (played by Gerard Butler).The storyline in ""Angel Has Fallen"" is straight forward and it is actually quite good. I really enjoyed how director Ric Roman Waugh brought the storyline and script to life on the screen. And I will say that you quickly and easily immerse yourself into the movie.The acting in the movie was good, and there is a good group of actors and actresses on the cast list, with the likes of Gerard Butler, Danny Huston, Nick Nolte and Morgan Freeman.It should be said that ""Angel Has Fallen"" focuses a lot on the action sequences, which is definitely enjoyable - I particularly enjoy that. But at the same time, director Ric Roman Waugh manages to keep enough focus on the storyline as well and also makes it a non-linear storyline, so there are some nice ups and downs throughout the course of the movie.I am rating ""Angel Has Fallen"" a solid seven out of ten stars, and this is definitely an action movie that is well worth sitting down to watch, and I would say that this is also a movie that you can watch more than just once.",Angel Has Fallen

This is not a film that the critics can get their pencils sharpened about. It's a pretty run of the mill shoot 'em up with Gerard Butler out to prove his innocence after being framed for the attempted murder of the US president (and just about everyone else). He doesn't know who to trust and must combat both friend and foe to realise his goals. Morgan Freeman turns in a likeable performance as the President (again) in this fast paced action-drama too.",Angel Has Fallen
11,zardoz-13,Better Than Average Nonsense,7,10 September 2019,"The third time isn't as charming for ""Shot Caller"" director Ric Roman Waugh's ""Angel Has Fallen,"" the second in the president's bodyguard trilogy, which commenced with ""Olympus Has Fallen"" (2013) and then ""London Has Fallen"" (2016). Despite a stellar cast of familiar faces and lots of high-octane explosions and shootouts that punctuate the plot, this tolerably entertaining entry ranks as the more formulaic, springing fewer surprises than its predecessors, and lacking a shred of old-fashioned fun. Indeed, indestructible Gerard Butler is back on guard as the president's top watchdog Mike Banning, and Banning is every bit as beleaguered here as he was when the fireworks erupted in ""Olympus."" For the record, Butler and Morgan Freeman are the only surviving cast members from ""Olympus"" and ""London"" who reprise their roles. This time out Morgan Freeman governs the Oval Office as President Trumbull, while President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) has departed. Furthermore, ""Coyote Ugly"" star Piper Perabo has replaced Radha Mitchell who played Banning's wife Leah in the first two entries. Several faces fresh to the franchise participate in this new, larger-than-life escapade. Among them is Nick Nolte as Mike's reclusive father, Jada Pinkett Smith as a tenacious FBI agent, Tim Blake Nelson as the bespectacled Vice President, Danny Houston as one of Mike's old army chums, and ""John Wick's"" Lance Reddick as another Secret Service agent on Trumbull's security detail. Sadly, Waugh and writers Robert Mark Kamen of ""The Transporter"" and Matt Cook of ""Triple 9"" have cooked up a conspiracy thriller bristling with an inventory of genre clichés. You'll figure out the identities of the villains long before their treachery is exposed. Clocking in at a minute over two hours, ""Angel Has Fallen"" shoehorns one improbable action scene into another with reckless abandon. Meanwhile, the writers do a skillful job of painting Mike Banning into a corner as a traitor on the Kremlin's payroll. Nevertheless, you know nothing can keep a good guy-like Mike Banning-down.As ""Angel Has Fallen"" unfolds, Mike Banning has been lying about his health. Headaches and insomnia plague him. Rather than jeopardize his status as an active Secret Service Agent, Mike consults private practice doctors who know nothing about him. He has been gobbling painkillers like candy, and he refuses to discuss his health issues with either President Trumbull or his wife Leah. Mike's conscience bothers him as he leaves to oversee security on Trumbull's annual fishing trip. Earlier, he had visited his old army pal Wade Jennings. Jennings owns and operates an elite military style training camp in the boondocks and as a private contractor provides mercenaries for Black Ops missions. Although Mike advances further than anybody on the obstacle course, Wade still tags him. Mike assures Wade he will recommend Jennings and his obstacle course training facilities. Anyway, while Mike is watching Trumbull fish, the President confides in him that he wants Banning as his new Chief of the Secret Service. Mike agrees to ponder the proposition, but his headaches get him excused from the detail. He hasn't gone far when flocks of drones sweep over the President's 18-man security detail and blows them to smithereens. Mike watches this daylight massacre in shock. He orders his last surviving agent to push the President overboard into the river. The drones target the Presidential fishing vessel and obliterate it with the Secret Service agent. Mike swims out and saves the President and then helps him escape. The moment our hero awakens in an ICU hospital ward, FBI Special Agent Helen Thompson (Jada Pinkett-Smith of ""Set It Off"") accuses him of murdering his entire team and trying to kill the President. Mike stares in disbelief at his wrists cuffed to the bed and complains he has been framed. Meanwhile, President Trumbull survived the assassination attempt, but he lies in a coma unable answer questions about the attack.
Of course, the FBI refuses to believe Mike has been framed. Later, the Feds haul him off in a three-vehicle convoy to a detention facility. Predictably, Mike doesn't remain in captivity long. Unknown assailants sideswipe the convoy and leave no witnesses behind. Our defiant hero surprises these gunmen and beats the crap out of them. Eventually, Mike stumbles up to a gas station and uses a pay phone for a collect call to Leah. Eavesdropping on Banning's home phone, Thompson pinpoints Mike's whereabouts. Before the Feds careen onto the scene, Mike commandeers an 18-wheeler, but the local constabulary spot and follow him in hot pursuit. The authorities stick to Banning like glue, until he crashes the truck and vanishes into the wilderness. Mike reaches the home of his reclusive father, Clay Banning (Nick Nolte of ""48 HRS""), who lives off the grid like a hermit. No sooner has Mike caught forty winks than an army of gunmen storm Clay's acreage. Mike tries to flee, so the authorities won't arrest Clay for aiding and abetting a felon. Abruptly, all Hell breaks loose! Mike watches in awe as his bearded Smurf-looking father triggers explosive charges galore around his cabin. The next day Mike stacks the dead shoulder-to-shoulder on the porch of Clay's cabin. Mike and Clay slip away quietly in an inconspicuous Chevy pick-up, while Feds swarm the cabin. They scratch their heads over the dead gunmen. The Bureau cannot identify them because the men don't show up in any database! Now, Agent Thompson has second thoughts about Mike's guilt.The drone assault in ""Angel Has Fallen"" is unforgettable. Not even the hospital wing implosion afterwards overshadows the drone attacks. Everything boils down to standard-issue genre business, tweaked by an occasional surprise. Jade Pinkett-Smith figures prominently in one of those surprises. Nick Nolte and Gerard Butler make an amusing father and son act. Despite the far-fetched heroics in this high-octane opus, director Ric Roman Waugh stages several earsplitting firefights with kinetic vitality and has stunt men somersaulted during all the fireball explosions. ""Angel Has Fallen"" gets by on a wing and prayer.",Angel Has Fallen
12,Uriah43,A Fugitive Trying to Clear His Name,6,17 February 2020,"This 3rd film in the series begins with a veteran Secret Service agent by the name of ""Mike Banning"" (Gerard Butler) contemplating retirement as the years have taken a toll on him physically. Although he would like to be promoted to the position of Secret Service Director, as it stands he is content to finish out his time and guard the President of the United States, ""Allan Trumbull"" (Morgan Freeman) for the time being. Unfortunately, after only he and President Trumbull survive a well-planned assassination attempt, he becomes the leading suspect and from that point on he has to evade both the FBI and the Secret Service in order to catch those responsible and clear his name. Now, although I didn't especially care for either ""Olympus Has Fallen"" or ""London Has Fallen"", I thought that this particular movie was much better in that it had better acting and a decent script to go along with all of the action and pyrotechnics. Make no mistake, however, this film still suffers from several unrealistic action scenes which, unfortunately, seem to be par for the course with movies today. Yet despite this fact, I found the film to be entertaining for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly.",Angel Has Fallen
13,phd_travel,Very enjoyable and exciting - sometimes older is better,8,5 September 2019,"Just when you think they have run out of ideas for action movies, this exciting and inventive thriller comes along. I enjoyed all the sequences from the drone attack to the hospital shootout. Gerard looks suitable as a worn out pain killer addicted secret service man at the end of his rope and his face looks puffy. In fact a lot of the cast are older and all good. Nick Nolte is well suited for once as Dad. Jada Pinkett Smith plays an FBI agent. The plot is about a secret service man framed for an assassination attempt on the President.Don't listen to any bad reviews. This one is worth a watch.",Angel Has Fallen
14,SimonJack,"Lots of Hollywood pyrotechnics, violence and gore in this third ""Fallen"" film",6,28 December 2019,"""Angel Has Fallen"" is the third film in which Gerard Butler plays U.S. Secret Service agent Mike Banning. All three were Hollywood versions of pyrotechnics. As with the earlier two (""Olympus Has Fallen"" in 2013 and ""London Has Fallen"" in 2016), this film is mostly a display of explosions, gunfire, and violence. The six stars are mostly for the technical aspects of such mayhem and making the gore of the bloodshed seem real.Films like this don't require much acting, just lots of action in the form of quick movements, dodging, jumping, climbing, vehicle chases, and shooting and fisticuffs.Only two more members of the cast are noted actors, and they both were prominent more two film generations ago. Morgan Freeman (age 82) plays President Trumbull and Nick Nolte (age 78) plays Butler's dad, Clay Banning. This type of film has been a meat and potatoes production for Freeman over the past 30 plus years. He has often been cast as a high government official, a professor, doctor, scientist or magnate of some sort.The plot is very simple and obvious. While it classifies as a crime and espionage action film, it hardly fits the category of mystery. Most should be able to guess who the bad guys are within a few minutes, and it doesn't take long to figure out who was behind the assassination plan.The film does make some of the FBI and Secret Service agents as not too smart. Knowing Banning and his capabilities, they so quickly believe all the easy ""clues"" that make hum a suspect. The grand-daddy of them all is finding $10 million in his off-shore bank account. So, such a capable Secret Service agent as Banning wouldn't know that such a bank account could be discovered easily? There are some other far-fetched aspects of the film, but that's the license of filmmaking.Those who enjoy lots of action, violence and explosions should enjoy this film. For others, it will be a mixed bag. This should end the ""Fallen"" series with Butler, though. He's definitely showing his age (50) which is about the max for these types of films.",Angel Has Fallen
15,thesar-2,"But, Always Gets Up",5,5 April 2020,"Trust me, this isn't a great movie, and the 2nd half is 2x the movie the 1st half is, but it's solid 50/50. It's recommended and yet, nothing groundbreaking and feels like a 90s action movie all over again.This is a weird one. It's not even for fans of the original two. I guess all you have to take from those movies is that ""Angel"" is always loyal to the President. And you don't need two movies for that; this is pounded into your head more times than the character gets pounded in his head.Too bad it's so damn long. The first half hour is hyper-slow and sets up both the most obvious ""secret"" villains and a John McClane from Die Hard with a Vengeance. It's almost worth just knowing that what I just told you and skipping the first half-hour so it's only the 90-minute movie it should've been.The action, few and far in between is okay, but its not until Nick Nolte shows up that it's fun. Never, ever thought I'd say that. And, on the subject, how on Earth does Nick Nolte look and act the exact same in 2003's Hulk and here in 2019's Angel Has Fallen?I digress.

But Angel Has Fallen came at the perfect time, end of August/early September when there's not much else out in theaters, at least blockbuster movie wise. While not better than the first entry 'Olympus Has Fallen', it is certainly superior to 'London Has Fallen' from 2016, and it makes for a nice cap to the 'Has Fallen' trilogy. That is, if this is the end to the series. And look, there's a ceiling to Gerard Butler's acting talent, but he's more than serviceable in a role like this and last year's Den of Thieves. Oh and Nick Nolte? He's so dang good in this movie it feels like he's on an entirely different level than everyone else. I'm here for it.7.0/10",Angel Has Fallen
18,Cineanalyst,"Goes Without Saying, but, Boy, it's Hackneyed and Predictable",2,29 April 2020,"The action scenes are acceptable, I suppose, in this third installment of presidential-assassination-attempt duds, ""Angel Has Fallen,"" at least as far as generic car chases, explosions, gun play and an ounce of fight choreography go. Sure, a green-screen composition here or a possible violation of the axis of action there might not look quite right, but it's nothing some choppy editing can't work around. No, the real problem is in the awful writing, which is done no favors by some conspicuous casting and characterizations. Whatever fun I may have hoped for from the guilty pleasure of some macho action junk is ruined by a series of straightforward tropes that telegraph the entire picture ahead of time.Hero's friend turns out to be the baddie who betrays him? Seen it, and I certainly see it coming with a gigantically conspicuous opening scene establishing this until now (in the series) unknown friendship between the characters, the fact that the friend runs a private defense contractor (always evil, in movies at least), and that he's played by Danny Huston. Yeah, no wonder whether the Nazi in ""Wonder Woman"" (2017) has another nefarious scheme up his sleeve this time. And, wow, could they have made Tim Blake Nelson look anymore suspicious as the Vice President? Maybe if they gave him a dastardly mustache to twirl, but, otherwise, I doubt it. Plus, wasn't this plot of the next in line of succession turning out to be behind the evil plan the basis of ""White House Down"" (2013), the other action flick about a terrorist attack on the White House released the same year as ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" the first movie in this series. And, of course, the hero being framed and so must clear his name setup has been the basis for ""The Fugitive"" TV series and movie and countless other adrenaline burgers.Even bringing in Nick Nolte as a crazy survivalist doesn't help. Heck, they even include an after-credits scene in a failed attempt at levity. Who do these hacks think they are--the Marvel Cinematic Universe? After seeing the same junk I'd seen before in ""Olympus Has Fallen"" and ""London Has Fallen"" (2016), I didn't think the series could fall any lower; I was wrong.",Angel Has Fallen

Yeah, just check them out and you will probably understand because, well, who cares what the critics say, and who cares about the ratings on IMDB, if a premise rakes in money, then Hollywood will keep on churning out sequels. Mind you, it wasn't as if the cinema was all that packed when I saw it, not compared to, say, Infinity War, but then again that made an awful lot more money than these ones did.Mind you, as I indicated, it isn't as if these films are any good, and this one is basically no exception. It is basically a mindless action film which you pretty much end up working out what is going on, and who the bad guy is, pretty quickly. Actually, it isn't as if they are trying to be subtle or anything like that, but then again, people probably don't come and watch this film for it being a suspenseful thriller full of twists and turns, but rather they come and watch it for the action.The thing is that in this world, being the President of the United States is actually a lot more dangerous than it is in the real world. Honestly, the sophisticated nature of the attacks are just amazing. Mind you, they do happen to have a civilian contractor (or should I say mercenary company) pulling the strings here, namely because they are pretty upset that the whole let's contract out our military to the lowest bidder is getting a bit too long in the tooth and the current president wants to do away with it.Honestly, I can't say that I really felt that Banning's character was all that deep. Then again, as I suggested, it is an action movie. I guess it is just making the secret service agents into action heroes, because they do seem to get left off the scene in favour of the FBI and the CIA. On the other hand it is all yay, yay, USA, and all that, but honestly, what would one expect. Interestingly though, it is still good old Russia as the bad guy because, you know, with a huge market on the other side of the Pacific, we can't actually use the US's real rival, but just pick on the other kid on the block that, well, we've always had a problem with.Oh, and the other interesting thing is that the still seems to be an awful lot on wilderness in West Virginia, that is if it was actually filmed in West Virginia. The idea I got was that it has pretty much been devastated by the coal industry. Then again, film makers are able to make things appear much different than what they really are.",Angel Has Fallen

The plot is totally predictable and there's a handful of dodgy special effects... But I found myself thoroughly entertained by the peril, violence and non-stop action... I do not really like Butler.... I do not know why, I just do not connect with him.. Also, Nick Nolte is absolutely AWESOME in this! Where has this old my friend been? He absolutely killed it!!!

25,paulclaassen,Formulaic and doesn't quite live up to its predecessors.,5,18 December 2020,"If you're into suspense action movies and you enjoy the 'Bourne' franchise, then this will surely satisfy you.'Angel has Fallen' is not quite the same as its predecessors. Angel refers to the President's top security agent, or Guardian Angel. This is Mike Banning (again very well portrayed by Gerard Butler), who is being framed for murder and attempted murder on the President.The film features some amazing photography, and then some photography that's so shaky, its hard to follow the action. The visual effects during the attack on the agents were incredible. The visual effects during the attack on the hospital were not that great (in fact, that entire scene was maybe a bit too much for the film's own good). The hand to hand fight scene between the protagonist and antagonist at the end is so cliched, I wish Hollywood would finally abandon this trait. Yawn, it's in every single action movie...In general, this is a good film with a very good script. The action is intense and exciting. There's maybe a bit too much comic relief for my liking - compared to the previous two films - but nevertheless still good. The film's first half certainly was much better than the second half.",Angel Has Fallen
26,cruise01,Action packed thriller that tops the previous films.,8,24 August 2019,"Angel Has Fallen (4 out of 5 stars).Angel Has Fallen delivers an explosive action packed conclusion to the Fallen series. This time the plot following Mike (Gerard Butler) being framed for the attempted assassination of President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman). Mike being on the run from the federal agents and trying to find out who is behind the attack on the president before it is too late.The plot is forgettable and predictable. But it is what it is when it's trying to set up the characters and putting them in action set pieces throughout. Mike being on the run. There is car chases, him fighting bad guys in the forest, and trying to stop them from assassinating the President. There is more to the story with its predictable twist with the villain. Which was shown in the trailer. Mike's former friend Wade (Danny Huston) does play an interesting antagonist. Shows up to catch up with Mike. Talking about their military time together. And next scene later, Mike is betrayed. Also another fun addition was Clay (Nick Nolte) who is Mike's father. And he lives off the grid in the middle of the forest. Trying to stay off the Government's radar.There are plenty of action to make this film worth watching on the big screen. Definitely, one of the films that you leave the brain outside the theatre and enjoy the film for what it is with its action packed direction. Plot may not be memorable. The action is sure as well is entertaining and exciting. Director Ric Roman Waugh handled the action sequences well. Better than the last two films. The second movie was boring and repetitive with its action. The first movie was poorly lit and confusing.Overall, Angel Has Fallen is a good action film. The plot is forgettable and the twist is predictable. The direction is action packed throughout and definitely keeps you on the edge of the seat with the intense gun shoot outs.",Angel Has Fallen
27,leonblackwood,Same as the rest of the films in this franchise! 4/10,4,16 February 2020,"Review:
Well, I got exactly what I expected from this film! Loads of military action, corruption, and of course, Gerard Butler (Mike Banning) saving the day. They did try to make the storyline complex, by adding a bit of drama and various twists, but the outcome was inevitable. As soon as the film started I worked out the whole plot, especially when I saw Danny Huston (Wade Jennings), who always plays the baddie. The action wasn't too bad, and there is a sense of intensity throughout the film, but once you've seen one of the films in this franchise, you've seen them all. Butler put's in his usual ""one-man army"" performance, and Morgan Freeman (President Trumbull) didn't do anything special, and I found Jada Pinkett Smith a weird casting as Agent Thompson because it was such a small role. Nick Nolte put in an emotional performance as Clay Banning, but apart from that, it's exactly what it says on the tin. The far-fetched action scenes kept the movie slightly interesting, along with the fact the Mike Banning became ""America's Most Wanted"", so if you want some mindless action, then this is the movie for you. Personally, it's the type of film that you have on in the background when you have visitors around, so I won't be watching again in a hurry. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Ric Roman Waugh, who brought you Exit in 1996, In The Shadows, Felon, Snitch starring Dwayne Johnson, That Which I Love Destroys Me and Shot Caller starring Nikolaj Coster-Waldau from the Game Of Thrones. After watching the bonus material, they did dig deep to make the military action look authentic, and they tried there utmost to make the plot seem realistic, but I don't think that they brought anything new to the franchise. As Gerard Butler produced the movie, and he worked closely with the director to perfect the film, it's obvious that they need fresh eyes to come up with something original because the ""saving the president"" concept has run dry.Budget: $40million
Worldwide Gross: $147.5millionGenre: Action, Thriller

It is packed with action, a good two hours of turning off the mind and letting things blow up.
One of the best additions to the franchise is Nick Noltie as Clay Manning,Mike's pops, an old marine still in shell shock and whacked out of his mind.

In hopes to evade capture by FBI and the group that framed him, question remains will he get to the bottom of this, before it's too late.
An entertaining sequel, great action and suspence. Although it was lacking a little in the mystery part. Nick Nolte steals the show has Butlers estranged father.

Gerard is a secret service agent that is protecting Morgan, the President-Morgan has been promoted from being the Speaker of the House in Olympus and the Vice President in London to the President now. Danny plays an old military buddy of Gerard's that wants Gerard to put in a good word with the President/Morgan in order to get a lucrative government contract job. There is an attempt on Morgan's life and everyone is killed, except Gerard.

Gerard goes on the run to find out who set him up and Jada is the F.B.I. agent investigating Gerard. Nick plays Gerard's estranged father-Nick left Gerard and his mother when they were younger and Gerard has not forgiven him for it. There is plenty of action and suspense throughout and as the end credits start, there is a scene with Gerard & Nick-nothing at the very end.

Throughout ANGEL HAS FALLEN, two U.S. Army buddies--""Mike"" and ""Wade""--do their best to frame, maim, and kill each other (mostly for money). In Real Life, a military comrade fatally shot the AMERICAN SNIPER of movie fame on a gun range. In Real Life, FORENSICS FILES provides viewers with a steady stream of ""fraternal"" homicides (often over women) taking place within the military milieu around bases here and overseas. In Real Life, a ""Band of Brothers"" care officer slew more than a dozen trench mates at Fort Hood, TX. Speaking of Ft. Hood, ANGEL HAS FALLEN's Mike was born there. That should have been enough to wise him up to the fact that most ""servicemen"" are just in it for the money. When the Job Market is bad, Enlistment goes up. If you dine at a restaurant full of military folk, most everyone will be grousing about their nickel and dime concerns. It's the goal of nearly every Army Ranger like Mike and Wade, or Navy SEAL, to become a better-paid mercenary fighter (of killer for the highest bidder). Who can blame them, when their current Elder ""Brother"" (or Clown-in-Chief) constantly bad-mouths POW's and Gold Star families?

41,kirbylee70-599-526179,SAVE THE PRESIDENT AGAIN,10,17 December 2019,"Franchises are what the movie industry seems to be built on these days. In the past there were only a few, most notable the James Bond series of films. But with the rise of several successful franchises like the ELM STREET films, HARRY POTTER films and more, it seems a new one pops up each year.In the 2013 film OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN we were introduced to the character of Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), the top notch Secret Service agent in working the Presidential detail who fell from grace when he saved the President but not the First Lady. He redeemed himself and then in 2016 returned again in LONDON HAS FALLEN, guarding the President this time in London as a terrorist attack on the commander in chief goes down. Of course he was successful.Here we are 3 years past and now we have ANGEL HAS FALLEN arriving on disc, the angel being referenced being Banning, the President's guardian angel. The film opens with Mike going through a training session at the camp his old Army buddy Wade Jennings (Danny Huston) has. Jennings has retired from active duty and now runs a mercenary for hire group.Mike has been groomed to take over as the new director of the Secret Service by both his outgoing boss David Gentry (Lance Reddick) and President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman), the VP in the first two films. The only thing keeping him back is pain issues having sustained so many injuries in the past. Rather than confront this he takes pain meds and hides his condition.On a private fishing expedition for the President Mike is showing fatigue and the Trumbull sends him ashore. As he pilots his boat back the entire Secret Service details is attacked by a swarm of drones armed with explosives that takes them all out. Before the drones can kill the President, the agent with him throws him in the water and Mike swims to his rescue. For some reason the drones do not shoot him.When he wakes he finds out why. Trumbull is in a coma and a trail of clues lead to the conclusion that Mike was behind the assassination attempt. FBI agent Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith) places him in custody and he is transported to a safe facility. Along the way his convoy is attacked by the same people really responsible for assassination attempt, Wade Jenning's group. Mike escapes these captors, realizes who they are and heads out to find assistance.The only person he can trust and the one that he feels no one will ever connect him with lives in a cabin in the woods by himself. They've not had contact in years. It's his father Clay Banning (Nick Nolte). There are issues between the two but it provides Mike a place to rest. Until Wade's men track him down and attempt to take out both men. What they didn't count on was loner and conspiracist Clay being prepared for just such an occasion.Determined to save the President and reclaim his good name Mike sets out to do just that. Each step of the way he has to worry about Wade and his men stopping him as well as the countless number of police, military, FBI and Secret Service people searching for him. It's no spoiler to assume the outcome. The fun is the journey getting there.When this film was released in theaters I can remember the bad press that it got. Critics felt it was too over the top. They said it was too unbelievable. But the fact of the matter is that this is the exact reason that people went to see these movies to begin with. They're popcorn films, movies that you sit crunching away on salted, buttered goodness while having a blast at the movies. Filled with tons of gun battles and explosions it was the perfect summer movie. And yet it disappointed at the box office.That shouldn't stop you from enjoying it at home. Butler continues to play the role with ease. Freeman does a great job as well, the wizened bureaucrat who knows there are few he can trust and who is proven true as the film unfolds. Piper Perabo takes over for Radha Mitchell as Mike's wife Leah. And Nolte does a great job as an old curmudgeon who has the chance to make up for lost time.It's a fun film that provides all of the action you've come to expect in the series. With films like JOHN WICK, THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS series and more seeking to grab the reigns on action films this one gives them a go for the title. It might not rule them all but it is a movie that packs a punch.",Angel Has Fallen
42,masonfisk,GOOD FOR WHAT IT IS...!,7,4 September 2019,"The third entry in the Fallen series finds our intrepid secret service hero, played by Gerard Butler, now on the verge of becoming the president's (returning series champ Morgan Freeman now commander in chief) head of the service but his harsh work regiment (he's been taking too many pain killers & doctors have told him his lifestyle has to change) & his newborn at home has him rethinking his future. Enter an old army buddy (a blind man can see this plot twist from a mile away) who asks Butler to put in a good word w/the president to consider his contracting outfit for future conflicts. During a fishing outing, a swarm of armed drones decimate the service outfit w/Butler & Freeman (who he saves) the only survivors but incriminating evidence put his innocence in question sending Butler ala Richard Kimble on a fugitive run to exonerate himself.

Especially for a viewer, like myself, who is not from the US and does not share their ""world view"".That said, I do get it. Most big nations churn out films of this kind pushing their perspective such as it is but this one's really, really overcooked.

When nutty Nick was on screen it raised it in a way that was a nice surprise. This is a flick that won't win anything but you could do worse.

47,rgkarim,Fallen Into A New Routine,8,24 August 2019,"Epic action flicks are always a riot to see because they promise excitement, fun, and potentially some legendary sequences. The army of stars who have portrayed heroic figures continues to grow and in some cases those heroes drop into multiple installments that vary in quality. Tonight is an example of one such franchise that continues to push that hero to new heights in an attempt to squeeze every dollar out of the franchise. Could a third installment of the legendary Secret Service agent Mike Banning be one of those movies that is all about the cash and less about the quality? Well Robbie K is back again to give some thoughts as we finish up the weekend with what will hopefully live up to hopes and expectations I have for it. Tonight we look at:Movie: Angel Has Fallen (2019)
Director:
Ric Roman Waugh
Writers:
Robert Mark Kamen (screenplay by), Matt Cook (screenplay by)
Stars:
Gerard Butler, Piper Perabo, Morgan FreemanLIKES:
Constantly Moving
Gets the Intensity Starting
Nice Use Of Characters
The Ending Battle
Nick NolteDISLIKES:
Predictable
Loud
Mystery Lacking
Not As Much Exciting Acting
Morgan Freeman's Character Semi LackingSummary:Like its predecessors, Angel Has Fallen is back in the habit of making a story that is all about moving from danger site to danger site. Banning's latest journey does not take long to get things moving, bringing the incident to full, explosive power to get the antics going. The new tale then takes that intensity and tries to run with it the full time, finding few times to quiet down before the next set of problems sets in. Angle Has Fallen surprisingly does a nice job of integrating the characters, most of them, throughout the film, keeping them involved in the developing plot and having them contribute to find the solution. Jada Pinkett Smith's character is there to act as the cat chasing the proverbial mouse, all while helping dig into the mess that Mike has fallen into. His wife played by Piper is working on her own components and rather than being left to make casual appearances, she actually gets decent inclusion in this film. Yet, it's the living legend of Nick Nolte who takes the cake for the character of the film for me. The rugged, rough voiced actor really brings the bitter humor to life, somehow saying so little , but doing so much. I thoroughly enjoyed this character in what he brought and how he was an attempt to break up the Fallen series monotony. Yet despite who you grip onto in this sort of action, mystery, crime feature, the ending is my epic conclusion I was hoping to see in this film. Angel Has Fallen is all about those special effect frenzies that are littered with gun play, explosives, and one man defying all odds. You won't be disappointed with the final sequence, as it captures the spirit of the first two after the long wait.In terms of areas of improvement though this reviewer notes that the predictability and lack of surprise makes the hidden/mystery element of this movie a little lame. You know who is pretty much behind this operation, how they are going to try to execute the plan, and what will most likely happen to counter it. In fact the only thing to question is who is going to make it to the end. Had a few more surprises been thrown in, this movie could have had the nice twist to make it stand out. Sadly, the story and plot were geared more towards the character inclusion and loud antics of the movie. The Fallen series always struggles with volume control for me and if you have sensitive ears like mine, the intensity of all the high-octane scenes might take its toll on you hearing so look for ear plugs or folding your ears. The minor things aside, the movie surprisingly does not do much with Morgan Freeman, and if you remember the previous films the president kind of has a big role in each of the films Maybe due to scheduling or maybe trying to be different, it's not until the end where the man in charge is finally brought back into the story in an attempt to wrap things up. And speaking of action, I seem to remember the first two films having much more action than this instalment. It seems that this film toned back on the action in an attempt to give us a little more story and mystery, which is a shame as I wanted the adrenaline fest these films are. Certainly there are ""exciting"" moments, but they swapped many of their guns for some new spins that did not have the same suspense or quality of the memorable moments from the first two. If that's up your alley then you'll love this, but remember the ending has the battles we love, you just got to make it there.The VERDICT:Overall Angel Has Fallen is starting to settle down and try out new venues for telling their story. Certainly the speed of the film series continues, and the intensity gets things moving quickly to keep you into the film as almost all characters are brought into this chapter of Secret Service agent against the world. Sadly, the same formula of fighting with lots of guns and ambushing via covert attacks seems to be resting for much of this movie, again trying new gimmicks to make it stand out and reserve the usual techniques for the ending. It would have worked more for me had they kept the mystery/surprises going to add on to the intensity and leave your jaw dropping.

Months prior I found out & was buzzing!Nick Banning in the sequel gets framed for trying to kill the president & goes rogue to find out who is behind it.While I didn't expect a sequel, that didn't mean it was A. Unneeded or B. As bad as the critics say. I found the film to be pretty epic! I found this one more engaging than the last 2 entries. While they were great action packed films in themselves, this one I liked in particular because Nick was going rouge & the framed-for-a-crime theme was strong!The action was on point! The scenes involving the killer drones was an epic opener! The story-line while simple enough was a little complex, but the films epic fight sequences & explosive action made up for it!Overall, 9/10",Angel Has Fallen
51,elliotjeory,Good action film,7,20 April 2020,This was far better than the second one in the series. It was a more character driven story that made the plot more interesting. It's silly action but enjoyable. I didn't like the bad guy Wade I thought he was lame. Otherwise a good film.,Angel Has Fallen
52,Luigi Di Pilla,Good Entertainment,6,14 March 2020,If you watch this don't take some scenes seriously. It works for an intriguing thriller with a mix of Designated Survivor and Terminator. I liked Gerard Butler cause he really played the bodyguard believable and with great emotions. The special effects were well executed and the filming locations perfectly chosen. It deserves a solid 6/10. The first and second film of this sequel are worth a check.,Angel Has Fallen

54,arungeorge13,"A slight improvement over London, but this series is headed nowhere! [+43%]",4,16 November 2019,"Short Review: Gerard Butler dons the presidential savior's role once again in a predictable, unoriginal actioner. After the pathetic London Has Fallen, I did not have my hopes high for a sequel. What actually drove me to watch the flick is director Ric Roman Waugh's previous work (I thought Felon and Shot Caller were pretty great!). But as expected, when stunt choreographers take up jobs to direct franchise flicks, they barely turn out to be memorable and Angel is the latest example in that category.Angel is thankfully less offensive and in-your-face than London and/or Olympus. It gives Mike Banning a little character development as opposed to the previous films. While there's plenty of pyrotechnics on display, bloodshed is minimal. The CG in some of the scenes involving explosions is quite tacky. While the film is in its save-the-President mode, it's not exciting at all and appears to be a rehash of its prequels. The film introduces Clay Banning (a no-nonsense Nick Nolte), probably the most interesting character in the entire series.As one would anticipate, the scenes involving Butler and Nolte battling it out with the bad guys in woods is one of the film's best stretches. It's a short but effective stretch, giving viewers an idea of where Mike got his 'crazy' from. The rest of the film is by-the-numbers and purely rests on the idea of what's entertaining in the eyes of each viewer. It's a scant improvement from London (in terms of set-pieces) and less tongue-in-cheek in comparison with Olympus, but is as formulaic as it can get! The twist in Angel gets the award for the most foreseeable one in an action film this year.Verdict: Time-pass actioner!",Angel Has Fallen
55,Abdulxoxo,Decent,6,17 January 2021,"The latest instalment in the 'Has fallen franchise is certainly formulaic but it's fun. There's little about this film than stands out as praise-worthy. The directing and writing are kinda mediocre, the CGI is below average and most of the performances are instantly forgettable. But Nick Nolte deserves a brief mention as Mike's estranged father. He has a couple of good scenes when we first meet him, and provides a little comedic relief at the end. Luckily in the third act the filmed moves the story to a hospital, where the best of the action took place. Now this is what I signed up for. Fast paced action scenes with gunfire and explosions, chases and fights. Butler was running around being heroic. Overall, Angel has fallen is definitely not in it for the character development or anything, but if you're looking for a solid action flick it's worth a watch.",Angel Has Fallen
56,omendata,"Great start but devolves into standard by the numbers crash, bank, wallop drivel",6,21 November 2019,"Fanastic start to the movie with the drone attack really got me going but the movie then just becomes another shoot em up thriller with very little in the way of thrills; plot, character development and a poor shadow of the previous well made incarnations.Jada Pinkett Smith is a truly awful actress almost as bad as her son but of course being part of the privileged hollywood elite she gets to ruin a movie instead of giving someone who can act a chance. Poor old Gerard Butler is not that great an actor either and his chronic alcoholism has aged him tenfold - He was actually in my year at school in Paisley 30+ years ago and I have aged better than he has!The only saving grace for the last hour of the movie is Nick Nolte - great to see him back again and he makes me give this an extra star. Danny Huston of course does his best to keep the story together but not even his inclusion can save this retread.

57,martimusross,Great Action Thriller,6,25 August 2019,"Angel Has FallenThis was a tightly scripted thriller with more than a few interludes where it poked fun at itself and the genre.It is taken as a given that the plot will contrive to make Gerald Butler one man pitted against most of the known world. Whilst holding to this wholly believable given we were treated to three set pieces. The first was a drone attacked quite brilliantly realised, the second a mega-truck chase and lastly an attack on a hospital.Gerald Butler displayed his full range of acting skills from A to B and we had Morgan Freeman as POTUS who did not talk about a wall or fake news so it just wasn't very realistic.Nick Nolte was fabulous as craggy, crusty old codger who has the best one liners and seemed to have booby trapped the entire forest.Overall I had a really good evening the movie was very entertaining and we had some solid and memorable performances.

59,Prashast_Singh,A treat for action fans!,10,24 August 2019,"This is hands down the best film in the trilogy and one of the most entertaining action films of the year. Although the narrative sounds familiar, yet it's the execution that sets it apart from other hero-becomes-fugitive action movies. You don't really need to have seen the first two movies to watch this one.Gerard Butler is simply awesome and I'm telling you that if this is the last film in the series, I'm gonna miss Mike Banning. Same for Morgan Freeman, whose portrayal of Alan Trumbull is at times very impressive. Piper Perabo is excellent too: her realistic expressions are indeed heart-winning.The action sequences stand out due to the brilliant choreography, camerawork, uniqueness and the way they make us feel that characters are indeed vulnerable. There's hardly a boring moment due to the presence of nonstop action and tension.In short, if you like action movies, there's no way you should miss this one. Whether you liked the first two films or not, this one will nevertheless leave an impact.

As even character in the movie said it, that it is cool because of adrenaline, which is coming together with adventure.

I thought he did a wonderful job in ""Warrior"" as the conflicted father and then again in ""A Walk in the Woods"" stealing every scene from Robert Redford. Now in Angel Has Fallen he once again rises to the occasion. Actors usually don't get better with age, but Nolte is clearly never better.",Angel Has Fallen
64,bankofmarquis,Nolte steals the film,6,26 August 2019,"It's always interesting to me that when I leave a film and realize that the best part of the movie I just saw was the extra scene during the credits. What were the folks that made this movie thinking? Did they save the best for last? Most of the time it is - unfortunately - that this scene shines BECAUSE it really has nothing to do with the rest of the film, in both style and substance.Such is the case with ANGEL HAS FALLEN the 3rd film in the ""Fallen"" series (following OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN and LONDON HAS FALLEN) that follows the trials and tribulations of White House Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) as he tries, once again, to save the President (a game, stern - yet sincere - Morgan Freeman) from an assassination attempt. But this time...the twist is...that Mike is framed for the attempt, so he has to go on the lamb ""The Fugitive"" style to clear his name and to find out who really dunnit.I figured out who dunnit - and who was behind it - in about the first 3 minutes those characters/performers were on the screen - but it's the destination, not the journey, that counts in these types of films and this journey is...""so-so"".The plot contrivances, action sequences and chase scenes are all pretty middle-of-the-road with Director Ric Roman Waugh (SNITCH, FELON) resorting to the quick-cut, jittery camera ""cinema verite"" style of action shooting that, to me, shows laziness in choreography and originality and ends up giving me a bit of a headache.So...failing a good plot and good action sequences, a film like this must have good, interesting characters and good, interesting actors inhabiting them. And...for the most part...that part of this film generates some interest as the previously mentioned Morgan Freeman, the always dependable Lance Reddick, the oily Danny Huston and the quirky Tim Blake Nelson all share the screen to good effect. Piper Perabo also joins the fray as Mike's wife and she elevates that side of the proceedings.In the end, it comes down to the screen presence and charisma of star Gerard Butler as Mike and - unfortunately - he just doesn't have enough of that to keep things interesting. Especially when he spends a large part of the film playing against an actor who plays Butler's father - the one and only Nick Nolte.And he...just about...steals the movie. Here is an actor that has screen presence and charisma to spare, even under long hair, a beard and a voice that has seen many, many cigarettes and booze.And this takes us back to the beginning (or should I say, the end) of the film...Nolte and Butler share the end credits scene and it's, by far, the best darn thing in this mediocre film.If you're going to sit through this, make sure you stay for the end credits scene.Letter Grade B-6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Angel Has Fallen
65,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Intense action thriller,7,8 May 2020,"Intense action thriller. Lots of explosions like a Michael Bay directed film. Will probably annoy your neighbors if you use your surround sound. Better than the second sequel. Both Gerard Butler and Morgan Freeman showing their ages unfortunately. Not sure why Butler looks so old in this film because he really isn't that old.Some characters didn't make sense such as a doctor behind the nurses station that can track ip connections to the nurses PC. The main plot was predictable. From the swearing in scene with Tim Blake Nelson as Vice-President Kirby, I already figured out the whole plot of the film. I knew VP Kirby was behind it all.
Nevertheless, I enjoy the amazing CGI explosions and sound effects. If you love things that go boom, you will love this film.",Angel Has Fallen

67,abisio,A decent third chapter of the .... has Fallen movies,8,24 August 2019,"The ultra violent ... has Fallen movies can only be considered as a guilty pleasure; basically an espectacular assassination attempt on the USA President.
There are no spoilers in commenting that the President will survive and Gerard Butler will save the day and kill the bad guys (otherwise nobody will care to see it).
The good thing is that moving the saga from the small confinement space in the Olympus chapter; to less but limited London and now to a wide open Virginia / North Carolina forests gives wider possibilities to the action. The drawback it requires more elaborated scenes and script to justify events and movements.
If you suspend your disbelief; the movie almost succeed but not totally.Action sequences have some budget limitations but are still very well staged. The trunk / car chase at night is quite original. The explosions around Clay (Nolte) cabin create a very intense (and somewhat funny) sequence. The drones attack is really impressive; far better than any overpriced AVENGERS ENDGAME action moment.Sadly secondary characters are underwritten. Jada Pinkett Smith is there for the check and does not looks very happy; and same for Piper Perabo. Lance Reddick deserves a better scenes but his character barely talks.
The exception are of course the charismatic Danny Huston as the bad guy you cannot fully hate and surprisingly Nick Nolte who steals every scene he is in; as a cuckoo's anarchist and Butler's father.; pathetic and really funny at the same time.Morgan Freeman is fine as always (particularly when he looks completely scared and lost) but his character does not allow more than a basic performance; not his fault of course.In brief; compared with any other action movie this year; is quite effective without being forced. In my opinion not as intense as the two previous chapters but still worth seeing it.",Angel Has Fallen
68,bob-the-movie-man,Lumbering in every sense of the word.,4,6 September 2019,"""Olympus Has Fallen"" (2013) was a great tongue-in-cheek action movie, directed by Antoine Fuqua, with a dynamic Gerard Butler - then 44 - saving the President of the United States (Aaron Eckhart) from certain death from Korean terrorists. Roll forwards three years and an appallingly xenophobic repeat - ""London Has Fallen"" - failed to impress me (though I note that I did call it as probably Trump's favourite of the year!). Yet another three years have now passed, and with Morgan Freeman's character making his way from Speaker to Veep to President, the team are back for more of the same.The film starts with a bit of a bang. Mike Banning (Butler) is still on presidential protection duty but time is taking its toll. Suffering from back pain and crippling headaches, he tries his best to hide the symptoms since his ability to function in the role is questionable. Moreover he is wrestling emotionally as to whether to accept a 'way out' in the form of a cushy desk job.When a terrorist attack leaves Banning as the 'last man standing' the finger points to him as ""the inside man"". How can Banning prove his innocence and bring the real villains to justice?I saw Butler in a hire-car commercial a few weeks back 'playing the action hero' and thought at the time ""Man, he's looking too old for that!"" And so it seems. In the movie he lumbers around the screen like an overweight traffic warden.The script - by Robert Mark Kamen, Matt Cook and director Ric Roman Waugh - very sensibly tries to deflect that by writing his creakiness into the story.... but it just really doesn't make a great job of it. One of the problems is that this material - a protection officer past his prime - was done SOOOO much better by Clint Eastwood in 1993's ""In The Line Of Fire"", one of my favourite action films of all time. This pales in comparison. Banning's ills are inconsistent: his headaches don't seem to apply when he's 12 inches from a grenade going off!The movie is also ludicrously predictable. You would have to be seriously lacking in attention not to work out who the 'baddie' is going to be. The film doesn't even bother to do a decent ""reveal"".... it's more of an apologetic whimper! Even the ""big boss"" - a distorted voice on the phone - I guessed at the first call!So this is not a film to tax the brain cells. But you'd at least have respect for the evil masterminds if they actually had an evil masterplan that made even remote sense: you know.... irradiating Fort Knox to increase the price of their Nazi gold, or fixing Brexit or other such implausibility. But no - it seems the evil masterminds seem to have no plan other than their self-destruction: like Disney's lemmings, bad-guys are just herded off the cliffs with Land-rovers to be machine gunned.I'm sorry to announce this, but really young toddlers just can't act very well. They certainly CAN'T act ""traumatised"" as armed men break into their house and violence happens in front of them. Young Lynne Banning (played by one of Jessica or Maisie Cobley - coincidentally Mrs Movie-Man's maiden name) appears to be QUITE distraught during this particular scene. Unless this was some top class CGI work (the effects in the rest of the film would suggest otherwise) this is stepping over a line for me and I felt highly uncomfortable.There are two saving graces in the film: Morgan Freeman (who must have seriously wondered what turd he was polishing here) and Nick Nolte, playing Banning's reclusive father Clay. The film actually starts to come alive for a bit in a middle forest section, with some nice interplay between father and son. But, after some serious pyrotechnics, and another double digit lemming body-count, we return to staider fare.Summary: It didn't have the distasteful xenophobia of ""London Has Fallen"" (which I rather generously gave a 3/10). So I feel I should at least top that. But again I feel I'm being generous. It's all crushingly mediocre, and if I can remember any of it after three months, I'll be very unlucky indeed!(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

So as usual I had anticipations for it. Sadly the wait has not been fruitful! It's the worst of them!So before discussing what's wrong, I should say the few good things and they are Gerard Butler, Morgan Freeman and Some Impressive Action Pieces like Hand to Hand Combats, Gunfires, explosions etc. That's it.Now let's come to the real points. First of all the script here is bleak and poorly written! I know action movies normally don't have the luxury of good scripts but at least some of them do unlike here which is pure crap!The Screenplay too felt disjointed and slow in spaces! As a fan of Fallen series I expected more action sets and less talking! The CGI was awful in some places, especially towards the end. Background score was just decent! Nothing noticeably good! Few characters like Ramirez, Thompson has been totally wasted. They could have played some important parts or at least had some depth! Clay Banning's character was a good addition but the emotional angle didn't really work out, like at all. And the Cliches and flaws! Man oh man! There were too many. I won't spoil, you have too see the film in order to understand but the flaws were too obvious! And annoyed me a lot.So as you can see It's been a film that I would surely try to forget! But As I like Gerard and Mr. Freeman a lot I could watch the film till the end and yeah the few action pieces were good!

Everyone seemed tired and uninterested - especially Gerard Butler, who just looks worn down. I had a hard time getting through this film. It's definitely the weakest movie in the series.After an attack on the President's life, secret service agent, Mike Banning, is implicated in the attack because he is the only survivor - well, that and the fact that all clues lead straight back to him (an obvious set-up). While being transported, he is taken by an unknown hit team, but he manages to escape their clutches. While he searches out his estranged father, the only person who is able to help him out, hotshot FBI Agent, Helen Thompson, is close behind. With his father's help, Banning attempts to do the impossible and reach the one man who can clear his good name - the President himself. The real orchestrator behind the assassination attempt hasn't given up, however, so the clock is ticking.I don't know ... I really enjoyed both Olympus and London, so I had high hopes going into this one and was truly disappointed. Like ""Taken 3"", this third film takes a fugitive approach and tries to make our hero the bad guy. It just doesn't work. Especially since this is such an obvious set-up. After all that Banning had already done for the man, he is just going to suddenly turn tail and try to kill the guy? Eh ... no way. BUT ... some of the action sequences were well done, and the final confrontation was almost worth it.""Angel Has Fallen"" is not a recommend. It scores a weak 5 out of 10 stars and is just okay.

80,jwwalrath-227-85487,Banning returns in a somewhat different situation,7,1 September 2019,"The Fallen franchise deviates from the previous installments by taking a page from The Fugitive and having Secret Service member Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) framed for treason and having to go on the run to find who set him up. This is a generally entertaining film, but I found that there was a strangely interesting balance of several good and bad aspects.This was a lot more tonally balanced than the previous two films. Olympus has Fallen was weirdly cynical for a save-the-hostages film. London has Fallen unsuccessfully tried to involve both moral greyness and jingoism not to mention that there were a couple moments where Banning seemed to take a little TOO much pleasure in punishing the enemy. Here, I could mostly just sit back and enjoy myself without questioning anything.However, the basic story is CONSPIRACY ACTION MOVIE 101; nothing particularly new. I did like the script's attempts, albeit merely for entertainment reasons, of looking at the war machine and interference vs. non-interference.Butler's still got it as Banning. Nick Nolte is a fun new addition as Banning's reclusive survivalist, anti-government father. The villains if not outstanding are smart and provide a reasonable threat with some neat tricks up their sleeves.The action is quite good, especially the opening attack and the final confrontation. Thought the lighting is pretty grey, especially considering the first film, but it suits the tone here. Director Ric Roman Waugh (who helmed The Snitch with The Rock) has a good eye for visuals and settings.The camera work is distracting. There is way too much shaky cam not to mention a couple misplace quick pans. This even happens when people are just having everyday conversations.

Gerard Butler is beginning to look in need of an adrenalin boost, as well he might. It says a lot for him and the writer (and the CGI guys) that the Mike Banning shtick still has the capacity to thrill audiences. This formula is recycled from the DIE HARD franchise and, before that, from THE FUGITIVE. Bruce Willis's charisma kept DIE HARD tanked up through episodes 2 and 3 before flagging with Part 4, so now might be a good time for Mike Banning to retire. There's another bunch of high-octane movies whose name escapes me, but I seem to remember they have managed to stay consistently fast and furious.",Angel Has Fallen

And it's not bad at all to be honest, I actually quite enjoyed it.What I will say is that the film felt more character driven and not simply based on ""president needs saving"". He does need saving, but it's focused more on Mike. Which is a good turn for the film series to take. The action scenes were good, who doesn't enjoy car chases, guns, several explosions and crashes.

Admittedly some of the more practical nuts and bolts aspects grounding this fantasy into some sort of plausible reality are standard, but never sub-standard.

Nothing that is particularly revolutionary or spectacular but its all very fun.This film does suffer from the fact it has one of those plots where the protagonist is quite obviously being framed and a simple conversation with the law enforcement officers pursuing him would clear everything up.

Nick Nolte is a welcome addition, and how can you not love Morgan Freeman as President? A little bit too transparent as to ""who done it"", but other than that, it delivers what it promises - action, violence, and more action.

93,akcenat,Fans of militaristic gunplay will get their money's worth,6,30 November 2019,"""The * Has Fallen"" trilogy is the only trilogy to have a different studio produce each installment. That should give you a clue as to how the latest one will turn out. The studios didn't want it. So why why was this smarmy thriller even made? The answer is money. Not very good ""Olympus Has Fallen"" (2013) was ""Die Hard"" in the White House. Mid-80s action template of ""London Has Fallen"" (2015) was ""Die Hard"" in London and a mixed bag/a more current approach ""Angel Has Fallen"" (2019) is ""Die Hard""/""The Fugitive"" in West Virginia. As you can see, it's repetitive. How many times can the President really need saving? With this on, the whole time the audience well knows what's going to happen next as the predictability factor of this film is off the charts. A third chapter in a franchise no one expected to make it to three movies, it aims to set itself apart from previous installments. At the end, ""Angel Has Fallen"" does what advertisements says it'll do - gunfights, car chases, explosions - and sometimes that's all one can ask for. At a running time of a slightly overlong 114 minutes, it's a silly, fun action movie which is a tad predictable, but does it really matter with movies like this? a satisfying slice of mindless entertainment.Rating: 6+ / the best in trilogy",Angel Has Fallen
94,Just-A-Girl-14,Entertaining,7,30 June 2020,"This movie is a bit different than the previous two. It starts out slow and digs deeper into Mike Banning's character. We still get plenty of action but it's pretty obvious that Gerard Butler is past his prime, as is his character who is (in his own words) at the end of the game. Morgan Freeman is doing a good job but he too is a bit too old for this role. Aaron Eckhart's character is notably missing as he was a main character in this franchise up until now.
The plot line is very predictable right from the start but we also get a few emotional and humorous moments as well.
Nick Nolte steals the show with a brilliant performance as Mike's crazy, paranoid, living off the grid dad. The interaction between the two is very entertaining to watch!! I found the ending to be pretty hilarious and as a third (and hopefully) final movie in the series it's not bad.

But overall, the action was good. The movie moved along. The big scenes were huge! I know guys like this -- it was pretty true to life. Our Special Operators are a different breed. (Not the bad guys here though because they were pretty weak). Jada Pickett Smith was a weak spot, not a good actress and definitely not right for the role as the leader of a security organization.

96,michaelarmer,Average Political Action Thriller,5,5 December 2019,"There are 2 problems with this film1:- are the camera angles, close-ups/ultra close-ups, in the words of the late great Strother Martin, ""what we have here is a failure to communicate"" another Director who seems to think this is a good style. IT ISN'T, however this one is not as bad as some others I have seen recently, such as 'First Man', there are some wider shots, but it's the ultra close-ups are the most annoying, odd films have been made this way since the sixties, more often these days, please can someone tell the movie makers that this style ain't any good!2:- They are running over the same old cliche'd angles, the good guys that turn bad, the good guy that is framed to be bad then eventually proves himself, pleeaassse. If you are going to make a film like this with the same old story, at least make an attempt to do something different with it, make it stylish (not with the close-ups) or something, once you have seen one of these types, and lets face it these political thrillers have been going for years, you have seen them all, repetitively going through the same motions, just with different faces.Gerard Butler is not the best actor, but he makes a good fist of the over-the-hill agent, and the supporting cast are good, or at least not too bad, the older actors show the way though, Morgan Freeman playing the president again, he is always good, someone to rely on to put in a good performance. It is Nick Nolte who is the class act on this occasion, a very seasoned actor who steals the show as Gerard's Dad.The director does an average job, apart from the complaint already mentioned he is ok, the pace is kept good, scenes are good, particularly the action ones, photography is pretty good, and editing/continuity is good, but nothing special here, all running to the same formula, the music is a bit of a let down though, you would expect better, a more triumphant sound, particularly when all is saved, but it is more like a damp squib.I read some reviews where they are complaining about negative reviews for this film, read the above to see why there are negative reviews, I am not a half-empty glass type, I look for the positives, but there are few here, the formula needs revamping! I gave a 5 for the Action and Photography and some of the acting, If Nick Nolte and Morgan Freeman were absent I would have given a 2.",Angel Has Fallen

98,Magow-Intermean,Angel Has Fallen Review,9,24 August 2019,"Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), is tasked with protecting the President of the United States (Morgan Freeman). During a fishing trip, bomber drones are used in an assassination attempt on the President. Mike barely manages to save him, while other secret service agents are killed in the attack. Both are knocked unconscious, but the President goes into a coma. When Mike comes to his senses, he's arrested under suspicion of being the assailant behind the attack. Using his skills, Mike escapes custody, but now he needs to prove his innocence while protecting the President.Picking up after the events of the previous instalment, 'Angel Has Fallen' is content to stick with its outdated style of action that offers nothing new or inventive. Its shootouts and fight choreography are reminiscent of the shaky cam, jumpy edit style sequences that were popular years back. The plot is also familiar, and although there are some twists thrown in along the way, they're not exactly unpredictable. The story lays out some clues about who the antagonists could be and promptly follows through with them. Eagle-eyed viewers who pay attention will be able to figure it out quickly. One interesting angle is the relationship between Mike, and his father Clay Banning (Nick Nolte). This is because of Nick Nolte's performance as am army veteran who lives off the grid; he brings the right amount of paranoia and heart - the precise mix needed in a film like this.The entire premise would have been more enjoyable with some crazy humour. But the actors are also burdened with some clunky dialogue. The impact of crucial scenes is lost because of cheesy lines. Sloppy writing weighs down heavy on the actors. Morgan Freeman, Lance Reddick and Danny Huston have more than decent acting chops, but you can see them all struggle with the material. Meanwhile, Gerard Butler's efforts as Mike Banning are not in vain, but you can't help he's trapped, and not by design. While the film's practical effects are sound, the CGI is downright terrible. 'Angel has Fallen' has some redeeming qualities, but they're too few and far in between to justify its existence.",Angel Has Fallen

But I honestly gotta say, Jada Pickett was so not needed in this film, as the FBI agent on the trail of Gerard Butler. Her character was writings so poorly, that all I could take away from her role is that she took the part for the money.

101,OMTR,Probably the most insightful action movie of this century,8,15 May 2021,"In my opinion, the first two installments of this franchise are nothing but low-minded duds. Therefore, I was not optimistic about this third episode.I was in for a big and good surprise, because this third opus clearly identifies the fact that there is no imaginary foe since the greatest threat to the United States lies within its borders - No 'bad' Asian, Latin American or Russian here!On January 17, 1961, President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave the nation a dire warning about what he described as a threat to democratic government. He called it the ""Military-industrial Complex (MiC)"", a gigantic union of defense contractors and the armed forces. Eisenhower, a retired five-star Army general, the man who led the allies on D-Day, made the remark in his farewell speech from the White House.This film follows Eisenhower's wise words and shows how unethical and ruthless this MiC is. How these greedy people and corporations pose a clear and present danger to the United States of America and the world, who are ready to eliminate any American - babies, hospitals and the president included - who refuses to lie to go to senseless wars and risk a nuclear holocaust for their criminal profits. Such a level of perspicacity clearly makes ""Angel Has Fallen"" the best film in the series, and I am looking forward to discovering ""Night Has Fallen"". May it be another tale of deception and deceit, which denounces the Dark Side of the American Dream and upholds its founding Values.",Angel Has Fallen

director: Ric Roman Waugh
starring: Jerard Butler,Morgan Freeman,Jada pinkett smith, Danny Huston,Piper Parabo etcoverall rating 87/100Angel has fallen focuses on Mike Hanning struggling to keep up with the sacrifices of his work. And when there is a assassination attempt on the president and he is the only one to survive. He is framed for the attempted murder and must fight to prove his Innocence. Despite a few things they could of worked on this was a extremely entertaining film which offered a change in plot and tone.First of all i have to start off with the excellent acting performances. Yes Gerard butler was solid like in the previous films. But my key standouts are Morgan Freeman and Jada Pinket Smith. Morgan freeman is such an excellent actor he really played and suited the role of president this was mostly due to the excellent script he was given. He had a fair few powerful lines and phrases that really stuck with me throughout the film. And finally Jada pinkett smith who did an excellent job with what little screen time she had. Her character did not take no for an answer and was very sassy and enjoyable to watch. It was fresh to see Jada in this kind of role as she really suited it and went all out. It was a shame she was killed off so early on as i thought she could of played more of a larger role as the film went on.Next like the previous instalments the action was fantastic and very entertaining to watch. I think the action was the best its been throughout the whole film series. There was a lot more close combat and brutal murders that stuck with you more then the previous films. Gerard butler proved that he could still hold his own against the younger cast members despite turning 50 this year so despite some bad films he has been in he is still part of the great action stars of this generation like Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves. However i do just have to say that the CGI looked fairly bad in a few scenes.
This was probably due to it having a lower budget then the previous instalments but a lot of the large explosion scenes on the hospital looked really fake and some of the heavy gunfire scenes were clearly green screen in places. I only noticed this a couple of times so its not to big of a issue but they clearly tried to stretch there budget to its limits it can just be seen fairly clearly when watching.Next i thought that Gerard Butlers character Mike Banning had a much better character arc and development throughout angel has fallen. I thought the idea of the consequences of Mikes job catching up to him leading him to be on painkillers was a really interesting angle to add to the film. And to have him hide it from his wife was even more interesting as he loved his job to much.now for my final negative which held the film back from being amazing. It was far to predictable. I guessed who the main villains were before they were even revealed. Its because the made it so blatantly obvious who it was that when it came to them having the plot twist and the big reveal i was left underwhelmed due to me figuring it out. So the film lagged in any big surprises to keep your attention firmly on the the film.Now my final few big positives. First of all i loved the introduction of Mikes father and the humour he bought to the dynamic of the film. It once again adds a really interesting dynamic to Mikes character. And to see there bond develop as the film went on was heartwarming to see. Also he was absolutely hilarious. the fact that he had absolutely loads of explosives around his house. When he set them off it was brilliant. He was so blunt and swore all the time he just bought some much needed humour to the film.And finally the film had a much needed change to the plot and tone. I love that the film felt more like a thriller as well as a great action. The film had much more very tense scenes that kept you on the edge of your seat. And it just felt a lot more shocking with the violence. I also loved the change of Mike being a vigilante on the run as you could understand why everyone thought he was the main suspect. So instead of falling into the generic category if it had the same formula as the other two Angel has fallen did the complete opposite much to my surprise and delight.Overall despite being painfully predictable. Angel has fallen offers something different to this franchise and action films as a whole and is the strongest film in the franchise.",Angel Has Fallen

This third part is directed by Ric Roman Waugh, the director of Snitch and Shot Caller.In the film, there was an attack on US President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman), which caused him to fall into a coma. Apart from the president, only Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) survived the attack. Mike is soon accused of this as the man responsible for the attack and attempted murder of the president.
To clear his name, Mike must now take on his own colleagues and the FBI until he has exposed the real perpetrator behind the attack.This film comes across as a standard third film from an action film series, where the older hero of the previous films is now suddenly seen as the villain of the film. The third Taken film, for example, also had a similar story. This is how this film comes across as familiar and predictable, because you will see most twists and turns coming beforehand.Despite the usual, there are still some entertaining action moments in the film. Many action scenes are a bit too zoomed in and motionally filmed, so that it is not always clear what exactly happened.
The green screen can often be seen in the background of many scenes. Many scenes with explosions do not always come across as realistic.The acting work is done well. Despite his lesser acting work in his last films of recent years, Gerard Butler does a good job with this film. Just like himself, his character has also become older and must learn to cope with the consequences of aging. For example, his condition has decreased compared to his younger years. Morgan Freeman has more of a cameo in this film, because his character soon ends up in a coma for a long time. Nick Nolte also has a nice role as the father of Gerard Butler his character.

And these battles and stunts are simply fantastic. However, I could not find anything that would show how things (Stunts, shootings, chases, crashes and the like etc) were done. So don't bother looking.I thought this would be another Olympus is Falling or London has Fallen, and yes, I was right, but it's the CGI that wins in here. It just looks too real and kept me more than engaged. I guess that's a compliment. The pacing was perfect and nothing was overdone. Good dialogues too.Notables: Danny Huston as Wade Jennings, the owner and leader of an army of Mercenaries and needs government contracts to stay in business; Nick Nolte as Clay, Mike's estranged father; Jada Pinkett Smith as FBI Agent Thompson who believes Mike is guilty; Piper Perabo as Leah, Mike's wife; Tim Blake Nelson as Vice President Martin Kirby, who takes over when President Trumbell is in a coma.Truly enjoyable due mostly to the CGI because it was done in a very exciting way.

118,Hallelujah289,"Decent, unrealistic, has good moments",6,4 June 2020,"""Angel Has Fallen"" has very good production values and it delivers on its action. Gerard Butler remains good-humored, sometimes impossibly so in this tense action thriller. I wished he'd show more range. However, this is an inoffensive, many times hyperbolic thriller with some downright unrealistic moments (gosh, that is one trusting almost-comatose president). I thought the villain's obsession with the protagonist was so over-the-top it became ridiculous and funny. Still, I enjoyed watching this film, and will recommend it.The dynamic between the protagonist and main antagonist is a lot like that of Shakespeare adaptation ""Coriolanus,"" which Gerard Butler also starred in. It's a much more serious story that isn't quite as enjoyable to watch.My favorite part of ""Angel Has Fallen"" is probably Butler's paranoid, hermetic Vietnam veteran father with a penchant for bombs.",Angel Has Fallen
119,gareth-75442,Loved it,8,15 November 2019,"For a 40 million budget this is an excellent 3rd installment to the fallen series, yes its totally unbelievable just as the 1st & 2nd movies are but it's entertainment & that's all it's supposed to be, well worth a watch & with the added addition of nick nolte I actually enjoyed this more than the first 2 movies, keep watching during the credits for an extra scene with banning & his dad, totally fun watch.",Angel Has Fallen
120,jackgdemoss,"A trilogy that falls in quality, film by film",6,24 August 2019,"This is the perfect example of a movie trilogy that just shouldn't exist. The premise does not allow for three entirely separate catastrophic threats to be cleaned up nicely at the end of each film. Olympus Has Fallen was a great watch and I loved the narrative, but now it just feels tiresome. This negative is amplified by the subpar effort put forth by the action choreography team and the editing team. The cuts were way too quit and I actually pulled myself out of the movie for a solid 15 seconds because I genuinely could not figure out what was happening in the action. This series will continue downhill, if it continues at all.",Angel Has Fallen

124,elgrampo77,Very good pop corn cinema,8,17 September 2019,"As always it depends on what you expect. If it is Shakespeare-like award winning drama then you are probably wrong. But if it is a well done action hero movie with superb shooting scenes, nice acting by butler, freeman & Nolte and some humor on the top, then go and see it. Of course you know after max 10
Minutes who the clichee bad guys are but it does not affect the movie in a negative way. And you simply have to live the scene during the credits...",Angel Has Fallen

If you want to sue Hollywood for producing empty-headed, superficial, preposterously fantastical all-american BS, then this movie will do nicely has exhibit ""A"". This one comes a close second to""Red Dawn"". But if you know what you came for, then you know you're in for a massively entertaining time, laughing out loud at all the ridiculous antics and bad CGI.

127,faithless4734,Nick Nolte saved this movie....,7,7 April 2020,Prior to his characters appearance this movie was a solid 4 stars on a good day. But he brought this remake of Fugitive (complete with the transfer escape into the woods) back to life. He really did a great job of making this a much better movie I am giving him 3 of the 7 stars I rated this movie. I know he is only in it for an overall short time but they are the absolute best parts of the movie followed by Morgan Freeman's parts. If I Could rate by actor Nick would have a 9 maybe a ten and Morgan an 8-9.,Angel Has Fallen

129,boydpeters,Don't expect too much and you''ll be entertained,7,28 August 2019,"My take is that the writers didn't get far in when they decided that to think hard would be more than this plotline needs, and so they chose to not do that and went to the pub instead. And it showed.But you know what, suspend the giant gaping holes in this film and just enjoy it, and you'll be entertainedI don't think this was their intention, but if you laugh at them as much as with them then you'll still be entertained",Angel Has Fallen

131,Mivas_Greece,"The last of the trilogy has a lot more action, and is even more entertaining, although Olympus has fallen was the best of the trilogy.",7,1 April 2021,"Action movie. After Olympus has Fallen, and the also very good sequel, London has Fallen, comes the latest film in the trilogy, Angel has Fallen. Gerald Butler and Morgan Freeman are the main protagonists of the previous two films, since Freeman is now the president of the United States. Once again, the president becomes a target, only this time this effort targets the president's loyal bodyguard in an attempt to frame him for the attempted assassination of the president. Who's behind this attack? Will he be able to save the president? Butler is now considered the mastermind of this attack and when he manages to escape, he becomes a fugitive. His own colleagues are now after him, but also those who set him up. On the one hand, he must survive, on the other hand, prove his innocence and finally, find out who is behind it, and eventually he will once again have to do his best to save the president after his failed assassination attempt. Though quite a predictable scenario, it's pretty good, reminiscent of a bit of a runaway with Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford, but this one like London Has Fallen has too much action and too much shooting, unlike the first, Olympus has Fallen. A pretty good job in the third film of the trilogy, although I think the first one was the best.",Angel Has Fallen
132,Fields201,The Taken Route,6,24 August 2019,"When you have an action series and you don't know where to take it in the third movie, make your lead a fugitive. Worked well for Taken, right?I'm really not sure how Olympus Has Fallen became a trilogy as it wasn't that spectacular but I guess Gerald Butler needs a career. This one takes him and the now president Morgan Freeman attacked by drones and his own colleagues frame Butler.It's a run of a mill action thriller that checks your brain at home. It's nithing special and you may forget you even saw it. Nick Nolte was good.",Angel Has Fallen
133,gk303007,A good one time watch,8,10 December 2019,"Gerard Butler has a capability to drive a story on his shoulders be it his earlier romantic movies, or a cult 300 or his later action packed movies. This is no exception. Story, by far, is known and thats no more puzzling. However, the execution is what it takes to differentiate. Action was good and to some level different be it the drone sequences, the bomb explosions in jungle or the barricade escape in last scenes, Acting was ok from all the characters and none much have a role except Gerard and Nick and the story, as pointed before, was old and no different. And, there was some unnecessary drama and stretch a little bit here and there.A one time watch.",Angel Has Fallen
134,rdamian1963,The franchise is falling,5,10 April 2020,"Although the a ton is quite good, the movie just too predictable. It isnt a horrible film on it's own but more copy and paste, change the villain and off we go.",Angel Has Fallen
135,daniellawson-14-787057,I love this series,8,28 May 2020,"POSITIVES:1) Gerard Butler has really taken ownership of this character over the past 3 films
2) There are some very good action set pieces
3) Nick Nolte comes on and steals the show
4) Danny Huston is so underrated, he's great in everything
5) I normally hate the talking/exposition scenes in action films but I actually like them hereNEGATIVES:1) I found it conflicting that the film sets up Butler and Huston as great friends, but then it seems Huston betrays Butler very easily
2) Some of the CGI is terrible, which in this day and age is inexcusable
3) Many of the action scenes are deliberately shot at night to covers things up so you can't really see what's happening
4) Aaron Eckhart is definitely a miss here. His relationship with Butler was the best part of the past 2 films and he at least seemed interested, unlike Morgan Freeman who is clearly just here for the money",Angel Has Fallen
136,asage19,First class actioner,8,8 August 2020,"It's a terrific movie, kinda liked London Has Fallen better, but this one is straightforward action, like it a lot.
Morgan Freeman, Gerard Butler, Danny Huston, Lance Reddick... what a cast. Tim Blake Newman was so good. Nick Nolte was really so excellent. Seeing him in this movie was kinda like a diamond dropped into a paste necklace, he is just the best thing in the movie.
Really missed Radha Mitchell, who also has serious acting chops. Piper Perabo was okay, but too young, and not Radha Mitchell.",Angel Has Fallen
137,rohit_vit2020,"Good enough, but not the best",7,21 July 2020,"Morgran Freeman's acting, and Gerald's action performance is good. The action sequences could have been better, though very interesting. The plot is interesting, but there are certain unrealistic scenes that in no way anybody can usually reach upto President's door steps especially after the event of assassination attempt.Certain action sequences are good to watch, though not the best in class.

the movie had good pacing, as well...very important for any movie, much less an action/adventure movie...instead of, at some point, feeling like i've seen enough fighting/the movie's too long...never happened...
i'd be a liar if i didn't say how some parts of the MAIN villain's way/words reminded me of someone now very real in his position...i'm not going to mention names, though...

This one was definitely less fast than the previous two films. But I enjoyed it because it showed the hero in a more human state whilst the other two were over the top.
Of course he is impossible to kill as always but I really enjoyed it.
Have we seen this movie again?YES we have.
Does it bring anything new on the table? NO it doesn't
But does a movie always have to bring something new? A weird twist plot? A scene that has never been done before?
In my opinion NO it does not have to be something fresh and new. It just has to be well executed. And this movie was well made.
It had a very nice drone attack scene too.",Angel Has Fallen

146,chi_town_fed,Okay. Worth watching.,6,3 December 2019,Nick Nolte is still a great actor. I love his roles as he ages. Like a fine wine his skill gets better with time.The villain made little sense in his decision making. The drones were cool. I couldn't accept certain tactics by the villain as the movie progressed.,Angel Has Fallen
147,timeblank,Love the Chemistry,8,25 August 2019,Gerald Butler and Nick Nolte have great chemistry as Father and Son. Those were the best scenes. Story is okay not bad but also not good either. It does relate to The Fugitive and Enemy of the State.This does rank number two under Olympus has Fallen and third is London has Fallen. The villain is good too. Intimating and deceptive. The only thing I did not like was the CGI and visuals. Looks so amateurish. Yes I agree the shaky cam sucks.To me it's a better film than London has Fallen.,Angel Has Fallen
148,bitbucketchip,IQ Has Fallen,5,21 July 2021,"Butler is not looking good as one man army Banning in the latest in this series. His fading physical prowess isn't helped by a script written by Xerox machine. Seriously, this is the same Fallen movie, again.Everyone else is a moron. Banning's peers are thoroughly inept buffoons. Ignore them. They couldn't find coffee in a Starbucks. The bad guys are comical. They could EASILY have assassinated the president, destroying Banning by taking away his sole purpose in life and pinning the blame on whoever they wanted. Do they do that. Of course not. Instead they try to frame Banning in a hairbrained obvious way the brain dead good guys immediately fall for (I kid you not). The good guys are led by what is supposed to be a ""strong female character"", but it is remarkably laughably executed. She's continually outsmarted by the drug addicted Banning.The movie suffers because Banning isn't even a hero here. Plenty of innocent are injured or killed in the ensuing mayhem, as Banning does his best to violate every law in the land to evade capture. When the president is the target there is tension. When a secret service agent is injuring or killing citizens to save his own skin, there isn't.It's all too stupid. We're talking The Asylum level script writing here.The action scenes could save the film, but whoever decided to use an unstabilized smartphone to video them at night needs to find another job.If you've had a few beers and are looking for background noise while browsing on your phone, this movie rates 5 stars. As standalone entertainment it's worth a pass.",Angel Has Fallen

150,gerry_barnaby,Good film but the weakest storyline of the 3 movies,7,22 August 2019,"This film franchise which is now in its third film continues Mike banning (Gerard Butler) story only this time excused of attempted assassination of the president, im not gonna lie, im gonna be completely honest this film was great, it does have a flaws, but as much as this film was good, ive gonna admit that the story of this 3rd installment is slightly weaker than the other films while still being entertainingly funny in places.That comes from Nick Nolte character Clay Banning that sound like a crazy old conspiracy theory guy, but these scenes are made funny when mike and clay are surrounded in the wood, this where the film funny moment start happen, even alot of the audience in the cinema viewing I was in was laughing which let be honest was outright Hilarious coupled with the banter which is the highlight of the film.While the action is a little less than before the film does have a few action scene that was good, the flow of the pacing is solid, while some moments do tend to drag a little, but the film as a whole is worth watching if you're a fan of these films.But like I said there are a few issues with this film, that kind of do need to be addressed, because I feel this film could've been done better than the first two films.
Dislikes: There are a few CGI moments that make the film really off, it make it really obvious that they are in a studio standing in front of a green screen which really takes you out of the film.They had to throw that stupid Political message into the film about the Russian hacking presidential race candidates.As ive said the story is a little weaker than the original two films, this is because the set up of mike banning is way too predictable and find out who it is setting him up cames way to fast in this film. I feel this is what lets the film down and the story down because this reveal could have been kept secret until the 3rd act of the film, instead it was revealed way too early which took away the tension of the film.The way this should have been done was having the very person that set him up a mystery and hidden from the audience until the third act, this would have kept the audience on the edge of their seat wonder who it was setting him up would have kept the film interesting. this is where I think the story fails why the Original two film was actually better though this film was great to watch.",Angel Has Fallen

Nothing in this film makes sense. The assumption is that the viewer is brain dead and will just stare whilst eating popcorn.But it does look good. The grading and quality of images. Even if some of the CGI is amateur.This is a bubblegum film with incredibly lazy story writing. Really poor. It is trying to link in with a political message but the story is so poor it doesn't work. But I would recommend watching. It is a brain dead shoot em up.,Angel Has Fallen
153,mandagrammy,Great Action For a Threequel,8,4 July 2020,"For a third time out, this film holds its own quite well as an action thriller. True, it is totally illogical, but if you expect logic and reality in this genre, you are going to be disappointed almost every time. The only drawback for me was that I figured out who the mastermind behind the assassination plot was very, very early on, as well as the main henchman. That said, it didn't spoil all the fun of seeing the bad guys doing their thing and our hero thwarting them at every turn. So buckle up and enjoy.

Morgan Freeman, despite really looking old here, turns in yet another solid performance as the President and Tim Blake Nelson is a slimy trigger happy vice president.This film is kind of like a steroid enhanced partial remake of the Wolfgang Petersen's 1993 Clint Eastwood starrer 'In the line of fire' from the early 90s.

160,garethvk,Angel Delivers What Fans Expect,8,21 August 2019,"It is hard to believe that it has been six years since Gerard Butler introduced audiences to Special Agent Mike Banning. Over the course of the film and its sequel; Banning kept the President safe against a never-ending barrage of threats both home and abroad.
For the new film ""Angel Has Fallen""; Banning must protect a new President (Morgan Freeman) and clear his name when he is framed after a devastating attack on the President.When he is suddenly the most wanted man in the country; Banning must use all his skills when he is abducted and subsequently escapes while be transported to a detention facility.The movie takes a bit of time getting up to speed but wisely has some good action along the way to setup the film and increase the tension levels. Once the action revs up, it is full on pedal to the floor action with Butler throwing himself into the fray against heavy odds no matter the cost.What makes this film stand out from the others is that narrative is more plausible than other action films and you do see Butler dealing with the results of his profession. This is not a Teflon Super Hero who has bullets bounce off his chest. This is a man who bears his physical and psychological scars from his years in service and has a hard time letting go of the work even though it is what he believes he is best suited for.Morgan Freeman gives a very strong performance as does Nick Nolte who stole many of the scenes in which he was in and provided some real Wild Card comic relief and action to the film.In the end it is Gerard's picture and he throws himself into the part without becoming repetitive of his past films and giving Banning a relatable and sympathetic quality that is often lacking in films of this type.In a summer of many films Over Promising and Under-Delivering: ""Angel Has Fallen"" is a refreshing exception as it was an enjoyable thrill ride from start to finish and I sure hope we have not seen the last of Agent Banning.4 stars out of 5",Angel Has Fallen

168,KathleenK22,People have become too picky and spoiled,9,26 September 2019,This is a very good movie. It is action packed. We went late at night and no way would you fall asleep because it is action packed. Characters are relatable and surprising at times with good actors filling the roles. I like the family involvement and a new family member is introduced not including the baby. There is some humour too but it is mainly an action film. The ending is satisfying. The story is important and this told a story. One reviewer berated the movie based solely on camera work. Facial closeups are fine and notice they are used a lot lately. Warts and moles happen. Maybe it is to denote age or stating nothing is perfect. Angel has Fallen has lots of settings and one in particular is good especially when all hell breaks loose which is funny. There were a couple of jibes at the present president which would have been hard to miss. Anyone who got nothing out of this film and awarded it a 1 or 2 need to understand this this not being objective. We saw a film last week that we could have easily gone to sleep in easily and I gave it 5. But I looked for pluses. This one is visually exciting and tells a tale filled with characters who are well portrayed so there is plenty to like.,Angel Has Fallen
169,GavWaskett,Lightning strikes three times and everyone dies except the man it hits!,6,12 September 2020,"Mike Banning is back and yet again everything goes to hell around him. I mean who would seriously agree to work with this fella anymore. Every assignment he is on, a multitude of people die.Just a quick recap, firstly back in Olympus has Fallen, the presidents wife and a couple of agents die in a car accident, he then leaves his Presidential duty only to come back to save the day once The White House is taken down by Dylan McDermott an old friend of his and generic Asian baddies . Then London gets pretty much wiped off the map when he takes Aaron Eckhart's President to a state funeral, thousands of Londoners and others die as does the Head of the Secret Service, another friend of Banning's. This time is generic Middle Eastern baddies up to no good. Now he is back again looking after the promoted President Trumball (series regular Morgan Freeman), Banning's secret service friends get massacred, Trumball gets targeted and everyone else Banning meets is on the hit list.The change to this one, is that Banning is framed for the attack - but seriously who would believe the man who single handedly saved The White House and London would go after the President, it goes against everything he has ever done. I mean anyone with any ounce of common sense, would go, well this is suspect, I reckon it's a frame job!Other changes included, Banning's wife morphing into Piper Perabo, Nick Nolte turning up as his never ever mentioned father and Danny Huston turning up as Banning's old friend - well I for one wouldn't trust him, just on Banning's track record. I mean all his friends are either traitors or dead. I would definitely run for the hills if my old mate Mike phoned me up and asked me for a catch up beer as nothing good would ever come of it!Tim Blake Nelson and Jada Pinkett Smith turn up so that we have the double barrelled name quota of the cast fulfilled.But, in all seriousness, there is some good twists, the action keeps the film rolling along, even when you are questioning the logical judgement of the people involved and Gerard Butler is always a watchable action star. I read that the Producer has films 4,5 & 6 set up as well as TV Series, so be prepared for Mike Banning to spread destruction and mayhem wherever he goes, oh sorry to stop the baddies and not the cause of any problems whatsoever as it is just pure bad luck what happens to everyone and everything around him!The third film is better than the second but not as good as the first, so if I take 2 from 3 and then add a 1 and then multiply it by the number of films they are going to put Gerard Butler back into his role but then subtract the amounts of Mike Banning's friends who dies but add the number of President' he will serve before he retires and divide that by the gruffness of Nick Nolte's voice, then we have an enjoyable but predictable 12/20 for Mike Banning The Third - a jinx's story!",Angel Has Fallen
170,darkwizard404,Predictable but entertaining,6,1 September 2019,I went in there with little expectations and wasn't disappointed. It's an entertaining action film with not that great of a story. The twist was very predictable but nonetheless a fun movie overall.,Angel Has Fallen
171,kyragd2009,Another action,5,14 May 2020,"I liked it. It's not the great though. If anyone Gerard Buttler fan, this is for you. He is younger and not bulky in this movie!",Angel Has Fallen
172,benxrichardson,P's get degrees,5,23 June 2021,This action film is a solid pass. The plot is ridiculous and some of the CGI is poor but the action scenes are solid and the drone scenes are reasonably unique.I would never recommend any of the has fallen series but they are good mindless fun.,Angel Has Fallen
173,garethwooduk,Brilliant action movie!,9,2 September 2019,"Really don't get the negative reviews, for those who haven't scene it and want too? Please do!If this is to be trilogy movie to end all 3 well that just ends a brilliant series!Gerald Butler is the best of Liam Neeson & Bruce Willis, great action one again... set pieces... more explosions and good plot twist, no spoilers!Love the back story of Mike Bannings absent father, everyone is on point and throughly enjoyed!We need more action movies like this!All hail Gerald Butler!",Angel Has Fallen
174,benjaminwest-242,A thrilling end to the trilogy,6,3 November 2021,"Angel Has Fallen is a solid conclusion to the Has Fallen movies. The acting is good, highlighted by Butler's intense demeanor. Emotionally the film is average and lacks dialogue that would help the film flow more smoothly and logically, but the plot is still largely well written. There are some questionable moments, however, that falter the film. With its intriguing action, this can be slightly forgiven. The comedic moments also are a plus for a more serious toned production. Overall, a worthwhile film to complete the franchise.",Angel Has Fallen
175,helenbassett,Angel Has Fallen Film Review - Ric Roman Waugh Directs Gerard Butler As Public Enemy No1 - The Most Wanted Man In America,9,7 September 2019,"I don't know how many security staff it takes, and how much it costs, to keep a president safe when he's fishing (or golfing!). But for Gerard Butler's Mike Banning the cost is much more physical. In Ric Roman Waugh's Angel Has Fallen Mike has always been part of the president's Secret Service detail, and now President Trumbull wants Mike to take on the role of Secret Service Director. But Mike is keeping his president in the dark about his many health issues, and also his wife. The unrecognisable Leah in a cast change, and now played by the lovely Piper Perabo.Gerard Butler is slightly fraying around the edges, but he's not yet ready for a desk job, and he's game for another tour of duty with Angel Has Fallen. He can still run with the bulls when training on Danny Huston's assault course. Danny in fine fettle is either a president or villain in his screen roles, and here he is Mike's comrade in arms Wade Jennings, from way back. Now running his own private security business, maybe if Mike took on the Secret Service role he may throw some business Wade's way. Times are hard during peace for military contractors.But all that gets blown out of the water when on the fishing trip above a swarm of drones takes out the presidential detail, except Mike, who manages to save President Trumbull by hurling them both off the boat and into the freezing water. A hardy group of stuntmen took to the water during the attack with plenty of firepower.As the president lies in a coma and fighting for his life, Tim Blake Nelson is sworn in as VP Kirby. To be honest he is too short to be US President! But he lands on his feet determined to root out who ordered the attack. And unfortunately Jada Pinkett Smith's FBI Agent Helen Thompson has narrowed it down to one. The trail leads straight to the Dark Web and a $10 million bank account in Mike's name, courtesy of the Russians. With the van from where the drones were launched found, and full of Mike's DNA, as back up evidence. It's very thorough and neat.Angel has fallen far and Mike is the No1 villain in the US. How many times can a president's life be threatened under the watch of the same guy? Before he snaps and takes up the arms himself? Even Lance Reddick as Secret Service Director David Gentry believes Mike is guilty. He must be retiring if Mike is being offered his job. Back to The Continental Hotel for him then!In custody on the other side of the law Mike is taken enroute to a detention centre, when the convoy is attacked, and he is sprung. Until he takes out these would be assassins and makes his escape. Although you would never know as it's so dark you can barely make anything out. But he recognises a couple of the guys he just despatched, from Wade Jenning's security set up last week. I think we know whose gig this is! Yet with more guns than people in the US, and a patriotic population, Mike himself is likely to be recognised if he attempts to phone his wife. He is, but manages to tell Leha he has been set up, just as the Feds zone in on his call. And the service station customers zero in on him. Fortunately he can drive a rig to make a fast escape..If Mike has been set up he needs to lay low and work out his next move. And he heads for Nick Nolte who has the perfect off grid life in West Virginia. Mike's estranged Vietnam vet father is also really keen on protecting his land. And when the villains find them, well Clay is ready for them. Lots of bangs for your buck in this one. And plenty of laughs. Angel isn't taking itself too seriously here.And back in the Oval Office the VP is hawkishly eyeing up the Russians, and with the US military spread thinly across the world, he may need to use additional private military if the US want to launch an attack. Wonder who they could ask for that?With President Trumbull heavily guarded how is Mike going to get to him and prevent the real bad guys from taking him out? I'm willing to give Gerard a chance. He's always good in these shoot to kill roles and Angel Has Fallen carries itself well. With a lively cast, Jada Pinckett Smith looked especially good, terrific stunt crew, and plenty of buildings to blow up, Ric Roman Waugh gets the job done.A great action movie for the boys. With a surprising end credit scene. Because in the dark no-one can hear you scream!",Angel Has Fallen
176,paindweller,This was wicked!,8,15 November 2019,"Such an enjoying watch, sure it was slightly cheesy in places yet the overall film was so good! I'm glad I never watched the other 2 because this did the trick!",Angel Has Fallen
177,Exiled_Universe,Best in the trilogy!,9,22 December 2019,"This movie wasn't better than the Rambo movie but it was very very close. The movie had a great modern dark plot to it which I felt like it was used in other movies before but this one definitely stands out from anything like that. First of let me talk about the something amazing, the different settings. There is a lot of chase sences in the movie and most of it takes place at night which is really cool and makes it feel different and also makes it stand out from other sences in other movies. It also makes it feel a bit realistic and modrn in some ways. Sometimes it can be slightly predictable and felt like it was made in 2010 but in other times it blew your mind and had a lot of minor plot twists here and there that were pretty suprising to me. The little ending scene was pretty funny and had wierd vibes because the whole movie was dark and gritty and then just that was a little wierd. Also the actors like Morgan Freeman and the guy from John Wich chapter 3. Overall it was an amazing movie and I absolutely loved it and it was a great modern movie that felt great and I also wonder if there will be a fourth entry in the then ""franchise"".",Angel Has Fallen
178,pcampionz,Great Action! Nolte was Great!,7,12 April 2020,"Lots of good action not the best movie but very watchable. Great story line! Would have e been cool if they showed Nolte with a tunnel system around the property and they could have taken out the bad guys like that, but the way he did it was great as well!",Angel Has Fallen
179,Birminghamukengland,Absolutely terrible.,1,23 August 2019,I can no longer take anything to do with the USA President seriously with the current imbocile and amoeba that is Trump who is resident in the Whitehouse. So with a plot to assassinate the stupidly named President Trumpball I couldn't have cared less anyway what happened to him.This film really is totally dire. The acting is appalling and for the first half is filmed in the dark.The scenes are repetitive and plain boring with a storyline a child could have written.What a waste of two hours and 25 quid.Shame on the makers of this rubbish.,Angel Has Fallen
180,martinsplads,Waste of time,1,3 September 2019,"You know what ? This movie is a generic boring action flick with zero surprises and no depth what so ever. I feel sorry for people that pay money for this trash, its just really tragic that directors and producers gets away with making action movies that shouldn't have been made in the first place. Just by looking at the poster you know exactly how this movie gonna end, I don't believe that anyone with half off a brain cant figure this movie out is that God damn predictable. The only thing that actually works are Gerard Butler and Nick Nolte acting but they cant save this film, not by a long shot. Angel Has Fallen has fallen down in the toilet and I just hope it stays there forever.",Angel Has Fallen

Lots of time and money.",Angel Has Fallen

The storyline is realistic, nothing in this movie is exaggerated. Actors Morgan Freeman and Gerard Butler are a great combination, there are some tear-jerking moments so guys are prepared. I would have to recommend this movie to anyone that asks me about it.",Angel Has Fallen

185,kleinjoshua-76516,It was alright,7,13 December 2019,It was ok. Descent story some pretty nice action scenes. But i think Butler needs to except the fact he can't keep up with action movies anymore.,Angel Has Fallen
186,jcallows,Oceans rise. Cities fall. Hope survives.,7,5 April 2020,"It was great seeing Morgan Freeman as the President again. He was a natural at it in Deep Impact. I remembered his calm, soothing voice when he told the public in the midst of an impending meteor disaster, ""There will be no hoarding. I'm freezing all prices. What costs a dollar today will cost a dollar tomorrow."" Those words and that film came to mind during the recent events. But I digress.Angel Has Fallen followed the same path as Wolverine and Rambo. It spent more time exploring the human side of our hero. And like those films, it felt contrived and unnecessary. Take this part out and you won't miss anything. Because of this element, Angel Has Fallen was a film of two halves. The first half was about Banning and his past. It was slow, dull and nonsensical. And the fact that much of the action was in the dark didn't help either.The second half was a different movie altogether. That was a good thing because it became similar to the previous Fallen films. The second half pretty much redeemed this film with some intense action sequences and good chemistry among the main characters.The verdict? Definitely the weakest in the trilogy but still enjoyable to watch. Just skip the first half.",Angel Has Fallen
187,christosyr,Good!,8,13 November 2019,Good film but something I found ridiculous is the name of the president? Trumpbull are they serious?

194,sme3,Preposterous,4,31 August 2019,"Rather than serving up escalating tension and increasing action, Angel Has Fallen serves up escalating implausibilities and increasing absurdities. Some of the action scenes are exciting, but the preposterous plot make caring about the stakes of the film nearly impossible. Ultimately, this film seems like only so much noise devoid of meaning. Morgan Feeeman elevates the film considerably with a performance way above the rest of the material. Phony-looking visual effects enhance the unbelievability pervasive throughout the film.",Angel Has Fallen
195,jimwt66,Decent movie but just more of the same,6,12 July 2020,"If you like action movies then you will like this. It is basically the same as the other 2 movies but still has its own merits. The acting was on par with what you expect from Freeman and Butler. The video was good. The sound was good. It was predictable but who really goes to see action movies for a twist?Call me immature but my favorite part came after the credits started rolling. I definitely hate what Marvel started where you have to wait for the credits to catch the last little bit of the movie. Anyway, like I said call me immature but I laughed my ass off on the last line ""I'm going to pee in here"".Nick Nolte really was slammed by life. He looks like death warmed over but for this case his looks fit the character. Not sure how many action movies Butler has left in him. He has come a long way since his days of ""Madness?

I mean if you're FBI but you make bad decissions like you're in Police Academy, it's irritating to watch.And the main bad guy in this movie you know it's him after a few shots, and when they reveiled him it wasn't surprising at all.Typical 5 points action movie, where it's predictable, filled with stupid people just because they need to die as in the script, and worst of all the camera work.Good thing is they completed a trilogy without completely falling apart, it's not the worst and hopefully the next one will be better.",Angel Has Fallen

The bulletproof bodyguard returns as a PTSD-afflicted insomniac, forced to go rogue to clear his name after he's blamed for an attack on Morgan Freeman's president. Director Ric Roman Waugh shoehorns in a few explosive set-pieces, but Freeman seems somnolent even when not required to be comatose.

I thought it was a good story with many surprises along the way. The movie touches on how outsourcing government functions can leave us vulnerable.
The movie was timely with the president being a hybrid of Trump and Obama (Morgan Freeman was called ""President Trumble"" or something like that.)
The movie touched on Russian interference although that turns out to be one of the story lines that might surprise you.

Don't outsource! Build as much as we can here in the states and take the power away from the countries that have us by the balls! You know who I'm talking about! Trump was right, who would've thunk it?",Angel Has Fallen
212,northernpaladin,Exactly what you'd expect,6,20 February 2021,"There are 3 things to know about this film.
1. It's way better than London
2. Nick Nolte completely owns it
3. Gerard Butler is getting a bit old for this
Beyond that, it is exactly what you'd expect; super secret, super efficient, military contractors outsmart and outfight the whole of the US intelligence network and frame our hero with $10million even though boss of said contractors is allegedly broke. These contractors are also prepared to kill their own present to secure funding, really? We also have, of course, the obligatory enemy within (the VP) who is opposed to the president's liberal agenda - hold on, isn't this the plot to White House Down?
Not surprisingly our hero fights against all the odds to bring down the bad guys in a series of high octane, high body count encounters where the super efficient contractors can't hit a barn door and seem to have no urban environment fighting skills. This is against a single opponent who is physically impaired (as detailed in earlier scenes with doctor) and is generally only armed with a pistol.
Obviously it all works out in the end but along the way we have to endure Piper Perabo as an incredibly wooden wife and the casual throwing away of two promising characters, Jada Pinkett Smith & Joseph Millson as the dogged FBI agents - maybe there's just no room for an empowered black female in the all white testosterone environment of a Gerard Butler film?
What did grate however was the final scene of the epic shoot out where Butler sits with the dying Danny Huston and they jabber on about being 'lions' as if they were warriors of old who had fought nobley. Absolutely not! Butler, as Mike Banning, has fought for his flag and his president and has right on his side (and yes this is completely cliche ridden) whereas Huston is a cold blooded murderer who has killed indiscriminately he definitely isn't a warrior.
All that said the film passes 2 hours quite effectively which is exactly what it is intended to do but Butler really does need to look at his lined and jowly face and say ""I'm done"".",Angel Has Fallen

It has filled with curiosity , suspense and action during the entire run time.So you can just relax and enjoy the action with a sweet pop corn.The plot was curious enough to attract the viewers attention for about three quarters of the run time.The last quarter is about putting the finishing touches and one thing I hate was the hero has got everything right and everything happens to his advantage.Morgan freeman / Gerard and Houston put on a cynical show of pure class acting which I actually believed fulled to the success of this not-so-innovative plot.I would rate this film same as Olympus has fallen, White House Down etc. Jason Bourne belongs to this same category but it has a matured and strategic Story which obviously make it bit more appealing and rated.Yeah but viewers do need this kinda light story lines from time to time.",Angel Has Fallen

No spoilers here, but if the FBI comes across a dozen dead bad guys in a bunch of vehicles and can't ID a single one of them, then they are woefully incompetent. There's just way too many ""that could never happen"" moments to make the movie enjoyable.
There are some spectacular set-pieces. And the twins that play the daughter Lynne are probably the best actors in the movie.

I like Mike Banning. He's a big mess, but I like him. So found the somewhat mediocre action scenes that separated the big heart moment fully tolerable, because the little family payoffs are so nice.This is, so we're clear, not a very good movie, being both predictable, too long, full of a kind of digestible hyper-violence that I think is actually bad for the world, and profoundly cynical about America in all the wrong ways - but I enjoyed it, and more than the other two, which were superior action movies by a good measure.If you liked the others, you'll probably like this.

It's familiar territory we've seen in movies before and it hits all those beats and settles for something fine rather than great.Angel Has Fallen is not a bad film it's just a very bland and forgettable one in a series that's much the same aside from the fun in the first film. Angels best new asset is bringing in Nick Nolte as Banning's father and though it's great to see Nick Nolte in a film he doesn't add much to it overall.The film is just bland and dull with things we've seen before, action scenes we've seen plenty of times before and it feels ultimately like this series has nothing more to offer us. That's why it probably feels so bland and often times boring. The actors all do a fine job, but the material they're given doesn't do anything for them.There's really not much else to say.

As far as a good and honest action flick goes, it has all the ingredients. Butler does have more ""wobble chops"", but it fits the narrative of the story - the ageing warrior. I liked the tech presented - gave it a bit of a ""007"" feel.

You can survive serious car crashes emerging only briefly dazed. Out of the many hails of bullets only one slightly nicks our hero. There is the usual conspiracy in high places, and Morgan Freeman is yet again president. Probably 40 people appear to be killed, several by explosions, and yet not a single drop of blood instead of dismembered corpses.

There is a lot of action, but the plot twists are fairly predictable and the dialogue laughable at times. There are many implausible aspects, but I thought the worst occurred when Banning conveniently found a working pay phone so that he could call his wife (Piper Perabo) to let her know that he was all right.

256,sophaljonesy,The most enjoyable of the trilogy,7,25 August 2019,"When Gerard Butler launched his character Mike Benning in Olympus has fallen, you know this is supposed to be a fun action flick and no classic in making. The sequel had terrible CGI and a bit overly dramatic at times, but this instalment was surprisingly good. It was able to play the strength of all the cast. Butler is more like a real person than a movie action hero, since he has to deal with the toll his body has taken from all the fighying he has gone through. This vulnerability combined with stoic toughness is what makes Gerard Butler's Mike Banning in this installment particularly interesting; we actually worry about him and think he can get it anytime. For not spoiling the movie, though it is obvious if you know this person's filmography, the villain was a believable threat to Butler's Benning because he is more calculating and as adept with the gun as Benning. Nick Nolte was a scene stealer and provided great comic relief, while Lance Reddick from John Wick is still as charismatic here as he was in John Wick. Though he is a completely different character. This attests to his hidden acting talents. I am also glad to see a cameo by Michael Landes too. Though he played a supoorting role, he chew scenery too. Finally, we have Morgan Freeman as president, and he was as calming and authoritative a presence as an ideal president should be. He shows why Gerard Butler would actively endanger himself to protect Morgan Freeman. Besides the acting, the shooting scenes are great. The explosions are plenty and even car chase scenes work well. In fact, this installment is very different from its predecessor. The scope of the story is wider, and portrays political intrigue better than its predecessors. There is some bad CGI but luckily that can be overlooked. In short, I am surprised at how good this movie is.",Angel Has Fallen

Butler changes up his Banning character into a flawed hero who keeps trying his best to protect his president. Freeman delivers a respectable President that viewers want to be protected. Huston brings a longtime friend who becomes a credibly disappointed security professional. Nolte shouts his way into the action and heart of this film. The gals deliver, too: Perabo shows us the frustrated and endangered wife and mother; Smith represents the consummate security professional; even the darling toddler screams her disgust at the villains. There is genuine humor in the dialogue, lightening the mood as needed. Miss seeing this movie in a theater setting and you will regret it.",Angel Has Fallen

285,ben_mister_s,Much MUCH better than London has Fallen!,7,23 August 2019,"Strangely enough, these movies really stuck with me over the years! I remember seeing Olympus has Fallen six years ago and considering it be ""The Air Force One on the ground"" movie!Obviously mindless fun but fun nevertheless.With London has Fallen they took a direction that almost every anti terrorist movie takes. Far from original plot, pretty bad one liners and some of the characters seemed like rookies compared to their smarter appearance in Olympus.But this movie was just fine. Given how this was written, it could've passed as a whole new movie instead of a third part of the trilogy.Mike Banning seemed like an invincible Rambo in the last two movies, in this movie they give his character the depth you don't see in the other two movies, physical trouble, mental trouble, relationship struggle, etc. The man is hurting and far from as effective as he used to be.Morgan Freeman brings along his wisdom, just like in the first two movies. Nick Nolte delivers a good (and comic) performance as Mike's dad.Not all of the plot, however, makes this movie okay. Some of it was obviously sped up to keep the pace going, leaving a few holes. Also some of it was very predictable. It is very easy to sniff out who the traitors are that set Mike Banning up, hardly making this a who did it? Early arguments in the movie let you know instantly that karma will be knocking on the door later on in the movie. Therefore a bit predictable.That being said. The movie is far more original then London has Fallen. The acting is just fine, most of the characters don't look like complete idiots, the action sequences are not extremely over the top but still exciting.Maybe not best of the three, but in a way definitely the most original of the three.

Gerald Butler is reliable, Morgan Freeman is classic and the use of technology in the opening attack is very concerning.If you a sensitive to it, it could be construed to be a bit 'rah rah America', but all three of them have been consistent with that.

However, the plot itself is a bit meh and very predictable. I mean since Donald Trump became president I cannot really take seriously any movie that attempts to make the president an upstanding, morally superior principled good guy that always says and does the right thing. If anything the vice president (bad guy) in this movie is more like Trump (the real life president). Anyway apart from that it was an ok movie better than the London one and the first one they made.

Not cool at all to do that to a child.That stupidity aside, Nxxxxx Xxxe provided a great unexpected appearance (I don't want to give his name away if you are like me and didn't look at the cast). I really enjoyed his character and performance. I'm sure he probably objected at how they treated that little girl too. Okay enough about the traumatized child.Another aspect that I really enjoyed was the technology the villains employed in the assassination of the President.

331,gandalf_theWise14,"A solid, action-packed conclusion to the ""Fallen"" trilogy",4,24 August 2019,"Angel Has Fallen is the third and seemingly final entry in Gerard Butler's action trilogy. At least, it really should be the last one, because Butler is starting to look his age, and there's only so many times one man can save a President. Anyway, ""Angel"" is a decidedly different type of film than the two that came before it, and I enjoyed it all the more for it.The title of this movie refers to top secret service agent Mike Banning, the President's so-called ""guardian angel."" Banning accompanies the new President of the United States, Allan Trumbull, on a fishing trip. While Trumbull is out on the water, a large group of drones attacks and bombs the area, killing everyone present other than Banning and, because of Banning's heroic actions, Trumbull. However, all of the evidence points to Banning being the mastermind behind this assassination attempt, and with Trumbull in a coma, there is no one to say otherwise. Seeing that he has been set up, Banning must now use all of his abilities to evade his own government, all the while attempting to uncover who it really is that wants Trumbull dead.The plot bears a resemblance to ""The Fugitive,"" a film that it clearly took a good deal of inspiration from. A man is framed for a murder he had nothing to do with, and now has to avoid capture until he can prove that he has done nothing wrong. There is even a scene in the woods with Banning running desperately away as the police attempt to find him, which was very clearly an homage to Harrison Ford's very similar scene in ""The Fugitive."" Of course, I'm not saying that this film is on the level of ""The Fugitive"" in terms of quality; this is a movie that's much more about the action than the deep meaning behind the story. In this way, ""Angel"" is very similar to the other movies in the series. However, they did seem to go in a much different direction with the story, which I greatly appreciated. Instead of saving the President from terrorists, Banning is the assumed terrorist that his former colleagues think the President needs to be saved from. Banning therefore spends a good amount of his time on the run, trying to remain hidden. They needed to go a different route for this film to avoid feeling repetitive, and they pulled it off.One thing that they did spend a good amount of time on was the age of Banning, and the physical toll that his job likely took on his body over the years. Something that is often ignored in franchises like this is the damage to the hero's body that will be sustained over time. In this film, they fully address this issue. Banning is taking painkillers to stop his constant headaches, and we see that it is starting to affect him both physically and mentally. We can tell that he will not be able to do such a physically demanding job for much longer. I really like how they attempted to convey this, because it was starting to become significantly less believable that Banning can still beat everyone up like he has been. It also gives off the feeling that he is much more vulnerable; I really thought this was a great addition, as one of my big issues with the previous two films is that Banning was seemingly invincible and just couldn't be stopped. In this way, I felt much more connected with him as a character, and was therefore more emotionally invested.Perhaps the best part of this movie was the addition of Banning's dad. We get a bit of information about Banning's past and where he came from, as well as some more emotional weight to the story. His dad was also a hilarious character that provided for some of the funniest moments of the entire series. Despite the amped up humor, though, the typical jokes from Banning didn't seem to be there. In the two other films, he would tend to crack jokes when in tense situations, but it didn't really happen here. That instead seemed to be replaced by the more emotional and meaningful moments. I would still say this was probably the funniest movie in the series, but most of the laughs came from Banning's dad, rather than Banning himself.One thing that felt off about this film was the oddly missing President Asher, who was played by Aaron Eckhart in the two previous movies. Of course, he's not the President anymore, Trumbull is. However, I still would have liked a quick cameo of some sort; maybe the opening scene could have been him passing the job off or something. I'm assuming there were scheduling conflicts of some sort, or something like that, but it just felt wrong not seeing him throughout the entire film.The weakest part of this movie was probably the villain, or villains. It is incredibly predictable who they end up being, and their motivations are your stereotypical action movie villain motivations: one wants power, the other money. The villains follow just about every action movie cliché there is. The writing of these characters was lazy and uninspired, with no creativity whatsoever.As for the action in this film, it's more of what you've come to expect from this series, but it was not quite as good as before. Gerard Butler is definitely getting old for these types of movies, and he was just not as quick as before. The hand-to-hand fights were slower and less fun to watch, and just about all of the action was filmed with shaky cameras and chopped-up footage. There is one fight scene in a car where it is literally impossible to tell what's happening. It's super dark and the camera keeps quickly cutting to different shots. Several of the gunfights later also use these quick cuts, making it really hard to even tell what's happening or who's shooting who. Some of the action in the earlier movies was edited like this, but this one was definitely the worst. If the action was more smooth, it would have been much more enjoyable to watch.Gerard Butler as Mike Banning in this movie gives a performance much like the other two he's given in this series. It's nothing you'll see at the Oscars, or any award show for that matter, but it gets the job done. Maybe he fell a little flat in a scene or two, but it was mostly solid work from him. His biggest issue was really his age. He is considerably slower (and even a little heavier) than when we last saw him, and this affects the action a little bit. However, they did a good job of building this into the plot and Banning's character, and it actually really worked. It felt much more realistic this way. The only thing that was hurt a bit was the action, where he definitely struggled a bit more than usual. The film still works, though, because of the direction they take his character.The rest of the cast is good enough. Returning members Morgan Freeman and Piper Perabo both again give solid performances, and Danny Huston is good as well. Nick Nolte is probably the star of the show as Banning's dad, providing very well-timed comic relief. Again, the acting isn't super memorable or anything, but it gets the job done.Overall, Angel Has Fallen is a solid conclusion (at least for now) to the trilogy. It provides a different type of storyline and more emotional weight, but the action is still plentiful. If you've enjoyed the series so far, you'll find something to like with this one.",Angel Has Fallen

339,marla-erwin,Franchise has fallen,3,6 December 2019,"I enjoyed the first two installments (Olympus Has Fallen & London Has Fallen), but it's pretty clear they stopped trying with this one. Within five minutes you can easily guess who the villain will turn out to be, who his confederate is, and pretty much everything that's going to happen.Every cliche is trotted out, from the ""will the hero retire or won't he"" tease at the beginning, to the hero and villain facing off mano-a-mano (literally) on a rooftop despite dozens of foot soldiers still around somewhere. And you'll have to suspend your disbelief for absurdities large (the villain has an impossible array of resources) and small (bad guys get into a heavily protected house by going around to the BACK DOOR).The most enjoyable bits are when Nick Nolte appears as Mike's estranged father (not a spoiler - that's telegraphed pretty well too). In fact, the after-credits scene of Mike and his dad trying to bond is the best part of the entire movie.In short, don't bother unless you've forgotten how movies work and need to be reminded of all the tropes.",Angel Has Fallen

This movie is a perfect example of how lazy movie directing has become. Virtually every scene - even slow static scenes- were done with a super zoomed in, constantly panning and focusing handled cameras. It made this movie absolutely unwatchable. I had to laugh at one scene where the entire scene was nothing but a mega-zoomed in view of Morgan Freeman's eyes.. all you could notice were the dark moles all over his face. I don't know this director.. and after seeing this one, I hope I don't have to look him up ever again. This thing stinks...",Angel Has Fallen
341,jackransom-69832,Angel Has Fallen,5,25 August 2019,"The third and i'm guessing final (depending how much money it makes) instalment of the 'Has Fallen' franchise. The first film - 'Olympus Has Fallen' is a genuinely very good action film in my opinion, it's brutal, bloody and well directed with some good performances. However its follow 'London Has Fallen' was rubbish, a bland, lower budget messily cut and shot film which somehow made more money than it predecessor, which is why we now have 'Angel Has Fallen'.The film once again follows Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is framed for attempting to murder the President (Morgan Freeman) and must evade his own agency and the FBI (led by Jada Pinkett Smith) as he tries to uncover the true threat and who framed him.This is better than the previous film by quite a bit, it's much more self-aware and the story is more interesting. Gerard Butler does give his all here and clearly cares about the franchise (he is producer on the film as well) he throws himself into the action scenes and Banning actually has more character focus here. His previous fights are finally catching up to him and he is having to medicate himself to prevent insomnia and headaches. You get this sense that every punch, throw and bullet he takes is really hurting this time round. Nick Nolte is clearly having a blast as Father Banning , his character is completely ridiculous but also has the most entertaining sequence in the film. Danny Huston is also enjoying that one role he plays as a military/evil organisation/politician and chews all the scenery around him. Jada Pinkett Smith is fine in her role but she really doesn't get anything to do and by now you do get the sense in some scenes that Morgan Freeman is just done with this sort of film now, however he does still have his moments.There is some entertaining action at points. The whole father/son team-up sequence is easily the highlight, with enough explosions to make Michael Bay feel a bit jealous and it is still cool and satisfying to see bloody gunshot and knife kills from an action film not restricted by its age rating, however this film really is left behind now that we have John Wick, Deadpool etc. to fill that niche with better writing and more inventive action. Also the action relies on too much quickcutting and shaky cam so there is no structure or scale to the shootouts.The film is just over 2 hours and it really feels it at points, there are several bland dialogue sequences and honestly no one cares about these characters enough to focus on family and dramatic sequences. Also there are several unintentionally funny inconsistencies. For a start they recast Mike's wife and she is younger than the previous actress and get's some horrendous dialogue (which is also a staple of this film at times), in the final section Morgan Freeman goes from being barely able to walk only being pushed in a wheelchair to full on sprinting about a minute after. The budget and scale is less than the previous film as well with some of the CGI being awful especially when the film swaps between practical and digital effects. Also it has the most utterly pointless, unfunny and random mid-credit sequence I've ever seen put to film.If it wasn't for the brand name and the cast this probably would've gone straight to DVD or streaming. It's an already dated and forgettable action film. It has some entertaining moments but its really not worth bothering with.",Angel Has Fallen

The script is not the strongest, some may even say it is weak. OK, I won't argue the point. If there is a singular flaw, it is in the directing. 'Angel' is certainly not as good a film as 'London' or even 'Olympus'. But, it has some redeeming qualities: Morgan Freeman, Nick Nolte, Gerard Butler and Tim Blake Nelson are enjoyable to watch, several action scenes are notable (the drones are intriguing, and watching Nick Nolte 'defend' his homestead is delightful). Overall, it was a fun date night movie, enhanced by popcorn.It has been a good trilogy, but Angel will help end it.

I like the way that its referenced that the last couple of outings in the franchise has taken a toll on him both physically and mentally (you'll see, as wont give anything away)
Nick Nolte is pretty good as Case, and his scene in the woods at night is pretty...lets say...'explosive' lol (if seen in a good theatre with great sound, it'll rumble through the cinema!)
The climax really brings the house down (pun intended wink), and has some amazing action too!

The movie lacks a lot of action compared to the other 2 which this franchise is built on with also a few cast member leaving or been replaced this feels like it will be the fitting end to the franchise.

407,wattsontrain,Worst Gerald Butler movie ever written....,1,14 November 2019,"This movie is so bad I decided to finally create an account to write this review to try and spare most from this embarrassment of a film. First and foremost the action scenes were great. Im a butler fan btw. Gunfire, explosions and hand to hand combat is always fun to watch. Besides that it's the only positive thing I can say about this movie.The writing is in this movie is beyond pathetic, extremely lazy and just plain predictable. Whoever wrote this needs to be fired immediately or stick to writing children's books. The story goes like this. Gerald butler is the secret service agent working on his 3rd presidency term that previously single handedly saved the presidents life. In this movie he is with the president on a fishing trip when they're attacked by a drone strike. For some reason all the other secret service agents are terrible at their jobs and are all killed. Gerald butler and the president(morgan freeman) live but are in a coma.
When agent banner wakes up he is handcuffed and charged by the FBI for the attempted murder on the president because they found a van with his dna that sent out the drones. Apparently he is obviously guilty to them but no one sits to think this is the same guy that saved the president from two terrible attacks previously and the one guy who vouches for him is the current president. Banner taking painkillers and hiding it is enough for the government to believe he received 10 million dollars from the Russians.
The entire plot is revealed about 40 minutes into it or so. The writers must of thought ""we suck at this so let's tell everyone what they already suspect. The VP takes over as acting president and wants to go to war with Russia. Banners friend is the man behind the attacks and is just trying to get a government contract for his private agency from the VP once they go to war.
Banner escapes the prison transport due to Danny Hutson's team trying to take him. He kills them and leaves them on the road and the government still can figure who is behind the attacks at this point?
Pushing forward now everyone now knows the plot yet Danny hutsons team is still trying to kill the president. They get into a huge gun battle at hospital and Danny hutson has like 4 guys left alive on his team yet he continues on trying to kill the president. Why? Is he still gonna get that government contract if he did? It just makes no damn sense at all.
Anyone who says this movie keeps them on the edge of their seat is very very easily entertained and extremely gullible. If you read my entire review and you choose not to watch the movie you're welcomed. I saved you 2 hours of nonsense. This series must come to an end immediately. Theres a reason why Morgan freeman says he only does these movies for the money.",Angel Has Fallen
408,LastWeeksSocks,The Angel Definitely Fell,2,23 October 2020,"I went to see this in theater. I was a big fan of the franchise to this point.. Original was fantastic. Really enjoyed it. Sequel also quite good. This was just so very very very....very bad. Even setting aside a terrible storyline (which was poor even for an action movie), every aspect or this movie was underwhelming, especially considering the budget.I don't expect alot from action movies but, I do expect the action to be...ya know....good? At least that part should be solid, right? Watching this movie depressed me a bit. It seemed like 70% of the movie was a continuous close shot of Gerard Butler's face, who is starting to make the Val Kilmer transition.Slight spoiler from this point. Taking a look at the storyline, which as I said I put much less weight on for an action film than normal, it was also extremely poor. Gerard's character framed for an assissation attempt on the president, Morgan Freeman (who he obviously is guarding). The assassination attempt is by incredibly technically advanced means (as in never before seen advanced). Butler's prints are everywhere on the weapon controls. At no point do the people that arrest him question him being behind what would basically Tony Stark level tech nor him being smart enough to orchestrate an attack but, not wipe the keyboard, or almost killing himself also (that's right, he also almost died in the failed attempt). Having this idea of framing Butler for an assassination attempt was always going to be tough to pull off and make believable after he essentially saved the world twice.This was the first movie that I can remember that I almost left the theater. I give it 2 stars simply for respect to the franchise and since I didn't actually leave the theater lol. If you have the thought to watch this movie, save yourself the heartache and go watch the prequels instead, or better yet a John Wick movie.",Angel Has Fallen
409,Orki72,Trust Noone,4,24 August 2019,"It is abolutely frustrating if casting gives away the plot within the first third of a movie. We know the villains, we know the story, so all the way until the end we are watching plot holes getting bigger by the minute.
So if the cast doesn't add up, the story fails to keep the audience from boredom and the dialogue and action is only there mostly without any meaning, you know this is bad.
Don't get me wrong. It could have been a solid fun action movie, if it wasn't so predictable.
So, if you don't know yet to watch this and you are reading some of the reviews and actually the range is from ""the best action movie in years"" to ""a clear miss with no story"", what do you trust? Well, just trust noone.
So why am I writing this review? Just out of frustrating why often it seems impossible to have a decent good action movie these days. I don't get it, are all the good writers on TV? Are all the stories told? Maybe I've seen it all with a history of movie-going for 30 years. I don't know.

By the end it is laughable. It truly is written at a 3rd grade level. It starts early where the ""bad guys"" talk outloud to each other about what they are doing and why, because you know, if have are carrying out a plot, you always pause to review every step of the plot with everyone that carrying it out already and fully knows it. Instead of using some brains and write a good story that carries you along and using the story to reveal the plot, just have bad guys say it out loud so the audience knows. ""We are going to kill the President. Yes, we are and bin it on Mike Banning. Yes, and we are going to get a contract and make money for it!"" Really? They didn't know that already? From there is gets worse. From saying completely false things like, ""we've never had power transferred to the VP and then back to the President. We don't know what to do,"" to A President who is on a ventilator and in a coma one moment to running for his life the next moment to using oxygen to blow up the hospital (oxygen is a NON-flammable gas).

ONE downer though.... to me alot of this movie seemed to mirror scenes if not the movie as a whole from White House down and felt a bit like a reboot of that film, weird to say I know as Olympus has fallen was the reboot but I still feel the same nether the less a great film",Angel Has Fallen
418,jens-andree,Final chapter?,6,27 November 2019,"Angel Has Fallen is the third instalment of the secret service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) and the former Speaker/Vice President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) is now the President and yet again Banning is thrown into a major crisis - this time being accused of an assassination attempt of the President?!Obviously Gerard Butler is getting older and so is his character in the movie, but this is part of the story so those who complain that he's to old to be a bodyguard misses the plot.None of the movies in the trilogy are made to win any Oscars, nor do we expect them to, because they are full fledged action movies - and pretty damn good ones too!
However, Angel Has Fallen lacks somewhat in the story department compared to the two previous instalments, where I feel they've had much more involved and detailed stories whereas this one is more or less just one single thread throughout the whole movie. No side plots/tracks at all apart from a minor FBI investigation that's sadly cut short.One huge negative is that the wife of Mike Banning, Leah, is replaced by Piper Perabo. I don't know why they couldn't get Radha Mitchell for this one as well, but even if it's a minor role it never works replacing established characters...It doesn't quite match Olympus Has Fallen and London Has Fallen, but it's a good action movie and casting Nick Nolte as Bannings father, Clay Banning, was spot on and he delivers a really good supporting role.If you like the previous movies and you want a classic action movie this'll do the trick, but don't expect the same depth and story as the previous ones, but on a rainy day it does its job.",Angel Has Fallen

You'll feel like you've seen this movie before.,4,26 August 2019,"Everything that happens in this movie is either a cliche you've seen many times before or plainly telegraphed. The only part that could be a little unexpected was revealed in the trailers (the dad part) but even that wasn't really taken advantage of.The actions scenes are done well, even if some go overboard (which movies like this tend to do, blowing up a hospital? sure, why not) but there's nothing original in this movie and even though it means repeat viewings when this movie makes it's way to cable networks wouldn't be fine (you can start watching in the middle and you won't be confused by any of it) there are plenty of other similar movies that provide the same amount of action but are less predictable.Using cliches and subverting them could've made this movie much better. Let us think you're doing the same thing all of these movies have done before and then go somewhere else. Don't start the movie with an obvious training exercise masquerading as a real situation, don't make the obvious people the villains (the old army buddy that needs to get new private contracts, the vice president that's so hungry for power he can't stop interrupting the president). Have them act and do the same things but have them be the good guys and let someone else be behind everything.Bottom line is, if you want mind numbing action sequences go for it.",Angel Has Fallen

What we weren't expecting however, was the utterly unnecessary comment regarding the alleged, and subsequently disproven, Russian interference in the 2016 election! Can we not just keep politics out of it, people?Trump won fare and square in 2016, just like he did in 2020. Wake up, y'all!!Anyways, this film is great fun, even if Gerrard Butler's face is somewhat off-putting. That said, he is doing magnificently compared to Jada Pinkett-Smith, for whom gravity appears to be particularly vindictive. He philtrum seems to have lengthened by 1mm for every year she has been alive. She now resembles Ash from Evil Dead, or was it The Army Of Darkness, when he is getting sucked into the hell void and manages to escape?Nick Nolte crops up as Mike Banning's estranged dad, doing his best Nick Nolte impersonation. It was unclear from the dialogue and acting whether he was originally meant to be in the film, or had simply wandered on to the set following a hefty night on the liquor.

I've watched all three movies in this series because I'm an action movie kind of guy. This one being more character centric for the Banning character was okay because I wanted to see him either go out in a blaze of glory or have a good end for him.Nice wrap up for the character. Good storyline. Loved Freeman as POTUS in this one.Although writing wise I had already figured out who the big bad was early in the movie. Easy to spot the weasel in most of these types of films.Might not be one to buy and own (I did on VUDU as I own the first two). I re-watch series of movies like this again several times.

This one tried to bring back a bit more story... fairly successfully... bit still with the shooting and the splosions.

461,gavin-ferreiro,A reflection on Threats and Response,8,1 September 2019,"I have watched the film once and it deserves a few more views to get the actual feeling of what it actually means. No Spoilers at all.I found the film to be slow at first and then jam packed with action and contemplation. I do not believe it may be the last as the infighting in management could be bigger than as a foot soldier.What truly impressed me was the humour (humor to our American friends) in certain circumstances and his relationship with his father (well done Nick Nolte). I would expect that this would happen in true life as combat situations clears all troubles between people (common enemy scenario and let by-gones be by-gones).I also enjoyed the sense of biased decision making that was made evident to everyone, a true reflection of the errors made in the intelligence and security communities. Sometimes innuendoes are better than actual facts.Watching it in Saudi Arabia was interesting as the cinema was expensive and certain parts of the film was pixelated so I will have to wait for Blue-Ray.A great film and when in Ireland, I hope to see it in another cinema. Just a warning, it has scenes of graphic violence and if you suffer from PTSD, it may be triggered.Had to dry my eyes a few times.I will watch it again.",Angel Has Fallen
462,mc-hvnh,The weak plot as usual but the combat is pretty good,7,13 June 2021,"I don't actually like the plot. It's typical and like many actions movies out there but the combat is good. At least, they tried to make a decent combat, not like ""oh hey, just shoot"", specially in the hospital. I think this movie is pretty fun to watch. So you can watch it if you wanna entertain.",Angel Has Fallen
463,joe_97478,Glad I didn't pay attention to the bad reviews!,7,27 November 2019,"Wow, glad I didn't listen to all the crappy reviews so many people seemed to enjoy writing. To me, it wasn't a great movie, but I didn't expect it to be. But it was a good movie, a good couple hours of action drama, exactly what it was meant to be. And they even did it without throwing in all the silly needling and bickering that is so popular between the leads of movie and television shows these days. A film doesn't have to be great to be a good solid entertaining movie these days. Too many people seem to expect the near perfection that you get with 250 million dollar budget Marvel movie these days. Unless you're a movie snob, or just plain picky, you'll probably enjoy this movie, and like some of the rest of us, say, ""Hey, this movie was okay, entertained me well for the couple hours it was on.",Angel Has Fallen

465,aenima83,Great action movie,9,14 November 2019,"Rather watch this over the Joker, that was boring and stale. Butler is the new Bruce Willis of action movies.",Angel Has Fallen
466,Warneinator,"Yet another Butler Bomb, and just as bad as the last two instalments.",2,26 August 2019,"The existence of the ""Has Fallen"" trilogy is nothing short of mind-boggling. 2013's Olympus Has Fallen was actually one of two Die Hard clones set in the White House released that year, but managed to make more money than Roland Emmerich's White House Down through the advantage of coming out first. It surely wasn't because of its actual quality. It's an ugly, mean-spirited and downright unpleasant film, but I could at least somewhat understand its appeal in its attempt to be a throwback to overly macho 80s action films like Commando. The same cannot be said for London Has Fallen; a boneheaded, cheaply made and xenophobic excuse for entertainment, and one of the worst films of the whole decade. Naturally, I wasn't particularly looking forward to this trilogy-capper, especially as it felt the need to remind the world in all its advertisements that it's a sequel to these two prior outings. Having seen all three of them now, it totally makes sense why, because they're almost entirely interchangeable. But when the highest compliment I can give this film right off the bat is ""it's not as hateful as the last one"", you know you're in for a particularly bad time.Surprisingly, Angel Has Fallen tries in its opening 20 minutes to be somewhat deep and introspective, as it shows the effects that Mike Banning's career has had on his physical and mental health, as well as his relationship with his wife. But this utterly blows up in the film's face because this franchise has never been concerned with its characters in the slightest. Banning has always been an unlikable, sweary nutcase who often resorts to torture for fun, so to see this film attempt to be a character piece comes across as utterly laughable. I did not care for a second about his dilemma of whether to accept the director job, or his attempts to clear his name after being framed at any point during this utter waste. But whilst the character work is beyond salvaging, it doesn't help that it encompasses a plot that plays like a Frankenstein's monster of much better action films. The medical appointments, as well as a setpiece involving boobytraps in the woods, reminded me heavily of Skyfall, and the framed storyline is essentially a much lesser version of The Fugitive. It's an extremely trite and predictable narrative, but it would be at least mildly exciting if Banning was a vulnerable protagonist. Despite the opening's attempts to convince you otherwise, he remains completely on top of things at every point, survives every injury he takes, and none of the ailments he's meant to be suffering from impact him throughout the action sequences in any way whatsoever.There's a very strong feeling whilst watching this film that barely anyone involved actually cares about putting in any effort, because, well, it's Angel Has Fallen, it's so easy the paycheques practically write themselves. Gerard Butler barks nearly all of his lines like pretty much every role he plays, but even he's starting to look especially bored and unenthused this time. Morgan Freeman sleepwalks through his scenes as the US President, and literally sleeps through the second act in a plot-induced coma, Jada Pinkett Smith, Tim Blake Nelson and Danny Huston are saddled with stock action film characters speaking dialogue so cliched it could've honestly been written by a computer, and Piper Perabo leaves so little as of an impression and gets so little to do as Mike's wife Leah you probably won't even notice that she was recast from Radha Mitchell in the last two. Surprisingly, the best work comes from Nick Nolte as Mike's estranged Vietnam veteran father, who seems to have not gotten the memo that he's in a film called Angel Has Fallen and gives his performance way more emotion than the film deserves. But this general lack of care also extends to the production design. Angel Has Fallen comes from the same production company responsible for another Butler bomb; last year's Hunter Killer, and just like that film, it feels like it belongs in a direct-to-DVD bargain bin. The CGI is astonishingly poor, particularly in the drone strike assassination attempt, the greenscreen is particularly obvious, and most of the action is shot at night in the woods, so you can barely see any of it. Even with state-of-the-art digital projection technology in my local cinema, a lot of these sequences were almost impossible to follow, making the frequent use of explosions in one set-piece actually welcome. The standards of this franchise were never very high, but the sloppiness on display in this film is utterly inexcusable.In the context of the Secret Service, Angel is the codename used for agents. I didn't know that before, and I bring this up now because that is more interesting than anything that Angel Has Fallen has to offer. While it's a less unpleasant experience than its also terrible predecessors, it trades that unpleasantness for being woefully dull. The cast give a D-grade effort, with the bizarre exception of Nick Nolte, the plot is recycled from better films and tries too hard to justify the existence of this trilogy, and even on the most basic of entertainment levels, the action fails to deliver and it's some of the most generic and lifeless I've ever seen. This angel didn't have any wings, but it falls with a resounding thud into my worst films of 2019.",Angel Has Fallen

473,markjenkinsmedia,Angel Has Fallen; a very bad and stoopid film,3,30 November 2019,"""Angel Has Fallen"" is a bad and stoopid film - a shame, since ""Olympus Has Fallen"" and ""London Has Fallen"" were quite entertaining.The script reads as if put together by an excitable 12-year-old, but was actually written by 5 adults. Between them and no fewer than 17 producers and executive producers, apparently no-one noticed gaping plot holes through which star Gerard Butler could have driven an articulated truck.Extensive spoilers follow, but once you've read them you may feel the movie isn't worth seeing anyway.The action opens with Gerard being chased and shot at by his colleagues. I thought, ""gosh, I hope this doesn't turn out to be a training exercise, that would be clichéd and stoopid"". But it does. Wow - very original (Star Trek Wrath of Khan from 1982, anyone?)In fairly short order, President Morgan Freeman, whose facial warts make him almost unwatchable throughout, is the subject of an assassination attempt. But first the assassins kill all his Secret Service guards, giving him plenty of time to escape. If they just killed him first, the plot would finish there.Star Gerard is framed, the FBI declares, by virtue of being left alive, and having his DNA planted in a van full of rocket launchers. But why would assassins leave a van full of rocket launchers and DNA on site? This doesn't occur to the brilliant FBI analysts. Also, they missed the first day of FBI school, which teaches Cui Bono? - ""who benefits"" from a crime. It was the vice president - duhh.All this ""frame-up"" effort is expended by the assassins on the basis that if Gerard is framed, they would never be caught; as if the investigation would then cease, and no-one else be blamed, one man alone (almost killed himself in the process) having organised a van full of rocket launchers and all the associated ""doesn't actually exist"" assassination technology.So Gerard is blamed and arrested (in a few minutes). Escaping, he quickly learns the identity of the assassins. Then instead of giving himself up with the information, he helps his father (Nick Nolte) to murder dozens of mercenaries, then takes a knife to another FBI agent in order to get an interview with the President. No-one minds this, and within a few moments he is put back in charge of the operation.Meanwhile mercs try to kidnap Gerard's wife and daughter, but when they fail, she is just left alone at home with her tiny baby, not at all supervised by the FBI as the wife of a man just accused of trying to kill the President.The mercenaries, having gone to a great deal of effort to avoid identification, then choose to carry out a full frontal assault on a city centre hospital with machine guns, and not even a balaclava to disguise their identity. Although news crews have arrived in a few seconds to cover the evacuation of the hospital (a line of news coverage frequently being used in the movie to explain exactly what's going on, for the benefit of the dense), the FBI and National Guard which should have been guarding the President anyway, take much longer to arrive, leaving the mercenaries free run of the place.In parallel with this, some computers make oxygen squirt into the hospital and then set it on fire, demolishing the building. As I understand it, this is part of the design of all major hospitals these days, and a few seconds on the internet is enough to allow anyone to explode a hospital of their choice.Gerard rather spitefully stabs the baddie in the side and watches him bleed to death, foregoing any opportunity to actually question him. But head FBI agent Jada Pinkett Smith had already gathered enough evidence to convict, before going almost unarmed to confront a huge military camp bristling with armed mercenaries, where surprisingly (to her at least) she is instantly shot in the head.But all's well that ends well, and the warty old President gives Gerard a big promotion. The End.I don't mind poor acting. Huge levels of acting ability are not needed in an action film. But a sensible plot costs no more to write than a stoopid plot full of obvious idiocies, and anyone who's satisfied with such a movie is very, very easily satisfied indeed. Expect all 10-star reviewers to be actually working for the movie studio. Or to be one of the 17 producers.",Angel Has Fallen

The military-style movements (clearing rooms, holding their weapons at eye level, trigger awareness, good posture) and tactics (covering fire, ambush kill zones, crossing lanes of fire) are all very realistic and how I was trained in the military.One of the biggest letdown in action movies is when it's blatantly obvious that the ""mercenary #1"" or ""cop #3"" actors are holding guns for likely the first time in their lives. There's a specific way the US military teaches weapons training and this movie does a great job at making it look real.The personal story of Butler's character is a bit too cliche, and parts of it are a bit cringy and eye-rolling, but they do a great job of making it look like a no-win scenario.

There are scenes reminiscence of ""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""Die Hard,"" and even ""Indiana Jones Trilogy,"" among others. Do they work? To me they actually do.
This is a fun movie that entertains and has a good ending. The team of writers Robert Mark, Matt Cook, Ric Roman Waugh, Creighton Rothenberger, and Katrin Benedikt make Mike Banning (Played straight by Gerard Butler) survive every possible situation with wit and, yes, action-packed events.
The premise is the same as the other two installments, trying to save the president, a great performance by Morgan Freeman, but this time the problems are from within which keeps the audience guessing throughout the whole movie: how are they going to get out of this?
I must mention the excellent sound effects editor, Lily Blazewicz, who makes drones, bombs, gunshots, explosions, stabbings make a great impression. However, they did not translate that well into my Sony surround home theatre. Wish you better luck.
Composer David Buckley does a good job also in keeping the tension with a great balance between silence and music. And along with Gabriel Fleming, the Editor, keeps this movie together.

500,soumyamsd,Nothing Extraordinary,7,4 December 2019,"Plot: 6/10- A decent action film, as you would expect it to be. But the plot is too much plain and old style, the usual ones you would see in some common action movies. The story is again too much predictable. Anyways you can call it just good.
Cast: 9/10- Again nothing much to mention about the cast. Gerard Buttler and Morgan Freeman both are great actors. Other Co-actors had also been good.
Screenplay 9//10: Actually I have seen very less Hollywood films that sucks in their screenplay. And obviously none of the films of Fallen series have been a part of bad screenplay.
Overall:6.5/10 Just give it a watch. Obviously not too much pressure on brain.",Angel Has Fallen

504,sperezlaw,"Butler is getting old, USA and hospital plot is boring, more of the same, but good overall franchise enjoyment",6,31 August 2019,"Butler looks old and frail - not the Bruce Willis Die Hard type needed to realistically portray his character. Initial attack while fishing is anything but imaginative, except for the drones, and the plot - that Butler was a genius mastermind behind assassination attempt while committing rookie errors and leaving behind evidence of his involvement, is contemptuous, might as well call him Dora the Explorer meets The Science Guy for a cartoon. FBI is not as stupid as portrayed, and of course, the idea that Americans will target the President for profit (when they would do better investing in Bitcoin), is yet another Hollywood moment.That said, its value was because of the value of the overall franchise, still good watching, nothing unexpected, but worth the time.I agree that Nolte's character was the only new element which surprised anyone.QED.",Angel Has Fallen

Yes, I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, I had seen the previous two movies. It was supposed to be a fun easy to watch action movie, where things are not what they seem to be.Let's just say that the plot is quite predictable, but yet that is not the worst. The CGI was poor. The scenes and situations were extremely forced. After two movies with pretty much the same plot, you need to innovate. However, and to me that was just ridiculous, they showed not once, but twice how stupid they think the police is. Twice there were roadblocks trying to capture Mr Butler's character that the police decided to place right after the road diverted in two, therefore granting the protagonist a way out.All in all, the plot was full of holes that made it boring and unbelievable, in the worst of meanings. And the extra footage at the end just proved that they didn't take the film seriously at all.",Angel Has Fallen

Even the high definition picture couldn't rescue this ultra violent dross. They must have paid Morgan Freeman a fair buck to appear in this, hopefully directly into his retirement fund since he spent most of the film in a comfy bed.

525,chris-42800,Keystone Kops,4,12 April 2020,"I haven't seen the 2 prequels but I can imagine they weren't much better. If this was meant to be an action film with a thin plot and predictable dialog, where the body count is off the charts, it succeeded. These stories typically require the viewer to suspend reality in order to accept the story. I have enjoyed countless movies that do this, but for some reason the writers decided to really insult our intelligence. The ease is which the bad guys breach security to get at the President is laughable. The main protagonist somehow is the last to survive even after dozens of his followers are killed. In one scene the President is attacked while he is in his car. ""The Beast"", as it is known, is probably one of the most heavily armored and defended vehicle on earth, yet bullets pierce the windshield and the Secret Service decide to remove the President from it and expose him to senseless walking around. In another scene, the President is being hidden in an office and someone mentions that the phone on the desk is ""dead"". Wouldn't the Secret Service have walkie talkies or at least cell phones? To its credit, I watched the whole thing. Nick Nolte stands out for his performance. Everyone else mails it in.",Angel Has Fallen

I saw the low score on here and the critics reviews and I am shocked. I finally got around to watching this last night and I was very skeptical after reading the reviews. This movie was nonstop action and suspense. It actually reminded me a lot of The Fugitive with Harrison Ford. I have enjoyed all three of these movies and I would probably say this was my second favorite after part one. If you just want to good old fashion action movie with some great acting and awesome fight scenes, I highly recommend this one. Nick Nolte was amazing in it. Gerard Butler showed us a weary and fatigued Mike Banning. This was just a great throwback to older action movies. If you liked the first two, you will enjoy this one .",Angel Has Fallen

Yes but the heavy use of green screen and CGI ruined it for me, the CGI isn't as bad as it is in London has fallen but it just let the film down in my opinion.Nick Nolte..... was brilliant!! loved him in this movie and hope he returns if they make a 4th one in the series, Butler was also great as always.I think if you enjoyed the first 2 movies in this series you'll like this, don't get me wrong I will add it to my collection but the first film stands alone in terms of greatness.

Good Mike Banning.Angel Has Fallen brought the Fallen film series from the mat of large-scale destructive action towards the viewing of mediocre, the majority of which are more appropriate in a DVD rack than playing on the big screen. And for Gerard Butler, the fact that he lost to badass compared to Nick Nolte who had stepped on 78 years, seemed to be a sign of danger for his career as an action hero.Let alone Leonidas, Butler was no longer even like three years ago in London Has Fallen. He looks exhausted and unfit, which can actually be used as interesting material in exploration of manuscripts made by director Ric Roman Waugh (Felon, Snitch) with Robert Mark Kamen (The Fifth Element, The Transporter, Taken) and Matt Cook (Patriots Day, Triple 9 ) about the physical condition of the protagonist.After saving state officials twice, Mike Banning's body (Gerard Butler) reaches a limit. Concussion makes him often dizzy, even his backbone is increasingly fragile.

How anyone could rate a movie like this, 1 star, clearly has never made a movie before, and has nothing better to do than complain and nitpick about every little thing they don't like in any movie they have ever rated a 1 star! Don't get me wrong there are some movies out there that deserve a one or two stars, but all these great movies I love that get 1 star ratings, just makes me realize how many people are out there who have such negative, lonely lives that they have nothing better to do than complain about a movie they could never in 1 million years come close to making themselves. Bottom line, this movie was enjoyable and fun! Maybe it doesn't deserve a 10 star rating but definitely nothing less than 7, anyone who rated any great movie out there a 1 star makes me laugh. I always go on  to check the ratings of movies I'm about to watch, or I've already just watched, The type of movies with big budgets, well-known actors, movies who keep me wanting to watch, and not stop the movie halfway through. I'm so sick and tired of watching a movie that I thought was awesome and going on  afterwards, and seeing all these people rate them 1 star! Just a heads up to the people who are new please read more than just one review, if you see a movie with a 1 star rating scroll down a bit to see if anyone else has given it anything more than a 7, if a handful of people have given it more than a 7, and you're a normal person who's looking to watch a good movie then do yourself a favour and watch it and find out for yourself! Because there is Way way too many people out there who are rating all these good movies 1 stars that have nothing better to do than complain about every little thing in life. I hope  lets me post this review, and I hope enough people get to read this because there are way way too many people out there rating all these good movies 1 stars, Just shows how many people there are out there that have nothing better to do than complain about every little thing in life. I hope  lets me post this review, and I hope enough people get to read it! Because rating system is getting tainted by all these negative people rating great movies 1 stars! Hope this helps you guys! And if you read this and agree with me then I hope this review brings a smile to your face! And if you read this and don't agree with me and have rated a good movie 1 star before, I'm glad I'm not you! lol",Angel Has Fallen

The acting was superb by all of the characters including little baby Lynn. Who could not be moved at the sheer terror on her face during that one scene. (you will know the scene when you see it) Unlike most action films, where you have to suspend your belief at silly, endless chase scenes, characters too young to really know all they do and continuous foul language, the fallen series doesn't employ those cheap time wasting tactics. Instead, they give us believable characters, put in extraordinary situations that you know they will overcome. I loved Olympus Has Fallen, loved London Has Fallen even more, but Angel Has Fallen is even better than those two. It is on the edge of your seat action, characters whom you love and root for, a believable and terrifying story line and all without any other agenda but to entertain us.

Okay the acting is just about okay and the plot, well we've seen it all before; but the action is virtually non-stop and is well choreographed.

613,indigoplatty-59356,"It's Bad, but it has Nick Nolte!",5,12 September 2019,"Lets talk Nick Nolte before everything else.
Nick Nolte may have found his niche in playing roles as a estranged father, one instance in particular, with his provocative and powerful performance in the MMA Drama Warrior(2011). If you haven't seen Warrior, you are missing a surprisingly intense and emotional story. Sorry back on topic, Nick Nolte playing a similar role in this film brought something new to an exhusted series. He brings his signature sense of humor which has a bit of darkness and personal strife, but his performace is simple, and yet it out shines his other costars by an exceptional margin. The only one I can say had a sense of a performace close to Nick's would be Danny Hutson. Danny Hutson performace was more believable than Gerard Butler's. With the critically acclaimed crime drama Den Of Thieves(2018) Gerard's was his best performance in years but, thiis is a polar opposite to his role in Angel Has Fallen. His intense and absolutely thrilling performance in Den Of Thieves brought what you wanted out of Gerard, but instead a boring and shallow character with little motivations to even be present in these conflicts is what you get from Angel Has Fallen. I honestly believe the writers and directors saw this as an blatant cash grab and just wanted it to end, as the executives rubbed their hands together thinking about the money to be made. I am glad to see this series finally over so we can get back to a Gerard we know and love. Bringing him back into the udramtic film genre will be a great advantage to all who appreciate his talents. I am not going into the terrible cgi and ridiculous stunt double covering, or the easily predictable storyline. This movie deserves a 3 but because of Nick Nolte... I'll give em 5.",Angel Has Fallen

Swarming drones using facial recognition was something new.
HOWEVER!!!!
Trumble was VP for the first 2 movies and President in this one. But no explation has been offered as to what happened to the previous President.
THE BIGGEST HOLE in the movie is the change in Bannons wife. Same name, same looks, different actress. Do they not think we wouldn't notice? Would have been better to write out original wife via divorce or something else.

643,hamiltonkristy-60991,American thinking 2019,2,26 August 2019,"For Angel Has Fallen :
Gerard and Nolte worked great together.
The veteran idea of setting up trail bombs was spot-on a go-getter for ""what to remember that brings me back"".
The health, back condition of the character Mike, with the prescription pills, and all the dramatic action included with how he in reality should be, is not believable at all. It has a tendency to reflect the director and producer lack incentive on investigating the result of that type of spinal injury,. It's ongoing throughout the movie for the viewers.
When the character Mike is confronted by the truck driver defending the 2 men, that should have been shorter in sequence . The movements altogether were slow to reality and highly unlikely that the gunmen are going to shy away,
if they're truly believing Mike is a problem. Homework needs to be done over the many everyday southern working men. Someone needs to study the locations that the scenes are supposed to reflect, and the majority of hunters, Veterans, and NRA members in regards to their feelings and views, and especially how they react.
When Leeah, Mikes wife, asked his dad, ""tell me something personal about him"",
Noltes scene with compassion,
Should have had a more meaningful answer to reflect a fathers love, even with the PSD that he had. The name of his mom, etc. with minoote personal comment about Mike as a person, Gave the wrong impression to the viewer . Mr. Noltes character was more interestingly intelligent and that moment flawed him to the viewer.
The dark inside car scene is difficult for the viewer to see while Mike is trying to break free. It should have been shorter or atleast brighter as you struggle to see whats happening for so many seconds, etc.
The hospital staff for the President while being in a coma, seemed at level 1, unconcerned and unseasoned in what their look, demeanor and dialogue, should have been. It should have been more honourable for The President of The United States of America. Also the hospital room should have shown the Presidents bed several feet further from the door for safety reasons. There should have been more verbal update in his room about his condition from a Dr. Or nurse. The hallways leading to his room should have shown blocked off floors leading there, with more CIA actors presentable for the part.
The awkward reaction of the CIA group toward Mike, having worked with him, extensively, and believabley they ""question him"", with his history of faithfulness to his job, coming from his peers is wrong too. It leaves the idea that to try to help him in any way is treason for his peers, with no sound sense of reasoning, all alone.
The investigation for Mike was weak.
Mikes dad and wife in his corner, only, was inappropriate for a seasoned character of CIA agent protecting The President.
The boat scene with The President should have been more beautifully scened as there are areas of Virginia, especially between Jamestown and Williamsburg, and the area of White Marsh, that should have given more compliment to a relaxing Virginian atmosphere, as why the reason The President was there to begin with.
The drones appearing at such a large scale did not reflect the shown bombing that happened. It honestly appears that after looking at the ""after Affect"", from all of the mass drones were a waste of visual, if more explosives are not balancing it out.
Allowing the little girl to, on purpose be used to be made afraid, as opposed to zoning in the cameras on just adults was in poor taste. Just audio sound of a child crying should have been the decision made for her. That would be healthier for her precious little self psychologically since she can't even say sentences yet in reality for the little girl in that scene.
The back door scene of the two men coming into Mikes house with just his wife and child, are not even thinkable to imagine, as typically a man of CIA intelligence is going to specialize his inside alarms, and that should have been shown to the viewer. More detail about that should have been done.
The name of the President was not in good taste, it is too close to AMERICAS President in reality and should not have been closely associated with him.
That is disrespectful to President Trump.
Mr. Freeman, as President, should have had more, appeared visual injuries after an ordeal like that in the water with the ammo from the drones, especially considering his given age. Elderly people bruise easy, and it is visible regardless of race. The makeup artist should have come forward with that.
More bandages should have been used to show a possible head injury since he was in a coma. More details on vitals with him should have been shown.
The grenade explosion at the end of the movie, with Mike covering the dead body, should have been rethought with the area that it was set off, in that Mike at that distance, should have had more appeared visual injuries to be believable.
There should have been more hidden, underground weapons of defense for Mr. Nolte to give to Mike, and with a flashback, as Mike is defending himself at the last fight scene. That shows forethought, honour from a son to a father in that he trusted his dad and kept it close, and the bond between Veterans all at the same time.
Mr. Nolte should have had more interaction with his granddaughter at the eating table, since he saved her and her mother's life. It gives the impression of distrust at a seated distance to the viewer.
That's disrespectful to him as a grandfather, as his character is.
The dialogue at the end of the movie from Mike should have had a stronger, leading line that reflected the honour of a CIA special agent.
The woman that investigated the situation thats supposed to be a leader, and was shot, gave more of a local city cop impression for a general community, than for a Federal position of that much responsibility. She should have been put as an actress on the computer with the bad guys, than to be given that leading role.
At the end of the movie, the first and the second time I saw it, I was near to the last one out, due to the momentary credits, that redirected to the comical
Add on scene. The inbetween was too far stretched out.
The timing of this movie is a bad idea.
In the southeast USA it is time for kids to go back to school. So going to the movies is an afterthought for most people right now. Even the college students since everyone is focused on school and preparing for cooler temperatures.
This movie should have come out in July 2019.",Angel Has Fallen

Like it didn't stop Butler's character and his performance. His acting is solid and there're enough familiar names with good acting to keep you occupied. The only thing i was worried of this was going to be a copy of the Fugitive. It has many resemblences but this movie does it's own thing to keep it fresh. Sure the CGI may have it's problems but it delivers. Just kick your feet back, grab a snack and a drink and enjoy this movie for what it really is. A highly enjoyable action movie with solid acting to keep you busy for around 2 hours. And a solid sequel to an outstanding action sequence.

I absolutely hated this movie; unless you're the type of imbecile who's into stupid setup (as in ""shift the blame to the hero"") action/thriller movies DON'T watch this.

So I have rated it a good 6 because of the action, even though they try to harden Banning down from being superman without his cape.
There is just one thing that I really don't understand in action movies. It seems that the bad guys is like water on a gremlin, no matter whow many gets taking out, they just come flushing in the scenes.
In the last scene I counted more than 20 kills and captures, even though the 3 cars had 6 persons each, as far as counted, I could be wrong and it is not important in this movie, it is just an fun factor in most action movies.",Angel Has Fallen

1: Plot = TRASH
2: It's not by making Morgan Freeman lay in a hospital bed for 2 hours that the movie will be any better.
3: Flaws throughout the whole film...since when is the president's bandages not changed in the hospital?
4: Russia does not have to be involved in any way shape or form.

I'm glad that they created this movie and I didn't get chance to see this at the cinema, but, luckily Amazon Prime has this movie. The scenes were very carefully planned out and the special effects was truly an 10* rated.

Also, how long can an 80 year old man breath underwater when it is extremely cold, 30 secs.

729,m-cooper-78848,Propaganda,1,24 August 2019,"It is a poor attempt at left wing propaganda but what isn't now adays... the villains tag line was ""make America strong again"" and surprise he was colluding with Russia!",Angel Has Fallen
730,henrikrodahl,Chill action,7,4 May 2021,Nice action with a decent pace all the way through. Predictable and generic plot similar to olympus/London has fallen. Worth a watch if you enjoy action.,Angel Has Fallen
731,coffeebeanz72,Predictable and unbelievable even by action film standards,4,8 April 2020,"Action and pacing was decent, but that's probably where the positive side of the review ends. The plot made little sense, and at some points (especially the ending) seem to defy its own muddy logic. You always need to suspend belief for an action flick but this strains the imagination. If you're bored, it could be worth a watch, but be forewarned, it's a ride of bullets, explosions cliches and massive plot holes.",Angel Has Fallen
732,ari_lukman,Love it,10,3 October 2019,Nice movie Gerald..unpredictable story..as usual Gerald Buttler is the best,Angel Has Fallen
733,michaeluhlig,An amazing & fantastic sequel,10,7 September 2019,"This is a great, well made, thought out movie. I know what you are thinking, but what about the negative reviews? Do not let them discourage you. Angel Has Fallen keeps you on the edge of your seat, but it also had my wife and I, busting a gut, laughing. I'm sorry, but this was a fantastic sequel. It is not a kids or teen movie, but for the adults, it is a well made film.",Angel Has Fallen
734,mattman55,Puzzled by the negative reviews,8,13 January 2020,"While this is far from the greatest action movies I've ever seen, it is still a pretty damn good movie that is well worth watching and one of the better movies I've seen come out of 2019. I also would highly recommend watching this movie with a full 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound setup as it greatly adds to the intensity of the action sequences - particularly towards the end of the movie which was absolutely amazing. Ignore the negative reviews - I feel like they saw a completely different movie. At worst this is a very entertaining movie.",Angel Has Fallen
735,richcxx,It's not THAT bad people.....,7,26 August 2019,"Reading some of these reviews I have to wonder what the heck were people expecting? This is a summer action movie, sit back, turn your brain off and enjoy.Everyone complaining about the shaky/blurry camera work but I took as Mike's perception of what was going on around him as a result of all the trauma he has been through (at least that's how I'm looking at it). They really were focusing how his life has been impacting him physically and mentally and felt this was just trying to give you his perspective.Loved Nolte, he definitely stole the show in his scenes and the new wife did a nice job as well.Overall I think of the three movie es this one was my favorite, I was surprised how much I enjoyed it.",Angel Has Fallen
736,chelsea_rule-94674,Best out of the lot,8,2 September 2019,Definitely the best out of the lot.. Gerrard Butler was an amazing actor as always.. story line was great.. 8 stars,Angel Has Fallen
737,desire-95629,With a best start and boring end,5,24 August 2019,In start it was splendid movie but they can not contain their of best and at end so unreal and pethtic but action was good,Angel Has Fallen
738,venturewithalex,Cinematographery is great. Story is a remake..,6,13 September 2019,The screen work is great. The acting is what you'd expect of everyone in it. The issue I have is paying to see Mark Wahlberg's Shooter and the Shooter series combined and remade with Gerard Butler. It's practically scene for scene. This was a good movie if it was a standalone. Since it's part of a series and clearly demonstrates they ran out of ideas; this is the reasoning for rating so low.,Angel Has Fallen
739,columh,Nothing New,5,30 August 2020,Copy and paste action movie bringing little to the genre. Perfectly serviceable but ultimately forgettable. You'll be able to recognise all of the tropes used and can get some entertainment trying to remember the movies you've seen them in before if you get bored.Props for the method of the assassination attempt I thought that was fun.Ultimately it suffers from the usual blockbuster problems - you know who will live and who will die within seconds of meeting them. Which makes for little sense of jeopardy and the pace of the action leaves little time for the character depth needed to care about the cannon fodder.,Angel Has Fallen
740,titan-17939,Just be an action movie and nothing more.,7,16 July 2020,"This was a good good action flick once it got past the (Pain Pill Parts). I know people are struggling from addiction, I get it! It does not help the flow of the story when Gerard has to stop ever ten minutes to crush down a few vicodins. Let the the people escape that stuff for an hour and a half and leave the pills alone.",Angel Has Fallen
741,rayguy,"Good action, terrible script",2,17 January 2020,"Ignore the planted reviews sitting near the top apparently dumbfounded as to what people don't like. This film has a terrible script. Superficial, barely believable badly written characters spelling out an unoriginal unsurprising boring plot with irritating holes in it. Some of the action sequences are cool though. But that's it. Seemed like a lazy teen written script picking up the worst tropes of 90s action films. Grizzled vet protagonist who takes 0 sensible effort to resolve the film's central dilemma? Check. Attractive wife who adds nothing except emotional outbursts? Check. Tough black women leading FBI with 0 critical thinking? Yawn, check. Lots of white male ex military types crowding round CSI style computer screens spouting nonsense? Check. I honestly doubt anyone over the age of 14 could be impressed. Except the explosions, they were pretty alright.",Angel Has Fallen
742,avihai-16065,One of the worst movies i have ever seen,4,22 August 2019,"The movie was so predictable and it was just boring... the only good thing i found about this movie is the action scenes, they were decent.
Overall, its not worth the ticket.",Angel Has Fallen
743,the_boss-20026,Amazingg movieee 😍,10,9 September 2019,One of the best movies I've ever watched really good acting nice idea 👍🏻👍🏻,Angel Has Fallen
744,astridscott,Great Movie!!!,8,31 August 2019,I loved it !!! Full of Action and Passion!! 🙌🏾🙌🏾,Angel Has Fallen
745,rfxx-05888,Hint about future attacks,8,15 September 2019,"The moment I saw the drone attack, I felt that the future would be this, unmanned attacks and how dangerous they would be. Guess we have proof now with this latest Saudi attack. A must see movie to experience such devastation",Angel Has Fallen
746,nazmulahmednoyon,Missing excitement or thrills,7,25 August 2019,"The actions in this movie did not look like Gerard Butler's other movies, missing excitement or thrills such as London Has Fallen or Olympus Has Fallen.",Angel Has Fallen
747,marusso20,"Predictible, dumb story.",2,29 December 2019,"All these money and cast, but they still write the dumbest predictible action stories. I think some old fart was behind this movie not allowing young creative writing, otherwise I can't explain it.",Angel Has Fallen
748,MichaelCo,Thought it couldn't get worse and then they did another one,1,14 November 2019,"Extremely bad predictable script, bad acting and plain stupid camera aside, I'm actually most surprised about the outdated and horrible cgi in this movie, it's really just terrible.",Angel Has Fallen
749,marnar-1,Worthless!,1,5 January 2020,"I was able to watch first 45 minutes and then gave up. Ridiculous plot. Close up action scenes were at night and impossible to tell which characters were involved. I respect Morgan Freeman as an actor. However, after a few minutes at the beginning he becomes comatose ( so at least he didn't have to watch this pathetic film). I rented the film through Amazon because it ran a special price of $2.99. Still way over priced.",Angel Has Fallen
750,peterkrb,Meh but Overall good movie,2,28 May 2020,"This one was had me mixed emotions just because of one actor (agent Thomson) I didn't know whether I was watching bad boys or angel has fallen because of her role playing whenever it came to her part it it just seemed off putting, should've changed characters with somebody else and let this one stay in cartoon movies.",Angel Has Fallen
751,meijinrv,So predictable,3,10 April 2020,"Terrible acting. Invincible men.
Best acting goes to Nick Nolte. It was a shame his role didn't play longer",Angel Has Fallen
