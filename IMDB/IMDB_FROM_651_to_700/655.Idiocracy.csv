0,MartinHafer,"Despite the crudeness and stupidity, it's an amazingly insightful film",9,14 August 2007,"I loved this film and it's obvious I am in the minority. This film was marketed in only six cities and it bombed--going almost straight to DVD after its eventual release. I assume much of the reason it failed is that although the film appears stupid and crude (after all, it was created by the same guy who made BEVIS AND BUTTHEAD), but the central message was actually pretty deep and the audience didn't fully appreciate its depth.I think much of the reason I loved it so much is that the basic premise is one I have talked to my friends about for years--how on this planet, the dumbest and worst elements of the gene pool are out-breeding the smart folks. Taking this premise to an extreme, and you've got a future like you see in IDIOCRACY--where in the 26th century, idiots run rampant and there is no longer any sign of intelligent life on Earth! This certainly is not a politically correct reality, but Mike Judge (never one to court political correctness) has the audacity to point out just how stupid we are destined to be. And, in a very, very low-brow way, seeing this future stupid world is funny. I loved the 8-time Oscar winning film the audience was watching in the film, the merchandising of EVERYTHING and the incredibly shallow and awful future this film explores--sort of like a Brave New World for idiocy.Now despite all the funny scenes (and there are many), there is a strong warning to all--this is a super-crude film and one you probably shouldn't show to your kids, your parents, or anyone you whose self-respect you desire. No, it is chock full of potty humor and foul language but I really do think it is necessary in order to fully illustrate how dumb society is now and how dumb it will be if idiots are allowed to reproduce at will. As long as you have relatively thick skin and can understand that the film is meant as satire, then it's a good bet for anyone....except stupid people.PS--Please watch the film all the way to the very end--past the credits. You won't be sorry.PPS--The DVD extras are pretty poor--with a few unfunny deleted scenes and that's all.PPPS--Some time after I wrote this review, I read through some of the other reviews for this film and was shocked to see how many people didn't understand the joke! Check this out for yourself.",Idiocracy
1,SnoopyStyle,Idea funnier than execution,6,24 August 2015,"Without thinning the herd, society gets dumber with each generation as idiots procreate more than smart people. Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson) is happy to be slacking off. He is the most average recruit without any family connections. The Army picks him and hooker Rita (Maya Rudolph) for the Human Hibernation Experiment. The base is closed after a scandal and the project is forgotten. Instead of frozen for one year, they are reawaken after 500 years. Humanity has gotten really stupid and Joe is now the smartest person on earth.This is a funny idea looking for a funny movie. Luke Wilson doesn't do much more than a straight man in a crazy world. The world is single note. Some of it is fun. There aren't that many big laughs but it is just fun enough.",Idiocracy
2,claudio_carvalho,"One Day, We Will Reach There",8,30 December 2013,"In 2005, the Private Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson) is an ordinary man with an average IQ. He is invited by Officer Collins (Mike McCafferty) to participate of a classified program named Human Hibernation Project to hibernate in pods for one year with the whore Rita (Maya Rudolph). However Collins is arrested for participating in a prostitution ring and Joe and Rita are forgotten in the pods. Five hundred years later, Joe wakes up and finds that the society is absolutely dumb. But he is arrested since he does not have any money or identification. In the prison, he is submitted to an IQ test and soon he learns that he is the most intelligent guy in the United States. President Camacho (Terry Alan Crews) invites him to join his government and help him to resolve the problem with the crop. In return, he would give pardon for his faults. Joe requests the support of Rita and the lawyer Frito (Dax Shepard) that will show him a Time Machine. Joe tries to solve the crop problem and then return to his time.""Idiocracy"" is one of the funniest and most intelligent comedies that I have recently. The storyline is perfect and I am afraid that one day, we will reach this dystopia with the actions of demagogue and populist governments. This movie should be mandatory in classes. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Idiocracia"" (""Idiocracy"")",Idiocracy
3,kosmasp,Are we there yet?,7,29 January 2019,"Was this a missed warning sign? The current climate in America is kind of portayed here. Though some would argue, that it doesn't depict all of America, not even just the one side who seems to have a glutton for punishment and seems to like to vote against their own interests. So while there is some relevance to current events, this go far out.Still if you feel uneasy watching this, it doesn't mean something is wrong with you. Quite the opposite is the case, everything is right with you. Quite ridiculous at times, it is there for entertainment purposes ... no really! They weren't trying to do a documentary! All kidding aside, this can be viewed as fun - no matter what your political background is.",Idiocracy
4,classicsoncall,"""Evolution doesn't necessarily reward intelligence...""",6,12 November 2011,"When I was in fifth grade a little over fifty years ago, I read a Weekly Reader article that stated that most great civilizations don't last much more than two hundred years. Obviously that article made quite an impression on me because I still remember it. From the vantage point of the late 1950's this would have seemed impossible for the United States, but as we cruise well past the two hundred year mark, it almost seems inevitable now doesn't it?Believe it or not, I looked this film up because Rush Limbaugh recommended it the other day on his EIB Network radio show. I can't believe he actually watched it, but then again, benefit of the doubt and all that. It could be he was inspired by the way the picture satirizes the way the government operates today, what with a House of Representin that's about as effective as Congress these days.Well left to my own devices, this isn't the type of picture I would generally pick up, given the premise and the cast. A single viewing was enough to convince me that I've hit my quota of dumb pictures for the year, and even once is too much with this one. Indeed, human evolution may be at a turning point, and this picture only reinforces that it's direction is down hill on a slippery slope.",Idiocracy
5,gavin6942,A Not-Too-Unusual Expectation of Humanity's Future,6,27 February 2008,"An average military man -- average in every way -- and a local prostitute are frozen, to be awakened in one year. But they are forgotten and left to sit for 500 years until their chambers are broken open in The Great Garbage Avalanche of 2505. Now the average man finds himself to be the smartest man on earth (due to stupid people having more children than smart people) and must solve their problems while also trying to find a time machine to return him to his own time.The first half of this film is hilarious and a great social critique -- it parodies our love of such stupid things as ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" and our growing reliance on corporate sponsorship and catering -- Starbucks, Carl's Jr and a Gatorade knockoff are prominent throughout the film. And the introduction, explaining dysgenics, is dead-on accurate and hilarious... the poor and less educated do tend to have more children than the wealthy and well-educated. I have my doubts that intelligence itself is hereditary, but to some extent it could be true.Luke Wilson has always been the stronger Wilson brother in the acting department and he really is the strong point of this film. Maya Rudolph isn't particularly funny, talented or even good looking. She wasn't a great casting choice to offset Wilson, leaving him to carry this project alone. But he does it. Dax Shepard does precious little besides act stupid; Justin Long is funny but has far too small a role.My biggest concern with the film, besides the waning humor (more time ought to have gone into the second half of the script) is the complete disregard for explaining how things work. For as stupid as the population is, they still have advanced technology and well-run businesses. Who maintains this? Who does the repairs? Sure, I'm not supposed to think about this, but as a film targeting an intelligent audience to belittle the less intelligent, I have no choice but to think about the film critically.I don't know what more to say on this one. Is it Mike Judge's best work? Probably not. I think some of the jokes are funnier than ""Office Space"", but ""Office Space"" overall is the much stronger film. So, I can't really praise it all that much. The first fifteen minutes is funny, the next fifteen is alright and it generally goes downhill from there after the gimmick of a stupid America wears off (the rest of the world isn't explained). Well worth watching, very quotable, but still remains somewhat disappointing.",Idiocracy
6,lee_eisenberg,dumbed-down world is exactly what we've become,8,25 August 2008,"More than just a silly comedy, Mike Judge's ""Idiocracy"" is also a look at the possible fate of a society that suppresses intellectualism and does everything possible to the most brainless sectors. The plot has not-too-intelligent Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson) getting frozen in an experiment and waking up 500 years later in a society where stupidity reigns supreme, meaning that he's now the most intelligent person alive! While this may qualify as a stupid movie, it's only because it shows what happens when a society lets itself get brainwashed and commercialized to the point that a ""high quality"" movie is a two-hour shot of somebody's butt (I dare you to laugh at that!). Even in our society today, some people treat knowledge as ""elitism""; the opposite is of course a TV show about repeated injuries to a man's crotch. But whether or not that's supposed to dominate the movie, you gotta love the president's State of the Union address, the Rehabilitation, or any discussion of Brawndo.I certainly recommend the movie. And seriously, what would YOU think of a society in which all speech is a mixture of hillbilly nonsense, valley girl talk, and inner city slang?",Idiocracy
7,Woodyanders,"Hilarious and very prophetic ""what if?"" comedy",8,7 February 2017,"Ordinary schmoe army private Joe Bauers (a solid and affable performance by Luke Wilson) gets selected for a government hibernation experiment. Joe wakes up in the year 2505 only to discover that the world has become overrun by total morons who have been dumbed down by trash television and mindless rampant commercialism.Director Mike Judge, who co-wrote the wickedly witty and prescient script with Etan Cohen, keeps the entertaining story moving at a brisk pace, maintains a sharp and savagely mocking tone throughout, and makes the most out of the inspired and scarily plausible premise that might just be around the corner thanks to the crass stupidity and gross ineptitude of the Trump administration with its ties to big business and flagrant disregard for both education and the environment alike (for example, the dust bowl drought and crop failure that's plaguing the future was caused by an all-powerful corporation replacing water with a soft drink called Brawndo). This film not only astutely nails the increasing lack of civility and propriety in the United States, but also serves as a timely and provocative grave warning on how lowest common denominator-aiming TV programming, the degradation of both language and education alike, and major companies that put more importance on making money over taking care of ourselves and the planet we all live on might possibly lead to a dismal future in which idiocy reigns supreme. Moreover, this film is acted with zest by an enthusiastic cast, with especially commendable contributions from Maya Rudolph as sassy hooker Rita, Dax Shepard as dim-witted lawyer Frito, and Terry Crews as mighty macho wrestler and porn star chief executive President Camucho. Theodore Shapiro's spirited score hits the stirring spot. A total hoot -- and more than a little unnerving, too.",Idiocracy
8,rmax304823,Tragicomedy.,7,7 April 2015,"Luke Wilson is frozen and hybernated and then somehow forgotten about for 500 years. When he emerges, he finds an overpopulated country full of numskulls. Everything is filthy and falling apart. The world is owned by a corporation named Brawndo that makes high-energy drinks. The citizens are low-grade morons. The solemn narrator tells us that the English language has deteriorated into a blend of redneck, valley girl, and urban street talk. But nobody really knows how to speak well anyway. Example: ""It looks like we are experimenting some technological differences."" Authorities put him through an IQ test and he has to answer questions like this: ""If you have one bucket that holds two gallons, and another bucket that holds five gallons, how many buckets do you have?"" He's pronounced a genius.But his lack of identification takes him through several institutions. He's put in prison and develops a tricky way of escaping -- he tells the COs he's been released and they let him go. In the hospital, the doctor is dressed in Hippy garb and smokes. When he's captured again, the President of the United States makes him Secretary of the Interior because of his brains. The president is a huge, muscular black man in corn rows and Uncle Sam suit who struts back and forth on the stage bellowing each announcement and ending it with a dying quiver, as in a church sermon.I may have made this sound sillier than it is. Well, it IS silly, and there are times when he seems to slow down to a trot, but there are moments that are almost hysterically funny. If you listen carefully to the remarks in the background, there are additional Easter eggs.Luke Wilson is Owen Wilson's brother. Their voices are almost identical. They both sound a little boyish and innocent. The others in the movie tell Luke that he talks like a fag. If Luke hadn't been available, Owen would have done as well. They both fit the role like an enzyme and its substrate. Equally good is Dax Shepard's imbecile taxi driver and sidekick. He wears an expression that bespeaks ""escapee."" Some of the humor more finely tuned, as when Wilson is explaining to Shepard ""the grandfather paradox"" of time travel. (Can you travel back in time, kill your own grandfather, and still exist?) Wilson, desperately anxious to be clear, really gets into the hurried lecture; the paradoxes spin wildly out of control. And Shepard merely stands still, staring blankly, and saying ""Uhh -- uhh -- mmm."" It's as amusing as Monty Python's ""Twit of the Year."" There may or not be some sort of warning beneath the laughs. Did you know that only 41% of Americans can identify a picture of Joe Biden, the Vice President of the United States? And that one out of five Americans can't identify the country we achieved independence from? Fewer than half of us know that electrons are smaller than atoms. It's easily Googled. That last survey was done by the Smithsonian Institute. The focus of our shared data base seems to have shifted towards the ephemeral. We're no longer such a curious people. Why should we be? We are too prosperous to be curious.",Idiocracy
9,Quinoa1984,the smartest/stupidest movie you didn't get to see in theaters (most likely),7,17 May 2007,"Strange that, despite Mike Judge's previous successes with Office Space and King of the Hill, that the film was made at 20th Century Fox. Judge, with his co-writer Cohen, are lampooning the very things that end up keeping Fox in bread and butter so often. Not to put a very one-sided face on what Fox represents as worthwhile entertainment or just worth for the public (Fox News is another matter), but Judge might have taken a guess that taking aim at big corporate interests in their conglomeration methods (albeit Judge doesn't back down from naming Starbucks, Gatorade and Fuddruckers), the boom in births from those with the lowest common denominators for brains, and just society in general might tick off some of the studio execs. Nevertheless, it is still something of an outrage to see what was done to Idiocracy upon original release; limited, oddly enough, to theaters in the Midwest and southwest areas, with nothing on the east coast and northeast especially, it was buried and left for the DVD scrap piles. It might be that they, like test-audiences, didn't quite get what it was that Judge was trying to convey with his in-your-face satire.Idiocracy has the premise as follows: an average Joe, named Joe (Luke Wilson), and a prostitute (Maya Rudolph) who's pimp is named Upgrayedd, are chosen by the army to be frozen as part of an experiment, which goes wrong, and the two of them awaken hundreds and hundreds of years later, when human civilization has turned into unadulterated, libido-crazy morons. Morons as in they're only about 1 IQ point, more or less really, apart from Judge's previous creations Beavis and Butt-head. Joe is seen as the smartest man alive, and so is put in charge of seeing why there aren't any crops growing- Gatorade instead of water, which is thought of as strictly toilet-bowl fodder- and uses that as his side-line while looking for a time machine. All through this, Judge throws one big visual gag after another and, more often than not, they end up sticking in ways that end up combining many of Judge's strengths from B&B and Office Space. It's intelligent stuff that pretends to be aimed at the same lowest common denominator, and ironically one ends up laughing like the same idiot watching repeatedly on TV a guy get kicked in the nuts every which way to Sunday.There's more gags to come, more than one could think would be possible, and as a result there is a case nearly of overload. Luckily many of the targets- Fox News, the executive office of America (if an office could be called that), the various products all laid out as having tie-ins with getting people off, which is all that the public really has on their minds in their paths to immediate gratification- are hit usually just right. When it starts to come down to actual character Judge is a little more sloppy; the whole rapport between Wilson and Rudolph never totally clicks, with Joe/Not Sure (his name as given during a machine's obvious idiotic taking of Joe's ID picture) not really getting that Rita is a prostitute but works as a painter's assistant back in past times. When it comes to that, unlike Office Space, Judge doesn't have much in way of character chemistry. Which is fine; he and his crew have more to tackle in ways of elaborate visuals and would-be matte paintings (look at that garbage problem!), that character has to be limited in this case.The points aren't necessarily subtle, but then again, when all is said and done, the filmmaker gets his points across. What is it about living in a country that becomes homogenized to the point of no recognition when education is nil, the birth rates aren't made more equal (how many Jethros and Mattie-Maes can there be in this world, lets face it), and corporations contribute all the more to the ""dumbing down"" of culture- in quotes as that it's sort of an equal partnership in getting dumbed down. This is more than likely what the studio didn't really grasp, was that the joke wasn't necessarily just on them, but on many other facets of society. It's an ambitiously good comedy, if falling short of a great one, that asks some keen questions amid the rampant sex and flatulence and monster truck and stereotype-assaulting jokes. One can only hope, maybe many many years from now, it'll catch on.",Idiocracy
10,Hey_Sweden,This movie's got electrolytes! It's what movie goers crave!,7,15 February 2017,"The ever affable Luke Wilson stars as Army librarian Joe Bauers, an average American of average intelligence. He's recruited, along with a prostitute named Rita (sexy Maya Rudolph), to participate in a secret hibernation experiment. They're supposed to be woken up a year later, but things go very, very wrong, and when they wake up 500 YEARS have gone by. And because stupid people in the U.S. of A. have MUCH more success than reasonably smart people at passing on their genes to new generations, the America of the future is over run with colossal idiots. The corporations have completely taken over, and the Chief Executive is a man named Camacho (Terry Crews), a championship wrestler and porn star.Written by Mike Judge ('Beavis & Butt-head', 'King of the Hill', ""Office Space"") & Etan Cohen, and directed by Judge, this movie really didn't deserve the fate that it received. 20th Century Fox completely dropped the ball when it came to promoting the movie, and it barely played in theaters. A shame, because it functions as a real wake-up call for people, and gets you to thinking about the current state of things, and where North America could possibly be headed.Not that this is subtle about its points, though. It's played as an over the top, cartoonish satire, poking fun at the very people likely to laugh the hardest at its lowest common denominator humor. It's also a triumph of production design, costume design, and visual effects (although there is some dodgy CGI along the way).Wilson and Rudolph are endearing as two people forced to realize that, although they're far from being geniuses, just might be the smartest people alive in this future year. Dax Shepard has his moments as the money hungry lawyer ""Frito"", and Crews is hilarious as an ultra macho, extravagant POTUS. There are some fun roles for the likes of Anthony 'Citric' Campos, David Herman, Justin Long, Andrew Wilson (Lukes' brother), Scarface, and Thomas Haden Church. Stephen Root (as a judge) and Sara Rue (as the Attorney General) appear unbilled.""Idiocracy"" is clever, funny, and pointed enough to make for some good entertainment, and clocks in at a quite reasonable 84 minutes, with an amusing coda for those who wait through the end credits.Seven out of 10.",Idiocracy
11,dbborroughs,This would have been a great 5 minute sketch,4,3 September 2007,"Mike Judge's barely escaped film is a disappointment. The most average guy in the army is frozen along with a hooker named Rita, supposedly for a year. When a scandal closes the base they are hidden in, they are forgotten about and only wake up five hundred years later when they are freed by the great Garbage Avalanche. With Intelligence in the toilet Bob and Rita now find themselves the smartest people in the world.Satire, ah yes I remember what that is. This is satire, clearly it is with it lampooning everyone and everything about American society. I wish it was more clever and more funny than it is. Its a scatter-shot collection of stupid people jokes that look like it was done as a foul mouthed TV movie. Its done on the cheap and feels it. It reminded me of cheap-o 1970's TV spoof comedies, that were more often than not just okay, and which thrived on the big screen in the wake of SNL because you could show breasts and say dirty words. This is an okay SNL sketch with dirty words stretched to 85 minutes.The pieces work-in theory if nothing else, but the fact that the plot has to run the length of a feature makes it all collapse. Worse Judge has picked fifteen too many easy targets so that you'll know the punchlines way before they happen. I'm not saying its bad, yea well in a way I am, but its not that bad, and worth a look, but little else.Maybe Fox was right in sitting on the film, certainly its not the masterpiece (major or minor) people are claiming because of the controversy.",Idiocracy

This is the absolute worst movie of all time.I don't know how anyone can think this was funny. There wasn't one laugh in it. It was more of a documentary on what is going to happen when NASCAR fans and reality show fans reproduce.

13,zardoz-13,"""Gulliver's Travels"" Meets ""Beavis & Butthead""",10,26 November 2008,"""Idiocracy"" qualifies as a lowest common denominator bowel comedy about sci-fi time travel. This movie is hopelessly hilarious from fade-in to fade-out with loads of inspired but irreverent sight gags. Indeed, some of these sight gags may make spectators gag. Luke Wilson gives an appropriately mild-mannered performance as the misplaced protagonist. Mind you, this is the only performance that he could have given because it makes his character not only sympathetic, but also he behaves as if he didn't know he was in a comedy. Fourth-billed actor Terry Crews is insanely funny as the futuristic Obama president. Of course, nothing about Crews' hyperactive presidential portrayal is politically correct. Remember, when ""Idiocracy"" came out, no African-American had been voted into the nation's highest elected political office. In a sense, this comedy foreshadowed the election of a minority member. However, it was the first to do so; ""Deep Impact"" (1998) cast Morgan Freeman as the President. ""Beavis & Butthead"" creator Mike Judge and ""King of the Hill"" scribe Etan Cohen co-wrote this outrageous satire about a dystopian vision of a moronic America of the future where most technology has collapsed.In this utterly rude, crude, and politically incorrect yarn, the U.S. Army selects a thoroughly average Army private, Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson of ""Charlie's Angels""), for their top-secret Human Hibernation Project, because he is thoroughly average. Since the U.S. Army couldn't find anybody in their ranks to fill the female slot, they have selected a hooker, Rita (Maya Randolph of ""Bridesmaids""), from an African-American pimp named UPGRAYEDD. The extra 'd' stands for 'double dose.' Joe and Rita are put into suspended animation for only one year as a part of the experiment, but an accident occurs. Instead, they wind up being suspended for 500 years! Officer Collins (Mike McCafferty of ""Changeling"") was busted not long afterward for operating a prostitution ring, and the military base was dismantled. Everybody forgot about the hush-hush military project as well as Joe and Rita. Our hero and heroine end up at the bottom of a gigantic garbage heap. As civilization grows even more idiotic, mankind lets the garbage pile up into mountains for centuries. Joe and Rita remain buried beneath all this debris. Years later they are released from their capsules as a result of the Great Garbage Avalanche of 2505 and discover a society where the dumbest have procreated in such huge numbers that human evolution has degenerated to the point that everybody is a imbecile. Indeed, numbskulls proliferate, and an African-American wrestler, President Camacho (Terry Crews of ""White Chicks"") the Ultimate Fighting champion, rules as the President of the United States. Surely, Judge and There is a restaurant chain named Buttf@#kers.Society has degenerated to the point that mindless television programming and rampant consumerism rule the airwaves. The favorite TV reality show is called ""Own, My Balls,"" where guys get kicked in the gonads. There is also the Masturbation Network. The Best Picture of 2505 is a film entitled ""Ass,"" and all it shows is a giant close-up of a naked, flatulent, male butt for 90 minutes. In a brilliant sight gag, a carnival ride time machine display takes citizens on a journey through the 20 Century and they learn that Charlie Chaplin and the Nazis tried to rule the world. There a Museum of Fart where people tour a number of displays depicting various eras of time and they get to press a huge red button that sounds various kinds of farts.Nobody drinks water in the year 2505, and a Gatorade knock-off sports energy drink called ""Brawndo"" has become the number one employer in America and the number one beverage because it contains electrolytes. ""Brawndo"" looks like green radiator fluid. Nobody knows what purpose electrolytes serve, but they've been told it is good for them. Following this lack of logic, farmers rely exclusively on ""Brawndo: to irrigate crops. Consequently, nothing grows anymore, and America has turned into a dust-bowl of devastation. Not long after Private Bowers arrives, he is put in prison. During a tattooing session, which is a social requirement along with a special I.D. system, he ends up with the unlikely name of Not Sure because he isn't sure what to say to the machine that registers his citizenship.Eventually, Joe escapes from private, but the authorities recapture him. They discover that Bowers has the highest I.Q. in America; Bowers took an I.Q. test before he started serving time. The President makes Bowers the Secretary of the Interior and promises him a presidential pardon if he can solve their food crisis. Nobody believes Bowers when he explains that ""Brawndo"" has saturated the top soil with so much salt that nothing will grow. When he recommends that they revert to water for irrigate their crops, they react with puzzled expressions and say, ""You mean like water from the toilet?"" Bowers' recommendation is the right step for the future, but hysteria erupts, and ""Brawndo"" has to lay off thousands of workers. They storm the White House and Bowers finds himself on trial. His sentence is one night of rehabilitation. Initially, this doesn't augur ill for our protagonist until he realizes that he will be thrown in a huge coliseum before thousands of spectators and must face two souped-up ""Mad Max"" type vehicles that resemble giant sex toys on wheels. Our hero has his ankle chained to a huge rock. Meanwhile, the heroine Rita struggles to help him by sending a guy with a camera out to shoot video of a field that has become to spout vegetation.""Idiocracy"" is extremely witty, but it also may be horrendously offensive.",Idiocracy
14,view_and_review,Beavis and Butthead repopulate the earth,5,21 January 2007,"This is the first non-animated work of Mike Judge I've ever seen. It wasn't bad. Mike Judge explores the idea of the future being a place overrun by dolts as opposed to being the technologically advanced place that most books and movies depict. It is only natural to believe that the future would be dominated by technology & science as we've steadily advanced towards such a future since the beginning of mankind. But what if intelligent people became a dying breed due to their decreased reproduction coupled with the rampant breeding of idiots? Mike Judge writes a comical work about that very idea.I found the movie to be humorous but still not that funny. It was definitely a lot more vulgar than I anticipated. As absurd as the movie was, there was a small bit of truth to it; and that was in the commercialization of everything. In this future everything was either fully or partially owned by some big brand company. Even the government was bought out by big businesses. But still, I would say the best thing about the movie is its brevity. At less than 90 minutes, Mike Judge did understand that a movie about complete buffoons could not go on too long.",Idiocracy
15,Uriah43,An Indictment of Current Societal Norms,6,10 October 2015,"Although not particularly brilliant or notable in anything in particular, an army soldier named ""Joe Bauers"" (Luke Wilson) is ordered to partake in an experiment involving a form of time travel which relies upon cryogenically freezing him to awaken a year later. Likewise, a prostitute named ""Rita"" (Maya Rudolph) has also been supplied to accompany him. However, things don't turn out as planned and rather than being awakened a year later they accidentally emerge from their pods almost five hundred years afterwards. They immediately discover that the human population has regressed intellectually and as a result the two of them are the smartest people on earth—and society is simply not ready for either of them. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was an entertaining film which could have been better if it hadn't been so vulgar. Of course, part of the reason for this was to expound upon the crass nature of society today and essentially multiply the effects over the course of time. But the lack of education and ignorance could have easily been played out a bit more fully in some of these scenes instead. In any case, the end result was—ironically enough—a boorish attempt at comedy to illustrate a decline in social mores. Be that as it may, while there weren't necessarily any scenes of a sexually explicit nature, I would recommend this movie for mature audiences only.",Idiocracy
16,movieman_kev,Criminally unadvertised,8,12 September 2006,"I was fortunate enough to be visiting Texas while this movie was playing. Fortunate because it wasn't showing anywhere close to where I live (the lack of advertising, theater count, or backing of any kind for this film is astounding) Mike Judge has yet to make anything that was less than great, and Idiocracy, while not without it's flaws, is no exception. The story of the movie is of Pvt. Bowers (Luke Wilson) who is selected by the military for a top secret cryonics program solely based on his 'averageness' and the fact that he has no family or friends that would miss him. He's frozen with a Rita, a hooker (Maya Rudolph) because the Pentagon couldn't find a military female who fit the same criteria. When the program is shut down and forgotten about, Bowers and Rita don't wake up for quite awhile. When they do, they find society is mentally retarded due to idiots breeding much faster than smart people. Blending scathing social commentary with juvenile humor, Idiocracy has many more hits than misses and I found myself laughing out loud for a good duration of the film. Maya's character must have looked hilarious on paper but she's horribly unfunny in the film and is pretty much a waste. However that's the only thing hampering an otherwise great film. Is it as good as ""Office Space""? No, but what really can ascend to those heights of greatness?? However it's still a very worthy successor.My Grade: B+",Idiocracy
17,zetes,"Make sure you see it when it hits DVD, 'cause you probably won't get a chance to see it in theaters",9,6 November 2006,"20th Century Fox was moronic not to release this film to theaters. The movie is a sci-fi story about an average man (Luke Wilson) who gets frozen in an Army experiment and is accidentally left in that state for 500 years. In the meantime, stupid people have reproduced like crazy while the intelligent have become extinct. Thus, Wilson emerges as the smartest man on the planet. It's a high concept comedy, but the actual comedy, as it focuses on enormously stupid people, is extremely lowbrow. One of the funniest jokes is a popular television show called ""Ow My Balls"", which consists of one guy being nailed in the crotch for half an hour. When the guy from the show makes appearances in real life, he doesn't seem to realize that all the idiot fans are going to want to kick him in the gonads. This film might not have been the top box office draw of the year, but it certainly would have made money, which is all the studio cares about anyway. The movie itself isn't a knock-out (after seeing Borat on the same day, it might have been best to avoid any other comedies  but this was a once-only showing), but it's fun and unique. I love the cartoonish quality of the production design. Well worth seeing if Fox ever gives anyone else the chance to do so.",Idiocracy
18,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Idiocracy (2006),6,24 August 2008,"Mike Judge is best known for, and probably cut his teeth with his razor sharp sarcasm and wit on his Beevis and Butt-Head series. How does he perform now with live action and comedy set in a futuristic science fiction genre? Not a bad piece of entertainment for a rainy Sunday afternoon, though not exactly laugh out loud material from start to end.The jokes here failed to go beyond the sight gags of making fun of conglomerates and fast food joints such as Carl's Jr, and I wonder how those executives take to their companies being made the butt of many jokes in the movie. Also, there seemed to be a pre-occupation with sex and money, with a number of jokes relying on the quick and the dirty to draw in the laughs. Sadly though, these fell really flat, as you could see them coming from a mile away, and unfortunately having the punch lines delivered without much impact.However, the story though, had a lot of potential and actually set one thinking, especially in the current climate of low population figures here, and the local authorities getting into a frenzy to try and promote pro-family lifestyles, and dangling incentives to get our citizens to procreate to sustain a future. While we had this graduate-graduate pairing in hope to having intellectuals born to intellectuals, one wonders if the incentives would make any dent to these folks' ambition anyway when they work out the disincentives to having children, and the nightmare situation depicted here, is to have the dumb and dumber contribute the numbers, and well, dumb down the entire population gene pool. Scary thought eh, when natural selection goes to the dogs.I hope I do not sound condescending here (and it's not my intent), but that forms the basis of Idiocracy, where the smart folks fail to re-populate themselves, and society in general have contributions coming from the less-intellectual because of their free loving, devil-may- care upbringing and irresponsibility. So given 500 years into the future, an average person leading an average life here, might seem as a genius to that dumbed down era. And that's exactly what happens to Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson), an average Private in the armed forces who gets ""volunteered"" into a top secret program of soldier-hibernation, of keeping combat fit soldiers for the future to be used for conflicts then, when there's peacetime now.And in a comedy, you'd come to expect things go awry at a drop of a hat, and the bulk of the jokes come from being in a dumb society who speaks improperly, and where the top-rated television programme is a Jackass clone. Sight gags go into overdrive here, and props keep things looking futuristic. But alas the story moves from set piece to set piece, following Joe through from a hospital, to court room, to jail, and finally to the White House, where he's made Secretary of the Interior to try and clean up the agricultural problem, and all the while trying to get new found friend Frito (Dax Shepard) to get him to a time-machine so that he can journey back 500 years to 2005.The less illustrious of the Wilson brothers, Luke does pull off the exasperated Mr Average role here with aplomb, but the rest of the cast seem to go over the top with their performance as idiots, and made it a little difficult to sit through stilted performances, with some incredibly banal dialogue trying to pass off as humour. Like I mentioned, it could've been genuinely funny but it didn't, but thankfully it had its premise set up nicely, and provided food for thought of a future that could have Mother Nature pull a fast and funny one on mankind.",Idiocracy
19,Mr-Fusion,The scathing wit is its charm,6,15 September 2015,"It probably says a lot that ""Idiocracy"" has become a sort of shorthand for how our culture continues to decline (right up there with ""going postal"" to describe a conniption. Every time you hear about a candidate for the Darwin Awards, you think this movie (more specifically, that it's one step closer to reality).The movie takes our society to some absurd (yet, sadly, still close to home) lengths, and Mike Judge is having a blast doing it. The president knows how to play the crowd like saps, fast food has become pretty much just Carl's Jr. (a dystopia if ever there was one) and the citizenry are literally slack-jawed morons. This is where the movie excels, although as a comedy, it's no ""Office Space"". It's fairly uneven, the hero's narrative loses steam in the second half, but you're too busy laughing at the scathing opinions of Costco and Starbucks to really let that be a deal-breaker.6/10",Idiocracy
20,SimonJack,To be or not to be -- foul,2,14 December 2017,"""Idiocracy"" had the potential to be a very good movie and satire. But the overboard use of vulgarity throughout ruins this film. It might be the focus of the film. But, whether or not, it detracts from it as a film one could watch for fun or for its satire I note that many reviewers panned people who didn't like it for the social aspects. Would those who enjoy such vulgarity want their families or circles to talk and behave thus as normal? With a better twist and the vulgarity cut, this could be a very good satire.",Idiocracy
21,siderite,I expected more,7,30 December 2006,"Mike Judge is a scholar of stupidity. He finds it, refines it, exposes it. He did so in Beavis and Butthead, in Office Space, in Saturday Night Live... He does so in this movie. However, he does it with almost no style. It's not like I didn't enjoy the movie, but it was so extreme in its stupidity, that it did not connect.The only true valuable lesson is the beginning, where it shows how a bright high IQ couple postpones making children, waiting for the right time, and miss their opportunity, while a family of hillbillies grows exponentially in time. That didn't make me wish to have children, though...What I think bothered me most is that the movie does reflect reality. The increasing dumbing down of the human race can only lead to disaster. But the state of the world in the 26th century, according to the movie, was just comical. It wasn't realistic enough to make anything but a smart-ass farting movie.On the other hand, maybe it wasn't meant to connect with me, but with the hillbillies that will eventually watch the movie and maybe think more and breed less. Alas, it is unlikely to work...",Idiocracy
22,namashi_1,An Underrated Gem!,9,14 July 2016,"Mike Judge's 'Idiocracy' is a delightfully engaging satirical science fiction comedy, that appears more relevant than it did years back during its unsung release. This underrated gem, is a tale on us humans & how its important to love our planet, before it goes all to the waste.'Idiocracy' Synopsis: Private Joe Bauers, the definition of ""average American"", is selected by the Pentagon to be the guinea pig for a top-secret hibernation program. Forgotten, he awakes five centuries in the future. He discovers a society so incredibly dumbed down that he's easily the most intelligent person alive.I was pleasantly surprised by the sheer innovation of 'Idiocracy'. Its such a different, novel concept, that ranges from being hilarious to being absolutely scary. I mean its all fun to see our protagonist travel centuries ahead, but the pathetic condition he lands up in, is amusing at first, but really plays with your mind later on, in the right way. Its a very important film, told humorously. We need to love our planet & also our people, in order for better times ahead.Etan Cohen & Mike Judge's Screenplay is excellent. Not only is it innovative, but also brave enough to talk differently & yet staying in the barometers of comedy. The Writing is super-strong! Mike Judge's Direction is fabulous. 'Idiocracy' is amongst his finest, but overlooked films to date. Cinematography is flawless. Editing is razor-crisp. Art & Costume Design are fantastic. Make-Up, deserves a special mention. Theodore Shapiro's Score is perfect.Performance-Wise: Luke Wilson is at his natural best. The underrated actor suits the part to the T & delivers a convincing performance as The Smartest Man Alive. Maya Rudolph is first-rate as the lady who travels with Wilson in the future. Dax Shepard is superb as the dumb ass. Why don't we see him more often in films? Terry Crews is fun to watch as the obnoxious president. Others lend good support.On the whole, 'Idiocracy' needs to be watched! Its truly well-made.",Idiocracy
23,StevePulaski,Can't keep a good voice silenced (or even muffled),8,21 November 2014,"This past week has been a telling week for American journalism and reporting. For one, a picture has surfaced online of Kim Kardashian's backside in an effort to ""break the internet,"" so she claims; it's a picture that has been circulated, parodied, criticized, praised, and been widely talked about for the last few days everywhere from late night talk show banter to primetime Television news. Just yesterday, November 20th, 2014, President Barack Obama addressed the United States on his plan to respond to long-stagnant actions on immigration. It was a statement that was not shown by CBS, NBC, ABC, or Fox, some of the biggest news networks in the country. We have established this week that the media feels a moronic hashtag campaign from Kim Kardashian is more important to cover than sweeping legislation on immigration. If the alleged ""idiocracy"" in America hasn't started, I think this was the kickoff. But I digress before I even technically began. The satirical brilliance and social commentary of Mike Judge's film Idiocracy was, at first, mentioned second to the inordinate amount of problems this particular film had getting a release and publicity. Judge was in the middle of a back-and-forth, neverending amount of negotiations for the film's advertising and release of theatrical trailers, often resulting in either stagnant developments or delayed release dates for the film. It became abundantly clear that 20th Century Fox, the film's distribution studio, had a film on their hands they had no idea how to market and no idea how to manage, resulting in a very quiet release and the high possibility of the film falling into obscurity.Thankfully, Mike Judge has made a name for himself over the years, with the hilarious workplace satire Office Space, the MTV animated show Beavis and Butthead, and the true-to-Texas program King of the Hill, which was strong enough to give Idiocracy something of a cult following, despite all the trouble the film underwent to get a basic release. Some speculate the only release it even made it to theaters - albeit no more than one-hundred and thirty - was to fulfill Fox's contractual obligation to give films a theatrical release, regardless of how small, before releasing it to DVD. At the end of the day, despite earning the stamp of a cult following, Judge deserved far better treatment and more confidence from a studio he made a lot of money.Focusing on the film itself, Idiocracy is a satire, portraying America in the year of 2505 where everyone has the IQ and the cognitive thought process of Beavis and Butthead. It all starts in present day, when Corporal Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson), a librarian for the U.S. Army, and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph), are selected to partake in an experiment that has Joe and Rita frozen in time by Joe's commanding officer (Michael McCafferty). When the officer is arrested one day, the experiment is abandoned and Joe and Rita are frozen in time for the next five-hundred years, finally awaking in the year 2505. Joe awakens after the chamber he was frozen in crashes through the apartment of Frito Pendejo (Dax Shepard). Joe awakens to find a society that is completely inept and moronic, void of any intellectual curiosity or intelligence whatsoever. Joe is eventually caught for not having a mandatory arm-tattooed, which is applied by a machine, which also grants him the name ""Not Sure"" by a technical error. He finds Rita, who is paranoid about finding her old pimp ""Upgrayedd"" (Brad Jordan) and paying him back, despite the fact that he has been dead for hundreds of years, and tries to find a way to a rumored time machine that will take him back to when he was put to rest. In order to do that, however, he must cooperate with an unrealistically stupid society, run by the incompetent President Chambers (Terry Crews), who discovers that Joe is the smartest person in the country and advises him to fix all the problems with the new America.For a film ripe with commentary and featuring various observations about American culture now and where it could be headed, Idiocracy is a surprisingly breezy watch, never hitting you over the head with an abundance of morals and being remarkably fun while equally sad and frustrating. The film shows a culture that is anti-science, anti-reason, anti-logic, and without any kind of a direction, simply being a haven of mouthbreathers to spew nonsense. It's a sad film to witness, and all I can hope is that it doesn't eventually become a documentary.Judge knows how to tackle material like this, though, in order to make this a fun ordeal rather than plaguing us with frustration and neurosis about the future. He turns Idiocracy into a briskly-paced riot, filled with action, science-fiction, and comedy that is too funny to be called juvenile yet not high-brow enough to be dry-wit. He finds the middle ground of humor, and employing people like Wilson, Rudolph, and Shepard to play headlining roles allows for unconventional cinematic heroes to prosper. With that and more, Idiocracy is a great deal of fun, albeit frightening in the potential for it to become even marginally prophetic. Starring: Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph, Dax Shepard, Terry Crews, Michael McCafferty, and Brad Jordan. Directed by: Mike Judge.",Idiocracy

She said it was one of those films I just had to see and it was one of the funniest she saw. Then she said, hopefully as a joke, I should not come back to work until I saw this movie, so I rented it immediately that night and watched it. I have to agree, this was a very hilarious movie that I just couldn't stop laughing at. But do you wanna know something scary? After I saw this film, I was telling my mom how I agree that our society is ""dumbening"" down and how many of my friends could act like complete morons when it comes to common sense. Then I go online to check some mail and I see the lead story, parents in Switzerland wanna name their kid ""4Real"", scary isn't it?Joe is your average Joe, he is asked to participate in an army experiment with a hooker, Rita. This experiment is to see if we can prolong life, but before they can reopen the experiment, the army is shut down. 500 years have passed and Joe awakes to a very different world, but you know how we were supposed to get more intelligent in the future? Well, it's not like that, everyone speaks in ""Valley Girl"" or ""Surfer Dude"" or they just slur their words together. Joe is later proved to be the smartest man on Earth, which is good, I'm not sure compared to this world where they feed juice to plants and don't know how to treat sick people or know what shapes are. Joe has to save the world and humanity, which is pretty scary considering how normal he is and is being helped by a hooker.Idiocracy is one of those must see movies, in fact just take a look around, this will be our world if we don't shape up I feel. It's a really good movie and just a fun comedy that I'm sure will make you laugh more than a few times.

The concept of a average Joe being the smartest person in the world in the year 2500 AD was pretty intriguing, especially the picking at of idiocy.

And I'm not saying I didn't get the humor. Oh, I got it. I was five once. And even at that age, I would've turned my nose at this.The entire concept is so old – one military fool and one ugly prostitute get dumped into an experiment that inadvertently has them sleep 500 years, only to awake in a commercial-based, nation of fools – that even Futurama on its WORST day would be ashamed.Once awakened, Rita (Maya Rudolph) and Joe (Luke Wilson) are the smartest members of a degrading human race bent on killing themselves by watering plants with energy drinks vs. water.I want to stop there. Not in fear of spoiling anything further, but as I am thoroughly disgusted in even thinking of this movie any longer. I mean, I get where they were going – product placement, ads, Costco, TV, blah, blah – but this would've been best served as a 20 minute Adult Swim CARTOON, NOT a 90 minute film.You really want to know what would cause a future of morons?

The concept is interesting, a keen observation of the USA's worrying trend towards anti-science, but it would probably be better suited for a short film or something less traditional in terms of narrative. As it is, the piece is basically just an adventure in which we're expected to laugh at how 'dumb' everyone is, with its plot never feeling fully satisfying in and of itself. The other main issue with the picture is that it just isn't all that funny. Its satire is as brash and on-the-nose as its over-the-top characters, and its general vibe is actually somewhat grating (probably because of all the aggressively unintelligent shouting). It has the right intentions, but it isn't really executed all that well. Still, it's decent enough. It's perfectly watchable and it will probably appeal to some more than others. 5/10",Idiocracy

30,Cineanalyst,Utopia,7,28 January 2021,"This is an interesting (and maybe even frightening) movie, although not necessarily for the reasons some seem to consider it as such. To take it at face value, as satire--just what the mockumentary voice-of-god, voiceover narrator claims--is to flirt dangerously with eugenics: that society is crumbling in part because undesirable people are procreating at a faster rate than desired people. As has oft been the case historically, this is wrapped in pseudo-scientific social Darwinism and mislabeled as ""evolution."" IQ tests are also unquestioningly championed as a legitimate metric. In a hyperbolic sense and not in the sense at all of ""The Great Dictator"" (1940), this idiocratic thinking is Charlie Chaplin's Tramp as Hitler in the Time Machine amusement ride.The commentary that society also fails because smart people wasted their abilities by profiting on the bald and impotent is a little better. The appeal of, the address of the picture, being to the literal most average people. Yet, this gives way to a future that although severely mocked eventually hires the smartest man in the country to solve their problems, where they ask for that man's help to solve these very real problems, and where that man cares and wants to help them. Sounds like a utopia. Sure, there are big problems with the justice system, corporations, our garbage, continuing to be able to feed everyone, maybe even automation; but if that makes for an idiocracy, look around, those problems already exist and have existed since at least the Industrial Revolution and, for the most part, longer than that. And, sex crazed and filthy mouthed? C'mon.I don't so much mind the dated, politically-incorrect slurs, either, and the FoxNews gag is spot on, but the basis of much of the comedy is troublingly debasing and stereotyping of cultural and economic ""others."" Mostly, poor and poorly-educated people. This is even the case in the English of 500 years in the future, which the narrator describes as ""a hybrid of hillbilly, valley girl, inner city slang, and various grunts."" Consider, though, that language is merely what society agrees upon. Meanings, spellings and grammatical rules change, or ""evolve,"" constantly. Try reading Old or Middle English sometime, or something more layman than Shakespeare from half a century ago. Those aren't mistakes we're seeing written and spoken in the future.After establishing that the narrator is the stupid bigot and that the supposed dystopia isn't all that bad, ""Idiocracy"" may be an amusing futuristic comedy with charming limited visual effects. That brings me, however, to the biggest problem, or at least question, I have with ""Idiocracy,"" which is why do I still find it hilarious. Is laughing at someone laughing at someone else getting kicked in the groin or farting just another shameful form of feeling superior to those seen as inferior in some way, or is it merely as unsophisticated as the initial laughing at genital pain and flatulence. Are we, am I, the audience sitting in a theatre watching a butt pass gas, sitting on a toilet watching TV? Is the ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" creator just making fun of his own audience or making us stupider? Shut up, I told you already!",Idiocracy
31,CuriosityKilledShawn,Already halfway there.,8,17 March 2007,"If you're in the mood for sharp dose of intelligent satire then Idiocracy is the movie for you. I'd never heard of it until I gave it a rent and it's wall to wall hilarious, I kid you not.Luke Wilson plays magnificently average Army guy Joe Bowers, who is encouraged to take part in a hibernation experiment because of his complete ordinariness. Along with Rita, an equally average hooker (!), he is sent to sleep in a large incubator with the intention of being woken up in a year. But during his slumber there is a scandal on the base and it's closed down, the incubators forgotten about.Flash forward 500 years and the human race has been incredibly dumbed-down, following the orders of super-conglomerates, talking in a warped language of unintelligible slang syntax, wanting nothing more than to sit in front of a big screen TV and watch moronic shows while being bombarded with commercials for unessential products while the planet turns into a giant trash heap. Doesn't sound like it could ever happen could it? Breaking free of his incubator and let loose in this strange world, Joe now finds himself the most intelligent person alive, but instead of using this newfound talent to make friends and make the world a better place he is shunned by society for being 'faggy'. As Lisa Simpson once put it, as intelligence goes up, happiness goes down.We really do live in a world where the REAL brains, scientists, doctors and honest leaders are cast aside to make way for footballers, movie-stars and backstabbing politicians. Eerie foreshadowing, no doubt about it.Desperate to get back to his own time, Joe teams up with Rita to find a supposed time machine. But he is made 'Secretary of the Interior' by wrestling champion, porn-star extraordinaire and President of the United States Camancho. The country is the middle of a devastating dust-bowl since no crops are growing. But that's because they are being fed with Brawndo (Gatorade) because the Brawndo cooperation deemed water a threat to their profits and bought the rights to it. A problem easily solved. But who's going to believe that? It's a shame this film didn't find legs in the cinemas, but like Mike Judge's other cult hit, Office Space, I'm sure it will find an audience on DVD. Judge seems to have a strange, unpredictable sense of humor. I'm a big fan of King of the Hill and Daria and if you are too then you should definitely check out Idiocracy. After all, it's fun for us intelligent folks to laugh at the dumb.

One can easily appreciate the 505 years later experience of our heroes, because again, the director has tried to put things on a very human level. Somewhat similar to Woody Allen's ""Sleeper"", this movie is very funny. Do not miss the deleted scenes as the ""Museum Of Fart"" is a classic.

34,johnnyboyz,I'm With Stupid. Thoroughly amusing take on modern American life which is well worth checking out.,7,3 July 2020,"I think I understand what's going on here: a film aficionado is supposed to watch ""Idiocracy"" and laugh at how stupid everyone else is for not watching independent films, right? Or, at the very least, films that actually have something to say about something. Well, maybe it is a little self-gratifying to now and again think of one's self as intelligent and everybody else as not being up to your own standard, but, let's say you were in the position Luke Wilson's protagonist finds himself here... Just how DO you grow crops properly? Or fix economies? Indeed, how many of the famous faces during the opening did you recognise? And how many should an intelligent person spot?Joking to one side, it is, broadly speaking, too late, isn't it? The world Michael Judge creates in ""Idiocracy"", some 500 years into the future, has its blueprint in our own time now: Destruction Derbies and WWE are popular; politics is spectacle, White House discourse is a joke; Presidents are blowhards - in the case of Arnold Schwarzenegger, they are also bodybuilders; movies make millions of dollars yet suck; society and popular culture have been saturated by sex and sexuality, and a plummy voice often induces mockery.If there was one moment in Judge's dystopia which struck me more than any other, it was when the protagonist of a television programme entitled 'Ow, my balls!' (don't ask) is ambushed by a member of the public and kicked in a place you should not need spelling out to you. This was primarily out of the fact it replicates true-to-life instances of people being incapable of telling apart televised fiction from reality, as when especially nefarious soap characters are confronted on public transport by fans of the show or Paul Eddington is congratulated on doing such a great job as Prime Minister, despite only playing a fictitious one in ""Yes, Prime Minister"". We are already here, aren't we?""Idiocracy"" tells the story of Joe, played by the aforementioned Wilson, who is a lowly desk clerk on an anonymous American air base early in this century. His job, like his life, is safe and easy; he doesn't want trouble and doesn't test himself - just to work for long enough to build up a pension and retire. Joe is dragged out of this bubble by the higher-ups for a hibernation experiment, which is outlined in a manner I usually detest in films via exposition and slides, but is actually here very funny. He is meant to be asleep, or frozen, in a special pod (a little like the crew members of those spaceships in science-fiction for long journeys) for one year so that the authorities can observe its efficiency. Alas, something goes wrong, and due to the secrecy of the experiment, both he and a sex-worker named Maya (Maya Rudolph), whom was also selected for the experiment, awake to find themselves five hundred years into America's future.This simple enough premise provides Judge the opportunity to hold up a mirror to American, indeed Western, society - what might our attitudes and culture lead us to? What happens when we keep aiming as low as we do? Judge's future struck me, via its architecture and the characteristics of its inhabitants, as an odd amalgamation of Las Vegas and the Deep South - seemingly the two cultural hubs of present-day America Judge fears having the most influence on its future. In the America of ""Idiocracy"", people are suddenly incapable of stringing together a handful of words and dress atrociously; commercialism reigns, so much so that people actually walk around with advertisements on their shirts. Unfettered materialism and consumption have led to piles of garbage the size of buildings; society is so sexualised that prostitution has infiltrated everyday cafés. Many of the women, in fact, walk around in tight tops which accentuate their cleavage - I imagine this is Judge playing a trick on the audience - if we like looking, we're as stupid as the rest of them, right?From merely a generic standpoint, there are a lot of laughs, and the material is a lot better than merely dumping a load of stupid characters into a piece and having them say or do stupid things for easy laughs. Joe's lone friend already belonging to this nightmare-world is a certain Frito (Dax Shepard), whose house his hibernation pod initially crashes into, but whose idiocy carries such poised authenticity for the world Judge creates that we can go along with the joke without feeling like the mentally challenged are being mocked.Crucially, Judge gets the basics right - we like the protagonist and there is a sense of urgency as he seeks to evade capture from the authorities of this brave new world. What Judge has made is something character driven - Joe, when we first meet him, is watching wrestling on TV, bored on the job, and that the film concludes with him running his own violent gauntlet for means of everyone else's entertainment cannot be a coincidence. Eventually, he will also come to learn of responsibility; that having some kind of input is important in life and that you cannot just keep evading this stuff.More recently, people (curiously on both sides of the political spectrum) have taken to describing the here-and-now as being the arrival of Idiocracy, particularly in the wake of President Trump, but let's remember it was Bill Clinton on TV in 1992 playing the saxophone in his sunglasses which did its bit in sapping the substance out of politics, or dumbing down important decisions. For another comedy which plays by no one's rules which has something to say on contemporary society; culture and where it might take us, see 2013's ""God Bless America"", but see this as well.",Idiocracy
35,Tweetienator,A New Chapter of Nostradamus Discovered,7,22 September 2021,Idiocracy is no perfect movie - there is some filler time here and there - but with every decade passing it gets more and more visionary and important: to a certain degree it tells us what lies ahead for us and what is already operational in full scale and on all levels of society.

36,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Brilliant imagining of an awful future with an unworthy story,6,22 July 2012,"What if the future is nothing like the novelist and filmmakers imagined? Isn't it more practical to imagine a flawed society bred from stupidity and excess? ""Beavis and Butthead"" and ""Office Space"" creator Mike Judge, along with Etan Cohen, has a great deal of fun envisioning this future in ""Idiocracy.""""Idiocracy"" is built entirely around this concept, so naturally that's where this comedy succeeds and fails. What it lacks in story it attempts to make up for with goofy imagination, and it succeeds enough of the time to warrant sitting out its run time.Luke Wilson plays Joe Bauers, an average male with a middle-of-the-road IQ. He agrees to subject himself to a military experiment meant to test stasis pods for military soldiers. He and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph), that is. Well, while asleep the experiment is shut down and the two are forgotten about. They would've stayed that way if not for a giant garbage tsunami — 500 years later.In this sad, sad future, everything is corporatized and all services and technology are dumbed down so everyone and anyone can use them. Joe's adventure begins when he runs into Frito (Dax Shepard), a speech-slurring lawyer who doesn't protect his clients' best interests (one client being Joe) because he's too stupid. Joe ends up in jail, though he escapes by simply telling the guard he was supposed to be released from prison that day.To make a long story short, Joe's intelligence catches the eye of President Camacho (Terry Crews) and he's named Secretary of the Interior. He must figure out how to make the crops grow again or be killed, pretty much. Obviously, Joe just wants it all to go away, and Frito tells him of a time machine that keeps his hopes alive for escaping back to his own time.The detail of Judge's vision for this abhorrent future makes the film. What Joe and Rita do is of no consequence, though you do root for them, which isn't hard considering every other character is a total numbskull. Instead, the way jokes are crafted into and from this imagining of a stupid future keeps us engaged. A machine that diagnoses all problems seems like an awesome thing, but when the operator doesn't know which probe goes in your mouth and which in your rectum, it suddenly becomes rather amusing.""Idiocracy"" is a cautionary social parody that refuses to take itself seriously. While there's something horrible about the number one show on TV in 100 years being ""Ouch, My Balls!"" and the Best Picture winner being a film called ""Ass,"" it does us no good to make that critique in a dead-serious manner.The only fault of ""Idiocracy "" — and it's a substantial one — is that it doesn't have a story worth a damn. Judge desperately wants to take us to this world, but his film is guided only by the foolishness he wishes to take place in it, as well as jokes about our stupidity that are ripe for the picking. He's not interested in taking the time to tell a story that would also make the same point as his gags and satire. Good thing the gags and satire are sharp enough, as it makes ""Idiocracy"" an amusing, one-of-a-kind watch.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com",Idiocracy
37,jzappa,"A Buried Gem Holding Up to Censure the Link Between Dysgenics, Commercialism and Anti-Intellectualism",8,12 November 2010,"One would've supposed that the longed-for follow-up to Mike Judge's cult darling Office Space would've been grounds for festivity at the studio fortunate enough to obtain such a film. Assuredly, this'd be something like a certificate to print cash. Nevertheless Twentieth Century Fox discarded Idiocracy callously into a handful of theaters and let it run for a month, scuffing not even a million before being yanked with even less esteem for its worth.Is the film awful? Unbearable? An utter humiliation for Judge, one that, conceivably, he frantically sought to submerge but that contractual commitments legally entailed be released, even if only briefly and brusquely? No. Here's the ""trouble"": Idiocracy is even more incisive, more derogatory, more radical than Office Space. Ruinous enough that Judge summarized the slacker culture of a whole age group in his 1999 film, strengthened the disgruntlement and overall Gen-X populism of multitudes of dejected corporate laggards, but that was a rinse: Just let geeks pay lip service to the spirit of an underdog protagonist. They'll be happy corporate laggards.But with Idiocracy, Judge takes a penknife to a far more deep-seated characteristic of prevailing American civilization: our tendency, or frankly, cheerful eagerness to extract endlessly from the environment without thinking, or debase public speech as an exclusionary and inclusionary gesture, intended to make us sound like one of the regular folks, suggesting an unspoken defiance of the sincerity of whatever is being talked about, or regress into the path of least resistance in every social and personal capacity. Judge's nefarious satire here is so piercing, so indispensible, so unmistakably so keen to where we may be proceeding as a society that there's no laughing it away, as spitefully, irately hilarious as it is. It's like this: the extremely average Joe and the likewise exceedingly mediocre Rita are frozen in a military test, and awaken half a millennium after their intended unfreezing to find that they're rather plainly the most intelligent people in the world. It appears that the present fashion of obnoxious drones procreating arbitrarily and intellectuals postponing for so long that it never happens has caused a populace of lamebrains so obtuse they don't understand why the crops won't grow, can't follow that plants require water instead of niche-marketed sports drinks.Once all the vanguard gags have been spent---the spot-on prediction that language has all been reduced to a mix of valley, urban slang and grunts, hospital lobbies full of slot machines, there are entire mountains of garbage and Starbucks now just sells hand jobs instead of coffee altogether---there isn't much else happening in this scattershot affair. Joe rambles about being misconstrued and hopeful of finding a time machine that'll take him back to 2005. He's sometimes accompanied by Maya Rudolph. The movie also has pretty funny cameos by Justin Long, Thomas Haden Church and Terry Crews, among others.But by that same token, one admires that Idiocracy truly is that forthright. It doesn't even try to minimize the bang of its pure anger at how extraordinarily foolish humans are, both as individuals and as a group. This is a movie that identifies how unwise the ordinary person is---Joe is the intentional key pattern, and Wilson plays him as a good-natured clod---and that half of everyone else is even thicker than that.This is not, perchance, the ideal way to attract a movie audience, and possibly Fox was defensible in thinking that offending the viewers might not turn a profit. Conversely, most of the people at whom Judge is taking such devastating aim are too dense to grasp they're being slighted, so conceivably it would've been a rinse.Also, I think the more likely conclusion is that Murdoch and his subordinates saw the dead-on implications of its recalled product: In the consistent, and much funnier, expansion on Demolition Man's gag about every restaurant being Taco Bell, only a small number of trade brands run out of control over the ""cultural"" panorama of the 26th century, in a manner that succeeds as a slight to both calculating corporations and the consumers that bestow them their virtual domination. ""Welcome to Costco, I love you,"" says the greeter as droning patrons shamble by. The capitalistic malignancy that afflicts this bizarre future Joe and Rita find themselves having to revive is an audacious denunciation of the corporate supremacy of our current world. But hey, if no one wants to dwell on it enough to realize that we need to prevent it, then perhaps Idiocracy will become another prophetic work like A Face in the Crowd or Network, just not even close to those production values.",Idiocracy
38,Polaris_DiB,Communicative dissonance? (haha!),6,12 January 2007,"Who hasn't harbored notions that eventually stupidity will take over the world and the smart people will cease to exist? Such is the science fiction question behind Mike Judge's (Office Space) new comedy staring Luke Wilson as the Most Average Man in the World timetravelling to the future to become the Most Intelligent Man in the World.I think what this film does really well is present the difficulties in trying to communicate to stupid people. In that sense of the dialog, this movie is actually quite genius. Wilson's character tries so hard to just straighten things up, but is oftentimes overwhelmed by the brick wall of complete absurdity:""But it has electrolytes!"" ""What are electrolytes?"" ""They're what plants crave!"" ""But why do they crave them?"" ""Because they're electrolytes!"" ""Yeah that's what plants crave!""It's a pretty silly movie.Unfortunately, some of the jokes had me wondering, ""So... are these jokes funny because they make fun of people who think they're funny.... or are they still just dumb humor?"" A hard line to draw in a movie of this type, but honestly the movie is fun enough and, uh, dumbed-down enough for everyone to enjoy! (Yes, indeed, the very people this movie makes fun of will find it enjoyable, I promise you). Ultimately it's pretty decent.--PolarisDiBFavorite Quote: The dialog above.

Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph are singled out for an Army project to be placed in hibernation for a year to have their DNA preserved so that the human race can be salvaged. Unfortunately, the commander gets busted for prostitution, the base gets torn down, a Fuddruckers gets put up in its place, and they are forgotten about for the next 500 years, when they are awaken to find that dumb people have taken over.(due to evolution:watch for the forshadowing explanation at the beginning with the smart and dumb families.) Watch for all the sight gags (a la Naked Gun) and all the jokes in this movie-it was actually well done despite a fair amount of gross-out humor.

40,Lechuguilla,Blunt-force Humor,4,23 April 2016,"A wonky space device hurls a generic American Joe and Jane five hundred years into the future. They wake up in an America that is unrecognizable in its cultural trashiness and arrested development. It's an interesting concept that could have been a terrific satire on our current culture. Unfortunately, the underlying concept is diluted by too much emphasis on hyper action borrowed from TV wrestling and rapperism.There are some funny moments. Those mini-cars are humorously ugly. I like the dialogue in the Costco segment. The Fox news anchors are a hoot, except the woman needs to be a blonde, not a brunette. Also good is the brief segment explaining that water had been deemed a threat to corporate profits; hence the use of a sports drink to water plants. The dialogue and visuals in these segments render a commentary that is prescient.But the overall trend of the film is not clever dialogue but rather fast action and irritating noise. The rapper President is not funny; he's annoying. The car to car rehabilitation sequence in the second half is boring and unimaginative. And with a screen shot averaging just 1.9 seconds, much of the futuristic visuals whiz by without notice.Further, the nondescript background music is overbearing and reminds me of what I would hear in some stupid Tom Cruise ""action"" movie. And finally, too much of the dialogue is lowbrow and crude gutter talk, as the film tries to appeal to a juvenile demographic.I would have preferred a slower paced plot with emphasis on clever, organic dialogue, not the labored adolescent humor that dominates much of the film. I predict this film will age badly, as cultural values and technology change. In ""Idiocracy"", be prepared for a typical Hollywood action movie with in-your-face, blunt-force ""humor"", set in some distant future.",Idiocracy
41,jimbo-53-186511,Excellent concept but it didn't work out quite as well as I'd hoped,5,27 February 2016,"Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson) is defined by everyone as being an average American and is deemed to be the perfect man to take part in a top-secret Hibernation Project. The intention of this programme is for Bauers to be put to sleep and awoken after 1 year. However, a government scandal results in the closure of the facility and sadly Bauers is forgotten about for not 1 year, but 500 years!!! Bauers awakens after being asleep for 500 years and discover that society as he knows it has devolved almost beyond repair so much so that he is now the smartest man in the world.Given the rather promising concept I really hoped that this would prove to be a biting, witty satire as well as being a film that brought about a consistent run of jokes, but sadly Mike Judge's Idiocracy is very much hit and miss on both fronts....Maybe it's just me but when I looked at the write up and learned that this was a satirical comedy I was actually expecting a lot of good satire. I thought that the new world that Bauers now inhabited would be explored and critiqued, but sadly much of this potential was wasted by Judge not really thinking the idea through and really only having 2 running gags throughout the film (all the inhabitants of the new world are stupid and that they mistake Bauers clear speaking voice and articulate manner as being a weakness because it makes him sound gay). These examples of critique aren't bad per se, but they become repetitive and become less and less funny each time you hear them. The courtroom scenes were ridiculous and seemed more farcical than satirical or funny.Although I've been negative in the previous paragraph I have to admit that some of it was actually quite amusing; I liked the scenes in the hospital and Bauers being assigned the name of 'Not Sure' due to a computer not understanding him was pretty funny too - anyone who has tried to use voice recognition systems can probably relate to this, even though, naturally, this has been exaggerated slightly in the film. Amidst all of the uneven writing and chaos in this picture Judge has remembered to make the film have a positive feel to it by allowing the protagonist to use his 'superior' intelligence for the good of humankind(I won't say anymore than that though). Many of the characters are fairly likable as well which also helps (although Bauers lawyer was more irritating than funny).Idiocracy doesn't totally work and wasn't the biting or witty satire that I was hoping for and it wasn't as clever or funny as I would have liked either. Having said that it has enough positively and likability to make it worth a watch and did prove to be quite funny at times as well.",Idiocracy

The only downside is that it does really push the crassness and the irreverence heavily, a good portion of that is intentional but there are portions that don't quite fit.I really do love this, it's a highly quoted movie for me and one I feel like I talk about regularly with people. That said, this style of movie, this style of humor absolutely isn't going to click with everyone and I 100% get that and it doesn't make it wrong for anyone to feel it's just not for them.

48,Blueghost,"Poignant, but a little flat.",3,3 July 2010,"The world portrayed in this film reminds me of my life growing up. Trying to indulge myself in knowledge and common sense only to be met by the ""You suck..."" and ""You're a f#$%..."" crowd, I found my frustration with mankind (teenage-kind in my case) growing at a geometric rate. The older they got, the dumber they got. But I endured. After all, one is perpetually told that people change and grow up. But, innate habits die hard, and where the coverings and behavioral flavors of people change, they themselves do not.So it is with this film. An extreme parody of modern push- button/instant-gratification culture, or how middle school sensibilities have taken over our once proud cultural leading edge, one is hard pressed not to give a tacit nod to the extreme presentation of today's worst social mores. Think McWorld meets Terminator, and all the this implies. Think of the fattest, dumbest, most self centered idiot you knew in school, and imagine what the world would be like if he ran things.Think of cultural idiocy, like the people who cheered O.J. Simpson during his flight from the police, and the media circus that surrounded one of the most sensationalized events of the 1990s. Think of how basketball used to be well reffed and considered more gentlemanly than the pushing and brawling that goes on in today's sports. Think of how boxing, though influenced by crime, had a kind of tasteful social presentation, and now think of the extremes combative presentations have gone to garnish dollars. Think of how situation comedies on network television pushed the social envelope by addressing deep and profound issues of right and wrong in the 1970s, then think of the invasion of tasteless culture led by Rupert Murdoc's media empire heralding the 1990s with the likes of ""Married with Children"". Take all that, and other like examples, and magnify it a hundred-fold. That's kind of what ""Idiocracy"" is all about. Ayup: It's a clever film to be sure, and one would be hard pressed not to comment on the genius of the premise, but the gags are about as tiring as the 30-second spot culture it zings. The hyper-intelligence of the protagonist doesn't carry the film like it should, and given the amount of work that went into the making of this film, one is hard pressed to wonder why it didn't have a keener impact.Again, it's not the premise as such, but the fact that there's just little substance to it. Yeah, sure, okay, we know that there are instant gratification idiots out there. America is fat. Instant porn, super-sized culture seems to be ever on the rise. But, have things ever been different at anytime in history? One wonders.Bottom line; it's a tiring film. It really doesn't teach us anything that we already don't know and abhor about American born pop culture and its negative impact. Why do we see monster truck rallies and court TV where the trash of society becomes mainstream spectacle entertainment? Because in a world of pay-per-view entertainment, all the good stuff costs money. And that's the larger point the film missed.To this end this is probably why it got limited distribution, and why the film faded into the background. The companies that are ridiculed in this film probably didn't care for the negative press, and perhaps the distributors feared litigation on all levels, but I think the larger force operating here is that the film is just plain flat.Well, I'm not sure what else to say about this movie. It was recommended to me, and I took a chance on it. I'm marginally glad I saw it, but would have preferred that my local blockbuster hadn't shut down so I could view it on a weekend rental deal.",Idiocracy
49,Blueghost,What idiocracy is really about.,3,21 December 2017,"Luke Wilson represent the smart person with taste in a sea of tastelessness, and is so frustrated that he is hooked up with a woman of fiduciary virtue. That's all there is.There's a plot about a dystopic future, there's a whole setting about how American's taste has bottomed out, everyone in the future has a double digit IQ, and, essentially, things are beyond bad.It's a tasteless comedy meant for younger audiences, older high schoolers and post college grads who have yet to find their niche. The psychiatric formula in this thing is out of sociological-fear screenwriting 101, where sexual gratification is seen as cure all to ""smart people's"" ills, when, in fact, as per the setting and resolution of the plot, it may actually be the setting and other surroundings the subject is in that needs addressing. In other words, maybe the world is junk, but getting hooked up with a hottie isn't going to solve nor change that, nor even make it better until the world is de-junkified (to coin a phrase).As a one time young budding screenwriter who's pulled back the curtain on a number of scifi films, as well as dramas, comedies and so forth, I think I can safely say that this thing is pretty tasteless, even though it reflects some of my outlooks in my younger days. Even so I can't say I liked this thing too much. It has a few minor highs, but the over the top nature of it reminds me of how tasteless humor came into vogue in the early and mid 1980s, and has come home to roost ever since.Ergo, I don't think ti's a very good film, though the premise is certainly semi-interesting from a lay person's perspective.I really didn't get anything out of it, and just thought the whole thing was abysmal in taste. The same film could have been made for all audiences and told the same message without crass and disgusting blue humor. Lastly, this is probably my last film review. The IMDB has done its best to alter the format of their pages, effectively hiding what used to be showcased user reviews. I kind of know the reason, but will refrain from any commentary, just announce that I'm dissapointed with the decision, and, to keep it in vein with the spirit of the film, I feel like Joe Bauers as I sit here writing this last paragraph. As for the film itself, eh, it's marginally interesting, competent on the technical level, but otherwise I'd skip it.

The grunt (Luke Wilson) usually has funny lines; the hooker is a throw away character that is poorly written.The acting was better than expected for this type of movie, and there are numerous sight gags that work. The pathetic future is illustrated very well, with the WWF, fast food chains, ATM's, reality TV, superstores, and bar codes being only s few examples of modern day foolishness sent up for some good skewering.Even though it occasionally descends into the same brainless level of life it's ridiculing, this movie is funny for the most part.",Idiocracy
54,DeeNine-2,Outrageous but prescient?,7,1 September 2013,"This is played for laughs, but the idea that people are getting dumber is actually highly plausible. Studies have shown (or so I've been told) that domestic animals are not as bright as the wild kind. And guess what? We domesticate ourselves, or rather our culture does.Recently there was a story in the news about a study that showed that the brains of obese people are 16 years older than the brains of people of normal weight (these were people in their seventies). Furthermore the brains of the obese had about eight percent less mass than the brains of people of normal weight. Merely ""fat"" people had half the deficiency. So when director Mike Judge depicts all those fat and dumb people in the future, he may be on to some serious prognosticating.As for the film itself, well, it is strangely compelling. This future world of idiots with everything falling apart seems almost real. It should be emphasized that all science fiction about the future is of necessity an extrapolation from the present. In fact, the real power of futuristic tales is what they tell us about the present. Idiocracy is no exception. The dumbed-down, couch-potato, dimly-aware creatures shown in the film are us! (Present company excepted of course.) Unfortunately Idiocracy is a sort of one trick pony. The central joke wears a little thin toward the middle of the film and the concocted story collapses into the merely silly. There are some good laughs along the way, such as crop failures due to using a kind of Gatorade on the crops called Brawndo instead of water.—Dennis Littrell, author of ""The World Is Not as We Think It Is""",Idiocracy

But the theme about people getting less intelligent in future time might not be so far fetched. I cannot say that it will happen,but if we don't take proper care of our educational system than this could be a possibility. I have noticed that some schools aren't teaching facts anymore. (Like history,geography,basic stuff). The focus is more on learning practical abilities. The theory behind most subjects may be boring but is essential in understanding how things work. In the movie there is this ridiculous example of people growing crops with Gatorade in stead of water! Well,we can laugh about it. But if you never been taught that water contains minerals necessary for plants to grow so how would you know. To me this is a scary notion. So now you understand why this subject isn't funny anymore. It could be that Mike Judge is making fun but at the same time is warning people for a real disaster if education doesn't improve fast. Am I taking this movie too seriously? Yes of course! To each his own fun. I loved Mike Judge's work (Beavis and Butthead and Office space). In these he was able to be critical and funny at the same time. In ""Idiocracy"" I missed this.

57,Sirus_the_Virus,Idiocracy is hilarious.,10,7 August 2009,"Idiocracy is a hilarious film from Director Mike Judge. Judge did Office Space back in 1999, and his newest or recent film doesn't disappoint. It's a got a hilarious cast including Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph, Dax Shepard, and Terry Crews. Though the film is crude, it's awesome. Also, it's really F*ucking funny. I won't say to much about it but I will say this. It's a great comedy and I think you should see it. I'll admit it is sometimes very immature, but that's Mike Judge for you. I like Luke Wilson's character and Maya Rudolph's. In fact, I prefer Luke Wilson over Owen Wilson. At least Luke Wilson doesn't have the annoying voice over the dented nose. Just note, Idiocracy was probably the funniest film of 2006. Though we had Clerks II and Borat, Idiocracy wins overall. The Plot: A moronic soldier and a prostitute are meant to sleep in a capsule for a year. But something goes wrong and they sleep for 500 years.When they both wake up, they realize the world has gone retarded and there is a huge prostitution thing going on. It also turns out that the idiot soldier is the smartest person on the planet.",Idiocracy
58,lambiepie-2,A Fun Movie that Makes you think...,10,1 September 2007,"Gotta be honest, the overall theme of the film is what keeps you going. It's Mike Judge's take on the ""dumbing down"" of the world and how that may effect the world 500 years into the future.An average Army grunt gets chosen for an experiment to see if humans can be frozen for a year and reawakened successfully. Mishaps occur and instead of a year, it's 500. When he wakes up, everyone has really dumbed down, become lazy. Along with the Army recruit, a female was chosen - and honestly how she was chosen, what she is and why is one of the downs of this picture.Again, this is a picture with a good theme and a few good sketches to punch up the theme. But it is no ""Office Space"" and it is no ""Futuramma"" although some may wish to make obvious homages to both. There are lot of comedic holes, a lot of misplaced humor to drive the point home, and the acting isn't all that top notch either. But here is a good film idea to ponder around with - it just doesn't go as far as it needs to. Or become as intelligent as it needs to be - and maybe that's the pun in and of itself.",Idiocracy
59,sarastro7,Problematic,9,3 February 2007,"I was looking forward to Idiocracy, and in many ways I wasn't disappointed. But the movie has a big problem: it appeals to two different and mutually exclusive audiences. Which are people with taste and people with no taste. The overall social satire and critical attitude to current society will be appreciated by the former, who on the other hand won't enjoy the vulgarity of most of the jokes. And vice versa. If you enjoy the jokes, then, by this movie's message, YOU are the problem.Whereas, if you have taste and don't enjoy the jokes, this movie is just not going to be that funny to you. The solution would have been to make the jokes really funny instead of just vulgar and stupid. As it is, this is halfway towards being a really funny and really good movie. But it doesn't quite get there.And another thing: IQ is not particularly hereditary. People in trailer parks do not necessarily have lower IQs than business execs (and evolution doesn't work that fast anyway). It's true that the poor are undereducated, but that's because they're poor. So the whole thing about the world succumbing to stupidity because only stupid people have kids... that just doesn't float. No way, no day. It's all about education. And given the opportunity, the kids of trailer trash will be just as brainy as rich kids. Still, that element of the movie can be put down to symbolism, so I'm not letting it detract from my rating.8 out of 10.",Idiocracy
60,mentalcritic,"Unfortunately, the studio only made it worse...",2,14 June 2007,"On the surface, Idiocracy had all the right ingredients for a comedy that would be remembered by audience members who have commonality with its protagonist long after its release. Sort of like a Repo Man for the twenty-first century, to use a comparison. Unfortunately, however, the studio found reactions from test audiences to be underwhelming, and made drastic alterations in the hope of increasing its mass appeal. The problem is that instead of improving the film, this interference served to exacerbate the flaws that were already in the story. One clue that self-proclaimed intelligent viewers seem to miss is that the premise of the film is based in some very faulty assumptions regarding the nature of intelligence and intellectual development. For Mike Judge's story idea to work, Pauline and Hermann Einstein would have to have been extraordinary geniuses who were capable of turning the world on its head with new ideas regarding the laws that govern our universe. The same would need to be true of the Teslas, the Newtons... you get the idea.So when I say that Pauline and Hermann were just an average, ordinary couple who happened to raise a high-functioning autistic child who developed an intense, pervasive interest in theoretical physics, the fundamental flaw in Judge's idea is exposed. During the setup of Judge's future world, several assumptions are made about divisions in the human race for a start. IQs in Judge's world are either above the range we consider normal (above 120 for those who do not already know), or below that range (below 90). No middle ground exists in Judge's world, and this is unfortunate because the middle ground is exactly where the majority of interesting stories occur. Additionally, Judge makes the assumption that two parents of lower intelligence will necessarily produce a child of lower intelligence, or that a child of lower intelligence will not grow up to want a better life than the trailer trash that Judge seems to believe constitutes the entirety of the populace whose IQ can be measured in two digits.It should therefore come as no surprise that the only watchable parts of Idiocracy are those that take place in the year 2005. The world of 2005, although only seen through what a visualist might call a keyhole, shows so many more shades of grey than the imagined world of 2505 does in the entire remainder of the film. Not helping matters is how the world of 2505 begs so many questions about how the place is kept running, if not optimally then sufficiently for people to do business. I never thought I would be saying something positive about a Stanley Kubrick film, but in Dr. Strangelove, we are shown in rather horrifying terms how the world is the way it is because the best and brightest are in charge. The key element in how intelligence or simple aptitude (which are not the same thing) keeps our world going is not the actions of those at the top of the curve, but the gulf between them and the average citizen. As is said so brilliantly in Caddyshack, the world needs ditch-diggers, too. But Judge seems unable to guess what would happen without the scientists.Historians will tell you that the best way to predict what happens in a future situation is to look at things that have happened in the past. A society that becomes complacent and stagnant will eventually fall into ruin and be erased by a more optimal or ideally-positioned society. To put it less baldly, the world has a way of righting itself when things get too out of balance. Historians familiar with the Spain that Christopher Columbus left behind on the fateful trip that ended in the Americas will know that humanity is a doomed species without medical care and research. In a world with garbage piles so huge as to provoke avalanches, and doctors who cannot even form a coherent sentence in their native language, mankind is literally target practice for every virus known or unknown. That the human race could have survived like this for more than fifty years without getting a rude wake-up call is perplexing even to those who have not memorised the contents of Paradise Lost.And this is the big problem for Idiocracy. In attempting to create a story about the rule of the stupid, Mike Judge finds himself resorting to exaggeration to an extent that turns his commentary into an insult to the intelligence of the audience. The word satire is absent from many descriptions of Idiocracy, and with good reason. A satire usually has something to say about its subject, and a good satire says it without being terribly obvious. Idiocracy throws so many obvious jokes at the screen in an attempt to get the audience to laugh by rote that it just leaves the intelligent viewer dumbfounded. The hypocrisy inherent in dumbing down a comedy about dumbing down for mass consumption, for mass consumption, might strike people as ironic. Unfortunately, it would take a radically different edit of Idiocracy to convince me that the man who created it was not, to use George Clooney's classic line from a much better comedy, dumber than a bag of hammers. The material is literally that idiotic.Hence, I gave Idiocracy a two out of ten. As a human being who has higher aspiration and divergent thought hardwired into his brain, I find it insulting. That should tell you everything you need to know about how well it accomplished its storytelling goals.",Idiocracy
61,thekarmicnomad,Like being punched in the brain,3,16 August 2008,"This is a small budget Mike Judge film (who we all know and love) making a light hearted statement on how stupid we are all becoming, concentrating mainly on the MTV nation. At first it seemed quite daring and exciting for Mike to take a bite from the hand that has fed him for so long. But it was not to be. The film is actually written for the moron audience it is trying to mock. An annoying narrative runs through the entire film with tedious exposition. At one point it actually explains to the viewer why you can't grow ""flowers"" in a glass of coke. The humour, rather than lampooning people of diminished intellect, is actually aimed at them. There are a few chuckles at exaggerated points of modern day pop culture but after about twenty minutes in, the film suggests it is cool to be a complete idiot and anyone who thinks otherwise should sit back, take a chill pill, chase it with a bottle of bleach and become one of the trendy mindless hordes. The concept is excellent and there are some clever ideas and some funny scenes, but the whole affair is just pretty silly. A weak plot line about the main characters decision to take the reins of his loser existence is clumsy and inconsequential. Some token middle weight actors appear, the production is low budget (never been a problem for Mike before in the past) and surprisingly the sound track is also rather poor. Plot and dialogue are negligibleSome people have commented that this film is very clever and you need to look below the surface to see what is actually happening. Maybe this is true and perhaps it is my failing in not seeing this. But that is like putting yourself through 2 hours of electro-shock therapy to build an opinion on the evils of torture.

62,Andy-296,Dystopic comedy is only mildly funny,6,25 March 2007,"Mike Judge's dystopic comedy (which was barely released by its studio) is only mildly funny. It opens in the present, with average guy Joe (Luke Wilson) drafted by the military for a hibernation project. He is supposed to wake up in a year, but because of a mishap, he wakes up 500 years from the present. There he finds a society populated by morons. It seems that the intelligent didn't breed as much as the unintelligent, and the result five centuries from now is a society of astonishing vulgarity and coarseness, in a state of terminal decline. Here one has to add that the scientific premise behind this conceit is shaky: thinkers have noted and worried for centuries that the poor and unintelligent are having more babies than the rich and intelligent. Yet, despite this, IQ scores throughout the world have gone up, a probable result of increased education (and a refutation of genetic determinism). The movie is also somewhat racist: is it supposed to be a sign of decline the fact that the US president is now a black with a hispanic surname?. The movie's better when it hits at the corporate world, who has taken over every aspect of this future society. All in all, an ambitious but not very accomplished movie.",Idiocracy
63,MrGKB,Mildly amusing satire of American culture...,6,26 June 2009,"...on a broad, comic-booky level, Mike ""Beavis and Butthead"" Judge's ""Idiocracy"" certainly generates laughs despite the absurdity of its premise. Said premise involves a Joe Six-pack (Luke ""Bottle Rocket"" Wilson) and a vaguely ethnic bimbo (Maya ""SNL"" Rudolph) being dumped 500 years into the future via experimental hibernation, only to find themselves in a world that has intellectually devolved into a society of imbeciles. Never mind that such a world could never exist (at least as portrayed); ""Idiocracy"" manages to skewer a wide sampling of contemporary low-brow American culture: slavish narcissism and self-indulgence and the corporate exploitation of same; the cult of personality; LCD entertainment and the denigration of genuine intelligence; homophobia and other bigotries (although interestingly, racism and xenophobia are studiously avoided), a fascination with sex and bodily excretions and various other illustrations of the prototypical American dullard. Almost none of this nonsense is laugh-out-loud funny, but various gags provoke at least a grin or two and a nod of recognition. Most of the targets of derision are too obvious to provoke any real thought; perhaps this was Judge's intent all along, and begs the question of just how stupid he and co-writer, Etan ""Tropic Thunder"" Cohen, think their probable audience really is, or conversely, just how smugly elitist. Production values are quite good, as is Tim ""Suburbia"" Suhrstedt's DP work. All in all, ""Idiocracy"" is a tolerable timeburn, but you won't be any stupider from missing it.

Wilson, as Joe Bauers, finds himself the only inhabitant who questions anything and these ridiculous and mostly very stupid questions are the main thrust of the comedy element.Director Mike Judge (Beavis & Butt-Head, Office Space) takes a clever satirical swipe at so many things that potentially plague both us and our planet and by dumbing them down to a broad, bordering on moronic level, makes them even more pertinent - and hilarious. For those like me who don't much like Beavis & Butt-head, it's fortunate that none of the characters here are not too obnoxious.As you can imagine, Joe's hesitant suggestion that perhaps the crops required water and not Gatorade (""What, toilet liquid??"") could make him the saviour to this whole eco-structure and civilisation. That, from a soldier of very average intelligence to one of the great thinkers of the New World 500 years later is a great premise, if it's fleshed out properly.Employing loads of visual gags amongst clever and fairly convincing CGI'd sci-fi scenes, plus quite a lot of dumb, but not (too) offensive swearing, Judge includes just about enough material to see it through. To my mind, it's best seen as a comedy, with science fiction satire as its theme and not the other way around. Laugh out loud at the funny bits, ride over the few that aren't and just enjoy it.

The premise is that intelligent people (those with an IQ above an amoeba) don't procreate as much as those who live in trailer parks, have questionable dental hygiene, and believe the height of entertainment is watching a monster truck rally.The stars are Luke Wilson as Private Joe Bowers and Maya Rudolph as Rita. Joe is average. So average that the military decides to pull him from his job (doing nothing) and inter him in a cryogenic coffin for one year as a test to see how far they've come with freezing people. They also need a female to round out the study so pull a prostitute named Rita from the streets and put her in a cryo-coffin next to Joe. Supposedly they're to be reawakened in one year. But the leader of the project is arrested and the project forgotten. The building where Joe and Maya lay cryo-sleeping is bulldozed, and their resting places vanish.Fast-forward 1,000 years and we find a massive garbage pile that suddenly falls, causing a landslide. Joe's coffin is ejected from the heap and he quickly wakes up. What he discovers is a society so dumbed-down that he's the smartest person on the planet (he's the only one who knows that watering plants causes them to grow). Maya's coffin reopens, too, and she returns to plying her trade but discovers she no longer needs to spread her legs, as only promising to do so gets her money.Joe is later elevated to the position of Vice-President of the United States (and eventually President), and he has to make the tough decision to stay 1,000 years in the future or to return to his own time via something called ""The Time Machine."" We later learn, too, that the time machine is simply a Disneyesque ride through a very jumbled and inaccurate world historical account.The premise definitely is intriguing, as some of what is touched upon can be seen in society already.

While the film is decidedly low-brow and filmed on a relatively small budget, this hilarious science fiction send-up is pretty much spot-on throughout it's fast running time, displaying a sharp eye for satirical commentary on the direction society is headed, in ways a cinematic equivalent to some of the animated show Futurama's cleverest moments. In a future far, far away mankind's breeding preferences have led to a world that has left much to be desired in the cranial capacity. Enter frozen everyman Luke Wilson, who actually makes his shtick work in this character's context as the brilliant human, unearthed after being m.i.a. for hundreds of years. Though the tone could definitely be interpreted as condescending, Mike Judge keeps things running smoothly enough to wipe away any pretensions the script may be hinting at. Only three movies into his career (counting his full-length Beavis and Butthead feature) and Judge continues to assert his unique wit, matched here only by the amount of clever sight gags. Yes the pacing and humor will get a tad repetitive by the final frame, but I couldn't really complain about something being repetitious in and of itself if it was based upon such fresh material as this futuristic farce.

So what was left to show in this motion picture if how society has been brought to such a level of stupidity and total lack of substance and intellect? What was left is simply to show a bunch of dumb people or as characters in the movie would say (about the only way they can express things), ""dumb mother f*ckers"".It is as excruciating to see dumb mother f*ckers on screen as it is in real life.

Kornbluth's 1951 novella ""The Marching Morons"", about a man who is accidentally put into suspended animation and is brought out 500 years later, to find a messy Earth heavily overrun by moronic humans while a comparatively small group of human geniuses is busy trying to hold society together. The reason things got that way because the dumber people were having most of the babies while the smart ones were having fewer.The same idea is brought up here, with an Army private and a prostitute being used for an experiment where they are purposely put into suspended animation. But in this case, the experiment goes awry and they end up waking 500 years into the future, being accidentally revived by a garbage tsunami. The world is futuristic but decaying and full of huge amounts of garbage, and there are no human geniuses, only highly advanced technology and computer programs that the humans are barely able to use. Corporations are now very powerful-but it matters little because the whole world is so messy anyway, with humans unable to grow their own food.The future humans are vacuous and naive and speak very slowly, and the sudden presence of the private and the prostitute knocks them for a loop-especially when they are smarter than everyone else in the world. There is mention of a ""time machine""...but how do they get back to it to return to their own time? And perhaps they might even be able to solve the mess humanity is currently in? The satire is too broad to have a real impact. The stupid people enjoy very lowbrow entertainment and consume unhealthy food, and assume plants need Gatorade and not water because water is used for toilets and plants need minerals-which is why the plants aren't growing.Why didn't this film get promoted? Quite probably because of the movie's implication that people who enjoy lowbrow entertainment and aren't highly educated are inherently stupid. The truth of course is that some highly educated people really do like lowbrow entertainment, and even geniuses can be stupid and imperceptive. Just ask Robert MacNamara, the boy wonder...and inventor of the Ford Edsel, a high-tech car that proved to be an expensive design failure.",Idiocracy
77,DonFishies,A social satire that is more wishy-washy than it is satirical,6,6 July 2007,"Right from the start, I knew I was not going to like Idiocracy that much. Yes, I have watched a lot of Mike Judge's previous work, but the idea behind Idiocracy seemed like nothing but a one-note joke I doubted he could hold for the entirety of the eighty-plus minute runtime. Sadly, I was right, but only to a point.In what could be considered a brilliant military experiment, Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson), a very average American, is selected for a hibernation program in hopes that he will survive and remain intact for a year. Along with the prostitute and again, average, Rita (Maya Rudolph), both are put to sleep. But through a series of events, they are both forgotten about, and stay sleeping for five hundred years. But a lot has changed in those years, and how Joe just may be the smartest man on the planet.Idiocracy should have felt original in its concept. A prophetic prediction for the future, Judge outlines the idea of everyone getting a whole lot dumber, and the acceptance levels for just about everything to go totally out of whack. And while some of the plot devices he uses have already come true (such as shortened words and an abundance of slang), a lot of the things he brings in have already been used in other works.Throughout the entire opening of Joe and Rita's hibernation and waking up in the very far future, I kept thinking of Futurama (and that was not an all too original idea even when that first came out). When the character of Frito (Dax Shepard) is watching the ""Ow! My Balls!"", I envisioned the likes of The Simpsons, Family Guy and just about anything else in the last ten years where a central joke was a man getting hit by an object inbetween his legs. What should have been fresh material for what could be a brilliant social satire, felt stale and rehashed. If he wanted to make an effective statement about the times, should he not have used some new material? Would that not have been the logical thing to do? Yes, there are a few small touches here and there (one that comes to mind is the love seat that is also a toilet), but they are few and far between the recycled material.What is also a little disheartening is the story in general. It just feels half-baked. I was never the greatest Office Space fan, but it had a story (one that was wildly random nonetheless), and the story was decent enough for the film to go from beginning to end with relative ease. Here, it just seems like that one-note idea was just that, and more than a little bit of padding had to be added to make it feature-length. The first little bit with Joe getting used to everything was alright, but everything that leads out of that specifically, feels weakened because of its obvious making-stuff-up-as-we-go style film-making. It is nowhere near as strong as those original moments, and becomes downright boring in a lot of cases. If it is good for anything, it is to further perpetuate the idea of the film being a dull joke that never got totally off the ground.And of course, the film is littered with plot holes, only further making the original idea continue to become worse and ill planned than it originally intended.Wilson is painfully boring and uninspired in his role. I realize he is supposed to be average, but the dullness and lack of enthusiasm he displays in almost every scene is almost inexcusable. He just does not look like he is even attempting to try with the material, and does not seem to get the joke about him being so average. I realize some may say he plays the average role to perfection, but the zest needed to make his character truly alive and three-dimensional, is entirely missing from every scene he graces. I just wish he was nearly as good in movies like these as he is in Wes Anderson flicks (and even that broadly dull comedy is a whole lot funnier than this social satire).Rudolph and Shepard seem to be playing their roles very well, but suffer from never taking the role past its limits. Never did I truly believe Shepard was as dim-witted and moronic as his character sets out to be. He looked the part, but really did not act like it at all. Rudolph looked truly confused most of the time, but again, I think this is more of an issue of not quite getting the jokes being brought up throughout the film. Small turns from recognizable cast members will either make you giggle, and leave you with a rotten feeling in your stomach. They all look and sound like they are just reading from the pages of Judge's screenplay, and not doing much at all with the words.For its many issues, Idiocracy is watchable. When the satire is turned on and is working, it feels incredibly realistic and slightly frightening in what it is suggesting. But when it is off, and is merely attempting to make statements, it falls flat on its face. Judge knows what he is doing here, and I am disappointed to say, but he just does not seem to know what statements he wants to make, and whether or not he should even bother making them in the first place. It is very wishy-washy in what it wants to accomplish, and the film suffers as a result of that. But hey, for a movie about idiots and averages, should I really have expected something truly worthwhile and predictive of the future? 6/10.",Idiocracy
78,gigan-92,"""Years passed and mankind became stupider at a frightening rate.""",10,23 May 2012,"I LOVE this movie. One of my all-time favorite comedies and one of those rare few that I find startlingly relevant. A world where sex is everywhere, illiteracy runs amok, plants are watered with sport drinks and farting buttocks wins awards for best screenplay, and the story took place in the 26th century. To me however, it all seemed like a world not too far away, especially for dear old America. Sh*t, scrap the 2500s, I see this happening in roughly a century or two. Maybe I'm cynical, so I've been told numerous times, but I see the signs all around me. If not already convinced, after watching this movie you soon will be.Leading this charming satire on the human race are the likes of Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph, Terry Crews, Dax Shepard, and Justin Long.

79,Imdbidia,Substance wrapped in confetti,7,1 May 2017,"Idiocracy is a very funny movie, really hilarious at times, that depicts a near future where people and society have involved into a bunch of brainwashed illiterate idiots. The settings are a bit theatrical but it really works well to showcase the story. The dialogues, play of words, and the items of misspelling are really funny.Despite the fun and the silliness, Idiocracy is a metaphor of our modern world, of where our modern world is heading to, and a very clever critique of the exaltation and institutionalisation of idiocy, money over education and skills, and the proliferation of rudeness and bad manners as the new normal way of being.Luke Wilson is always great a playing ridiculous characters with conviction, and this is the case also here. Terry Crews makes a hilarious president, Dax Sheperd plays the perfect good-hearted idiot, and Maya Rudolf is very sweet as the naughty 'painter'. Overall, the cast is very good and they all contribute to the film being so enjoyable.This movie is totally unpretentious and very funny, but with a very serious important embedded message if you bother to scratch underneath the silly surface.",Idiocracy

One watches this sort of Mike Judge film not primarily for the social commentary and dystopian future setting, but to laugh.I think Mike Judge was looking to make this film highly accessible, easy to process, obvious in its meaning and message... and focused more on the typical Hollywood structure and pace as opposed to making a true masterpiece as he probably would've liked.6.5/10.",Idiocracy
82,dfle3,Interesting comedy on where humanity is heading,6,3 July 2008,"Found out about this straight to DVD release via The Movie Show (Australian TV show) where the reviewer recommended it.This movie is perhaps a symptom of a middle-class fear that poor people will inherit the earth because they will out breed them!In it, army slacker Joe Bauers is used as a guinea pig to test a process for freezing America's best soldiers (the military doesn't want to risk freezing good fighters without knowing if the process works or not). The intent is to unfreeze the soldiers for a time of emergency in the future.Things go wrong, fortunately, for the purposes of plot development.Bauers unfreezes many centuries into the future along with a woman who is also part of the experiment.They find themselves in a time where, despite their average intellect, they are the smartest people on the planet!Despite sounding like this could be real ""Beavis and Butthead"" territory (archetypally stupid cartoon characters), this movie does have a surprising level of sophistication. It does critique elements of modern society by setting it in the future-from television programming to corporate advertising claims or just the influence of corporations in society.This movie actually made me want more-I was quite engaged by a plot line concerning failing crops and was hoping for more of the same with different topics.I did have a handful of good chuckles in this movie but the rest of it kept me engaged and interested. Sometimes you have to look closely to spot the jokes...like paying attention to the ad for ""The Masturbation Network""!Also, this movie has a post end-credits sequence, so you might want to keep an eye out for that.One of the reasons to watch this movie is also its imagining of a future civilisation.

However, I wouldn't want to review it as such, since that would be boring  and I am quite certain it's a brilliant satire, if that makes any sense. Too many satires are dismissed as being exactly what they satirize (Natural Born Killers mistaken to be too ""violent"" just makes me shake my head). ""Idiocracy"" is so dumb to the core in its humour that at one point I just realised this HAD to be a satire  of studios, contemporary society and trailer trash culture.The basic set-up caught my attention the minute the universal logo appeared and a narrator explained the Darwinism-gone-wrong process that prompted a world filled with idiots. Survival of the fittest has never implied survival of the smartest; it is simply a question of who procreates at the most rapid speed. In humans, this is typically the below average intelligent people such as rednecks, the less educated, trashy celebrities, et al, and as a result  over many generations  the intelligent alleles have all been replaced by dumb ones.There is satire even in this. Too many films employ narrators who explain absolutely everything even when it is already clear to the viewer. The new idiocratic world speaks a language that is derived from Valley girl speech, inner city slang and slack-jawed hillbilly. Starbucks has become synonymous with handjobs. In all seriousness, if you thought Blade Runner, Children of Men or other bleak Orwellian science fictions showed terrifying visions of the future, you are in for one hell of a nightmare. The scariest thing is that it could theoretically happen, and to an extent this natural selection process is already occurring in our species.It is in a way a pity that Fox orphaned this project, no trailers, no nothing, for that just displays their misunderstanding of the film's nature. Although I didn't find ""Idiocracy"" to be hugely entertaining, it moved so earnestly at such a brisk and condensed pace that ultimately it is an altogether harmless film.6 out of 10",Idiocracy

To be fair, Idiocracy did not have much of a theater run so it attained cult status a little later in life.Luke Wilson stars as an ordinary Joe who gets transported into the future where he becomes the smartest person on Earth because everyone gets dumber.The film satirizes our worsening media consumption habits, corporate sponsorship and are lowering nutritional standards (before the Michelle Obama era) among other things. Some of the humor's a little broad and there's a lot of weird genital humor (a restaurant called butt-munchers, for example). Some of the broad humor is so shockingly out there, it goes from overplayed to good again. Case in point: Stephen Root's judge character declaring the protagonist guilty because he talks gay is pretty 3rd grade but it's so over the top and its conception is so random, that it works surprisingly well.On top of that, much of the satire is just very clever and on point. Luke Wilson taking an IQ test and being placed as a cabinet level position alongside dumb people who got where they are through nepotism and other ridiculous reasons is just hilarious.There are some surprisingly good comic performances.

They are forgotten about after a regrettable turn of events and wake up 500 years later, to a world significantly dumber than it has ever been! It's a great premise and one that really delivers with Judge's trademark comedy lighting up the screen! The only downside to it is that there is perhaps a bit too much crass humour thrown in too, which is justified due to the point it's making and puts you completely in Joe's position trying to make sense out of everyone around him. So it's hardly a fault of the film as that's the characters it's depicting, but I couldn't help feel annoyed at points. Nevertheless, the majority is still really fun, doesn't take itself too seriously and Wilson's reactions are hilarious!

And the Extinction of Intelligence in the Species  a satirical anthropological ""what if""",9,30 January 2007,"After just seeing H6, I needed something to ""clean my palate"" of the gnawing thoughts in the back of my skull. Mike ""Bolton"" Judge; writer, producer and director of Bevis and Butthead and Office Space, provides a movie that is parodic at times (elements of Logan's Run, Planet of the Apes, the Last Man on Earth and the Omega Man permeates the story, while overtly sanctioning the ""consumerist zombie"" theory of George Romero). It is satirical and yet still funny the rest of the time. The difference is that previous views of the future of humankind are a bit more dignified than in this movie. The future was always a bright, gleaming beacon for the elevation of mankind (in some cases the humans themselves had not changed, yet technologically we were more advanced). This movie takes is the opposite way - a.k.a. the toilet. Humanity has degraded to stupidity and apathy on all possible levels. The movie functions on the level of the viewer, while at the same time functioning on all its levels as a whole. This is the multi-tiered mound of garbage. Hidden treasures are abound for those that dig deep enough and yet there's stuff at the top for the not-so-motivated.During the year 2005, the United States military conducted a secret project (""The Human Hibernation Experiment"" for short). This project consisted of hibernating a male and female for a period of one year. This was to be developed for the purpose of ""freezing"" our best troops so they can be freshly deployed where they would be needed. Obviously they would not use this on their best until it was tested. As the guinea pigs, they used the most average man in army, Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson) and a ""private sector"" female, Rita (SNL alumni Maya Rudolph). One intravenous injection of Yoo-Hoo later, while being packed into an army, green-fatigue, metal-looking coffin, they go to sleep expecting only a year to pass. In less than a year, the project is lost and forgotten, only to be accidentally discovered the same year as the Great Garbage Avalance of 2505.This is pure Philip J. Fry brought to live action. It is the same social criticism mixed with humor, character development and identification as you found from each and every episode of Futurama. It is a fish-out of water story where the fish looks more normal then the water (by contrast). Owen Wilson isn't quite Billy West, but he does a very good job a selling the likability of an average joe like Joe. There are some nice cameos in the movie including, the Apple guy (Justin Long), David Herman (from Office Space, Mad TV, and several voices on Futurama - Mayor C. Randall Poopenmayer, Professor Ogden Wernstrom, Turanga Morris, Larry , and Dwayne), Greg Pitts (the Oooohhh !! guy from Office Space), Scarface from Geto Boys (a pimp named Upgrayedd), Thomas Haden Church, and the pimped out and presidential Terry Crews (The President of the United States - Camacho).The movie is relatively fast paced and doesn't dwell too much on one theme. It is not an exhaustive study, if you choose to read it as such. At the same time there is enough detail to warrant a serious critique. Its ending is light hearted and positive and I think is the major detriment to the movie. The premise is at the same time ridiculously ludicrous and at the same time eerily possible. Another noteworthy instances would be the inclusion of President One tough-mother !! SHUT YOUR MOUTH !!! Its about damn time we had a black president. Sho'Nuff !! The genius of the Fat Museum is not lost on me either. OW ! My balls !! the TV show is pure genius. It makes American Idol seem like Tarkovsky, while reminiscent of the ""I'd Buy That for A Dollar"" TV show from Robocop.

99,pkpera,This is satyre in first place - I need to update my review this 'corona' days,9,20 December 2018,"Movie is scary, or maybe better to say was scary with many of what presented.
But I must say now, at March 29 2020, that we already gone lower in many things. What I experienced last 3 weeks is so painful inability of officials to perform even very simple things at decent level. Starting at composing proper regulations, in good understandable and not misleading text. Health care system and doctors, their bureocrats - they made me much sicker than I was.
And I could continue. The point is: what was presented in Idiocracy was so small scale bad. What we go through now is lethal, leads in economic disaster. Today they talked first time about hunger what we should expect, and is already present in Southern Italy. And to finish this - some already talked about some medicaments, recently developed, which can help against coronavirus.
Did not say that will cure it, but will make it easier to recovery. And they will not export from it at all - 'our citizens are our priority'. Sure, those with lot of money - what to expect except it will be expensive. And that it had practically 0 effect ? Sorry, we can not predict everything ...Listed as adventure, comedy, sci-fi . Sure, there is all it in, but this is actually just our present - now, in 2018 much closer to 2500, and not in year count, but in what is point of movie - idiocy .About half of screentime is just overdone in purpose presentation of today's 'mass culture' - what can watch on TV, see on streets in form of advertisements and like ... And not only in USA . I always hate when going in supermarket to hear their own laud and primitive advertisements, always finished with company name said bombastically. While there are so many not attractive things to see - employees in bad mood, unfriendly workers at cache desk, counter. Lot of money spent on advertisements, while there are so many things distracting potential buyers, customers. Can say same for cellar phone offices.Lot of overdone toilet humor - and what I see here - some complain about how that was not in good taste. Is showing that idiots have no good taste a bad taste ?
Yeah, idiocracy is already here, in many heads.Ending was little cheesy, not really inventive. That's why I give it 9. Indeed scarier than any zombie movie. Luke Wilson's another smart screenplay choice - in both meanings :-)",Idiocracy
100,michaelradny,Idiot,7,17 August 2015,"Idiocracy is something that you know what it will be and when you see it, in this aspect, you aren't let down. But the problem lies in that you know how the film will pan out, every thing from the humour to the story, unfortunately there's nothing unexpected that makes this good. It's a very predictable film, in fact it probably is the most predictable, but despite the potty humour and the annoyingly dumb characters, Idiocracy doesn't arrive to be anything it's not, so hats off to that. Nothing groundbreaking, funny at times, entertaining at times. Just turn your brain off and enjoy the strangeness of this film. However, this is quite possibly the most accurate and terrifying view of what the human race could evolve into, so it does have that weird aspect of that as well.",Idiocracy
101,D_Burke,"Sometimes misses it's mark, but is overall unforgettable",6,1 January 2008,"I saw this film back in May when it was released directly to video. It was admittedly surprising that it didn't receive a theatrical release, not only because of it's A-List leading man Luke Wilson, but also because of the usual cult following of Mike Judge. Judge has made a name for himself as director of ""Beavis & Butt-Head Do America"" and ""Office Space"", and would no doubt have attracted a bigger following with this movie had it been released in theaters.I'll admit when I first saw this movie, I absolutely hated it. It's not because I thought the premise was bad. If anything, I thought the movie echoed ""Forever Young"" (1992), and has the same farsical concerns about the future as the novels ""Farenheit 451"" by Ray Bradbury, ""Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley, and ""The Time Machine"" by H.G. Wells.Truth be told, the movie at first didn't strike me as funny. It appeared to me at first to be the same mashing of fart jokes, tiresome kick-in-the-crotch/hit-in-the-head humor, and increasingly outdated homophobic jokes that constituted ""Scary Movie 4"", ""Date Movie"", and ""Epic Movie"". I still stand by the fact that these jokes tended to go a little too overboard in scenes, almost hammering the point of this movie in too often. Plus, I thought it extremely hypocritical for the creator of ""Beavis & Butt-Head"" to accuse Americans of being dumbed down by mindless media.However, ""Beavis & Butt-Head"", like this movie, is intended as a farce. Plus, the movie suggests that the eventual spread of obtuseness is caused primarily by the uneducated ""redneck"" archetypes reproducing (sometimes with each other's relatives), while many smart people (with PhD's and other advanced education) hold off on having children until they find they missed their mark. I thought that point was well made in the beginning of the movie.More good things about the movie include the performances of Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph. Wilson plays the part of the reluctant average guy as well as he does in other movies, and it's hilarious how he becomes a sane man in an increasingly insane world. This part could have been played by a satirical, angrier comedian like George Carlin, Chris Rock, or Jason Lee, who expressed their astonishment at a world gone completely wrong. But Wilson does a pretty good job given what he has to work with.Rudolph is also great in this movie, and is truly one of the most talented comediennes to come off of ""Saturday Night Live"". She has the unfortunate disadvantage of being part of the least funny SNL period in a decade, but she's nonetheless an excellent character actress who shines in this movie.The movie's take on politics is also sharp and ambitious, as Terry Crews (who has had his share of bad movies, but is nonetheless, like Rudolph, a very good character actor) demonstrates as the President who was elected not for his intelligence, but for his entertainment credentials. It sort of reminds you of our current president.Overall, the movie tries too hard to push the humor in some areas, but is a witty satire nonetheless. I wish the movie could have made up its mind which audience they wanted to appeal to, but I give it a mild recommendation.",Idiocracy
102,TheCorniestLemur,I mean...could happen,7,7 February 2021,"Quite pleasantly surprised by this, I was expecting a more typical cringey 2000s comedy, but maaaaan has this aged like a fine wine...aside from some things you couldn't really get away with saying anymore.It's a classic example of a film that's really clever in its stupidity, because while a lot of the humour is really stupid (although the opening scene and the cop with the rocket launcher made me absolutely howl), there is a point to it, and I definitely like that point. And yes, roughly half of America is turning into most of the characters in this film, it's an obvious observation, so who's to say it wasn't an accurate point as well?All the performances are pretty great, even if it's not really a film that asks for much out of its actors, although it really is crying out for a better director. There's hardly any variety in the shots or editing, and that's a real shame because it's a concept I would really love to see someone like the Coen brothers or Edgar Wright have a shot at.And let's not beat around the bush, the effects are terrible.I guess I would have also liked to see a bit more of a character arc from Joe, because the film feels structured perfectly for one, but all it really amounts to is him acknowledging the role he might have played in making the future the way it is towards the end and not really much else.But, you know, it's always nice seeing a film that still feels prescient today, like I've mentioned before, and considering the fact that it actually made me laugh a good few times, it wasn't a constant problem that the direction could have been a lot better. It is a constant problem that this could be being set in motion already, however, so if you're smart and you're reading this, please reconsider having those kids, it's bad enough just reading about the daily exploits of the Disunited States.",Idiocracy

Certainly not one that'll have you in stitches or rolling on the floor, but then I don't think it ever pretended to be that or set itself up in that way.Whilst the idea was executed in an amusing plot, I'm sure there was a tinge of seriousness from the writers & those concerned, and used the extremities in here to evoke a message of how dumbed down society has become and that we are heading in exactly the direction of this film, just nowhere near to the extent it makes out.There was a wealth of plot available with a premise such as in Idiocracy so it was easy to be left with the opinion that the substance was a little light. There were parts of the plot and some of the characters that gave the impression of the film still being in a draft stage rather than a finished version, but all in all still a very good effort, I'd recommend it to anyone. There isn't anything to not like about it, so I fail to see how people can get that worked up about it. The rating is at least 1/10 beneath where it should be.",Idiocracy

Luke Wilson (""Old School"") and Maya Rudolph (""Away We Go"") play subjects of a military experiment gone wrong who find themselves waking up in the year 2505, when mankind has devolved to the point of uselessness and near-extinction, brought on by needless over-breeding, poor dietary choices and mind-numbing television. Wilson plays the slacker and Rudolph a prostitute, and both turn out to be the strongest and smartest in a world gone terribly, terribly wrong.""Idiocracy"" is the kind of wacky yet centered cautionary tale that only the mind of Mike Judge could produce, but unfortunately loses steam half way through when its narrative is given nowhere to go, giving way to a slightly clichéd Hollywood ending that doesn't quite gel with the overall tone of the rest of the movie. It's a shame that the film bogs itself down in simplicity when much of the material at hand is rife with social commentary and oh-so subtle jabs at its viewer as well as its production company, Twentieth Century Fox (who, in turn, abused the film so badly that it was an inevitable flop). There's heavy usage of CGI to convey a trash avalanche as well as a monster-truck jam of sorts that gives the movie an unintentionally cartoonish look and feel. Surprisingly, though, it works in the film's favor, giving the film a wacky tone when it could easily slide into gloomier territory. It also doesn't hurt to have left-field cameos from the likes of Justin Long, Stephen Root and Thomas Haden Church, either.In the end, it's a film with bold ideas that doesn't quite reach its potential. Still, though, like much of Judge's other work, it will have you thinking and questioning the world around you. Is ""Idiocracy"" ahead of the curve, foreshadowing the shape of things to come? Well, only time will tell. As for now, enjoy it for the sublimely ridiculous comedy that it is.",Idiocracy
106,son_of_cheese_messiah,"Great ideas, lacking in execution",6,25 April 2011,"This is a very timely comedy considering the dumbed down nature of western humanity. A general gripe would be that it would not take 500 years to get to this world, we are virtually there now. Case in point: this 2006 film predicts a movie called Ass would win best screenplay at the Oscars, the same year the abysmal Little Miss Sunshine wins that category at the Oscars. Although this has many genuinely funny moments (rare in modern films) it is lacking in some departments. The production values are not high and a lot of the sets look cheap. The voice over seems a rather weak device too. And the story does develop in a rather conventional and altogether predictable way. Still so many of the concepts are hilarious and frighteningly close to realisation. I particularly liked the president having to read the word ""shit"" off an Autocue (a sly dig at Obama no doubt) and the chair cum toilet, but many other ideas are delightful.",Idiocracy

108,manuelasaez,This would have been so much more effective as an animated film...,4,29 March 2016,"I sat through this unfunny and unspectacular movie simply because of how absurd it was. Everyone was talking about how it was a reflection of the road humanity was taking, and in a sense, it couldn't be farther from the truth. Do people really think that if only the idiots survived that the planet would still function in any conceivable way? To me, this movie is more of a criticism on the idiots who sit and watch these types of movies, complaining about the morons in society, yet do nothing about it. The armchair activists and the keyboard warriors; YOU are the reason why society will fall, because you do NOTHING. This movie fails because it was presented in the wrong cinematic format and was so amazingly unfunny it was cringe-worthy, but it did leave one lasting impression, for me at least. Humanity will not fall into idiocy simply because stupid people choose to procreate while the intelligent no longer feel the need to have children anymore. Many intelligent people see the world around them devolving into liberal bu!!s#!T, with people who complain about everything yet do nothing about it, and many of them will just ultimately say, ""Screw it. I just don't care enough anymore"". That will truly be society's downfall. This movie is ultimately criticizing the morons that sit behind their computer screens and complain about the world not being politically correct enough, and no longer allowing true debate and progress from taking place. It should have been an animated film, and it should have been serious. It fails as a comedy, and as social commentary, but as a biting critique on armchair warriors, it succeeds with flying colors.",Idiocracy

If you can get past this first not very plausible fact, that no one else would know about the experiment, or if they did would just forget about the 2 frozen people, then you are in for quite a surprise. What this movie really is about is how our society is dumbing down, and does so in an entertaining manner. A quick glance at any newspaper or newscast will tell you the same thing. The movie is a social commentary, and maybe a warning, to our society that we need to stop obsessing about the latest celebrity snafu or pregnancy, quit making heroes out of someone just because he/she can run fast or hit a ball, and basically stop rewarding mediocrity. It's a movie that pokes fun at all the Big Box stores, and what may actually be a foreshadowing of what is to come for our society if we keep allowing stupidity to go unchecked. The acting was okay, and there were some better moments, and some scenes could have been fleshed out a bit more, but maybe the point was that society cannot stay focused for more than a few seconds at a time on any single thing.

113,Jakealope,Good Intelligent Movie About the Dumbing Down of America,9,31 December 2008,"Like Beavis and Butthead, this movie mocks the people it aims at with the kind of slapstick, lowbrow humor it ridicules. I have to give Mike Judge kudos for daring to mock and insult his audience then making them love it. As you read from others, this movie got dumped, doomed for oblivion, with 0 publicity and marketing budget compared to over hyped dreck like ""88 Minutes"" or ""Step Brothers""/ There is nothing new about the observation that the stupid, both intellectually and morally, are out breeding the smart. And with free universal health care coming, this trend can only increase. And after eight years of Bush and the alleged, cool rational geniuses of the right like Laura Ingraham and Rush Limbaugh cheering every dumb ass, fascist hypocritical move Bushco made, it seems like good fortune telling. (For you cons, don't get me wrong. Pop culture, especially rap and MTV is pushing us there too at full sail, which this movie mocks like his Beavis and Butthead did.) The future is funny and depressing at the same time. A wasteland of wrecked infrastructure and cheesy fast food outlets and (Democratic free health care) hospitals run by the tail end of the bell curve denizens. Being a man from the past, Joe Bauers, Mister Average IQ of 100 unambitious military lifer, is now the smartest man alive in the future after a top secret military experiment goes wrong. He is persecuted, maligned then becomes the top dog in USA of 2505, after he figures out the crops are failing cause they are being watered with Gatorade, not plain old water.Okay, the plot and action are not terribly complicated but the satire and futuristic behavior of a nation of Beavis and Butthead couch potatoes puts it leagues ahead of the average comedy, like Zohan.

Just imagine for a moment: A futuristic world that is populated on a global-scale, by people who have the IQ's of 70 or lower and the endless array of challenges (of being that stupid) that would create. Once you've imagined that, you've taken your first step into the world of Idiocracy, a world of astonishing stupidity and unceasing lunacy, this is the main gist behind this riotous and vastly under-rated comedy; combined with the awkwardness one would expect to experience in such a world, upon waking from a centuries old slumber. In Idiocracy's case it's a man named Joe who lives out this waking, futuristic nightmare - and makes the best of it.....In the year 2006 the US government was experimenting with cryogenic-suspension and in order to complete their experiment they needed a test-subject. Enter Joe, the most average guy they could find to act as their human guinea pig and along for the ride comes his appointed ""mate"", a street-walker, named Rita. However, with this experiment ""something went terribly wrong"" and upon waking some 700 years later, Joe (and Rita) not surprisingly, finds the world to be a very different place. One such difference is that it's inhabited by millions of moron's (perhaps billions) and he encounters countless waves of stupid, degenerate, people of sub-normal intelligence who are effectively retarded. Now all of the sudden Joe (who was ""Joe average"" in his own time) finds himself to be smartest person in the world, which makes things even more complicated for him and his existence quickly becomes a troubled and challenging one and not necessarily by his own choice. Joe's only crime is the fact that he's much smarter then everyone else and it's his differences among the legions bumbling idiots that drive the story along, eventually Joe's misadventures lead him all the way to the White House and to the President - and in a certain and obvious way Idiocracy, ironically, proves to be: Phrophetic!Idiocracy is a highly effective comedy that's absolutely loaded with laughs and is a completely ridiculous madcap affair and is easily among the funniest movies I've ever had the pleasure of seeing.

Stories which made you care about whose ass it was and why it was farting."" Mike Judge has made works I've adored for years. I was an avid watcher of Beavis and Butt-head when that show was first aired on MTV. I found the humor in it when somebody sued because they claimed that kids in a trailer park were imitating the show, and it was not true. I found humor in King of the Hill, the more humanistic side of laughing at stupidity. You realize that stupid people are people too. I saw Office Space during its short and unimpressive run in theaters before people found it on video and took people to watch it for free since I worked at the theater.Now, I have to say that Mike Judge has become shrill.There is a difference between making fun of the idiots among us and mocking a generalized world of idiots. The former is a good way of holding a microscope to what the world is. The latter is an overly aloof form of exaggeration and snarky humor. And, the latter is Idiocracy.Idiocracy is a science fiction comedy where the most average man in the military, Joe (Luke Wilson), and a whore, Rita (Maya Rudolph), are frozen in time for 500 years to find that the world now consists only of morons. Due to the intelligent people's inability to breed prolifically and a lack of human predators, stupid people were allowed to spread the seed constantly, and eventually wiped out intelligent people. Now, Joe and Rita have to face a future which has been over corporatized and dumbed down on every level.In this future, Costco now sprawls for miles with a tram and wildlife. Sex and violence have taken over as prime entertainment. A movie called Ass, which is 90 minutes of some persons ass on screen farting, won 8 Oscars. Water has been replaced by Brawno, a Gatorade-esquire sports drink. And, language has devolved into a mix of all the low slangs.Unfortunately, Idiocracy is nothing but a pile of complaints and rantings coming off as no more insightful than your average teenage internet flamer on whatever newsgroup/community/message board you read. With almost no insight into what the source of the problems are, it is very aimless and rootless.However, some things just are downright funny. It isn't all a bad movie. It has moments of pure genius, like the Carl's Jr stand which criticizes you, or the avalanche of garbage. The opening scene ranting about the birth rate of idiots versus academics is worth the price of rental alone.But, it is kind of annoying watching a movie that say that everybody's dumb 100 times over and has no faith in humanity. On the other hand, it is just what some people need. A good swift kick in the nuts.B-",Idiocracy

122,imagiking,Idiocracy: Completely Misjudged,2,24 April 2011,"Rather a fan of Office Space, and at the constant brunt of an insistent friend's urges to make my way to this, I took the opportunity to watch Idiocracy on television when it appeared, despite a vague memory of being unimpressed at catching the start when I had seen it a number of years before.Testing out new cryogenic technology, the U.S. military enlists Corporal Joe Bauers and private citizen Rita to go into a year long hibernation. Following the abandonment of the facility containing the pair, they are forgotten and are only awoken after 500 years. With the global population having become unanimously stupid, Joe now boasts the world's highest IQ, and is turned to to fix the problems of the dystopian society.A social satire on the idiocy of modern American (primarily, though not exclusively) capitalist society from Mike Judge? What could go wrong? Well, the answer would appear to be just about everything, I'm sorry to say. For a film which purports to criticise the loss of intelligence in our current commercialist paradigm, Idiocracy is itself wholly stupid, idiotic, unintelligent, and downright dumb. Now, let's get a few things straight before we continue. I do realise that to effectively comment upon something, it is at times necessary to yourself resort to employing it. Would anyone dispute that This is Spinal Tap, despite iconically parodying the silliness of heavy metal culture, gave rise to a number of irony-free silly heavy metal concert tours from a very real and very silly heavy metal band? Certainly not. There is nothing wrong with becoming the subject of your discussion, indeed doing so is often necessary: would Unforgiven have functioned as well as a revisionist commentary upon the glamourlessness of violence in the western genre without portraying the violence of the western genre? An entirely rhetorical question. With Idiocracy, however, the situation is different. Judge employs idiotic characters and dialogue as well as lowest-common-denominator humour, but to what end? To show us the direction toward which our society is fast headed? Well yes, the character of Frito conveys this well, as do some of the circumstances in which Joe finds himself. But when we are shown a fast food chain eventually renamed to ""buttf*ckers"" (the asterisk is my addition), we are invited to laugh at it. Excuse me? Aren't we here to address the issue of stupidity in modern culture by examining an accentuated version thereof in a futuristic context? And yet the funniest thing the film— presumably, as one critical of stupidity, intended itself to be intelligent—can think to do is to have us laugh at how funny cheap profanity is. I just don't get it... The humour is lewd and crude, and relies heavily on profanity, sexual jokes, and exactly the things which characterise the dumbness of the society I assumed it to want to critique. Maybe it doesn't want to; maybe it really just wishes to provide cheap and stupid laughs. Either way, it fails to function entirely, neither amusing not satirising, just bemusing in its intentions.Apparently intended as a scathing criticism of society's stupidity, Idiocracy is itself exactly what it claims to dislike about our modern world. Completely misjudged, appallingly and bizarrely stupid, and with a hideously uninteresting narrative to boot, it makes the popular ""comedy"" of Apatow and his ilk look genius, and by golly gum is that saying something.",Idiocracy

The idiots take over and after 500 years, you're left with people who watch shows of people getting kicked in the balls, watch movies about asses, think drinks with electrolytes are good because... electrolytes, wear advertising on everything, make the lowest common denominator jokes, misspell everything... wait, I was trying to make a point about how absurd the movie is but, heck, it seems like present day.So yeah, the movie does take the dumbing down to an extreme, and I think where it didn't work for me was to the degree it did it. Mike Judge (the director and writer of this movie) did this *brilliantly* in Office Space, but it was just too much exaggeration in Idiocracy. Had it been more subtle, more directed, and more believable, I would have liked it much more as the concept is a great one.Idiocracy got to the point where it was no longer a remark about the dumbing down of society but just a bunch of stupid stuff. Again, Mike Judge's Office Space was a brilliant satire on office life so he could have done something equally brilliant in Idiocracy, but didn't. It's too bad.",Idiocracy

125,rhoda-9,Idiotic and not funny,1,10 October 2015,"The only sensitive and sensible thing I have ever heard of Fox doing was its withdrawal of this movie. I rented it on the basis of its rating here, and stopped watching after about 15 minutes--15 minutes of disgust and disbelief. The basic problem, of course, is to make the idiots sufficiently idiotic to be regarded as such by even the most intellectually challenged viewer. So we see a population of staring, mugging imbeciles, unable to concentrate on a topic or to understand it. What this results in is a lot of people whose behaviour is indistinguishable from that of the inhabitants of an asylum, so the movie encourages us to, in effect, laugh at the mentally ill. If the director was too idiotic to imagine the horror and denunciation it would cause all across the country, at least Fox wasn't.In line with the movie's desire to appeal to as wide (or low) an audience as possible, the jokes were all moronic. This is not so much a movie as an exercise in irony--ie, the director and audience, believing they are laughing at people to whom they are superior, when in fact they are laughing at a mirror.",Idiocracy

And Idiocracy gives us a look at our so called future. I somewhat agree on the movie's message, because every day we human beings are dumbing down, and who knows what we would be like 500 years from now. The idea of the movie is wonderful, however we see the writers wasting a brilliant chance, and that is how they wrote the film, and how there weren't many laugh out loud moments.Luke Wilson does his best playing his character, but I was still expecting more hilarious jokes. Idiocracy is not a bad film, it just did not meet my expectations.6.5/10",Idiocracy
127,Michael Kenmore,Funny movie ahead of its time but as depressing as Dr Strangelove in unvarnished truthfulness,7,11 February 2007,"I thought Mike Judge wouldn't make another live action movie as evidenced by his years-long Salinger/Malick-esquire absence from movie-making after the hilarious Office Space, but Mr. Judge rebounded with another better-than-direct to video comedy movie appropriately titled Idiocracy.But regrettably not as great as Office Space in terms of consistent bull's eye on belly laughs. The movie have worn out its welcome into the hour, although it's a mercifully short movie. Another half an hour and it would be intolerable.Ironically, Stanley Kubrick chose to make ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" run less than 90 minutes to keep the tolerance level even without losing steam and that film, while funny with satirical physical comedy and verbal jabs, is incredibly depressing and demoralizing to watch the subsequent times.Idiocracy had a terrible marketing campaign, no doubt owing to the studio's appalled contention with the film's brutal, no-holds-barred condemnation of corporate irresponsibility & degradation of culture & morals in pursuit of avarice & corrupted favors. Mike Judge and the production crew of the movie shouldn't feel betrayed, because Idiocracy have already attained a cult film status owing to the story's prophecy ahead of its time under the context of sardonic perception with barely concealed harsh tone of the sociopolitical & socioeconomic satire imagined by Samuel Pepys, Mark Twain or Jonathan Swift (yes, I read good old books, thank you very much).I will not regale the plot in further explanation, I leave that to other user reviews, except to say that Luke Wilson and the cast did a good job developing the characters' wide range of personality to convincing comedic effect.Idiocracy is an enjoyable movie to watch but preferably not with the persons you know to be less than smart and susceptible to belligerence at the drop of a hat or a matter of mere misunderstanding. They will probably take grave offense to the movie and complain about how unfunny it is when the satirical point have been made to expose the utter apathy and stupidity of the American public in general.I would go so far as to compare the satirical element of Idiocracy to the better episode of The Simpsons whereas the majority of the general public might prefer the trashy likes of Seth MacFarlane's double serving of numbing dumbness & low-brow vulgarity Family Guy & American Dad.Yes, Mike Judge was responsible for the infamy that is Beavis & Butthead which have dumbed down MTV-addicted children & adolescent teenagers considerably back in the early 90's (sometimes with tragic results) but he redeemed his creation with the riotously hilarious Beavis & Butthead Do America.Whatever happened to Beavis & Butthead Do Hollywood? Looks like the particular set of characters' fame have faded and doomed to the 90's ""Spike & Mike's Sick and Twisted Animations"" aesthetics.Idiocracy almost isn't a good movie owing to minor lame subplots and endless train of expositionary dialogue, not to mention hitting the point with the equivalent of a sledgehammer. Still, it's a funny movie courtesy of Luke Wilson and another woman trying to fight their way out of the dumb society by using their ""average"" intellectual prowess and end up meeting the bizarre array of dumber-than-dog characters.Good film overall. I hope Mike Judge makes another movie, he's a great talent to watch out for! Fox, while responsible for neglecting the film in theatrical release, have a winner on its hands due to DVD rental blockbuster status and word of mouth.Not recommended for those who watch the movies casually and tend to take things too seriously if it challenges their belief, no matter how true.*** out of four",Idiocracy

129,mgmax,Satire on exactly what the studio did to it,7,2 September 2006,"A lot of things in this futuristic satire are more theoretically funny than actually funny (though it does have some laugh-out-loud moments) but a lot of that is because it seems to have been cut by the studio to better appeal to exactly the idiots it's mocking. Many situations aren't allowed to develop, there's obvious overdubbing of expository material, and worst of all a narrator explains EVERYTHING (most of which needs no explanation), probably because some preview audience didn't understand what was going on. In other words, a movie about dumbing down has been... you guessed it.One hopes that a longer, better version of this comedy will eventually surface on DVD, and it will become the cult fave it deserves to be, but even in this mutilated and somewhat comic- spirit-diminished form it's one of the more memorable films of the year-- a screech of disgust against our culture and all the ways it's become trashified, stupidified and uglified in the name of appealing to the yahoos. I watched it right after Land of the Dead, George Romero's latest milking of the single idea that consumers = zombies, which is basically the same point Judge is making; yet where Romero's counterculture viewpoint (now zombies = underclass that needs to revolt against the rich) seems hopelessly out of date, Judge's take is fresh, dead-on and far more disturbing. Just listen to the yahoos in your movie audience whooping it up for President Camacho's State of the Union just like their counterparts on screen, and you'll know that we're all doomed.",Idiocracy

Even Dax Shepard and Justin Long had some funny roles in the movie.The world takes place 500 years from now and the world is extremely stupid. It's up to Joe (Luke Wilson) to make the world a better place with help from a hooker (Rudolph). I actually like this one a lot more than Office Space (just wasn't a huge fan but like Mike Judge.

The biggest problem is an absolute lack of chemistry between Joe ( Luke Wilson) and Rita ( Maya Rudolph), they do not even kiss ( not even once)). If you watch movies like 'Demolition Man'( Stallone and Bullock), and 'The Running Man' ( Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso), you get that. There is not even a bad guy like Simon or Killian, to root against. It is simply a bunch of stupid people who lack the IQ's of a dog. Spoilers ahead: the stupidest part is at the very end. when Joe becomes President of America and Rita becomes First Lady and although they have ""The World's Three Smartest Kids.""' The moronic VIce President had even more of ""The World's Stupidist Kids and they and their descendants will outnumber Joe and Rita's Decendands, which is exactly what caused the problems in the first place.,"" The quote at the very end was ""Joe did not save the World he just gave it a kickstart.""

135,Ana_Banana,"Scary comedy, realistic Sci-Fi",8,18 May 2008,"Definitely, Mike Judge has a voice of his own, and he's not afraid to use it! After 'Office Space' (one of my favorites), he took things to the next level and delivered here an even crueler satire of our Western-type, ""civilized"" society. Obviously, in a dystopia you're not supposed to be fully consistent in every detail, and this movie is not so, but the power of its central idea surpasses any minor flaws in its concept, realization, pace or characters.No wonder that 'Idiocracy' was in fact sabotaged through bad marketing, as it aims to some of the basic characteristics of nowadays consumerism/corporatism and of any hypocrite system. 'Planeta M' (Planet Of The Mediocre) by Ioan Grosan, a great satire with a similar premise, published as monthly episodes in the late 80's in Romania, has been interrupted by communist censorship for similar reasons. You laugh hard many times while watching 'Idiocracy', but you also get a strange inner feeling that some of the things around us could actually become more or less as described in the movie. The huge garbage avalanche is utterly hilarious in its monstrosity, though it's one of the most innocent jokes when compared to the roots of other apparently funny situations in the movie. A great film, and a must see for any human having at least a trace of self-respect. Try not to hunt after any real or imaginary flaws of this movie, but think of it as a 'Time Machine'-warning by a contemporary and wittier H. G. Wells. Well done, Mr. Judge!",Idiocracy

137,rogerdob,Funny but flawed movie-making,7,1 September 2006,"The premise of this movie is one of the best---the dumbing down of America. What the producers of this film project is very scary but seemingly very possible. People talk converse in street talk, ads are everywhere, corporations control everything, and people no longer have to think. I found the satire quite amusing and laughed quite a bit. However, I fear that the average teenager won't get it at all---they won't realize it is satire and will sit in their seats wondering why they should be laughing at those in the film that talk and act like they do. It was scary when we left the theater and we saw the kids outside acting very similar to the dumb Americans of the future as depicted in this film.The film was not the best film-making. The film was narrated a bit and then it stopped and then it would start again (always a bad sign that the director was unable to move the story along cinematically). Some of the story logic did not make sense and there were a few holes in the script. Nevertheless, the premise trumps the bad film-making in this case and I found it to be an enjoyable 80 minutes.",Idiocracy

The concept is also a fairly straightforward rip-off of Futurama so even that isn't original.It is, however, pretty good satire and a chilling picture of devolution in action. It is a fact that birth rates are declining in the West and that it is below average for above average people. We've already started down the path that could lead to the future depicted in this film.

As I discovered reading its trivia section, it has been ignored even in its own country, and after watching it I understand the reason why: it is totally political incorrect since the beginning, but when the viewer discovers who will be the president of the United States in the future then he/she realizes that it is not simple comedy.

140,andrewburgereviews,Exercise in frustration,4,6 June 2021,"In a very strange and especially worrying way, Mike Judge's ""Idiocracy"" sends its point across. Please, read books, learn, don't let us become this. You can start with this review.Another in the what-if category, ""Idiocracy"" points out that five Centuries from now on, the world will be dominated by subpar intelligent people for the simple reason they reproduce faster. The first shot is of a couple who are way into the 3-digit IQ's and are overthinking whether they should have a child in this ""economic climate"" and not soon after we are told the husband died to add to the pile. Antithetically, 2-digit IQ's are spreading in more ways than one.Of course, it annoys me that ""Idiocracy"" limits intelligence to how high your IQ is, but the point is clear and blunt. The post-apocalyptic world it creates is as scary as it is impressive in its design. This garbage-addled realm of infinite pollution and urban decay all-covered in cheap commercial-inspired graffiti and cyberpunk machines is where Private Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson) wakes up to after being subdued to a top-secret government hibernation program and being forgotten.It's quite the shock to comprehend a reality in which everyone you ever known it's long gone but that's where ""Idiocracy's"" insight stops. What follows is a run-of-the-mill adventure whose details--really--are irrelevant. The movie quickly gets its point out of the way and for most of its runtime is confusing comedy with frustration. The potential that was wasted there even adds to it.In the end, ""Idiocracy"" is more annoying than noble. It presents its case in a very blunt albeit simplistic manner which is made worse by Wilson's boring nice-guy persona.",Idiocracy

An highly average man and a streetwalker had been frozen and left to wake up in the future which is not doing so well. Unfortunately sounding smart in a future where pro wrestling is at the height of intellectual thought makes him look fairly bad in the public eye. Our hero must try to survive as well as work on trying to save mankind from itself.This movie is as written above my favorite of the mike judge movies. This movie works hard to leave you laughing out loud at the antics of the future people. I really think that the level of thought going into this makes it a fairly original piece and the comedy doesn't just dwell on the main character's misfortune (though there is still quite a bit of that here).

How could a Mike Judge Comedy making fun of stupid people with a similar theme to Futurama be bad? It is painfully bad. There are a couple of laughs about stupid people in general but there was not even enough funny or interesting movie to make this movie average. The movie likes discussing IQs but unfortunately this movie has an IQ of a cretin.If you are a fan of Mike Judge and can get this as a rental for 1 buck, it might be worth your time just to see how bad the movie is and try to figure out where it went wrong.If you are not a fan of Mike Judge then avoid this completely.I am sure Mike Judge will come up with a better outing next time.

I get that. This type of on-the-nose humor is not going to appeal to a lot of people. Especially not with its vulgarity and its tongue-in-cheek slapstick presentation.The thing about Idiocracy that makes it so special is its frightening, detail-oriented dystopic vision.Its premise alone is conceptually hilarious as you listen to the deadpan narrator explain world history from 2005 to the 26th century.There's also a level of verisimilitude in Idiocracy that doesn't exist in most fiction.Everyone stays in character. Nothing is out of place in its chaotic universe. Every layered, detailed scene has jokes within jokes available for those whom may posses a discerning eye.That dumb, top layer of comedy that turns so many people off is only the beginning of Idiocracy, if you're willing to look closer.This is a classic comedy and deserves a better rating on IMDB.

Like Judge's previous works, this movie is a stab at the world we live in and it mocks many pop culture references we see around us today. From monster trucks and wrestling to fast food and pornography, this movie spares no mercy on the lifestyle of the uneducated. Unfortunately, the funniest portions are scattered inconsistently and the plot sometimes detracts from the humor rather than carrying it. The cast does an excellent job, but it doesn't solve the problem that stupidity is stupidity and there are only so many ways to show it. The visuals and special effects show no indication of a big budget, but they are fun. This movie should appeal to Mike Judge fans, but it might not appeal to those who only appreciate Office Space. It leans more towards a Beavis & Butthead audience. This is definitely worth seeing but don't go expecting to laugh through the whole movie.",Idiocracy
157,zerogirl42,Biting Satire About the Future,8,24 January 2007,"This isn't the easiest movie to sum up without posting spoilers but i think I do a good job here.Idiocracy takes the controversial topic of dysgenics (the hypothetical evolutionary weakening of a population) and explores its progress over the next 500 years. The world is populated by morons who would make Homer Simpson look like a Einstein.Idiocracy isn't as stupid as it first seems. I hated Baseketball and Anchorman. I have no patience for stupid humor. There's a deeper message/warning going on in Idiocracy. I would actually liken it more to Children of Men in a philosophical sense. Instead of a birth dirth, there's an exploding population of people too stupid to use birth control.Joe (Luke Wilson) is an army librarian who sits on his butt all day waiting for his pension. He's forced into an army experiment that goes wrong and wakes up 500 years in the future. In the future no one reads or even knows the word ""scientist."" Humans are slowly dying because of their own laziness. The future becomes a wake-up call for Joe to do something/anything worthwhile in his life. He desperately wants to get back to the past so he can improve his ways before it's too late.The visuals help add to the urgency of Joe changing his life and the world. The landscapes and backgrounds are amazing. I highly recommend using the pause button to study these.There's a societal message in Idiocracy that's much more interesting than sappy, comedy melodramas like Click or The Family Man. If you're looking for a feel-good family comedy, Idiocracy isn't it. If you want deep, social commentary done in a creative way with bite, you may appreciate the genius of Idiocracy.",Idiocracy
158,nuhc,Idiocracy - it's starting now!,7,22 September 2015,"I finally got to watch this movie the other night and it was every bit as good as I had hoped. I will say that the acting, special effects, and story isn't award worthy, but the message is the important part here. It's believable, too, with all the intelligent people being smart enough to know when to have kids and to have fewer of them, while all the stupid people are there are breeding like rabbits. And with little evolutionary pressure to be smart or die, the stupid people will always outnumber us. If there's one criticism I have of the film, it's that you likely wouldn't have to wait 500 years for this to happen, just give it about 100-150 years. I mean, when you go on the internet and see barely literate people posting to message boards in extremely poor grammar and textspeak, the future of Idiocracy is not far off. Not to mention anti-intellectual attitudes of certain segments of society, mainly those who claim that universities are bastions of liberal indoctrination. We have a major political party in which one of the members after the 2012 election said, ""Stop being the stupid party,"" yet this year (2015) their leading presidential candidate is Donald Trump. Frankly, it's entirely easy to envision a major corporation buying out the FDA, EPA, and USDA in order to spray a salty sports drink on crops in order to boost profits.All in all, this movie has a good story line and keeps you interested. Some of the special effects you can tell were made with models, but it doesn't really detract from the movie and in fact adds to the hokey, trashy feel of the dystopian society. It's a shame this movie wasn't supported, promoted, and more widely distributed by the studio.If you haven't seen this movie yet, by all means do so and heed it as a warning.",Idiocracy
159,mrtimlarabee,Funny film with a thin plot,7,3 September 2006,"Idiocracy is not a bad movie, but it isn't a great movie like Office Space either. Judge has created a movie that is biting satire, even if it is a little obvious. The film begins with Luke Wilson's character working in a library at a military base, where he is seen as a real ""average Joe,"" complacent with his station in life. He is selected to be frozen for a period of one year to test the new procedure and due to circumstances beyond his control, wakes up 500 years in the future in an America that encapsulates the said title of the film, where comedy ensues.Judge imagines a future obsessed with sex, bathroom humor, fast food, and money. Corporate logos are ubiquitous on street corners, clothing, and even in people's speech. Water has been replaced with a sports drink and if you're smart, people think you talk funny. Even more things are automated than they are in the present day, suggesting another reason for people's stupidity in this film.The sight gags are hilarious and the satire is on target most of the time. The plot is very thin though. All things considered, the film doesn't really need one. We can have fun for 90 minutes just observing the future that Judge has mapped out in this film what actually led to this mess in the first place.That might have been even funnier. However, studios know people won't watch a movie without a plot, action, love story, or other Hollywood conventions. So the pedestrian plot of trying to get back to the past is what we have to deal with. This is great, except for the fact it means everything needs to be neatly wrapped up in the third act, which is where this movie starts to falter. The humor that enveloped us for the rest of the movie isn't there and the ending becomes somewhat predictable.Overall, it's a funny film that isn't quite as good as Judge's more popular first feature film. There are many elements of the satire that are sly, keen observations about society, such as the dangers of too much automation in everything we do and our blind belief in products such as sports drinks. However, I don't believe this is the exact movie Judge wanted us to see and parts of it, including a very clumsy narration (Blade Runner anyone?) has studio intervention written all over it. Aside from looking a tad sloppy on the end, this is a funny movie and I hope more people get to see it.",Idiocracy

162,NJtoTX,Intelligent film about a future without intelligence,8,3 September 2006,"First, let me say that although I generally appreciate Mike Judge's work, I've been merely tepid in my response to Office Space, King of the Hill, and Beavis and Butthead. I generally prefer more intelligent comedy, and therein lies the irony with respect to Idiocracy.In a future world where the embodiment of Beavis and Butthead's views, basest instincts, and intellectual capacities are the framework of a chaotic, messy, semi-Mad Max semi-Blade Runner society, where every trailer-trash guy's fantasy becomes reality, a man with even average intelligence is threatening and accused of talking gay, and the mob mentality takes over. And this world is also incredibly funny.Yes, it's obvious that Carl's Jr., Starbucks, Costco and Fuddruckers executives will be horrified at the twisted values given their products in the year 2505.There were some missed opportunities with the film, and the relationship between the time travelers - the other being an average intelligence woman who's worried about her boyfriend's (pimp's) retribution - could have been stronger; the chemistry is there. And there don't seem to be too many women in the future.I did leave with a grin on my face, but the experience is a bit better than the memories. Thus, it's my kind of popcorn film, and it will be fun to revisit on video. Recommended! FYI stay through the credits for an extra scene.",Idiocracy

Careful, or you will miss some.It was extremely comical and clever. I was very, very impressed by it but, it makes you think about the future of humanity. Be prepared to be afraid. Some of the jokes in the film are based on real life events or shows that are already in existence. It makes you realize that as technological and advanced the human race is, we are becoming a dumbed down society.One thing I also really liked was the narration. It fades in and out to the point where it blends right in. It just flows and fits right in.Everyone must see this movie! It is definitely one of my favorites.

165,bobcolganrac,The Future Was Never Dimmer.,9,31 May 2007,"I loved this movie. It is Voltairian satire, appropriate to the times. The movie is pretty much a comic book, a cartoon, adapted to the screen. It is purposefully non-cerebral. The best satirists can mimic what they sense, and abstractly present it, and that is what Mike Judge has done. He's holding up a funhouse mirror for us to see ourselves and saying ""This is the direction we are heading. And we're accelerating."" Humanity is not only swirling in the toilet, it is getting darker by the minute. Good humor joins incongruities together, and Judge has done this well. His union of the military with the prostitution game, ubiquitous coffee shops with sex parlors, the presidency with black gangstas, the medical profession with a McMenu and doper culture are marvelous touches. The one thing that is omnipresent in the future is garbage. Junk, junk, and more junk to the point where it is overflowingly the new landscape. Vegetation has gone the way of the Dodo bird, the organic replaced by the synthetic. It is a world completely unable to restore itself to any reasonable semblance of order. Chaos reigns supreme. The only place where order still exists is the arena of Monster Truck competitions which somehow have also fused with ancient gladiator contests and morphed into public executions. The only foods are junk as well. And the only beverage left is a sports drink ""that's got electrolytes"" that's also by corporate wheeling also completely replaced water.This movie could not be described as high art. What we normally think of as high art disavows itself of the comedic, it is more serious. But high art arouses in the observer a complex process of feeling, or one of thinking which persists after the exposure. And in that sense this movie is accomplishing the same thing. It's making us think. Maybe it is high art. It would certainly qualify as high art in the future according to Judge.Great movie!",Idiocracy

Fans of ""Office Space"" cried foul and lambasted the studio, but after seeing the movie, I can sympathize with the studio. ""Idiocracy"" is intermittently funny and hilarious at points, but it is a drab (purposefully so), bizarre film that will likely even leave many fans of Judge's work dissatisfied.""Idiocracy"" is the story of a shiftless Army private (Luke Wilson) and prostitute (Maya Rudolph) who get drafted into a top secret military hibernation project. They'll be put to sleep and reawakened in one year, perfectly preserved. But, of course, this plan goes awry and they don't awake until the year 2505. The future is ugly, coarse, and incredibly stupid.The movie, like many dystopian stories, is not so much about the future as it is about poking fun at the present. Think ""Futurama"" meets ""Transmetropolitan"". The film is primarily a reflection on our tendency to celebrate the inept and lowbrow. Do you spend most of your evenings watching ""Flavor of Love"" reruns and eating biggie size fries? These actions will have dire consequences for future generations.""Idiocracy"" is under an hour and a half and mercifully so. The future is so unappealing and the people so stupid that we are happy to be out of their company sooner than later. The movie also lacks much in the way of narrative drive. It has many funny ideas that never coalesce into a sustainable narrative.Yet, the movie has enough very funny moments, is short enough, and features some good performances from the leads. Luke Wilson carries the movie with his easygoing charm and Maya Rudolph (""SNL"") gets solid laughs without trying too hard. It's definitely worth a look on video.

169,Adrian Sweeney,The future's not bright,7,17 May 2009,"This film tends to polarize people. Personally I didn't quite either love it or hate it but came close to both.Reasons to watch it: It's very funny in places. You'll be remembering the best jokes and chuckling for ages afterwards. It's a genuinely hard-hitting satire of our era, perhaps the only real biting satire I've seen on screen for a long time. People may well be referring to the best bits for ages, and if you haven't seen it you may feel left out. If you like to think about social problems rather than escaping them - I don't knock either attitude - then you need to think about some of the points raised here, assuming you haven't already. It's by Mike Judge, who made King of the Hill and the excellent Office Space, and like the latter it unfairly didn't get a proper release even in the US.Reasons to avoid it: It's stupid. Well, it's obviously more intelligent than the average Hollywood stupidity, but it's still pretty stupid at times. Some of the plot points are fairly stupid and feel arbitrary, and many of the jokes are stupid and crass. If you're stupid and crass in the cause of satirizing stupid and crass people, aren't you still stupid and crass? Are we laughing at them or laughing like them? This was a problem I had with Beavis and Butthead, and at least one of the main characters - really, the whole society depicted - is like a grown-up, or at least aged, version of one of them. The inhabitants of the idiocracy are genuinely repulsive and vile at times, and in a couple of places I found myself looking away and blocking my ears squeamishly or dearly wishing I just had. The voice-over device, although necessary some of the time, is a little overused and you become annoyed to be told things rather than shown. Furthermore aspects of the ending are an appalling cop-out. 'I've decided I like these people after all.' For God's sake why? They are dreadful. If I say the film's like a coil of barbed wire with a candy-floss coating, that cuts both ways.",Idiocracy
170,Tecun_Uman,Destined to become another Mike Judge Cult Classic,10,10 September 2006,"Most people are totally unaware that this movie exists. Fox, which paid Judge to make it, has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it. I guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer. Well, I am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe. Basically, Judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin. Then these stupid are getting more stupid, by basically spending all of their time watching TV and having sex, which produces more stupid people. By 2500, a person of average intelligence today, will appear to be a genius, that talks ""all faggy."" Seriously, is this really that hard to believe. Oh sure, this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great as the time traveling army guy, hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time. Where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny one-liners, like ""can we family style her"" and ""hey man, I'm 'bating here!""

The only guy I actually liked was the fat dude in President Camacho's cabinet who laughs in an endearingly stupid way.) It's not the special effects (ye gods! Are we back to the Planet of the Apes, non-Wahlberg Edition?) or the conclusion (more predictable than the oldest joke in Captain Predictable's Deja-Vu Revue). No, what keeps me (mildly) interested is that I can't figure out if the movie is intentionally dumb.Because, brother, it's dumb. Hoo-boy, is it dumb. If Jim Carrey hadn't grown up and become mediocre, this would have his name all over it. But at the same time, it's making a statement about how dumb things are becoming. So, there's that question: is the movie intentionally dumb, to a point where it's not at all obvious that it's intentional? Is it trying to guide us into a false sense of arrogant security as we say ""man, that movie about the dumbing down of the world sure could have been done more intelligently"".

The people who hated it or don't get it are the people that the movie is making fun of. Obviously it can't have that broad an audience when they are mocking everyone with an IQ under 120 (after all, Joe/Not Sure is 100, and he's generally considered a loser in our times).The reviewers here who find it ""raciest"" or ""self-reflexive"" are the ones running the country in 500 years. So why get mad? You win? ;)For me, it was a flashback to sixth grade. Not because of the humor, but because the entire society had devolved into sixth grade, where the stupidest kids are cool and calling everyone a fag for being smart, or countering an argument by going ""blah, blah blah"" and having everyone laugh, and talking about wrestling and how everyone was going to nail everyone else even though they had no idea what to do. As a smart kid, I lived this, and for me it was vindication and nostalgia at once.It would have been nice if the movie was better overall. It needed something more than what it had. It was more of a drawn out short story than a full feature, but oh well. Luke Wilson does play the perfect average Joe since he is so average. The supporting cast played their morons well. And maybe it's sexist to make the ""average"" American in 2005 a prostitute, but sadly, it's not that far off if you've been in college within the last 20 years. But Maya Rudolph plays her character well, and she's a fox. Unfortunately Mike Judge really doesn't know what to do with female characters, but I'd still nail her behind the bushes, and I'm totally sure she'd put out... ;) (and for anyone who found that ""sexiest"" just watch the movie and you might get it. or maybe not.)",Idiocracy

And this movie is a smart movie. The premise is not original (""The Marching Morons"", the original story with very similar theme was written was back in the 1950s), but the execution is fresh and interesting. Also it sure takes a lot of guts to make a movie that most may fail to appreciate. Just the other day, I was explaining the movie to an intelligent colleague of mine, and his comments were, ""So you had enough free time to sit through this movie, you mean?"". Maybe I am just another moron, but that does not mean that this movie is moronic. It is a smart black comedy.What is its basic premise? That, due to the selective nature of the smart people, after a while smart people will cease to exist, and the world will be filled with morons. Sounds outlandish? If you look at most families, the sibling with the best income and comforts of life has the least number of offspring, and the one who is the worst of the lot has the maximum. This is not a 100% rule, but it works pretty much that way, and it works across the continents.What about the world being filled with morons? Actually, in my life, I already see it happening (and I'm sure, may of you do as well). Many people with high degree and successful career, never reads a book, have no clue about anything (except maybe about the evil trio of Paris-Lindsay-Britney, bought to you NOT by Carl's Jr. but by TMZ), do not give two hoots about what is going on in the world and are very happy with their life. And I see it constantly going in a downward spiral. I grew up in a poor country, and I can see that before the advent of TV (like some malignancy spreading to every sphere of our life), we used to read and learn things, but now all we know is what the TV shows us (things such as, brought to you by Carl's Jr.). and anyone hooked to TV has no ""second opportunity on earth"", because what TV generally projects is blatant consumerism and commercialization of anything and everything.Interestingly, the central satirical theme of the movie is that, and that is why it appears so fresh to people like me, who are otherwise used to usual Hollywood (and others) crap. Where the movie fails is, in my opinion, in the last 20 minutes or so. This part is abrupt, and kind of not carefully scripted or executed.If you like a smart movie, I think you will like this (and also probably Clerks II). II.",Idiocracy
175,jaysilentbob37,Is to Office Space what Mallrats is to Clerks.,7,7 February 2007,"As a big fan of Office Space, I followed the story behind this film's release for two years. I felt like I was going to die if I didn't see the movie soon. And in my anxiety to see this film, I think I set my expectations a bit high. The film is hilarious, but don't expect the quality, and pure hilarity that made Office Space what it is. However, that doesn't mean it isn't one of the funnier comedies of 2006... it is. It contains some of the biggest laughs I've had with a movie all year.The film follows Joe Bowers, statistically the most average man in the military, who is chosen as a guinea pig for a human hibernation experiment the military is conducting. Along with a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph), he is cryogenically frozen, and the two are almost instantly abandoned and forgotten when the base is shut down. Joe wakes up in the year 2505, where the world has sunk to the intelligence level of Beavis and Butt-head due to dumb people breeding far more than smart people. He is discovered by the people of the future to be the smartest man alive, and is unwillingly forced to solve all the world's problems...This film is one of the funniest movies of 2006. After such disappointing comedies this year as You, Me, and Dupree, and The Break Up, Idiocracy was a welcome gift. Mike Judge has always made me laugh my ass off. Beavis and Butt-head, King of the Hill, and Office Space are all comic genius, and combined with the seemingly endless release delays, my expectations went through the roof. Ultimately, the film made me laugh harder than half the movies released this year, but had some major, actually, near-fatal flaws, that were only saved by the brilliant jokes.First the good. Idiocracy is filled with hilarious jokes and sight gags, that will make you laugh just thinking about them. Watch for a great gag involving a Carl's Jr. vending machine and an unfit mother. Classic. The interesting thing is that the gags wouldn't be nearly as clever in any other premise. Simple dick n' fart jokes are made intelligent, as the people in the future think they're the funniest thing in the world. Also, jokes at the expense of major corporations such as Starbucks, Costco, Carl's Jr., Fuddruckers etc... are all priceless. As a social satire, the film is a masterpiece. As much as I hate to admit it, the idea that in the future, mankind will be dumbed down, is as logical an explanation as I can imagine. The film's hilarious prologue will help it make sense. And while it probably wouldn't be nearly as lighthearted as portrayed here, it's a believable scenario.Now the bad. The film feels incomplete, and isn't well put together at all. The set designs, and special effects are all good, but the story is rushed, and feels like it was edited in a day with little to no effort put into it. The story isn't used to it's full potential (Luke Wilson's attempt to help the future's crops grow is certainly funny, but isn't enough to carry most of a movie. More issues like these would have been great), and while the narrator is pretty funny, he starts to get tiresome after the first forty minutes, and basically just fills in for what could have been interesting plot development. If you thought Office Space was underdeveloped, this will make it look complete. Also, Maya Rudolph was annoying as hell (just real whiny, and overacts like mad). In most comedies, these problems could be seen past, but with the film's brilliant premise, I expected more. Idiocracy is to Office Space what Mallrats is to Clerks. Idiocracy and Mallrats are both very funny and entertaining, but both lack a certain charm that their predecessors had.Overall, the good outweighs the bad, and I give Idiocracy a 7/10.It is rated R for Language and Sex-Related Humor.

Quite frankly a premise that we're only about half a step away from at present. It's about a ""future"" world where an unmotivated, not particularly bright, average sort of a guy is deemed the wisest man in the world. A world where the population has become so stupid due to the dimwitted breeding prolifically and the intelligent breeding less and less. A world where everything is bought and controlled by massive multi-national corporations that turn everything into a marketing venture to sell their junk food, and other cheesy products that the witless public buy religiously. A world where the lowest common denominator mob mentality has taken over and turned every social institution, including the legal system, into a venue of sadist, scapegoating theater for the moronic masses. A world where the inane vulgar slang comprised of offensive profanity and mindless commercial catch phrases is the only language the dopey great unwashed speak, even though they don't even understand this simplistic banter, let alone someone like our lead character, the ""smartest man in the world"", who is only intelligible and not particularly eloquent but because he doesn't speak the same language as these dolts they label him a ""fag"" and other obtuse insults.

All we need here in the US of A is to completely dismiss anyone with half an intellect (which for all intensive purposes has happened already) and we're there. ""Idiocracy"" is clever in that it is not really sci-fi anything but a satire of today's world. It does the job of smart satire in that it disguises itself as a satire of ""other times"" and ""other people"", not these half wits we have here today, surely- wink, wink. It may not have quite the depth of ""Office Space"" but it certainly hits home for anyone who is frustrated with the decreasing intellect of this non-evolving populace we are surrounded by today, which is probably anyone who can read and understand this. According to a recent report by the National Institute for Literacy (NIL), 90 million ADULTS (1 in 2) in the US is functionally illiterate, which means they can't read and understand simple legal documents, perhaps this post. ""Idiocracy"" is an obvious satire for anyone who has the ability to put together some cohesive thoughts, even if only occasionally. It gives us a moment of humorous reprieve in this frighteningly dumbing down world we live in, an opportunity to laugh at what is in reality a horror. I'll watch it again, except for the last half hour which is mostly trite formula, but the first part where you can clearly see a reflection of today's world is worth the time and will give you a few stress relieving laughs.",Idiocracy
180,tomq5p,A decent critique of where we are headed,6,10 November 2007,"It isn't too surprising that Mike Judge's ""Idiocracy"" did terribly at test screenings. Many of the people watching the film may have been missing the jokes because they were the exact type of people being depicted.This movie, starring the deadpan Luke Wilson and the sexy Maya Rudolph, imagines what would happen to our society if all of the worst current trends took hold and became the norm. The movie levels criticism at rampant commercialization and commodification, corporate dominance, lack of education and literacy, obsession with violence and sexual exploitation, and a host of other societal ills. Although its critique of society is reasonably well laid out, ""Idiocracy"" deals with race in an inappropriate manner.Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph's characters are ""frozen"" (à la Austin Powers), and, after some unexpected events, wake up about 500 years later. The world is in a state of disrepair where TV rules and intelligent people are nonexistent. The dystopian future created by Mike Judge is often funny and clever in its stupidity. The dialogue is well done and the problems that face the imagined world in 2505 are relevant to our current ones. The movie simultaneously elicits laughs are and sighs when we think about how ridiculous the situations are but then realize how similar they are to the real world. This movie can appeal to someone who ""gets"" all the references and critiques as well as someone who doesn't, and that is its main deficiency. In appealing to a larger audience, it is forced to dumb itself down somewhat and rely on slapstick humor or weak plot devices. However, the most troubling aspect of the film is how it deals with race. In the hopeless future presented in the film, the government is headed up by a clueless black president. Latino accents are also often used in a very negative way and are associated with stupidity. Luke Wilson's character, a white male, has a very positive role in the film while Maya Rudolph's character is a prostitute. It also seems that there are more people of color as extras in the wide angle shots than in an average Hollywood film.In a film that could serve as a wake up call to society, or any film for that matter, it is inappropriate to use racial stereotypes and imply that people of color aren't as intelligent or as capable as white people. It is important to realize that the current destructive trends in society are often the result of the actions of white people. The pre-emptive war in Iraq is a perfect example. The bungling response to Katrina is another.Obviously, a film like this shouldn't bear the burden of educating people about structural racism and systemic oppression, but it also shouldn't fall into the same traps that it should be criticizing. The film is funny. The plot is weak, but the gags are entertaining. The general message is on the money, but the treatment of race is highly problematic. 6 out of 10",Idiocracy

They are all witty, biting, current satire that can be appreciated at multiple levels. Sometimes there are 3 jokes told at the same time. As Peggy Hill put it: ""I learned one thing in summer swim class: You cannot save a drowning man!""This film was poorly marketed and released and it's a pity. It's genius and hilarious and has a ton of inside jokes you have to watch for. Like with Beavis and Butthead, the crudity is not meant to be funny on it's surface but rather from looking deeper. B&B were funny because we all knew kids like that in High School and as adults, looking back at them is sad but simultaneously, they were happy with their bleak future because they were too stupid to know better.And that's what Idiocracy is all about. Beavis and Butthead as a future. And if you don't laugh, you'll be scared because there's a lot of intellectual caution expressed in this tale. A lot of smart people don't want to have children so it begs the question: What will the future be like? It's a political question that many are afraid to address. There was even a huge debate about it between Larry Niven & Isaac Asiniov. This movie is based upon a short story by CM Kornbluth: The Marching Morons. But that story was bleak while this one is funny. In multiple ways.The humor is evident in that this bleak future is already partly here. As other reviewers observed, as you leave the theater, it's almost as if the idiots in the film wrote the advertisements in the Mall. Folks who don't think this is funny are, ironically, too ""dumb"" to get it. Folks who are REALLY dumb, will laugh, but for different reasons. That's the genius. It's also the genius behind B&B. How smart you are is determined by how many things you find to laugh about.I could really use a Starbucks right now...",Idiocracy
182,rob.cottrell-2,The Sleeper awakes again,6,10 January 2008,"As this film is all about the stupidity and shallowness of a media  obsessed society, I guess it's no coincidence that most comments have missed out on the origins of this thing. It dates, not from Woody Allen's 'Sleeper', but from a novel written in 1898 (and revised in 1910) called 'The Sleeper Awakes' by HG Wells. If you don't believe me, look it up in Wikipedia! Umokay..but you get the drift. However, the real inspiration for this movie is a short sci-fi novella, 'The Marching Morons', written by CM Kornbluth in 1951. It's all there. IQ or intelligence has shrunken to stupid levels and Kornbluth presents a similar dystopian world (except it's a 50's dystopia, obviously) for the same reasons as this film. There the similarities end. The thing about Mike Judge is you always get the feeling that despite his sometimes biting criticism, he has a genuine affection for middle American 'White Trash' society  not just here but in works such as 'Office Space', and 'King of the Hill'. When I initially heard how Fox had held this film back and then finally released it with no marketing whatsoever I really expected a no-holds barred attack. It doesn't deliver. The initial scenes soon soften and, in fact, it has quite a feel-good ending. If you want to experience the real thing, then check out the Novella. It differs in 3 crucial ways: There is still a tiny minority of intelligent people left in the world who are just about keeping things from total collapse. The 'Sleeper' is not some laid-back, genuinely caring soul (as played by Luke Wilson) but a ruthless and greedy ex ad-man. And, most importantly, the solution to the problem is far, far darker than what is offered here. But don't take my word for it. Read 'The Marching Morons' That is if you read books, of course.",Idiocracy

184,aigoalies,Pretty bad movie,2,15 August 2020,"This review probably will not be popular, due to the massive amounts of positive reviews for this movie. Firstly, the movie assumes that just because your parents aren't smart, you will be dumb. If your parents are dumb you could still be a genius, Einstein's father was a salesperson (since they are so fixated on Einstein as a genius throughout the movie). The second assumption they make is that how smart you are is measured solely by IQ. IQ wasn't even purposed to be a full measure of how smart you are. The funniest part of this movie, was the fact that even though the entire time it preached how everyone was dumb and how smart it was, it used a cliched comedy plot seen a million times before making it a ""dumb"" film just like all of the other comedies. A lot of people are saying that this movie is a ""documentary"" because everyone is so dumb these days. Firstly, dumb is a broad term, you might be ""dumb"" in one area but extremely smart in another area. Secondly, more people are going to college now than ever before. So not only is this movie hypocritical and has bad logic, it is also a terrible satire because it simply isn't true.My other problem with this film is the hard leftist politics stuffed down the audience's throat. The blasting of fox news, climate change, healthcare, capitalism, guns were all annoying and, to be honest, not very funny (the giant costco was the closest to funny out of the political jabs).BTW Einstein didn't actually think he was smarter than everyone else, he wasn't, he was just good at theoretical physics. The movie also thinks he invented the atomic bomb which is also not true he invented the equations that would be used in the making of the bombThe one good thing I will say about the movie is the jokes were pretty good when they weren't political and it got a few laughs out of me.

Its set in the future with great technology, but at the same time its borderline apocalyptic due to the human population having ridiculously low IQ's and are more than incompetent of maintaining the planet.
Also the story is great, two people from the present with very average IQ's get cryogenically frozen and wake up in the future, only to realise that they're the smartest ones alive.

This movie TRIES to be a social satire, but it is so broad, so clumsy, so turgid, so bloated, so self-conscious, so obvious, so sophomoric, and so clichéd that you will want your two hours back. Do not, under any circumstances, rent, TiVo or accidentally find yourself viewing this movie. It's a disaster and a colossal failure on every level. Nothing works. Nothing. It doesn't make you think. It doesn't do anything but club you over the head. Dialogue is painful. Acting is cringe-inducingly vaudevillian. Dax Shepherd plays such a convincing idiot you believe he has actually been brain damaged during filming, but instead of being interesting, it is off-putting, and tiresome. Luke Wilson flounders around, completely bereft of personality, playing the same earnest naif he always plays, and basically since the film ostensibly revolves around him, there is no emotional performance anchoring this mess and giving it any credibility whatsoever. The rest of the performances are equally inept, with actors flailing around in an effort to find a tonal consensus and all of them visibly aching to return to their trailers.",Idiocracy

They make an interesting argument and it seems like it could actually happen in real life because they use evolution as an argument.People don't really need any intelligence or any skills at all to survive in society because they have machines that can take care of it, so the only thing which evolution requires is the ability to reproduce more and stupid people tend to do that a lot more, so smart people might die out in the next hundred years if we don't do anything about it.I mean their problem where they had their crops were destroyed because they did not use water is pretty stupid because the machines would take care of it. You know one thing that is considerable is why isn't there more fat people because it is highly likely that there would be more of them too but fat people cannot reproduce so it is quite an interesting situation...I like that this movie shows how humanity could turn stupid but I don't like it when the movie itself is stupid as such I cannot give this more then a 6/10. This movie is really a lot like Wall-E but I think Wall-E is definitely better so I would recommend that first. I gave Wall-E a 7/10 so I cannot give this movie any higher then that.Anyways bombarding you with all that stupidity throughout that movie can kind of make you feel stupider yourself in the end. I think the movie would do much better by reducing the amount of time in it by approximately 30 minutes. I mean for the first thirty minutes or so it was definitely all good when they were introducing the whole situation and the trash avalanches and such, but later some of the things were just too stupid.

In it we see that the stupider you are the more you breed. Now I or anyone I have ever talked to can find fault with this theory. So basically by the time we reach the future intelligence is bred out of society. Two characters, who are from present day, have to deal with said mentally challenged society. By mentally challenged I mean ""got the tools, lost the handles."" The movie is quite scary but the real horror comes when the movie is over and you take a good look around.

193,tuomas_gimli,One of the smarter comedies,9,13 November 2012,"Idiocracy is probably one of the most underrated films released this century. It's a genuinely intelligent, imaginative and thought-provoking film that paints an uncomfortably real-feeling picture of a future populated by idiots.The story concerns an army librarian named Joe, who is chosen to participate in an army experiment to put soldiers into hibernation. Things go wrong, and Joe ends up sleeping for 500 years instead of just one. He awakens in a future where humanity has degraded into complete and total idiocy. The process of how humanity devolved is illustrated in a brilliant opening scene that makes the whole thing seem oddly possible and realistic. Joe starts looking for a way to travel back in time, and the rest is just laughs all around.The best thing about Idiocracy is its delicately crafted vision of the future. It really goes into detail with architecture, how people dress, behave and even walk. Details and references to today's culture are everywhere, and one can't possibly detect all the gags in just one viewing. The writing, though crude and vulgar, is very good, and the cast is clearly having fun acting like a bunch of total idiots. The highlight is Terry Crews as the president of the USA (you read that right) who gives a raving, maniacal performance. The rest of the cast is also good, and there are hardly any weak performances.Though the message of the film is universally applicable, most of the small gags are targeted at Americans, which will likely get slightly more out of it. Idiocracy is a film that really has something to say, and it gets you thinking. Though things slump a bit in the third act and the green screen effects aren't very good it doesn't drag the film down much.Summary: A hilarious yet intelligent and thought-provoking comedy with good writing, acting and a well-crafted world.

195,d_3434_d,The actual future of the world,7,19 May 2013,"It's hard to go wrong with director and writer Mike Judge, the creator of Beavis and Butt-Head (1993-1997, 2011) and Office Space (1999). Mike Judge is at its best when he exposes the idiocy of people. Beavis and Butt-Head are an excellent example of that. Idiocracy basically inverts the universe of Beavis and Butt-Head. Instead of two idiotic characters in a world where everybody in general is just average, Idiocracy is about about two average characters in a world where everybody is idiotic. The result is a move that is better suited for people before the pre-1990s because today we are basically living in a world that is quite close to what the movie portrays. It is for that reason that the move has achieved a good cult following among those who are against the New World Order conspiracy. It's definitely not for those who are into movies or TV shows like Keeping Up with the Kardashians (2007–2013) or Jersey Shore (2009–2012). If you are into such movies or TV shows, I wouldn't recommend Idiocracy to you as it will definitely insult you.As with What Dreams May Come (1998) I didn't feel as if Idiocracy was complete. It felt too short and I had expected more. The movie felt almost like a long commercial. The main protagonist of the movie, Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson), while interesting, is just too average. That's literally the point of the movie, but it doesn't really work to take full advantage of the dystopia. Before his introduction, the movie starts out well but sets the stage too high. It's the same problem with What Dreams May Come. With great material to work with, these two movies take the quick and dirty approach and leave - at least in my case - a little bit too much to be desired. I would have preferred if the movie would have been about 2:30 hours instead of a little less than 1:30 hour.As always, Mike Judge is very careful when it comes to politics, which is unfortunate because as with Beavis & Butt-Head, whenever he does touch on politics, it's good. With a movie like Idiocracy that's in particular important to get right. It's standard practice in Hollywood to trash Christianity and praise promiscuity, drugs, paraphilia, etc. Mike Judge's works naturally demand the opposite and Mike Judge delivers too little on this front, despite all the opportunities (especially in case of Idiocracy) that he gets. Mike Judge apparently thinks that the movie speaks for itself in this regard and it does those who understand what's going on but it's more important to reach those who don't. If you are one of those people who is a fan of 16 and Pregnant (2009–2012) and you watch this movie, then you deserve the same treatment as people who like Idiocracy get while watching a movie like Paul (2011). Hollywood has zero tolerance for people who refuse to go along with promiscuity, the dumbing down of society, etc. So it's only fair if a movie like Idiocracy would the opposite of a standard Hollywood movie in all aspects, not just a few. That's almost as bad as with South Park (1997-2013), which proudly sees itself as daring enough to make fun of everyone but they never dare to make fun of, for example, Islam or Muslims (instead, they resort to constantly attacking Judaism and Jews, for example). I would have liked Idiocracy to be more blatant, way more blatant. For example, in the description of the movie it says that Joe Bauers ""wakes 500 years in the future. He discovers a society so incredibly dumbed-down that he's easily the most intelligent person alive."" Great, but openly say what the exact reasons are for the reduction in intelligence. Just saying that smart people have less children is not good enough (statistically, Westerners in general are having less and less children). Obsession with sex (promiscuity and perversity in particular), drugs, PC, GM foods, etc, that's what causing a reduction in intelligence. Being dumb is literally celebrated in today's world (Jackass (2000–2002), Keeping Up with the Kardashians (2007–2013), etc). Those are the things that are dumbing down society. That's what I want to see in Idiocracy, the truth right in your face without any sugarcoating.Nonetheless, as with Mike Judge's previous (best) works, the message of the movie is priceless and the movie is more than enough entertaining to keep you interested. I would definitely recommend it.",Idiocracy

One big flaw is that there's no way such dumb people could still have functioning machines, food, agriculture, cars, etc. and behave the way they do. There's little extrapolation from the present into the future as in most dystopian futures like 1984, Brave New World etc . As social satire it falls short because there's no oligarchy represented here at all as the cause of the dumbing down which would've lent an edge to it all.

Its somewhat elitist in the way that it demeans people that are less intelligent. While it is funny at first, it runs tiresome throughout the film, and it only breaks new ground by being as ridiculous as possible. The future that it depicts is serious, and a lot of the films merit lies in the way that it makes the viewer think, even if it for ten minutes.

It would have had far greater comedic potential to look at the idiocracy of the 26th century through the eyes of someone who is actually intelligent.But perhaps the movie still isn't dumbed-down enough to convey its message, as some reviews here see it as an indictment of liberalism, whereas it is, of course, nothing of the sort. In fact, the movie is a full-on attack on everything that's anti-intellectual in current US society, illustrated by a star appearance by an insanely dumb network called... Fox News. If that still makes it too hard for some people to connect the dots, then a real-life idiocracy may not be that far off.",Idiocracy
206,theeintolerablekidd,Good sci-fi comedy,7,10 May 2011,"Idiocracy, a movie about a future society of dumbed down humans, is dumb in itself - it's a silly movie about silly people - but very enjoyable at the same time. It's not a massive thought provoker but a fun ride into the realms of sci-fi comedy. It would have been nicer if it'd gone a bit deeper but it works and the depiction we are given of this ""stupid"" future is highly original and thought provoking. It's low brow comedy that also remains very intelligent at the same time - a rare trick. The style reminded me a bit of Woody Allen's ""Sleeper"", but not too much. It has a style and charm of it's own and remains very original. Definitely worth watching if you like the genre or if you're just a comedy fan.",Idiocracy
207,FlickMan,An uneven satire of current social trends,7,14 January 2007,"""Idiocracy"" is the latest in a long line of stories and movies set in a future society where things have been ""dumbed down"" and/or the people are stupid. As others have noted, its predecessors include the C. M. Kornbluth story ""The Marching Morons"" (1951) and the Woody Allen movie ""Sleeper,"" along with ""Demolition Man"" and the recent TV cartoon series ""Futurama."" The movie it most resembles, however, in both style and spirit, is probably ""Death Race 2000,"" released in 1975.Like each of these works, ""Idiocracy"" uses its premise to satirize and comment on trends in present-day society. And to some measure, it succeeds. There are some genuinely funny moments, along with a lot of gross-out humor. Production values are minimal, and if you're looking for a logical, coherent story, this is not the movie for you. Clearly, a society where everyone is as stupid as these people appear to be could not function at all. Who would design and build the giant vehicles used in the Rehabilitation arena, for example? I agree with the consensus rating of 6 to 7 points that IMDb users have given ""Idiocracy,"" although that figure is a bit deceptive., as it represents an average of extremes. People either think this movie is brilliant, or they think it sucks. I disagree with both groups. It's fairly clever in places, but hardly original in concept; see the works cited above. On the other hand, despite rumored ""gutting"" by Fox, it retains enough sharp-edged humor to qualify as insightful and somewhat daring.",Idiocracy

For me this film is beyond criticism in the normal sense but only a nightmare that once seen can never be unseen.We have now reached our Groundhog Day but without the happy ending.Laughing at the stupid soon wears thin and I'm just hoping that we are getting ready to send back to the past our latest Terminator model to eliminate the cause of the present rampart stupidity.

209,jack-964,Wisest dumb ass movie ever,8,26 July 2007,"This must be the dumbest movie I've ever seen and therefor it deserves a special award. OK, so it begins pretty good, logical, humor and then rapidly changes to complete and utter uh f@rt,@ss, föck stupidity that makes total sense. The strange thing is that i hardly laughed at it, though i guess it is supposed to be funny, with a very serious message. After a moment of thought why i didn't laugh, the answer was pretty clear... this movie is a lot more realistic then i would like it to be. So it is extremely dumb, yet very wise if the object was to reach people which aren't 'blessed' with a whole lot of neurons and synapses and electrolytes (huh, electrolytes?). This movie might actually be understood at some level by a big audience!Although they probably just laugh.Ah well, nice try...I am now editing (well adding to) my comment, cause i read some of the other comments. First i noticed some people see racism in this movie. Well, that did not at all cross my mind when watching it. However, i can imagine if you are looking from that perspective, you will see some. We could of course debate the link between intelligence and race, but i think this is not the place to do so. I wonder, if we were to rate the Huxtable family here, would you complain about them all being black? I don't think so, but i guess you could... (aside from that, from the 2 wisest people in the world, half, the woman, doesn't seem totally caucasian to me, so 'what the problem is?')Secondly the movie gets very mixed ratings; from 1's to 10's and everything in between, but a lot of polarisation there, which means the movie does its job very well! It stirrs people up, makes them want to speak about it and judge it. That means it is a good movie, whether you like it or hate it. After 5 minutes it becomes very predictive and boring even, yet you keep watching this utter crap. I guess you keep hoping that it isn't so. Or maybe it's our sick way to look at terrible accidents. Well, this is one for sure.",Idiocracy

However, I feel like Mike Judge is forced to direct and finish this movie, somehow, I feel he hasn't put his best attention and strength to make this movie. The cast is fairly good, Maya Rudolph is sexy and a funny person, Luke Wilson can play a funny character (as he did in Oldschool) but none of these actors can't do anything more because the script is not that funny, they don't have funny dialogue. There are few moments that make you smile or laugh, but in my opinion the audience gets bored for most of the part.I really wanted to like this but ended to be totally disappointed.

Mike Judge. The hilarious director of our favorite: Office Space.Idiocracy lives up to its title. These people are completely moronic, its amazing to see they have even managed to live this long without a total society meltdown. My only problem with the movie is the fact that the joke in the end gets old, and the laughs die. However I do give it the respect it deserves for making a movie that could have failed horribly into a movie that just barely made it.And one last tip of the hat to Maya Rudolph for playing the Hooker with a Heart of Gold, Rita.

Idiocracy isn't quite as good, but it's not too far behind.Kind of like nineteen eightyfour, only idiotic, would be a good way to describe it. I laughed out loud quite a few times, and there were a few genuinely clever bits of dialogue (The narrator explaining the evolution of what had become modern language, and ending with 'various drunks' comes to mind).If your expecting an intelligent yet humorous exploration into the potential dangers of our obsession with products and mundane entertainment. You will be disappointed. If you just want a stupid movie to entertain you, you'll probably agree with me that the film is about a 7/10.(I also know that many people who watch this at 13, will love it throughout their youth, thus DVD sales will probably increase in 5-10 years) 7/10(reviewed after first viewing)",Idiocracy
215,TwoThirdsMajority,Orwell's futuristic vision of stupid people,9,15 March 2007,"In Children of Men, Michael Caine's character Japer asks ""Why are we infertile?"" If he was in Idiocracy, he would have been the third smartest person in the movie after Maya Rudolph and Luke Wilson, and he'd probably ask ""Why are we stupid?"" In Mike Judge's Idiocracy, Judge takes a look at society today and it's effects on the future. In the 21st century, we seemed to have known that stupid people gave birth to more children than smart ones. And the smart & intelligent people are too stupid to make babies, since they're worry some idiots. And the result, more stupidity, less intelligence.In 2005, the US army wanted to reserve it's lower, more average servicemen so that they're fit for battle. And to prove that theory, they hired Joe Bauers(Owen Wilson), an average Joe US serviceman, and a prostitute named Rita(Maya Rudolph) to undergo an experiment. They'll be frozen for a year to prove that humans are able to be preserved without any damages. However, the US army officer in charge of the experiment was arrested for prostitution charges, and the two frozen humans are forgotten, making them frozen for not 1, but 500 years into the future.Waking up 500 years later at the year 2505, Joe and Rita discover themselves in a dystopian hell. No, the future is not ruled by Big Brother. No, it's not even ruled by the communists. And no, the future is not being ruled by damn dirty apes either. The future, like i said above,is ruled by stupid people. Yes, stupid people. Not even the smartest person is available. Why? Like i said, smart & intelligent people are stupid when it comes to making babies. Therefore, the intelligent humans are extinct, causing the rest of humanity to devolve into a race of unintelligent corporate tools.Upon discovering the future, they've found worse situations: The president of the USA is a former wrestler and porn star who is a black anti-Barack Obama, Justice has become ridiculously retarded, Costco is a city, Starbucks coffee offers sex while drinking, and no one wears suits nor tuxedo, And the English language has become nothing but valley, chav, hill billy and trash talk.After taking an IQ test, Joe discovers that he's the smartest person in the world. And he was forced to repair the North Korean-like drought that has suffered the American people for years. It appears that America has gone too corporate that a Gatorade-like company named Brawndo has taken over the America's food industry, causing water to be replaced with Brawndo all over the land except in toilets. They even pour Brawndo on the crops, which caused the drought. And even the cabinet seems not to acknowledge such problems, since they're all stupid like the people, and they wear bling-bling chains which has the emblems of the US government.This is a smart Orwellian film which also blends with Jackass-like humor and fart jokes that created the idiot atmosphere of the future. The cast is brilliant. Luke Wilson played a great job as the main character, and Maya Rudolph is a hottie in this film, and not to forget she played a convincing street-prostitute, although i do hate her unnatural African-American accent in this film. Dax Shepard was hilarious as Joes' future lawyer Frieto, while Terry Crews' portrayal of a lower-IQ-than-Bush president is possibly the best ever. And in a short came, Justin Long's scene as a doctor high on drugs was probably the best scene ever in the film.This film never got any publicity, not even a trailer or a poster. Why? Because Rupert Murdoch's greedy 20th Century Foxfilm corporation felt uncomfortable advertising an anti-corporate film like Idiocracy, and therefore they bury this film under the shadows of limited screenings.Still, this is a great comedy. In fact, if you're looking for the 40 Year Old Virgin of 2006, this is the one you're looking for. Funny, smart and a more hilarious version of Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men. If George Orwell thought of the future as being ruled by idiots, this is how it would have looked like.",Idiocracy

Well without tooting my own horn too much, but I'm a college graduate, a professional writer, and, here comes some ego, my IQ has been officially tested by PA Dept. of Edu to be 140, which is above average.So now that I sound like a pompous ass, I loved this movie. I feel that it probably can be enjoyed more as a commentary on the future downward spiral of the country. People who love low-brow humor (myself included) can get laughs out of the kicks to the balls because they're kicks to the balls. People who are more intellectual can get humor from the fact that this culture of idiots really enjoys kicks to the balls.I think intelligence is probably, for the most part, negligible in who will find this funny, but intelligent people can surely find a lot to laugh at.",Idiocracy

218,Frankaub-1,My favorite movie of all time,9,15 October 2020,"Yes, you read my title correctly, this movie is my favorite of all time and I think it's the most underrated movie ever to. Why you may ask? There are so many reasons to like this movie.My first argument, of course, is the humor. Even after countless times that I see this movie I still laugh a lot every time I see it.My second argument is that if you look past beyond the dumb joke, this movie is an intelligent critic of our society and predicts a terrible future for humankind if we don't do something to stimulate our mind. I don't know for sure that this is the direction that human is going to, but I know that some study really points in that direction.My third argument is the lessons that this movie teaches, which is to do something with your life. So many people and I include myself in that live their life without ever finding any purpose and just seek instant gratification like listening to a comedy, eat junk food, etc. This movie shows that if you chose to take action even an average Joe can achieve something great, but you have to be the leader of your life.Finally, I also think that every actor and actress in this movie are perfectly chosen for their role. Maya Rudolph is perfect as Rita, Luke Wilson is awesome as Joe and, of course, no one else could have done a better president Camacho as Terry Crews.To me the only downside is the overuse of CGI but even then, I think they did a terrific job with the budget they had.",Idiocracy

Smart people decide not to reproduce because they are responsible and think long-term and dumb people don't even think about birth control (or don't care), don't educate their offspring and pump out one baby after another.

I spent most of the time rolling my eyes and I'm almost ashamed to say, this movie made me laugh. It is a sinful joy.Completely average Private Joe Bowers, played by Luke Wilson and hooker Rita, played by Maya Rudolph are part of a Pentagon experiment to put soldiers in suspended animation. Joe and Rita are forgotten about when the people running the experiment are arrested and the base is turned into a garbage dump. Five hundred years pass as the world's population gets dumber and Joe and Rita sleep. Americans has been ravaged by their own stupidity. They have forgotten that water is for drinking, everyone speaks redneck-valley-ebonic-homey and everyone is named after a corporation. The president is a wrestler. Lawyers get their degree from Costco. They have forgotten science, medicine and all other useful knowledge, except how to drive. Everyone has a barcode tattooed on their wrist for identification and financial reasons.During a great garbage avalanche Joe and Rita are dislodged from their resting places in the garbage and abruptly flung into a world in desperate need of an IQ over 42. As soon as he gets out of his pod, Joe heads off to find a hospital. When he finally finds a hospital, the doctors are just as stupid as the regular people. When they realize he doesn't have a barcode all hell breaks loose. The doctor sets off an alarm that causes Joe to flee in fright.Rita figures out that she can make more money for less work because the men are so stupid. She convinces them to pay her for the anticipation of having sex. Rita never had to even have sex with anyone and she was making more money than before.Joe and Rita are reunited and help to solve the world's problems. The people are so ridiculously idiotic that they can't even remember that plants need water, not Gatorade. The premise of the movie feels like the internal monologue I've had with myself every time I go to the DMV or watch Maury, which is why I find it so humorous. How many times have you imagined, or better yet, feared, what would happen if the idiots who go on Jerry Springer ran the world. I believe Mike Judge has had that dialogue himself and decided to make it a movie. Most of the time, the characters are doing something so brainless that you can't help but roll your eyes. Watching the imbecilic motions of everyone other than Joe and Rita makes you feel the undeniable need to shake your head and laugh. It isn't that they are doing anything funny, if they were seven years old, but they are not seven and it is funny. Every single part of this movie is so over the top it is hard to take it seriously and I don't think Judge requires it of you. In order to believe that the world is run by people who are slightly retarded, you must let go of your lid and let stuff just spill over the top. I wonder if Judge was trying to make a cautionary tale. Maybe he is trying to encourage those of us who have a normal brain to spawn. Maybe he is trying to be funny. I don't care, it made me laugh none the less. Even still, I feel a deep shame in laughing. This movie is the Britney Spears record of cinema. Everyone taps their toes and no one admits they own the record. It would be difficult for me to admit in public, to my family or to my friends that I really like this movie.

There are a few funny parts, especially the opening sequences, but not too much after that. On the surface the idea of an average guy being deemed a genius sounded fun. A sort of futuristic Being There. And Judge's attacks on consumerism gave him lots of targets to shoot at. But it's almost as if Judge had too much on his plate. Perhaps if he narrowed his vision he could have focused on specific items.And in this post 9/11 world, I don't think a world of idiots would be as benign as it is portrayed in this movie.I pin most of the failure on Judge as the acting was sound. Everybody did a good job with their parts and you didn't feel that a change of personnel would make the material better.Luke Wilson is good. His role as a fish out of water is believable.Maya Rudolph is also good. Hopefully her association with this turkey doesn't limit her chances in the future. Besides acting great, she looks great.

Well, after Fukushima there might be a few more people than just physicists (like director Mike Judge) who know that this would be a good way to proceed. Now the joke is on us, the viewers.This, in essence, is the level of this movies subversiveness. It feels blunt like a sledgehammer, but it is very sarcastic and ultimately makes fun of its viewers. The ultimate joke is of course the very topic of the movie. It takes an old Nazi philosophy - eugenics - and shoves it down our throats so we admire it and laugh about how stupid it is to oppose it. It tells us straight in the face that ager the Nazis ""a greater power emerged - the UN. And it un-nazied the world forever"".

Turns out, he's the brightest one on the planet. On the surface, it's a very silly movie, and enjoyable on that level.There are two layers to this movie. One is the funny silly and at times deranged layer, and the other is a very serious layer. The silly layer is what people focus on, but the other is quite disturbing. One leads to the other.This deals with issues that could probably only be presented in a comedy and get away with it, just like 'The Twilight Zone' was dealing with contemporary issues in a science fiction setting. Our society is getting stupider. That's just a fact. Everything from obsessions with Kim Kardashian, a reality star, to the fact we are seriously considering electing a reality star with serious anger management issues to become President, the ridiculous obesity problem that Americans have to the enormous debt the average American has reveals this. It's easy to pull the wool over someone's eye's when they're shut. The powers that be love that.I could go on and on about the issues the movie raises, but let's take three things.Eugenics. A very dirty word since Hitler rose to power. This movie talks about it. When stupid people are breeding at a faster rate than smart people, society as a whole gets dumber. This should be obvious, but it's couched in language that is polite. In the wild, stupid people die off. In our society, they are supported and paid and encouraged to breed.Women as strictly sexual objects. In the future the movie envisions, that's all they are thought of. Places to get a prostitute, including the future Starbucks, predominate.The relentless dumbing down. One of the most popular shows on TV is called 'Ow! My Balls'. A show about someone getting hit in the testicles constantly.This is only a comedy by category, not in reality. Idiocracy is here, and has been here for some time. The movie portrays a former porn star and five time 'Ultimate Smack Down' champion as the President. We're not that far away.I've watched this movie close to 50 times, probably more than any other. All of the things it portrays are real, and really happening.The only thing that might be lacking is the casting. There were better people for the job, but they do a decent enough job. The concepts and writing make up for it. There are too many classic scenes in the movie to go into, but one is the scene in the hospital where the attending physician comes in and says, among other things, 'How's it hang essay, so I looked at your chart and it says your fkd up, your sh*t's all retarded, and you talk like a f*g'.

Nobody in the country, other than those who have been looking forward to this film, know anything about it. All the red flags have flown. It has to be a mess, it can't be anywhere near as good as Office Space, right? Wrong. Though Office Space it ain't, this film definitely has satirical bite and wit. It's a misfire on certain levels, but who's to blame is left to mystery.Based on what is currently showing in theatres, I can say IDIOCRACY is a good movie. It's funny, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. It's effective, sometimes ingenious. What it isn't as far as I can tell, is finished. We will see something come of this film again, whether it's an extended cut or reshoots. Alone it can be hilarious. It's ballsy at times.Leaving the theatre, looking around at the mall, I was surrounded by advertisements and billboards, commercialism and stupidity. It's not quite as damning a dystopia as 1984, but this movie paints an ugly future for our culture. And there doesn't seem to be much anybody can do about it.

Luke Wilson was his usual corny self. Maya Rudolph has definitely done better than this. And Terry Crews - well he's plays the character his plays best (outside of the Everybody Hates Chris) - the court jester. It was definitely a dynamic duo of poor taste and fallacious jokes.

246,gloshpit,Satire is a scalpel. This is a wrecking ball.,4,10 June 2007,"I'd heard various reports on this movie, some people loved it as being ""satirical"" and ""subversive"" whilst some complained about the lack of polish. I definitely fall into the latter camp - maybe if Fox had put some effort and interest into the film so that it could be better edited and have the bits that just weren't funny excised it could have been a scathing satire on modern-day values. Instead it's content to be amateurish and very sporadically funny.The concept is great. The future is an extrapolation of stupid rednecks breeding like rabbits whilst smart people have few (if any) children. Therefore the country gets flooded with stupid people, and the IQ levels plummet.The results do not match the concepts. Although there are some brilliant sequences (such as the much cited meeting to discuss what Brawndo is, with the cabinet just repeating the mantra of advertising) the makers seemed content to aim low and try to get laughs in the fact that hey, these people are kind of dumb - when the real humour comes from the outcome, the blind belief in advertising, the lowest-common-denominator programming. Just having people talk like they're retarded isn't funny in itself, but this movie tends to seem think it's enough to carry the film.A major part of the problem with the film is that you get flashes of genius when the satire is spot-on, but it never seems to be sure what aspect of modern America it's trying to undermine. There should have been more thought put into what exactly the targets were meant to be - people ending up like Jerry Springer audiences, being brain damaged, being rampant consumers, being mindless capitalists, being obsessed with sex and bodily functions... for a movie that tries to take a pop at stupidity, it fails due to not being smart enough itself. Maybe if Fox hadn't tried to pretend it didn't exist, maybe if someone else with creative control could have taken a look rather than it ending up a one-man self indulgence, maybe if given time it could become more polished and focused, it could have been a worthy successor to the hilarious Office Space. Instead it's a misfiring curio that I wouldn't bother watching through again - you see everything it has to offer first time around.",Idiocracy

248,David Spalding,"Flawed masterwork, definitely deserving of a better cut, better release",7,24 September 2006,"I just happened to be down in Texas this past week, which gave me a rare chance to see Mike Judge's latest film in its ""super-limited release"" by 20th Century Fox. Long story made short, the creator of Beavis & Butthead, Office Space and King of the Hill made this in 2004 ... preview audiences pooh-poohed it, some re-shooting was done a year later, and since then Fox has had a terrible time coming up with an ad campaign angle for it. Focus and test groups have responded negatively to various approaches. (Fox has never heard of ""word of mouth,"" and is apparently forgetting how Office Space became a cult hit in second run and home video releases.) So, presumably to satisfy contractual issues, they're releasing it in about 130 theaters, in only 7 cities. Most in Texas (where Judge lives). No advance adverts, no newspaper ads,... nothing. You pretty much have to trip over it by accident, or catch buzz of it on the grapevine.The question is obvious: is it a stinker, or just so outside-the-box that a conventional, studio release can't be done? My answer: a little of both. I won't spoil the plot (you can read it on Amazon or Yahoo or IMDb) for you.Some of the humor is gross, but it suits the story in which reverse natural selection (influenced by corporate and media interests, dumbing down the populace to a double-digit IQ standard) has made mankind a pack of shuffling, scatological morons. Much of Judge's satire is amazingly on target. This IS the guy whose modest workplace comedy became a mythic anthem to office workers everywhere who agreed that ""work sucks."" The motifs in OFFICE SPACE have spawned dozens of derivative works. The same may not play out here, but the wit and social commentary in IDIOCRACY is just as fresh.The production values are terrific. Though clearly shot on a budget, the film ably depicts a future dystopic America, where various crises and inaction have left the country a garbage strewn slum, a claustrophobic cage of advertising, discarded packaging, thoughtless automated vending machines, and decadence. I was repeatedly wishing I could freeze-frame the images and focus on the background details ... which clearly were as funny as what was in foreground focus.Clearly, the film needs re-editing. It drags in spots. It shifts back to the bookend, mock-documentary narration at odd transitions, sometimes just summarizing a scene that isn't moving fast enough. Yeah, very clunky. The narration gives the whole film a distance from the lead character that saps energy. When you ought to be in his skin, seeing ""Uh-merica"" in 2505 through his eyes, the narration has you standing in a lab smock, watching this pilgrim's progress through a telescope. Portions of the script come across as a first draft, so fresh and candid that it wasn't subjected to needed rewrites to polish the ""jewels in the rough."" That Judge crafted a non-stop comedy that is essentially apocalyptic sci-fi tragedy dressed up with wit and gags, is impressive. Animal House crossed with Soylent Green, if that makes sense. Office Space was unassuming, but close analysis of it yields a deep well of mythic parody and commentary on modern life. (Well, *I* think so. ;) ) If Hollywood execs expected more of the same, he failed. If they wanted him to up the ante, it would seem that he DID. He just didn't do it in the direction they wanted.It's not playing in your town unless you live in one of the seven Fox contracted for. Maybe letters or phone calls to local theaters, or letters to Fox directly, could remedy that. But most likely, you'll be seeing this on DVD within 6-8 months. Hopefully the disc will include bonus production info and deleted scenes that provide insight into this slightly flawed masterwork.",Idiocracy

I didn't find anything unwatchable. The story is funny all the way through, and there are a number of spoofs on real-world things, taken to the Nth degree, that are frighteningly believable in the context of how the world may become. The main thing that I really liked was that it's corporations that dumb us down - not just our own inherent stupidity or bad genes. I like the jabs taken at Gatorade, Fast Food, the Health Care Industry, Government. It was all so well done, and the best part about a Mike Judge movie is that in the middle of absurdity, he captures very real situations - satire at its best. Maya Rudolph and Luke Wilson both played their characters well. Most of the main characters were great. I am surprised that Luke Wilson takes parts like this when Owen Wilson gets higher profile roles - Luke is definitely the better actor... that's my 2 cents.",Idiocracy

Especially when you are thinking about those young people fresh out of college turning in their CVs with grammar and spelling mistakes.The film moves on with high pace and it doesn't leave much room to subtleties, but the in your face humor is perfectly balanced, and not for the second it doesn't feel cheap. Luke Wilson carries the film perfectly as average Joe (his name, Joe, was nice wordplay itself) thrown into unfamiliar surroundings where he discovers that he might be the smartest man in the world.The horrific thing is that the world depicted in the movie probably isn't 500 years away, but rather a 100.",Idiocracy

I just don't know that it didn't contribute to the very thing that it satires. Mike Judge has written some hilarious social commentary in the past, but the cartoonish characters of even the main character and the people that we were supposed to understand as average made some of the messages ring hollow. Making comments about developing good film in a film with cartoonish writing just comes off as unwittingly oblivious to your own skills as a writer. It reminds me of an interview where Chevy Chase makes a snarky comment about lazy comedies. Someone next to him had to remind him that he starred in several Vacation movies. I liked Idiocracy. I would indeed see it again. I just think that the writing of Wall-E did successfully what the writing of Mike Judge did rather clumsily here.",Idiocracy

273,zanity,An all too rare example of a sci-fi themed movie,8,30 December 2006,"Part Sleeper, part Logan's Run and part Futurama, Idiocracy is an example of the rarest big screen (yeah, I know Fox never allowed that in the end) genre.Usually Hollywood gives us mock sci-fi, like The Island, Deja Vu, and Children of Men, where a very different kind of film steals the clothes of science fiction to disguise its own inner worthlessness. Comic book hero films I consider their own genre.Idiocracy is also a very unsubtle satire that seeks to attack those that currently rule the USA without ever mentioning them by name. Indeed, Mike Judge bends over backwards to ensure that a simple-minded analysis of his film reveals it to be harmless to any present day entity, but Judge's enemies within Murdoch's empire are anything but stupid, and took offensive at the real message Judge embedded within his writing.Recognising the paradox of needing the approval of the very audience his film so ruthlessly lampoons, Judge makes the ultimate message of Idiocracy big-hearted and affectionate, an act of commercial cowardice that he probably regrets, in the light of Fox's actions.Anyway, Idiocracy is a harmless and surprisingly entertaining science fiction romp, albeit one that steals every single one of its ideas and jokes from far more skilled creative talents, especially the people behind The Simpsons and Futurama. It is obvious that a lot of love went into this film, but equally obvious (as the constant dodgy, but 'flavour-giving' narration proves- always an indication of problems in the story-telling) that the director never found a structure that met with common approval during the production process.Compensating for failures in originality and purpose are many, many wonderful vistas showing the ruination of urban US life 500 years into the future. The special effects may not have a 'Star Wars' budget, but they are used with a grand imagination that easily surpasses the written script, and reminded me of drawings from the golden age of Mad Magazine.The performers of Idiocracy are hardly a reason to watch the movie, but don't spoil it either. The astonishingly bland and untalented Luke Wilson (how does this guy get work- at least his even less talented brother has the looks) is cast in a role that attempts to make a virtue of his 'limitations'. Most of the rest of the cast are merely required to look stupid, and most of them do, albeit rarely in an entertaining way.Idiocracy is just one of those films that works as a whole, being, as a sum of its parts, significantly better than any of those parts taken individually. This, of course, is the very description of Mike Judge's successes. Dissected and analysed, his body of work rapidly falls to bits, but art is about the effectiveness of the whole, not the parts.If you like science fiction, if you like Futurama, if you can forgive a writer that has to steal almost everything from his 'betters', and if you are more interested in the creativity of special effects rather than their CGI 'perfection', you may well enjoy this movie.There is also the strong possibility that you will like Idiocracy if you are one of those people Judge is mocking, without realising that you fall into that category, but then again, one presumes that without this type of appeal, Fox would never have greenlit Idiocracy in the first place.Oh, and the film as a comedy? Well, again, really in the vein of classic 'Mad Magazine', and that means that many won't really find it funny at all, but those that do will most likely find it extremely funny.",Idiocracy

275,twistedhooch,The idiots at Fox have a lot to answer for...,8,19 March 2007,"I am a fan of Mike Judge, but I have to ask, why would he let Fox distribute another one of his movies after the debacle they made with Office Space? Needless to say, they royally made another mess of the release of his latest, Idiocracy. I would be curious what he would say on the matter as, alongside Beavis and Butthead Do America, Idiocracy is another great example of the clever-idiotic comedy genre (see also Dodgeball). The premise for the film is essentially live-action-Futurama, only with future inhabitants being idiots. This is a strong idea, well handled, and the joke ratio is good, even by Judge's own track record. Idiocracy is full of great sight gags, similar in nature to the early Simpsons or the aforementioned Futurama. The satire on dumb-down American culture is razor-sharp, a world that considers water 'the stuff in the toilet', and a world with a 'violence channel'. Several big name corporations are probably regretting licensing their names for this film, as they are taken to task for their part in creating a futuristic world where people are consumers rather than citizens  this isn't a world too far from our own by any stretch of the imagination. Luke Wilson is in strong form as everyman Joe Bowers, a guy sent from the present day to a future where he is the smartest man alive. The future idiots are also well cast, and very amusing, in particular President Camacho (Terry Crews) and Frito (Dax Shapherd).Though not perfect - the scale of the story is probably a bit too much for the budget, and the running length isn't long enough - Mike Judge has created a world that is prescient, plausible and scary, but always with a strong focus on the comedic elements. Fox, meanwhile, have done everything they can to bury this film. Didn't they release Dude, Where's My Car? and the American 'adaptation' of Taxi? Idiots!",Idiocracy

The podcast panel talked so much about it, it made me look up on IMDb to read about it. Weeks after, I went to get OfficeSpace and found the movie so funny, I couldn't wait until Idiocracy comes out on DVD.When it came out in May or June in Australia, I was so annoyed because it was only available to rent. Well I don't want to rent and then buy, so I patiently wait in pain. Before I knew it was on sale, I notice a shopping pamphlet was selling it cheap. I went there as soon as I could, grab it from the shelf, throw it to the register and buy it before making any second thoughts.After watching it, I realise I had never pay so much attention to a stupid movie such as this.

About a decade ago he struck again with the now cult-status Office Space. Now he provides us with the sleeper-hit Idiocracy. Done mostly in CGI and green screen, the films concepts and story lines are both fresh and original, which perhaps motivated the straight-to-DVD release. If Hollywood has learned anything it's that anything fresh, new, or original is scary (SEE: Norbit and Epic Movie's combined successes). Arguably as well, however, the movie is no immediate cult hit or must own gem.The film is funny as hell, and is in many ways reminiscent of a George A. Romero zombie flick. A lot of the films gags and jokes are visual like AIRPLANE!and play off the same nostalgic humor as Futurama (pay close attention to the billboards and signs in the background).

However these gems are often mired by moments of base humour that are both unfunny and unwelcome. Thankfully they never seem to drag the film low enough to spoil what is otherwise a very fun movie with great characters, set pieces and modern cultural references (the slander of giants like Starbucks and Costco not only provide avid amusement but also contain a sense of (albeit far fetched) realism).This isn't a masterpiece and don't expect any real thought-provoking satire but I don't think Mike Judge wanted it to be either.

293,Sec_Education,This comment brought to you by Carl's Jr.,10,29 January 2007,"This movie is comedy gold. The cabinet discussion of Brawndo and the nature of electrolytes is worth the ticket price alone. Standout performances were Luke Wilson in the title role, Dax Shephard as Frito, and of course, President Dwayne Elezando Mountain Dew Camacho (I give you my WORD!). It's simply worth seeing, because the comedy is both excellent the subject is something that has not been dealt in this way for most of the history of film.It is a telling indictment of Hollywood that this movie has been dumped by Fox. It had everything for a comedy; directed by Mike Judge, starring Luke Wilson, and IMDb rating of 6.3, which is very good for a comedy. (Note that Austin Powers 2, the best of that series, only gets 6.5.) Why was it not promoted? Why is it not being shown in Australian cinemas?Anyone who says that money is the only thing that matters to studio execs is at best naive. This film would have made very respectable money. The reason why it was dropped is that it is anti-dysgenic, in other words, pro-eugenic. It is a sad fact that in the media, we can't see any discussion of eugenics without reference to the forced sterilization and euthanasia of Germany in the 30s and 40s. Which of course, is curiously absent any discussion of how typical such policies were in other countries such as the United States.Mike Judge makes that very point at the end of the film. At the end of WWII, the ""UN"" un-Nazified everything. And it's true. In order to justify our own victory, we have thrown the baby out with the bathwater. Eugenics does not require forced sterilization or euthanasia. What it does requires is that the media provide positive encouragement for intelligent people to have children, and discouragement against stupid people from having children. Instead, it does the opposite.Another great thing about this movie was the positive portrayal of IQ as a useful concept. That is another thing that doesn't seem to be able to be discussed without reference to Gould's Mismeasure of Man, and how IQ has been ""discredited"". Well, guess what. If you can't answer a question as simple as ""If you have a bucket holding 5 gallons and another bucket holding 8 gallons, how many buckets do you have?"" correctly, there will be all sorts of other important real world ramifications:1) You aren't going to discover a cure for cancer, no matter how many Hollywood movies tell you that work ethic is going to get you there. 2) There are all sorts of jobs that you are simply not cut out for, and should not expect to be promoted into. 3) Lotteries, an inheritance, pro sports, prostitution, violent crime, or danger money are your only realistic chances of making a lot of money, and they are either slim or come with huge risks attached. 4) A nation comprised of people unable to answer such questions will make very little technological progress and have low GDP/capita, perpetual famines, etc.It should be bleedingly obvious, but it is testament to the power of Hollywood that it actually needs to be said.Kudos to Mike Judge for putting out this film. He won't make any money from this film, but thanks to file-sharing and the DVD burner, this film will soon be a cult classic irrespective of the actions of Fox. Those who see it will leave it with the knowledge that the future of the world is in their hands.

(There's even a not-so-subtle nod to ""Bottle Rocket"" in an early scene).Maya Rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former ""painter"" who was frozen as well.Despite all its strengths, ""Idiocracy"" has the distinct feel of a movie that was taken away from the director/editor before it could be fine-tuned.I cannot for the life of me understand why a movie this funny would just be dumped into a few theaters with no advanced screenings, no trailers, no marketing whatsoever.It's as if the studio decided they were not going to spend any more on it and just walked away.Or maybe they thought the movie had the makings of a cult classic, and the only way for it to become a true cult classic was to set it up to fail? Whatever the case, it is a shame, because Mike Judge and this film in particular deserve better.I predict this movie will have real legs on DVD, and word of mouth will propel it to the success it deserves.Perhaps the Fox Executives saw themselves in the characters, were confused, and thought it was a documentary?",Idiocracy

Three days later the movie still haunts me to the point where I had to come here and post a review.This doesn't mean that I think that Idiocracy is a perfect movie. It has logic holes so big you could drive a monster truck through them. But somehow, I think this is part of the point of the film. If it got everything right, it could have gone down as one of the great dystopian sci-fi classics of the ages, but that's not this movie's goal. Its goal is humor with a message, a much more honorable goal in an era where horror surrounds us on all sides. Idiocracy parodies itself even as it's making important points about the direction that the world is headed. Or at least America.No, this movie isn't going to solve any of the problems it presents in alarming and almost horrifyingly believable detail. This isn't going to make any movie critic's top 100 lists anytime soon, but I'll argue that it's a movie that most Westerners will see something familiar lurking in the background. Using all those images, archetypes and visuals that our subconscious minds have absorbed since birth, it warns you while it makes you laugh.I can only hope that this film becomes another cult hit for Mike Judge.",Idiocracy

The film reminds me of Woody Allen's ""Sleeper"" ,""RoboCop"", ""Planet of the Apes"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""Network"" and the late great ""Futurama"".

297,imdbjeff,Just how stupid does this movie have to be for people to get the point?,8,3 September 2006,"Let me start by saying that if you're expecting subtle humour, you're in the wrong theatre. It's low-brow and heavy-hitting. But he's not out to tickle your funny bone. He's got the sledgehammer out and he's drawn a bead on the side of your head. But fear not. As movies go, this is a fairly gentle education. Oh, also, heavy on the swearing, but once again, Mike Judge, not Fred Rogers.Was this movie called 'intelliocracy'? F*** no. The gem, the essence that is Mike Judge is that he has the ability to make people laugh at themselves. Beavis and Butthead was most popular with teen-aged boys, the very people at which it incessantly poked fun.With that in mind, I don't think the humour in this movie is aimed at the super intelligent. Maybe you are all too smart to get it. But he's not aiming at you. He's aiming at your average Joe. And he's got a message: get your act together and for god's sake, study botany! It is a little disjointed and the narrator gets to be a little irritating after a while, but once again, this movie is meant for people who need a lot of narration ;-) It's funny. It has a message that it wants to make sure that we all understand.I question the casting of Luke Wilson in the role of a man with a 100 IQ. Sometimes, he's not able to play down (what's he got, like, a 104?) to the level of his character. Slightly forced at times.Kudos on Dax Shepard in this one. I remember seeing him in Zathura and thinking, ""This guys looks like an idiot."" In this movie, he makes a great idiot. Maybe I'm psychic.It took a while to warm up to Maya Rudolph, but I gave her a little leeway. After all, she did have to play straight man to an entire planet. But once she got a little screen time, she made a solid contribution.Terry Crews played the same psychotic, aggressive character he's played many times before, but he makes a first-rate president none the less.Another bonus is that the place was practically empty. Counting my girlfriend and I, there were literally six people in the theatre. We could've had a barbecue pit and a mariachi band. So, no annoying people talking, as appears to be the norm in the 'talking-to-the-tv' age.All in all, a good premise and a competent delivery, given the intended goal. Lots of laughs sprinkled throughout.What made this movie scary was the fact that when we walked out of the theatre, it was sort of like the movie was still playing. We saw a lot of idiocy in the people immediately around us, maybe made more apparent by the dose we got in the theatre....They're all pods, all of them!",Idiocracy
298,mickekarlsson1974,No longer a comedy...,8,18 August 2020,"I saw this sometime back in 2009-10, and thought it was kind of fun, but completely over the top and ridiculous.
It felt like a wafer thin plot used to run one cheap joke after the other, all based on roughly the same premise. That humanity's race towards stupidity, in 500 years time, has reached maximum peak.Well... Guess what...It is now August 2020 and I just saw this again, for the second time in my life.
It turns out Idiocracy has transformed into some sort of Kafka'esque nightmare!
When watching those first ten minutes after Joe wakes up in 2505, when he's walking around trying to get his bearings in the sea of morons, getting assaulted because he sounds smart, I wasn't thinking ""this is beyond ridiculous"" (like I did 11-12 years ago). Now I just couldn't help feeling totally frustrated about the whole situation, and empathetic with Joe. My wife, who was seeing it for the first time, reacted with a blunt ""This is a total nightmare!"".Don't get me wrong now.
This is still a great comedy, it has just gone from an over-the-top ridiculous one, to a prophetic piece of commentary on current society.
It was of course just that even back in 2006, but it was just NO WAY to imagine how far (or low) we would have come in a mere 14 years.
I think Mike Judge's estimate of 500 years is far too generous.

It takes the ""What if"" situation to an extreme and it doesn't pull any punches (or kicks to the groin). It makes you think... what is to become of this empire once we've gotten totally to lazy and stupid? Everyone gets hit in this one esp. a number of major corporations, and even Fox News takes a punch(which is probably why the movie never had a proper release - other than the marketing department over thinking the campaign and not knowing how to market it ""so we'll just give up!"") Some may find the movie sophomoric, due to the groin kicking, and farting, but the movie is much more than that. You either get what Mike Judge is saying, or you don't. Most of the negative reviews I've read seem to come from people who just don't get it or are film snobs.It'll probably play for one week in the selected markets so if you miss it, keep an eye out for the DVD, it'll be worth the rental and I will eventually have it in my collection.Good Job Mike Judge, it's a shame that you got screwed, but you made me laugh out loud and I look forward to the next movie you do.",Idiocracy

The movie is littered extensively with detailed nuance drawn from contemporary observations by its makers. It can be productively viewed with a critical eye, and its extrapolation of ubiquitous contemporary clues generate a marvelous  if vaguely depressing  satire in the best traditions of literary history. It is at once accessible and profound. The movie's troubling vision is a successful blend of comedy and tragedy.

Mike Judge breaks the stagnant mold of pop culture and the homo-erotic bias of Hollywood to direct this amazing feature... with magnificent results.Even the research gone into the psychology of his characters speak volumes. The way it explores the many subtle nuisances of consumerism present even in our modern culture is beyond compare. The viewer take note: this film ventures into the darkness of mankind and the very heart of Corporate America, and does not hold back to what is regarded as a believable and an adroit masterpiece.Mike Judge's awe inspiring direction makes Stanley Kubrick look like Uwe Boll. When I finished this film, I couldn't speak for three weeks.

303,tygerhardt,Starts out strong...peters out at the end.,7,8 January 2007,"I felt this film started out really strong. It made it's point brilliantly and if you're like me and you hate a lot of what passes as entertainment in our consumer culture and you have a knack for spotting how cultural trends evolve you almost get the impression that Judge is a modern day Nostradamus.He also scores points for casting Luke Wilson in this role. Wilson seems to have found his niche playing relatively straight laced characters who are amusingly dumbfounded by the extraordinary level of absurdity that surrounds their lives (take his character in Old School for example).Initially Idiocracy reminded me a little bit of Woody Allen's ""Sleeper"".I can also see why some folks may be put off by this film. The cultural divide in America at this time is pretty wide and it really takes a poke at the more obtuse side of said divide.Where I find fault with this film is some of the characters are a little under developed (for instance...what of Beef Supreme? It could have added a lot to make the later half of the film more engaging had we known a little more about his history earlier on in the film). Or President Camacho...it would have been interesting to see a bit more of how this society developed into what it became.Like I said initially, the first half really comes out swinging but pretty much from the middle on, it loses a little steam...and the ending was pretty disappointing. It's almost felt like the studio forced them to put a typical Hollywood style ""everything worked out fine and they lived happily ever after"" ending. And the post credit ""extra"" was pretty lame and unnecessary.I think if this film could have delivered solidly from start to finish, it could have easy been one of the most scathing social commentaries since Network.Sadly it falls just short of the mark at the end, however the first half of the film makes this film worth watching.",Idiocracy

Knowing it was a ridiculous comedy, i suspended my intellect and sat down wanting to be absurdly entertained. Idiocracy defines itself, limiting any true comedy that would make one cry from laughter and presenting forth a story of outrageous scientific theory and retardation. Joe participates in a military experiment gone wrong, and winds up 500 years into the future with a companion hooker as humanity has degraded mentally into uneducated buffoons incapable of even realizing water grows plants.Society is stuck in neutral, actually starting to shift in reverse when Joe fights his way out of prison, eluding capture, and grabbing the attention of the president with his IQ test score. Joe winds up serving as secretary of the interior of the united states and is forced to prove his intellect solving crop problems, trash pile up, and the cultural and economic dependence on carl's jr and brawndo corp. Joe and his Hooker Rita wind up saving the day, escaping a rehabilitation death trap with Beef Supreme, and ultimately becoming the President of the United states. The movie is fun, and should not be taken seriously what so ever.

The scenes showing how far we had fallen, specifically with the doctor, the TV shows, and the court proceedings, were fantastic. ""You talk like a fag!"" Awesome. We all know people like this, now. Shades of Beavis and Butthead.The movie really didn't have anywhere to go from here and slid for a while and didn't quite keep it's footing.

It wasn't hyped at all by the studios, nor did I even hear about it's release from my normally plugged in friends. After throwing my money away on so many bad movies this year, I wish I could've seen this one in theaters as opposed to DVD. Mike Judge is the master of disguising deliciously intelligent humor in a low brow package. Just watch ""King of the Hill"" for a while...it's ostensibly redneck humor, but it's a very subtle jab at rednecks while being very sympathetic at the same time. I read the tagline for this film, and immediately I ordered it off the internet. I really don't understand where these negative reviews are coming from, except maybe from Carl's Jr. This movie is not only hilarious, but it's balanced as well. Moments of levity are interspersed between hilarious sight gags and jabs at our current superstar/corporate culture. Sure, there is some fart humor, but it's only there to laugh at derisively. The premise is only semi-plausible, but since when did that even matter? I don't see people heaping scorn upon ""Futurama"" because the premise is very similar. Just watch this movie.

The narration, for starters, really dumbs things down, which isn't the smartest thing to put in a movie that is about dumbing down. The last half hour is virtually laugh free and also very stupid. And Maya Rudolph, despite being one of the main characters, could have been cut from the film completely and you wouldn't even know anything was missing. Not to mention her whole prostitute gag isn't even remotely funny, yet she commands a significant amount of screen time, sucking the life out of the movie frame by frame.So why a 7 out of 10? Because despite its numerous flaws, its been nearly a year since I've first seen Idiocracy and I still regularly quote the movie and it still comes up in conversations between my friends and I. In Idiocracy's future of the damned, there are some over the top ideas of what a low IQ society would be like. And in present day America, I regularly see things that aren't too far off. For instance, in Idiocracy, Carl's Jr. offers everything with ""Big Ass Fries!"" Almost by coincidence, Idiocracy contains a shot of Fuddrucker's, which has menus that downplay their sensibly sized burgers but champion their ""will cause diabetes"" sized items. I'm pretty sure that if you order a salad at Fuddruckers, the cashier is instructed to call you a pussy.It goes on from there. The overt sexuality in advertising, the lowest common denominator movies and TV shows, news broadcasts that will do anything to avoid being boring, pornstar/ fighter presidents, a costco that offers everything (from furniture to law degrees), most of these ideas are worth a laugh or two, but they're much funnier when you start to see similar things happening right now.Idiocracy is still a pretty bad movie, but I highly recommend that everyone see it and take what they can from it.",Idiocracy

There are definitely some hilarious parts to the movie consisting of some really clever and smart humor.

There had to be an outstanding contractual obligation for him to do this or maybe he was a victim of 'shotgun casting'. Fortunately I got my money's worth as I watched this on a plane. I fear some may categorize this piece of feces as a 'cult classic' for future cable channel broadcasting. Mike Judge's previous work, Office Space, is a perfect example of that. However lightning doesn't strike twice. It is hard to describe how bad this film really is, but please, it is not worth investing your time to find that out. In concept it sounds like a great idea, but the writing and directing is so terrible that maybe their significant others actually performed the work. There were so many opportunities to be just a bit more clever with the story and the dialog, but it it never breaks that membrane. Give me Ringo Starr in Caveman. That was fun idiocracy!

If you read the fanboy reviews on IMDB you'll get the idea that you're in for more of the same. And in a way, that's true, but this flick doesn't have the charm of Office Space. Thirty minutes into the film I was waiting for it to get past the feeling of being a trailer, and it never did. For me the social commentary *did* in fact get buried under the lowbrow fart jokes. The jokes were MEANT to be funny instead of occurring naturally or based off interplay between the characters, and it shows.In Mike Judge's cult classic Office Space, most everyone can identify with the stereotyped characters, and most everyone probably knows a person like that. In Idiocracy, you recognize that the characters are based on contemporary society, but they're not loveable in any way. Because of this the watchability suffers.For only the second time in my life I turned off a movie and found something else to do rather than continue suffering, because continuing to watch it was just painful.

Giving them a purpose in the world. And it seems only the worse people breed the most. I can understand how others don't like it. It doesn't help most of the jokes were 2nd grade bathroom humor.

The world has been reduced to impulsive shallow people who only care about money and sex and self promotion. Enter the 2 stars, Maya Rudolf and Wilson who are well below average intelligence as part of a botched scientific experiment. At first they are ridiculed and persecuted by Trump and his followers because they use logic and they believe in science. Compared to Trump supporters they are actually geniuses. When Wilson tries to convince Trump that crops will grow if they use water from toilets instead of gator aid Trump and his followers mock him because they think water is only used for flushing toilets. Trump decides to do a public execution of Wilson in a modern day version of his reality show called ""Your Fired"". In this version of the show he uses actual fire to kill his rivals. This movie is a very accurate representation of Trump's rise to power. I don't get why it is not part of the documentary genre but I guess that's because it's hard to believe that someone like Donald Trump could rise from a reality TV star to actually garnering enough votes to become the leader of the free world.Trump nearly destroys the civilized world and only then do his followers realize a very stupid man and woman from the past can use their high school level understanding of science to save the world.This is a hilarious movie that depicts what can happen if you stop thinking for yourself.",Idiocracy

For technical skill - tightness of writing, directing, acting - Judge's previous effort Office Space beats it hands down. It shows its age with liberal use of prejudicial slurs, which is fine by me in an artistic context, but some of the progressives might object (therein missing the point - though it really could have been toned down just a little, there is at least one point the joke goes too far. Hey it was the aughts. If you really want to be offended, go watch Airplane again).But it foresaw a trend in the zeitgeist that many people still don't recognize, which is that we're screwing ourselves stupid. I share Judge's opinion that the smarter you are the less children you are likely to have. (I myself have two, so I must not be that brilliant, but I'm an optimist and believe in intelligent propagation. Someone needs to make sure we don't irrigate the crops with Gatorade.) And whether it's nature or nurture, stupid begets stupid. In reality we are farther down this path than Judge, or anybody, realized. It wouldn't nearly take until the year 2500 for us to devolve this far.We'd never reach 2500, we'd do ourselves in long before that.

Joe, and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph), become the test subjects for a military project of a hibernation chamber. They were to remain suspended for only one year, but due to lack of oversight, Joe and Rita are forgotten about and accidentally wake up 500 years in the future.Here's the scary part: This film explains, in a very realistic and plausible way, how the entire population of 2505 became absolutely retarded. With no natural predators, the evolution of the human species does not necessarily favor the quickest, smartest, and strongest people for progression of genes... just the people who breed the most. Unfortunately, those people happen to be welfare-sucking, trailer trash idiots who breed like rabbits. This abundant reproduction of the stupid people has caused an adverse effect on societal growth and now Joe and Rita are the two smartest human beings on the face of the planet. If it helps, imagine the entire population as just a hybrid of rednecks, jocks, cholos and hoochies. Seeing this nightmarish dystopia, Joe learns of and attempts to track down a time machine to see if he and Rita can get back to when they came from, and that's basically the whole plot.But despite how one-dimensional I may make it sound, this movie is higher brow than you can fathom. Nuances are everywhere and anyone can see glimpses (warning signs, if you will) of modern day dumb-ciety permeating facets of everyday life and turning it into the train wreck on display in ""Idiocracy."" The film has some truly awesome showcases of realistic retardedness put on a pedestal. I don't want to give anything away and ruin jokes for you, but let's just say that it is pretty thorough. I can see how some would say that it is just a lot of toilet humor, but it, odd as it may seem, has a purpose; to show how dumb and crass these people are.This film, unfortunately, is destined to see the same fate as its predecessor, ""Office Space""; no one will see it in theaters, but everyone will brag about discovering this awesome/funny movie when it comes out on video. My only complaint for the film would be that the flow of the narrative sometimes gets broken so they can do a Hitchhiker's-Guide-to-the-Galaxy type exposition on how things got to be where they are, but it is a necessary evil and is implemented better here. Other than that, good characters, funny jokes, and better-than-average social commentary wrapped up in a funny bow.Final Note: If seeing our youth becoming gang-banger wanna-be's, acting like redneck/ ghetto trash and being proud of it... if you are educated and cultured in anyway and can see how our country is spiraling out of control into an abyss of stupidity, for god sakes, watch this movie.",Idiocracy

331,ranchelon,A really interesting concept made into a pretty good comedy,7,16 January 2016,"Idiocracy revolves around the concept of society in 2505. The movie starts off with a segment about evolution and the development of the human race. Explaining that unlike animals, humans do not have any natural predators and we do not have to be the strongest or smartest in order to reproduce. So anyone can have kids no matter how stupid they are. This results in dumb people having lots of kids and the smarter people sticking with one or two or no kids at all. Overtime this results in a rapid decline in the average IQ of humanity.Meanwhile the government is experimenting with the freezing of their soldiers while they're still in their prime. If war ever breaks out they can simply unfreeze them and have their best men ready for battle.However this system needs to be tested and the government decides to test it on Joe and Rita, our main characters. They were supposed to be unfrozen a year later but a freak accident causes the man behind the experiment to be arrested and our Joe and Rita are left in their stasis for 500 years.When they awaken in the future they find that the human race has dumbed down exponentially and they're the smartest people on earth. Joe and Rita now have to find a way back to their own time while trying to communicate and work with people that are no smarter then the average toddler.The main meat of this movie are all the little visual gags and jokes revolving around the extremely stupid society. It's basically showing how stupid the human race can be in a similar fashion to the South Park Honey Boo Boo episode.The biggest issue with this movie is the effects. With the relatively small budget that this movie had it's no surprise that the effects aren't fantastic. Especially now that it's aged a bit the quality of the effects really start to show.Overall i'd say it's definitely worth a watch. It has some really entertaining jokes, the acting is decent and it's kind of intriguing to watch someones view of society in 500 years. It makes you think if everyone in the future will be complete morons and what you would do if you were the smartest person on earth. It's pretty good and i'd recommend to check it out, you just might find something to like.",Idiocracy

Although the movie is from 2006, it could not be more on point in 2018. The over the top gags are hilarious, even the teenage humor of the 'Aw my balls' bit will have you ROTF.

I spent most of the film with my jaw dropped and in disgust knowing that we are headed in that direction. I like how detailed they were in this film in the costumes, showing that advertisements and labels of Mega Corporations pry their way into people's everyday lives. I hope people see this film and do realize that we are headed into that direction and that Average Joe's can make a difference, if they tried.",Idiocracy
335,Media Boy,If Office Space was Kane is this Ambersons?,9,5 November 2006,"Idiocracy screened in Minneapolis last night at midnight. One show only, and the only press about the showing was fairly negative reprints of other towns reviews. Still, well over a hundred people showed up and seemed to throughly enjoy the movie.I have to say this is not Mike Judge's best work but it is clearly visionary and remarkably interesting to watch. The jokes that are built into the scenery stack up and multiply as the film goes on. Wilson's performance was quite good and I have to say this is the first time I liked Maya Rudolph. Some of the plot turns in the third act seem kind of canned, but less so than 80 percent of current Hollywood comedy.It is easy to understand why Fox is killing this film softly. This is one of the most subversive movies to be released in recent years. I won't repeat a lot of the jokes you have read about regarding what has happened to Starbucks, Fudruckers and FoxNews, but they can't be happy. For me Judge's damnation is pointed towards what happens when branding and advertising become too close to the identity of the individual citizen (as opposed to consumer).In the end the film just seems over finished. It looked like lawyers were in the editing booth and dictating the voice over narration. Someday in the future we might get to see a director's cut, but I wouldn't hold my breath. We can celebrate the announcement that Judge will no longer make movies where he doesn't have final cut.",Idiocracy
336,dsnicol,"Humor, but difficult because also a warning",8,22 January 2007,"This film has its moments and elements that are truly funny. But most of the jokes ring with so much truth, truth that is truly frightening for the future, that the laughter comes with a sense of fear as well.The visual imagery of the film is VERY unsettling too. All of the oranges and blues together make you feel like your are in some bizarre alien world. But as soon as you remember that this is still earth, and still humanity in front of you, concern hits you again even while you are laughing.Overall, this film presents a serious message about the lack of respect for intelligence in our modern society in the only way it can do so without causing outrage: as a comedy. As such, it succeeds as best as I think it possibly can.I recommend this to anybody who is smart enough to get the jokes and to feel the meaning behind them.",Idiocracy
337,amy-707,Expected Better,3,19 January 2007,"Anyone saying this was as good or better than ""Office Space"" must have watched a whole different movie than me. My husband and I both thought ""Idiocracy"" was idiotic.No, I didn't miss the point. Matter of fact, the point and some of the subtle background humor was more amusing than the plot, characters, acting or jokes. I enjoyed seeing the Mac guy as an imbecile doctor, and I enjoyed pegging other actors and what they were/are known for. That's about where my amusement ends.The story idea was full of potential that really just lacked in execution. It COULD have been clever. It SHOULD have been less over the top... and it WOULD have been more than just a 2 hour fart joke.Wish it had lived up to my expectations.",Idiocracy

340,beamsterkaas,A Comedy?,3,14 April 2007,"Although Idiocracy paints a scarily true future for America, I wonder if that is all it sets out to do. For a movie that advertises itself as a comedy, its humor was surprisingly lackluster. In an idea that was so rich with possible laughs, I found myself laughing at perhaps only 2 or 3 lines. This movie did not make me see the world differently, nor did it make me laugh. It also didn't make me giggle, chuckle, snicker, snort, or, except for a few instances, smile. As Iwatched the movie I could feel my face slowly moving into a look of semi-consciousness. I believe that at one point I began to drool. I'm wondering if whoever bothered to fund this movie read the screenplay first.",Idiocracy
341,cdwebdesign,"worth watching once, for a half price rental",7,4 February 2007,"This is a comedy that got a few good laughs out of me, and a couple great ones as well. It was certainly not the best movie, and not the worst. It doesn't break any new ground by any means, but it does not try to either. It is a comedy that does not take itself too seriously, and uses it's ridiculous/silly premise to help set up the off-the-wall jokes and situations that are funny. I enjoyed watching it once, but would not ever consider watching it again. We got it on a two-for-one rental, and it was worth it for that price; if it had cost $4 or so instead, my woman and I would both have felt a bit cheated I think. If you've got a good sense of humor, aren't too critical, and can find a laugh in just about anything, it's probably worth a watch. I'd suggest watching the top 100 comedy films first however, if you can find such a list.",Idiocracy
342,wishonweinstein,"Spot on premise, poor delivery.",6,24 September 2007,"Don't get me wrong, it was a decent movie overall. But the big selling point in my opinion was the premise of the movie. It's near terrifying to see in the opening minutes of the movie are dead on, saying that our future is deemed stupid and ignorant because of the fact that Darwin's principle law is found to be ineffective under the conditions for the human race. The narrator sums it up nicely. So the movie should be suggested for the premise, not for the actual movie because it was not the greatest I've seen. Not horrible though.The problem was that it seems the movie had no work done on it after FOX gave it the heave-ho and thusly it came out as more of an independent work: Good idea, horrible plot line. Luke Wilson plays a decent character, although he sells it short in many ways. The other supporting characters are no one that anyone has heard of, but they play their separate parts with their own kind of grace, though that's not the word that would be best for these roles.In the end, I'd recommend this movie to shock people into thinking differently for our futures, rather than for a laugh. There are better ways to garner a laugh from a movie.",Idiocracy
343,lewisdog21@hotmail.com,Lame and not even slightly funny.,1,31 December 2006,I read the first few comments on this movie before I viewed it. I was expecting a good ride. The movie starts okay. It's a tool idea. To be honest I had trouble even getting thru the whole film. I loved Bottle Rocket with Luke Wilson. This isn't even close to being as good. I look in total disbelief at the comments of laughing out loud at this garbage. It's just not funny let alone laughing. Luke Wilson looked embarrassed to even be in some of the scenes. I'm not at all surprised this didn't get promoted or generally released in cinemas. The story is lame and insulting. It actually plays to the people that it supposed to parody. How ironic ! I say avoid at all costs. 1/10,Idiocracy

Ten years ago, the world had its problems, but today it seems that reason has gone mad, crazy decisions are made at the highest level around the world and the dumb reign supreme. Intelligence has little value, when you can win simply yelling your absurdities louder. That's what this movie is about: the carried to excess consequences of this model of (un)thinking. Maybe it's a little gross and even winking to B-Comedy, but definitely funny and enjoyable. Stupid jokes alternate with brilliant ideas in a satisfying way.

345,poogy1680,I don't quite get why people liked it.,1,10 January 2007,"I love Mike Judge because of Office Space, I love Luke Wilson because of Old School, and I love Maya Rudolph and Horatio Sanz because of SNL.Still, this movie rarely made me laugh. The thing is, I think Mike Judge underestimated his audience by hoping we'd laugh WITH the characters in this movie. It's an insult to even fathom that I would laugh at the same things as them. The endless ass and fart jokes make me long for the comparatively mature humor of Beavis and Butthead. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of that kind of humor. But it works better in fifteen minute TV segments.I understand the social statement Judge is trying to make here, but it wasn't well conveyed. The plot was flimsy, it seemed to duck out of trouble spots all too easily, and I wasn't impressed with the conclusion. Lots of unresolved plot points, plenty of missed opportunities to fit in more intellectually relevant humor, and cheaper than dirt fart jokes made for a pretty painful ride.If you're looking for something along the lines of Old School, keep moving. I suppose if you're a fan of Deuce Bigalow you may want to give this one a watch.I really can't recommend this movie to anyone expecting more than just an hour and a half long fart joke.",Idiocracy
346,kevfannc,Mike Judge does it again,6,19 December 2007,"I never laughed so hard in my life! Mike Judge hilariously shows us where we are and where we are headed. The satire is spot-on, and even the toilet humor, because of its placement, works on every level.This film just might go down as the first overlooked film of the 21st century, the first cult classic, etc. I prefer to think of this film as a HUGE mistake on FOX's part to make any sort of profit. How the execs in the board room passed on this comedic gem is such a mystery.

347,scsonka,500 years? That long?,10,31 July 2009,"I think the reason why this gem did not score better with the huddled masses, is that the masses felt that it hit a little close to home. The comedic creative license allowed for there to be semi-sophisticated machines interacting and/or guiding the less-than-intelligent which, even now, does not seem entirely far-fetched. Set aside the distasteful preoccupations with farts, boobs, and Testicle injuries (a current favorite among AFHV fans), the society portrayed here is actually frighteningly close to what's already at hand. The mock-science at the onset of the movie, as far-fetched as it may sound, is again, true very much to our nature. In short: If you are capable of laughing at yourself, this is a brilliant movie. If you feel threatened by the picture that this story portrays of our current culture and its' likely potential, then it will likely receive a low score. ...Oh, right.

I haven't laughed this hard all the way through a movie in a long time. As of right now (Sept 1), I have seen absolutely no publicity for this movie, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. Mike Judge did not disappoint me.This movie was intelligently stupid. If you liked Team America, you should enjoy this as well. I think that Mike Judge lovers from Beavis to Office Space will also enjoy this movie. Be prepared for quite a bit of language, but understand that it is making fun of gratuitous profanity.For one thing, it is perhaps the most witty forecast for the future I think I've seen. In a democracy, majority rules. The problem with that is that if the majority is a bunch of imbeciles, they are going to make imbecilic decisions. The prologue to the movie had me rolling. It compares the mentality of the intelligentsia vis a vis the mentality of the... er... trailer trash in regards to producing offspring. The white collar couple is very ""careful"" about having a kid, so careful they don't end up having a kid at all. On the other hand, the trailer trash basically cannot hiccup without producing a kid. It was a hilarious intro to the movie that really set the stage for the rest of the movie as a hysterical event.The humor on the surface level may appear extremely low-brow, but what makes it so funny is that it is actually making fun of the abyss to which our humor can drop.I was impressed with the acting. The tendency, it seems, is to over-act when your ""playing dumb"" in a movie, but the actors in this movie did a fantastic job of not over-acting their dumbness. Was particularly impressed with Dax Shepard, who could have very easily been not as funny as he was.I remember the ending seemed kind of weak, but it may have just been because I was tired of seeing Luke Wilson (not my favorite). Definitely worth seeing!",Idiocracy
351,nickadoo1970,The smartest comedy about overwhelming stupidity you're ever likely to see,8,18 September 2006,"A great deal has been made about the baffling lack of support 20thi Century Fox has shown Mike Judge's latest film, and for good reason. Idiocracy is one of the sharpest laugh-out-loud funny comedies to come out of Hollywood in quite some time.By the same token, it could be said that for not having the foresight of seeing frame one of this movie before viewing it in the theater, I had the luxury of and entirely fresh experience. I had little in the way of expectations, and the movie was full of wonderful surprises.Not to say that this movie is a unique and original concept. The plot is cribbed from familiar and well-worn territory (Futurama, Blade Runner, Brazil, Demolition Man, March of the Morons, Planet of the Apes, etc). What makes this film distinct from its predecessors is its dark, cynical, and downright angry tone.Judge aims his satirical guns with full force at the culture, particularly American pop-culture, with everything he's got. He doesn't hit his target with every shot, but when he does, he levels it to the ground.A hilarious prologue that illustrates why evolution begins to reverse as, intelligent people fail to produce offspring while idiots breed like rabbits.The movie then follows Joe Bowers (Luke Wilson), an all-around average, unassuming guy who has been selected to be cryogenically frozen in a military experiment alongside a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph). Due to governmental oversights, they're mistakenly left in suspended animation until accidentally awoken 500 years in the future; a future populated by nothing but stupid people.Hollywood is no stranger to the idiot character, from the Forrest Gumps and Dumb & Dumbers to current crop of movies that includes the likes Talledega Nights, Beer Fest, and Jackass Number Two. However, most of movies often tend to romanticize and celebrate the moron as a doe-eyed innocent, childlike and naive. Not so with Idiocracy. This film takes a decidedly ugly, hateful view of the ignorance and degradation of our culture.You might ask, ""Where's the funny?"" after reading the above description. Well, Mike Judge seems to take great delight in mocking and skewering the mindless stupidity of pop-culture. This is common territory for him, as with King of the Hill and Beavis and Butthead. With his previous work, though, he'd merely been scratching at the surface. In Idiocracy, he unleashes his satiric wrath like an exploding volcano.The film is certainly not without its flaws. Unlike Office Space, which was a wonderfully smart and clever comedy, Idiocracy predictably needs to rely on far less intelligent humor at times. A film about incredibly stupid people isn't going to present itself with much in the way of smart, instantly quotable dialog. Sometimes this can become a bit tiresome. Judge often attempts to compensate by loading the screen with tons of visual humor.I felt Office Space was brilliant in creating its absurd, yet all-too-real world of office culture, but once it got wrapped up with its largely disposable ""plot"" involving corporate embezzlement, it nearly imploded on itself. Idiocracy suffers from a similar problem in so much as, once its world has been fully realized, Judge seems to be at a loss for what his characters should actually do.I hope this gets a chance at becoming the cult-film I think it deserves to be.",Idiocracy

The film offers a rare mix of absurdity and humor that hits really close to home. It works both as a silly comedy and as a cautionary tale for a world that is dumbing down, a world in which Larry the Cable Guy is considered a comic genius, the fastest-growing sport involves guys driving around in circles and people still haven't figured out that professional wrestling is scripted. Just look at how few people on the Internet can put sentence together, much less figure out how contractions and homonyms work.

But isn't a satire supposed to be funny? The movie was about as engaging as a wet sponge, and it was a constant battle as to what was more stupid - the civilisation depicted in this terrible film, or the film itself.

They are forgotten and wake up in the year 2550. Not so original I know, the catch is, they wake to a world that is so stupid from the total loss of intellectual stimuli, no one knows how to complete a simple sentence.

This is one of those films that will divide the saints from the assholes---i.e., if you see it and enjoy it, your head's screwed on straight and you're alright, but if you want your money back or don't get it (or, God help you, you're a Fox executive and helped quash it), then you're hopeless and need to go catch the latest Jennifer Anniston crap-for-all.

364,naardebioscoop,Fun romp plus creepy eugenic plaidoyer,1,22 January 2007,"The movie gets 5 or six stars as entertainment, but negative 10 for its blatant eugenic message. The DVD case claims that in the future which the movie portrays, humanity has been ""dumbed-down by consumer culture."" This is a flat-out lie (presumably necessary, since most potential renters would be put off if they knew the real premise). In fact, in the first 5 minutes, the movie states in no uncertain terms that the ""dumbing-down"" is a genetic phenomenon: some people are born stupid, stupidity is hereditary, and the stupid are (now) out-breeding the non-stupid, so that in the future only the very stupid are left.This claim is stated repeatedly and totally explicitly, and illustrated with case studies and colorful graphics. (As part of this we get to see just who the stupid are in Mike Judge's book: they are poor, they are Southern, they have modest housing and clothes, and they speak in dialect. The contrasting non-stupids are wealthily dressed and housed and speak the favored variety of American English. Judge doesn't even bother to dissociate his idea of ""stupidity"" from his class prejudice by showing the ""stupids"" actually doing anything especially stupid; having a large number of children might seem like a candidate stupid activity, but that's the very activity that Judge is encouraging his non-stupids to engage in, so he can't very well call that stupid...)Mike Judge joins a long line of alarmists who are terrified that the genetically inferior will out-breed and swamp the Master Race. Under the name of ""eugenics"", this notion was all the rage with American fascists in the late 19th and early 20th century, who passed numerous laws forbidding the ""feeble-minded"" to breed (it was usually left up to judges to decide what that term actually mean; epilepsy for example was construed as within its purview) and, in many US states, mandating forced sterilization. The most famous eugenicists were of course the Nazis, whose program to save the genetically superior from the hordes of quicker-breeding sub-humans bypassed the whole sterilization process and moved right to ""euthenasia"" for the mentally retarded (and of course for other ""genetically inferior"" types as well). Thanks to the Nazis, most of the civilized world has lost its stomach for eugenics. But not Mike Judge, I guess.Please don't think I'm overstating the eugenic message in this movie; watch the first five minutes or ask anyone who has. What is stupid is that without this fascist idiocy, the movie would be a funny little time-waster at least worth recommending to a bored friend. The stupid stuff is sort of funny. Dax Shepard is an Oscar-caliber doofus. The intro could have just as easily blamed the stupidity on ""consumer culture"" or whatever and made the movie into (light-weight) social critique; nothing else about the plot would've needed to be changed.",Idiocracy
365,ajfuller,"Should have been polished, not discarded.",5,10 January 2007,"Mike Judge is incredibly talented, with a proved track record of making successful television shows and one bona fide cult film. So, of course, he cannot be trusted.That seems to be the message from Fox which apparently took over this movie and cut it the way they wanted to, then dumped it with absolutely no fanfare or promotion. First, the bad: The film is uneven and looks like it had a budget less than, or equal to, the money you could shake out of my sofa.A narration has been tacked on that explains in painful detail, exactly what you are watching on the screen. The special effects and set design are awful and the jokes are extremely repetitive.The story centers on the fact that America is becoming dumber by the year because stupid people breed faster. An average solider becomes part of a cryogenics project and is supposed to be frozen for one year. A female hooker is also chosen for the project, which is specifically looking for people that won't be missed by anyone.The project goes wrong and the soldier and hooker are actually frozen for 500 years. Waking up only when a trash avalanche propels them into Washington D.C.The satire is pointed and funny (the top show is, ""Ow, My Balls"" and the top film is simply called, ""Ass."") but I kept getting the feeling that the film was not shaped the way Judge intended. The choppy story suggests that many scenes were deleted or never filmed and the narration I mentioned earlier seems to be nothing other than an attempt to both make up for those missing scenes and explain the movie to those with IQ's lower than the residents of 2505.The jokes are scattered and the second half of the movie completely falls apart, with an over-reliance on WWF style theatrics that are amusing at first but drag as they go on, and on.There is a great story in here. There is a very funny movie that could have been made from this material, but we just aren't getting it here.I am really hoping that a Director's Cut becomes available eventually. I would love to hear what Mike Judge has to say about this film. There is no commentary track on the DVD, which really should not come as a surprise considering how Fox botched the handling of this film.",Idiocracy

According to the movie the future could be all about ass, ""latte"" and a general trend of 'uuh'. This movie is by no means the best movie I have ever seen, however, this future vision does scare me somewhat. Could a version of this bleak prediction be a possibility? Excepting for the main characters, and the president, all the future characters sort of blend together, creating one similar attitude and utterings for all. This could have been the intention of the makers, to show that everyone ends up having the same lowbrow interests, watch the same shows and have no more creativity and innovation. I certainly hope this trend will not dominate in the future, I should prefer to imagine a more star trek future myself, where money is a non-issue and exploration and achieving harmony are the goals.

But I had a good 10-15 solid belly laughs watching this, which puts it well above most comedies I see. Luke Wilson basically plays... uhh.. Luke Wilson in this one for the 23rd straight movie, which is fine with me. The female protagonist is pretty tacked on, but doesn't detract anything.

Those who didn't like this movie simply don't understand Mike Judge's humor, and that's fine. You're not dumb for not getting it. I didn't like Beavis & Butthead at first either. But with Mike Judge, there's always something else going on, and you have to realize the social commentary he tries to make before you take his stuff at face value.This movie was dead-on accurate in the way it prophesized the state of western culture. It was also completely relatable to me, because I realized that I actually knew a number of people as dumb as those in this movie. This is where we are headed. Don't believe me? Check out your local TV station's prime time lineup. If there are fewer than 3 reality shows on at any given time, I'll gladly take back my comments.At the same time, I think Judge relies a little bit on that stupidity to gain an audience. The dumb fans of Beavis & Butthead probably overlooked the irony and fact that they were staring into a mirror. Idiocracy, on the other hand, was a bit harder to enjoy than B&B without recognizing that irony. Basically, if you have contempt for mankind, you'll probably dig this flick.",Idiocracy

It has some of the same kind of comic future satire as ""Brazil"" and ""Demolition Man"", but taken to the next level.Then I saw the cast; Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph and Dax Shepard, who were all brilliant in their roles.Needless to say, this movie won me over in the first 5 minutes, where it shows above-average people having fewer children and the poorest, stupidest, trashiest people having lots of ignorant children, and how this is leading to a kind of reverse evolution. It takes that concept, and then shows where we are headed with this pollution of the gene pool.Sadly, I don't think it will take the 500 years as depicted, but probably only about 50. I already see the shocking rise of ""mild retardation"" in the general populace, media and culture. People who like classical music and art are ridiculed instead of respected. The lowest common denominator seems to rule, especially in Hollywood and on TV (eg, ""Jackass the Movie"" and any reality show where they make you eat something disgusting or humiliate yourself for money).All of the political/social satire aside, this movie is also just LAUGH OUT LOUD funny! And I don't say that lightly; few movies make me actually ""LOL"", but this one did.A lot of the best jokes are word/sight gags in the background, so you really have to pay attention to get some of them. I even had to pause and zoom in for a few of them (like when Joe got his government ID and for ""hair"" it said ""yes"" and for ""eyes"" it also said ""yes""). Also, the prison has engraved on the front ""House for Particular Individuals"", since the cops in the movie (much like real life cops) call everyone ""individuals"" instead of people, etc. Again, this was on the screen for just a moment...this is one of those movies you can watch again and again and dissect it to get through the layers of funny.Also, I normally watch movies with the subtitles on, and that clued me in to some jokes that might pass by your ears in the dialog mix, for instance, the police constantly talk about people ""excaping"" instead of ""escaping"", and there are many other mis-pronunciations that just cracked me up. But again, I might not have picked up on them just by the dialog mixed with music/sound effects; it is very subtle but still hilarious.Additionally, the special effects were REALLY GOOD for a sci-fi/social satire.I could go on and on, but overall, I think this is one of those movies that if you DON'T think it's funny, it's probably making fun of YOU!

Look no further than Huxley's ""Brave New World"" to see the same idea of ""Idiocracy"" fleshed out in a much more profound manner. That being said, perhaps profound was not what the writers and director was looking for. I am a great fan of ""King of the Hill"" due mainly to its social commentary, which at times is fantastic, as it is in this movie, but it appears the movie was hampered possibly by a small budget or lack of studio support as the idea behind it was excellent, but the end product comes out disappointing.

It would be nice to see an anthology type of sci-fi movie made from some of the great 50's Sci-Fi stories. Say 3-4 short films of 20-40 minutes each rather than stretching one story into a 100 min. film.

If you are a Mike Judge fan, or enjoy shows like Futurama, then you are doing yourself a grave disservice by skipping over this little known, limited release. Although the DVD touts very few ""bonus features"", this film is certainly funny enough to make up for it's perceived ""lack of value"".This movie is about an army grunt by the name of Joe Bowers (played by Luke Wilson) who is part of a top secret Army experiment designed to preserve Army personnel in peace time so that they can be thawed in war time to fight for our country. However, things take an interesting turn as the general in charge of the operation is busted in a prostitution ring and the experiment is all but forgotten. Bowers, and his sidekick Rita (played by Maya Rudolph) both find themselves awake in the year 2505, where through the course of natural selection, the population of America has grown increasingly stupid. Now Joe and Rita have to find their way to a time machine to get back to the year 2005 with the help of Frito (played by Dax Shepard).What I really enjoyed about this movie was Mike Judge's comedic satire on the course of US History over the last 50 years, and how mankind progresses over the subsequent 500 years. This is most evidenced by the advertising in the movie, which has become a staple of the American culture. With shows like South Park in the mainstream media, it's easy to see how conclusions could be drawn that in the future, profanity has become a marketing tool. This is portrayed in the film humorously with subtle things such as ""Fudd-Ruckers"" changing their name to ""Butt-F###ers"", and a billboard which displays the advertisement ""If you don't smoke Tarryltons... F### You!"". I also cannot stop laughing at Carls Jr.'s role in this future, with their slogan ""F### you... I'm eating"", and their automated kiosks self-advertising their ""Extra Big-A## Tacos"". (with more molecules)! This film contained everything I go to the movies for. Excellent, sharp, witty comedy, as well as an engrossing plot make this DVD one for the ages. Be warned, however. If you are not a fan of Mike Judge, did not care for ""Beavis and Butthead"", or do not have a sense of humor, then this movie probably isn't a good match for you.

The premise of the movie is hilarious, but its execution leaves one shaking their head after the movie is over. In a way, it's like a reversal of the basic foundation of Beavis and Butthead, where an average guy is surrounded by idiots rather than the other way around. That's the main problem since the people that surround Luke Wilson are TOO stupid, resulting in a myriad of characters who are simply annoying and make you roll your eyes. The story isn't told very well, there's too much narration and the good jokes in the movie are few and far inbetween. It has none of the wit or vitality of Office Space and is a distant second compared to the stupidly-hilarious Beavis and Butthead.

392,jim_bowery,"Idiocracy, wow!",9,11 January 2007,"""Idiocracy"" is now on DVD and all I can say is Wow! Well, maybe a mite more than that I haven't read any reviews that do justice to this movie and I don't expect I'll be the first to do so.Suffice to say, Mike Judge has done more than violate taboos against discussing the consequences of dysgenics. There is a lot more in this movie to keep it out of the theaters. Judge has concocted a vaccine to the mind-numbing meme machine running the West. You can't watch ""Idiocracy"" and then not laugh at the garbage coming out of the mass media in the guise of ""news and entertainment"". Indeed, the DVD opens with a mountain range of garbage about to avalanche, and it is such a perfect metaphor for what has been done to the mind of Western Man that one doesn't know whether to split a gut or sit in awe.It's such a relief to watch this movie. I can empathize with the audience instead of seeing the audience as a potentially dangerously dumbed down army of marching morons programmed with zombie morals who (see the movie to get this) are destroying their food production because they believe a sports drink must replace irrigation water ""because it has the electrolytes plants crave"".Now I'm the first to admit that there is more than mere stupidity going on in the worldthat some of the destruction is the result of a peculiar kind of stupidity one might call ""unenlightened self-interest"". Indeed, my counter to those who say ""Never attribute to malice that which can be attributed to stupidity."" is ""Never attribute to stupidity that which can be attributed to unenlightened self interest."" Nor does Judge's storyline do justice to such unenlightened self-interest when he portrays everyone from street hookers to to corporate executives as exhibiting this particular kind of stupidity. The worst unenlightened self-interest we are now experiencing utilizes high intelligence of a kinda sort of narrow and intense intelligence that just can't keep its fundamentals straight even as it solves problems that are the equivalent of proving the four color map theorem. Is it possible to describe someone with a 180 IQ as merely ""stupid"" when they grab control of high office and positions of influence while raking in hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars? Of course noteven if they cause the needless deaths of hundreds of millions, including themselves, it is hard to describe them as stupid, although I will admit I do so quite frequently when speaking of them. Indeed one of my main motives for working on artificial intelligence is my sincere hope that the ""intelligent"" idiots will hear the truth when a machine tells them, with encyclopedic detail and a bibliography-on-demand miles long, exactly how they're being so abysmally stupid in key dimensions.So the movie Judge won't make is the one where some transhumanists start engineering themselves for greater intelligence in zero-sum gamesmanship simply for the purpose of enjoying ever greater dominance over others, while they lose track of the fact that they needed those ""stupid white trash hicks"" to make the food.",Idiocracy

So go see this movie before Fox dumps it to DVD. Talk about an idiocracy... (10 lines of text to post? What a stupid rule!) Umm... Luke Wilson is a great straight man and Maya Rudolph is good and damn sexy, I might add. Be sure to stay for the end of the credits, btw. Uh, let's see, filling ten lines here...

When we got to the theater (in LA) there was no poster, no title on the marquee. I thought it wasn't playing there till my grown son filled me in; no marketing, no trailer, no poster because the corporations satirized in the movie are PO'd about how they are portrayed. The corporations will or have filed suit about their images in the film, reason enough to go see it. The filmmakers have touched a raw nerve, obviously, and it is the nerve of truth.The society of the movie's future is here. Anybody who sees this movie will recognize it as soon as you leave the theater. It may be less apparent in some other parts of the country, but in LA it cannot be ignored. Stupidity is revered, the thin-skinned denizens often react like toddlers without thought to everything that ""offends"" them, vulgarity rules, concepts of community are abandoned in favor of the selfish and adolescent. People no longer have or use critical thinking skills against the voices of ""authority,"" which are the few mega-corporations left which control everything. See summary. I enjoyed the huge-voiced, '50's style narration. Viewers would do well to pay serious attention to its message even more than the messenger.

This movie's target audience are Maxim magazine reading, beer drinking, Spike TV watching, sit on your couch on the weekends, swearing, sweaty, laugh at someone getting hit in the balls Guys; and if you fit the profile, you will have a gut-wrenching good time. The movie follows Joe Bowers (Luke Wilson) as he gets placed into a military experiment to be frozen for 1 year, but something goes awry and he is awoken in the year 2505. The movie includes many Mike Judge favorites such as David Herman (Office Space) and Steven Root (Office Space, King of the Hill) as well as many other notable actors, such as Maya Rudolph (Saturday Night Live), Dax Shepard (Punk'd), and many others. This movie is Vulgar, Offensive, and a great satire on today's popular culture. All in all, 'Idiocracy' is a just Guy's movie, its as simple as that.",Idiocracy

I thought it was the funniest film I have seen in a long time, mainly because I saw the truth in the satire. I strongly recommend this film to all my friends.This is not a film for everyone. Some people will see the crass humor and aura of stupidity, and find Idiocracy to be one of the stupidest movies they have seen. What these people don't seem to understand is that the crass humor is there, not to amuse the audience, but to show what appeals to the morons in the future.Luke Wilson is well cast as an ""average Joe."" He is mainly there to be a foible for the biting commentary about society that is spread throughout this film. Many of the funnier bits are in the background, so it is easily worth seeing several times. What makes the movie even funnier, and more scary, is that I see elements of it in every day life, in people I meet or on the media. Then, I go back and re-watch Idiocracy, and realize how good it is.The few people who have seen and enjoyed this film are able to be part of an elite club.

There is a reason you haven't heard of this movie. It is an absolute abomination. There were 2 funny lines elsewise it was the same joke over and over. My words are really insufficient to describe how suicide-inducingly wretched this movie is. Luke Wilson must have owed some sort of favor to Judge, Maya Rudolph, of course, has no apparent acting ability, despite a large chest, and Dax Shepard's name is Dax Shepard. I think Judge had a decent idea for a movie but never really thought it through, tossed it all together haphazardly, and you wonder why you didn't hear about this movie; I'm sure the studio didn't really bother to advertise it. This movie makes me want to kill myself, not because of the ominous future it portends, but the possibility that anyone actually finds this funny means the warning is relevant not in the future but already in the present.",Idiocracy

Often I found myself watching it like a car crash, just amazed that such talented people could make something so bad. I didn't laugh out loud once. Humorous is as good is this one gets. I'd be curious to read the script. Was it funny or was everyone so excited to work with Judge (thinking they might be in the next office space) that they just didn't care that the script was not that great.

That is just about as bad as this movie.I can't believe I spent money to rent this movie. I feel sorry for Luke Wilson & Maya Rudolph. Either they knew how bad this movie was while they were making and finished it anyway, or they didn't know until they saw it for themselves...but I am sure they both would love for this movie to disappear off movie store shelves as soon as possible.I also nominate Terry Crews for Worst Actor Ever for this movie but he will have some stiff competition for that Award from Dax Shepard.

I'm making all my friends watch this movie, everyone I know. This movie may very well be one of the most accurate ""Future"" movies ever made. This movie is more then just 84 minutes of entertainment, it's a warning to the future of our civilization.

404,MrJodie,Like a single flower in a mountain of manure.,3,14 June 2007,"I read many comments before watching this film and was hoping for satire. Unfortunately, satire requires a level of wit and intelligence in order to be valid. Satire is supposed to have a moral theme. The biting social commentary this movie wanted to achieve (I'm hoping, here) was thoroughly drowned out with decidedly adolescent humor.The entire movie rides on the premise that mankind is on the verge of extinction because the entire human race has bred out intelligence. The theory is that smart people breed slowly and carefully while the less intelligent breed like rabbits. While plausible only in the narrowest of considerations it misses the point of ""natural selection"" by a country mile. If the world's population tipped the balance and became that burdened by people unable to care for themselves, the herd would be thinned long before those people achieved a majority rule.Instead, the thin premise is used to turn scores of credible actors into ""homeboys and ho's"" throwing the world's raunchiest block party. Children celebrate birthdays in burger joints called Butt-f*ckers (do I need to explain that joke?). H&R Block now pays refunds with prostitutes. Starbucks offers sexual favors with a latte. It's one play on major business after another. While some would still disagree and comment that the movie brilliantly maintains a constant level of irony, I would simply point out that it went beyond caricature and fell into a mire of rude, offensive and damaging portrayal of modern social archetypes.I would much rather see a movie about a pro wrestling president who can give a speech without a single expletive in it. Maybe the entire cabinet could be prostitutes who, secretly, have degrees in political science and finance. People in ridiculous roles that prove that the human race, no matter how pitiful it seems, can still surprise you.I wanted this movie to be a lotus blossom, but it only turned out to be the painted rose from a Cristal bottle.",Idiocracy

Or maybe you have been conditioned to the point that anything remotely ""politically incorrect"" must be a racist right wing conspiracy. Clearly many negative reviews on here are made for political reasons. The real irony is that Fox was afraid of this movie and buried it. Afraid of getting close to telling the truth I guess, as all mainstream media is... (If you are on the left and you don't think MSNBC is as bad as Fox, you need to wake up and watch some Democracy Now! Because none of the mainstream media tells you anything outside of what will keep you from spitting venom at the other side)As far as cries of racism in some of the reviews, I can only laugh. In one review someone says something like ""paints all minorities as stupid"" Really? Frito was by far the dumbest guy in the movie... a white guy. And how about the trailer park family in the beginning of the movie??? I love dystopian movies, and this one is, by far, hands down, the funniest of all time.

From a person who disdains both the establishment left and right, I can give this film an unbiased 10 rating with ease. It had me rolling with laughter and nodding my head through most of it.

I enjoyed the humor which edges on ridiculous, and the budget cuts added to the aura for me. The sexual themes are not merely gratuitous but are a necessary part of the overall message in this flick. If the sign of a great movie is one that leaves you with something (and it is for me), Idiocracy enters the realm of greatness.

415,thomschurer,Movie has the same level as the things it is criticizing,3,30 April 2012,"The concept of the movie seemed really interesting to me. That society slowly became dumber and dumber because intelligence is no longer needed. Given this concept I expected a clever movie about 'normal' guy slowly gaining power in a world where he is considered extremely smart. This was not the case. The only thing this movie was, was 80 minutes of stating that the dumb people are really dumb. There were hardly any jokes in the movie and the jokes that were there weren't funny. The characters in the movie are also hard to relate to. Joe is the main character and he has average intelligence, but even Joe (the smartest guy in the movie) comes across as a really dumb guy. Joe agrees to an experiment to freeze him for a year and the viewer isn't given an explanation why a normal human being would agree to this. After being accidentally frozen for 500 years (he was forgotten, yeah, don't think to much about it) he ends up in an incredibly stupid world. But even when he witnesses all the stupidity in the world (including talking a prison guard in letting him go by using just one sentence) he still refuses to believe he is the smartest person on earth. You would also expect him to give up on reason to convince people and just use 'dumb' reasoning, given the fact it works on the prison guard. Instead Joe tries to go back to the past, assuming the people who don't know what water is have a time machine. Unexpectedly this doesn't work out in the end, but no worries, Joe falls in love with a prostitute from his own time. The prostitute named Rita was also frozen, but unlike Joe she manages to trick the dumb people into giving her money. In case you are wondering why Rita isn't the smartest person on earth: she is convinced her pimp will travel through time to get his money from her. In the end Joe and Rita end up together and there is a happy ending (they get married and have children). The happy ending is confusing, because it suggests that living in a dumb world is completely fine after all. But this movie doesn't show two people ending up in a inferior world, it shows a movie where two people end up where they belong.I don't recommend this movie if you expect a clever movie criticizing the current manner in which things are handled.

Additionally, years ago I read and immensely enjoyed C. M. Kornbluth's stories ""The Little Black Bag"" and ""The Marching Morons"" (the former in the Science Fiction Hall of Fame), and therefore am very familiar with the underlying premise. However, I should have kept in mind that Judge is also the genius (in the Latin sense) behind ""Beavis and Butt-Head"", which has rare moments of creativity, but generally very little to recommend it to anyone more intelligent or mature than its title characters; and sadly, ""Idiocracy"" has much more in common with that series. In it, the dialog and behavior of the characters of the future are supposed to represent those of unintelligent individuals but usually come off more as simply uneducated and boorish; and that, along with the level of internal inconsistency and the sloppy transitions, makes one feel that Judge did not feel it necessary to go to the trouble of writing multiple drafts. These problems, along with others too numerous to list succinctly, make for one of the worst movies I have seen in years.

This movie is way better than most satire flicks out there.SPECIAL EFFECTS (8/10): One of the better qualities of this movie. You literally feel a fear of heights in some scenes. Most of the magic is done on large scale with George Lucas looking details. The effects are the largest reason I'll give this movie a second viewing when it comes out on DVD.HUMOR/INTEREST (7/10) : I was worried that this movie might be so stupid that it wouldn't be funny. That is, until I started laughing with joy. Tons of jokes and satire in this one, but it's not exactly like the Scary Movie series either. Some parts will have you laughing, others will have you shocked. It's interesting to see how the future had evolved into such a disaster. The debris is real, but not caused by any wars. Man became very stupid, having technology do all the work for them. Most Taboos we have now become positive things in the future. OVERALL: (7/10) You'll probably find this movie cleverly funny.

I really like how they showed, for the eye to see - how the society has slowly become dumber and dumber and less capable of solving problems, eventually neglecting them, and finally not even realizing anymore that there are any. The weirdest thing is, and I noticed many agree with this, is that there is some actual truth to this movie. As everything is being done automatically more often we seem to lose our knowledge and problem solving abilities. As depicted in Idiocracy to extremes.In short (spoilers from here!); the President is an intimidating famous wrestler, the only thing to drink is the beverage Brawndo (which company employs half of the population), you are greeted in Cosco stores with ""Welcome to Cosco, I love you"", and if you talk like a normal person or try to read words, you'll be called a 'f*g' and intimidated. And that's just merely the tip of the iceberg.Seriously, just to hear one of the main characters 'Frita' say the epic line ""I can't believe you like money too, we should hang out!"" is worth watching the movie alone.Oh man, I'm telling you, you better prepare some clean underwear, because you're going to be in for one hell of a laugh.

425,vinnie_vegas69,"Good, but not great - A little heavy handed",9,29 January 2007,"Mike Judge's Idiocracy is an interesting film, and one that his fans will undoubtedly track down and see.Before I start the review, I would preface it by saying that if you get a chance to see it, definitely do, as it IS worth watching, and isn't the easiest film in the world to track down.Let's start with the premise - Luke Wilson is Private Joe Bauers, an Army librarian who is deemed to have absolutely no outstanding attributes or glaring flaws, making him totally average in every way. This, along with the fact that he has no living relatives, makes him a standout candidate for an experimental cryogenics procedure. Also frozen with Joe is a Prostitute named Rita who was pimped to the project by Upgrayedd, her abusive pimp. Unfortunately, a few days after they are frozen, the top secret project is abandoned, and they are forgotten about.They wake up in 2505, and find that with the dumbing down of society following the trends of recent times, everyone on Earth is only slightly more intelligent than a chimp. The way that ""everyman"" Joe Bauers talks is seen as being ""faggy"", much as someone speaking like Shakespeare would ridiculed now, and a former professional wrestler is the President of the United States (actually, this one probably isn't that outrageous really). The best show on TV is called ""Ow! My Balls!"", which admittedly sounds pretty good, and not only is everything spelled wrong, but signs seem to have run out of space for the wording, leaving them to be bunched up at the end.It's a funny premise for film, but this is the problem - Aside from the initial premise, not that much in the movie is truly funny. What I mean by that is that the ideas that come to mind from having read the premise of the film are probably about as funny as the film itself. Obviously, it's not terrible, but it probably could have been funnier.There are some winners in the script, such as Starbucks now offering ""happy endings"", and people placing their blind faith in the universally misunderstood ""electrolytes"", but they are just too few and far between, so unless you are going to laugh hysterically every time one of the idiots of the future slurs out a slack-jawed, profanity laden sentence with little to no logic and/or intelligence, then the laughs might be pretty well spaced.It's unfair for everyone to be comparing it to Office Space, because it's a very different film, but as a film, regardless of what came before it, Idiocracy is a funny concept that will probably have you laughing a lot more in the opening 15-20 minutes than in the rest of the film.I give it 5 out of 10 because it is enjoyable, but doesn't do enough to raise it above middle of the road.",Idiocracy
426,jmodic,"Great Film, Not Mike Judge's best but still very good.",8,12 February 2007,I would have to say this is a great movie. Mike Judge has an eye forseeing things that nobody would ever notice hence Office Space. Hemakes a statement about the dumbing down of society and that survival of the fittest is mere pipe dream in 500 years. That pop culture and mass marketing by wealthy companies tend to rule the day. Yes there is a lot of potty humor in it and it is to get the story moving and his point across. But the genuine frustration on Private Joe Bowers face is priceless and some cases we can all relate to it at some point in our lives. If you do not enjoy the humor then look at it from a different point of view and watch it again. It took me watching it twice to really appreciate this film for what it isAnd with said after watching it twiceI am going to read a book now.,Idiocracy
427,sierraromeo,Waste of time and money,4,25 March 2007,"I'll start by saying that I love Mike Judge and I love Bevis and Butthead and Office Space. I read the summary of the movie before I watched it and it sounded appealing and caught my interest. I really wanted to like this movie.Mike Judge uses a lower level of comedy in this movie than he did by using satire in Office Space. A lot of people would argue that he is satirizing the stupidity that runs rampant in our country right now, and he does to a certain extent. But flatulence isn't exactly the funniest thing in the world to me, and that type of humor is what comprises this movie.Luke Wilson is chosen for a military experiment and is cryogenically frozen. Although he is only supposed to be in hibernation for a year, something goes wrong and he doesn't wake up until 2505. When he awakens, he discovers a world that is full of dolts and nincompoops. This is where the 'humor' kicks in. Almost everything the stupid people say is intended to be funny, but it's usually just so dumb that I feel like my intelligence was lowered by just watching it. I laughed at a couple of occasions during the movie, and I really wanted this movie to make me laugh throughout. Mike Judge just missed on this movie.The movie's main message is the comparison between that future society and the world we live in today. Although some of the lines Judge drew in this parallel had some funny truths to them, a lot of it was just not funny and trying too hard. The movie was really crap, it involves cheesy romance, unfunny comedy, no character development and is really just a waste of time. I didn't even pay for this movie and I feel like I got ripped of. Save your money and your time, and go watch Office Space instead.",Idiocracy

The concept of sleeping through hundreds of years to find a world where everyone is an imbecile is interesting and engaging. The movie's plot however, is just one big ""black/mexican"" joke where stupid black people and Mexicans rule America. Yes, there are white people in power, Dax is the attorney with the Spanish word for a-hole as a last name; Milton is the first judge to see Joe, that other guy from Office Space is a minister of something but the majority of the people seem to be ""Mexicans"". The propaganda announcer has a ""mexican"" accent and even the stupid black president has a ""mexican"" last name.The movie has it's funny moments and delivers a few laughs but This movie could have been made just as funny (or unfunny) without using all these innuendos.

Maybe I'm seeing a message that was the result of this movie being cut over and over again as tends to happen in Hollywood. I've also heard that the narration was tedious and overdone, I found it to be a play on the fact that many people need to have the simplest of things spelled out for them because they just don't get it. Perhaps when the DVD is released we'll be able to see a longer, truer version of what Mike Judge intended in the first place.

In my opinion, the prime target for the movie is below 14 years of age, like may be 12. It definitely doesn't address for 25+ people. It's not funny at all, I don't remember I have laughed even once. Story is short; he solves exactly one problem.I think this story could be expressed in far better ways than this movie. It's a brilliant idea, but bad screenplay. Movie tried to tell ""how stupid can we get"" in a stupid (or, may be, ""poor"") way. From this point of view, it's successful; it's all about stupid stuff, and it's all told in stupid way. I, however, still believe that it could be a movie that still shows ""how stupid can we get"" in a smarter way.As a conclusion; it's recommended to be watched but don't expect real comedy or smart jokes.

The plot was predictable to those who read 'The Marching Morons,"" but the trademark Judge satire made it a worthy successor. Dialog was solid, with occasional peaks of smirking or outright tittering. Production values (cinematography, sound) were definitely not on a par with such masterpieces as ""My Super Ex Girlfriend"" but that fault lies with inadequate funding, not poor planning.Now that I've had a day to think about it, I feel fortunate to be one of the very few to see this film in theatrical release.

I still crack up at some parts and catch new sight gags in it. It's a really funny movie with great gags and easy to watch. This film has it's problems though. First, if adult language bothers you, don't watch it. The language is used to show how a dumbed down society would talk but it's profuse. Second, the framing is often poor, there are too many sight gags per shot that you miss most of them. In addition, some shots are too quick, too far away, too small or too cluttered for you to get the subtle humor in it. For example, it wasn't until the third time I watched the movie that I could see that one of the main drinks of the future was Nas-tea. Finally, the movie lacked an ending, it just sort of fades away without leaving you with a last laugh or happy feeling. There is one last gag after the credits but in addition to be poorly placed it doesn't add anything for the movie. Even with all those flaws, it's still one of my favorite comedy movies.",Idiocracy

Summer of 2004 came, and it was the same idle page on the Internet. Had Mike given up? Finally, three Summers later the movie is out, and I am stoked to see it. Only one problem; where is it playing? Before Friday, no one had information on this movie... all I knew was a head's up that it was playing at the Arclight Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. Now it appears there are a few more theaters that came out of the woodwork and have the flick.So, it isn't Office Space in terms of the style of comedy. But it isn't much like Bevis in Butthead or King of the Hills in terms of comedy style, either. What I noticed was an overwhelming amount of comedy going on without any commentary; there is definitely an attention to detail within scenery, characters, and even proportions. There was so much to see, that I need to go back to see it again.Sure enough, it won't quite appeal to everyone, so let me put it this way: If you like any of Mike's work, go and see this.",Idiocracy

The effects were uneven and belied the tight budget...but I can forgive them of that, as humor/satire held sway and makes utter 'believablility' secondary.The positive: Ambition, voice, vision. Mike Judge is now an official hero of mine...he has seen the world for what it is (in his eyes), and decided to make comment in unflinching dark humor. He is to be commended.

So why did Fox not promote it and not give it a wide release?Some have conspiracy theories: its anti-corporate message was not one Fox wanted to endorse; they don't want you to see this movie because you'll rise up and fight against neoliberalism. But, none of those seem very convincing to me. It is on DVD, after all. We can see it, after all. And so can people all around the world. Maybe the powers that be at Fox thought it better suited for cult status, maybe they thought it an unpalatable movie about things its audience doesn't really want to hear about themselves. Maybe they thought it would gain underground respect by not being a hit and gain international attention on the DVD circuit given the rise in America-mocking. Ultimately, I think they were aware of its potential unpalatability and motivated by money.Unfortunately for them, they couldn't have predicted how well this would have ridden on Borat's coat tails.I'm glad, however, that it's not going to be seen by EVERYONE.

You are led from finding out exactly what sort of man Luke Wilson is in the movie and what is going to happen to him.Then you flash forward to 500 years in the future and suddenly he is the smartest man on the planet. Strangely enough for being the smartest man he has a lot of difficulty functioning.

We're told that over and over.

Thompson and Kurt Vonnegut. I'm also a reader of political memoirs, and Judge's filmography left me wanting, waiting for a miracle. For me, the red herring was Office Space. It was OK, but not worthy of my time as a screenwriter and film buff. I needed more, and I got just that with this new film.The poignancy came with the premise of dumbing-down America. This is a current event, a contemporary problem, which has plagued the US for a decades now. It has gotten to the point where semi-intelligent people have contemplated suicide, in response to the degeneration of their neighborhoods and communities who drool over mindless television.To depose a President of the USA now is not dissimilar to committing mass treason, of which you would be excommunicated from your city, or worse, injected with lethal poison. How does freedom of speech and of the mind reign in a society so rigid in its values, made concrete by the marketeers of media at large? It doesn't, and it depresses the hell out of a lot of free loving Americans.That's why this film is so current, because it challenges your intellect to the point where it subconsciously says to you, ""I'm not as dumb as these people, and I'm offended that you'd make my country of the future this way Mike Judge, but really, why am I angry? Fox News acts just like these people in the movie, only a little smarter. If we follow these Fox News people, and those idiots I see on reality TV everyday, maybe we will end up like these retards. F*** it, it's only books for me from now on."" That's why this film is so engaging, because it forces you to ask these very serious questions in your own mind, while making you laugh your ass off. It seems clear to me that Mike Judge has spent at least the better part of a year developing this script, and it shows, for every scene is funny in its ""stands-on-its-own"" right.You need to watch this film, for as a screenwriter, and a person who has watched the top 250 IMDb titles, it's the second best of 2006, next to Copying Beethoven written by Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson.Watch it, it's by far the funniest, most relevant film of 2006.",Idiocracy

I guess it's not for everyone because it's basically Kafka's ""The Trial"" meets ""Beevis and Butt-Head"", which is a pretty tough combination to swallow. Still, I thought it was great. If you're going to see it because you want a sequel to Office Space you're probably going to be disappointed. But if you want to see one of the most brutal, acid-tongued, and hilariously honest looks at where our society is headed you're in for a treat. I just saw the 8pm show opening night in Los Angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater, which means the film will probably be gone in a week. That's really a shame because, in its own way, Idiocracy is one of the best satires to come along in quite a while.

The crowds around the complex seemed to be all of the extras used in Idiocracy. The only thing Judge left out was the cell phones and Ipods.I have never liked clothing with advertising on it and I have boycotted Carl, Jrs for years so the main theme of the movie struck me as appropriate.

We searched the website and found that his name was not even listed in the credits anywhere that we could find...why is that??? Also, why is Fox (according to an article we read on this subject) allegedly treating this film like it's not worth all of the hard work that obviously went into it?? Judge has done nothing (as far as we know) but produce hit after hit. This movie was definitely better than the ""Date Movie"" or even ""Scary Movie 3"" and we should know, because we are fans of these type of movies as well. Will we be able to own this movie on DVD anytime in the near future? What is it going to take to get this movie in a Hillsboro or Pana, IL theater??? Is there somewhere where people can go to vote for or offer support of some kind to get this movie out at more than just a handful of theaters?

I travel with this film, as I have with ""Brick"" because I demand that it be seen by as many people as I can bring it to. Its hilarity still hits me each time I watch it, and it doesn't get old or tired.This film's detail is microscopic, both visually and within the dialogue. What, at a glance, may seem like a hash-up of bathroom humor is a gift for those who can concentrate on relating to the film, rather than the recent trend of ""non-participatory"" comedy.I'm glad Idiocracy exists, because it rewards people who actively want to be entertained. It's an attack of ridiculous premise that is so well-organized that it suddenly becomes bothersome that any part of this storyline may become a reality in our future.If you love sharp wit and creativity, but feel that ""Family Guy"" and ""South Park"" fail to deliver, watch this soon.

The plot is inane, but this is excused by the fact that it's a film about dumb people. A highly polished an intricate storyline would seem to tear down the premise. As in Office Space, I find myself quoting lines from the film (I usually never do that), and the irony of an over commericalized dumbed down Fox Studio releasing it was not lost on me. (how did the Studio Execs. OK the Fox News scene for instance?) For a 'dumb' film, it sure makes you think, but more importantly, it's just damn funny. I had to wonder in my conspiracy mind whether Fox was purposely pulling back on promotion (no poster or trailer?), to generate buzz and draw to the film.

473,frizhad,"Feel-good Story of the decade, for the average Joe",8,6 January 2007,"Idiocracy makes you feel good about being normal.Mike Judge tells the stories of people ranging from average to mediocre. Office Space, King of the Hill, and Beavis and Butthead all cater to that point of view. Idiocracy continues that satirical legacy. This movie accomplishes the goal of provoking concern for the future and providing some laughs to a level that is attainable for any person who can bring him/herself to observe the world from a sociological perspective (Even someone illiterate! Video is in itself a simplification or lamens communication medium. I hope for the sake of my safety that nobody reads this message to anyone who falls into the category: disgruntled, muscle-bound illiterate).The 2505 characters were intentionally one-dimensional; but the protagonists characters also came out one dimensional. Some running gags went on a little too long. These are valid criticisms; but this movie is worth the watch. I would say that it is a modernized version of King Ralph.Attending average people is a setting present in many British comedy series (serieses? ha ha). For example Black Books and A Man About The House (the show that Three's Company was based on. Unfortunately Three's Company was too formulaic, always focusing on a misunderstanding or failed communication. A running gag that might work when you spread viewing out to an episode per week; but does not translate to marathon DVD viewing).Now that my long parentheses have been closed, I would like to contrast the aforementioned shows and movies with mainstream network shows.Friends, Seinfeld, Frasier: Network sitcoms are all about well to do urban socialites. Friends rarely satirizes the environment, because they are attempting to market this lifestyle. The comedy is frequently physical and accompanied with a laughter track (social engineering / Pavlovian?). Test marketing and focus groups must have shown that attractive actors keep the audience attention when nothing else is working. Seinfeld takes an approach that is more like a conservative application of running gags. An entire episode is devoted to a continuing joke (again, like Three's Company); but at least the idea is usually good enough to keep a bored person awake. Frasier is a minor improvement because it introduces the irony of mentally unhealthy, neurotic brothers who work in the field of mental health.I forgot Sex and the City. I haven't ever finished an episode, so I guess my comments might be a little off; but this show seems to focus on the lives of people belonging to the perceived upper echelon of society. Along with any funny moments, it is trying to normalize a way of life that is not realistic for most people. The constant toil of the characters (some of whom are career-centric) in their efforts to find mating partners as they age, is like a brief snapshot of the allegedly affluent couple in the beginning of Idiocracy.I have some recommended viewing for anyone who did enjoy Idiocracy. If you enjoy the theme of social commentary, try: Drawn Together, Weeds (drama), Extras (only some episodes are funny - be warned), Mumford If you enjoy the silliness: Team America, The Mighty Boosh, any Adult Swim show, Stella, Reno 911, Waiting...Hope this helps you decide whether to watch the movie (and potentially on some other shows and movies to watch",Idiocracy
474,rroberts123,The Marching Morons!,9,25 September 2008,"Great Movie! It could explain why we're having our current economic problems!! Yeah baby! If you like this movie then you need to read Cyril M. Kornbluth's ""The Marching Morons""! However, in that story there is at least a group of geniuses who keep things running smoothly. In ""Idiocracy"", there is only one ""genius"", Joe, and he has quite the challenge. There seems to be the common theme of ""we who keep our pants up will be overrun by those who keep their pants down"" which I believe was first uttered by a former cabinet secretary. The movie lampoons Fox channel, Monday Night football, government, our society's obsession with the ""beautiful people"" and other highlights of our popular culture in a hilarious fashion. Extremely accurate and prophetic, unfortunately. Highly recommended!",Idiocracy
475,subcreature,It's amazing how many people miss the point... oh wait. No it isn't.,8,21 June 2007,"You can read all kinds of references into the world of Idiocracy. A futuristic world populated by pampered, self-indulgent morons spoon-fed by the technology of a bygone era: this idea has its precedent in H.G. Wells' ""The Time Machine"" and Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"" amongst other satires.Early in the film, a narrator explains the quick degradation of humanity over five hundred years, but does not fill in the gaps of where all the futuristic technology came from in the meanwhile. Most of the criticism of this very fun (and funny) film seems to surround this omission, and the resulting complaint that the world isn't ""realistic"". As if ""realism"" has ever been a necessary quality of satire. Is ""Brazil"" realistic? How about ""Futurama"" or ""Transmetropolitan""? Hell, how about ""Gulliver's Travels""? I thought not. ""Idiocracy"", while maybe not as pointed as the best of the genre, hits the same notes and generally does so successfully.Besides, I didn't find the futuristic technology to be a problem. It is pretty easy to figure out that Mike Judge is satirizing the current trend toward automation and simple product interfaces, so that even total idiots can use them. As in ""Brave New World"", the society in the film seems to have reached a point of automated self-sufficiency at some point in the past (apparently created by the now-extinct 'smart people' in order to placate an increasingly stupid populace), leaving the remainder of humanity free to indulge all the worst, most selfish impulses they can come up with, and grow even stupider. The film just happens to take place during the last gasp of humanity, as everything begins to fall apart for good. It may still be ""unrealistic"", but if so, it's a remarkably well-presented brand of unrealism.The stupid people take up most of the screen time, of course, but they're just the victims -- they don't know any better. Mike Judge saves his real hate for the intelligent people in power who are dead by the time the film begins, but who are very much alive right now, in the 21st century. People like scientists who chase ""hair growth and prolonged erections"" for no other reason than the possibility that they'll turn a profit on their snake-oil treatments. People like politicians who let corporations simply purchase the FDA and FCC. People like media executives and their yuppie stooges who promote stupidity -- who enable the destruction of all culture, morality and health to make a quick buck.After all, who is really to blame, the Morlocks or the Eloi? The Paris Hiltons of the world, or the brilliant executives and advertisers that put her on TV and lowered our cultural standards enough to leave her there? This is all implicit in ""Idiocracy"", though. A line here, a hint there (witness the hilarious auto-doctor which literally does all the work in the health care system). It's one of the few aspects of the movie that's NOT pounded into the ground by the unnecessary narrator. It's just there for the viewer to pick up, or not, but it is one of the most interesting themes in a movie that's much smarter than any other comedy of the year.Pity that so many people will leave the film thinking it's just an excuse to show rear ends farting and people being hit in the groin. Not that that stuff isn't funny too, and maybe it IS a little pandering. But in ""Idiocracy"", it's just not as simple as it seems.",Idiocracy

It is good, no, great, an instant classic.

Visually fun to watch and I think we may have missed a few Sibyl background things but when our friends come over, we'll watch it again with them to catch those few things. It's nice to know we are not the only ones that think the human race is starting to be made up of those whose genes are from the bottom of the pond.",Idiocracy

Mike Judge paints a cautionary tale.",7,10 February 2007,"When I first saw the previews for this film, I wasn't sure what to expect.All of the satirical allusions were actually more depressing than funny  the over-emphasis on sex, the complete brutalization of the English language, the animosity toward intellectuals and labeling anyone that uses words with more than two syllables as a ""f**."" I see this form of idiocy in full effect today, we don't need a futuristic fiction when this level of horror is already here. There were some truly hilarious moments in this film but most of them can already be witnessed by observing society today (""I like money""). If the jibes at today's ""urban"" culture and deep-south felt too stupid to be true, turn on your local news or visit a local mall. If ignorance annoys you, this film is not for you.Sadly, the truth this satire presents will fall on deaf ears; ""Dis moo-E don't av Enuff boo bees n' sh*t, yo.""This review may come off as one pompous ass' diatribe on our society's devolution but, in a world where grown men playing with balls and fat, ex-playboy models are deified ...I'm fairly sure Mike Judge shares my concern enough to make this film.All in all, I could see this film garnering a cult following (to the likes of Judge's other works).",Idiocracy

The plot of this movie revolves around an average Joe waking up 500 years in the future and finding out that he is the smartest man alive. I like the idea of this movie and I think it could have been great but it had too many flaws. I think the producers could have done a lot better but this film leaves nothing behind.

OK so good start how ever this movie took a turn in a very wrong direction and itself became stupid, full of jokes that a first grader might find amusing. maybe i just feel this was on account that the start of the film was sort of witty and clever. and yes i understand that this was meant to be a satire but i was just board by most of the film the style of humor was dull and vulgar. i don't know i guess the best i can say is if your intelligent you will be board by this film, if you are stupid you will be insulted by it, and if you are still entertained by watching the wwf and holly wood hulk hogan you will love it but manage to miss the point entirely. watch the first 15 minuets and skip the rest.",Idiocracy

This film is pretty much identical to every other piece of Mike Judges work I have seen. It is pretty much a cross between Beavis and Butthead (the idiots) and King of the Hill (the straight guy).

By making the protagonist into a 'regular' guy, the movie attempts to bring down to earth the viewpoints and social views of the intelligent elite of society.At the beginning, Joe is just a regular. However, when he is transported into the future, he is suddenly a genius. Yet, despite the superior intelligence, he lacks many of the skills to avoid effectively communicating with his intellectually inferior audience. His first successful communication invokes the supernatural, when he claims the plants have spoken to him.However, the movie does conclude with a message on how the elite should act. Despite intellectual superiority, the movie concludes that the elite should work to help those less intelligent. Joe ends as president, and by doing so, he is able to promote intelligence among all.",Idiocracy

We have yet to discuss it.This movie may seem silly, but I have worked in and around people that are ""breeders"" and have no interest in improving their lot in life. They think the government will be there to take care of them.My opinion is that this movie hits real close to home and shows where we are likely to end up if we don't do something about the values in our country and the world. We need to get back to basics, God, Country and Family and wipe out the extracurricular crud.It is real easy for parents and politicians to bury their heads in the sand, but this movie has potential to be a reality.

Even looking at Luke Wilson (who I rather enjoy looking at) became rather difficult. Maya's character wasn't involved enough. Even the transitions from one scene to the next were choppy and uncomfortable. Honestly, I think I'd prefer the film in the movie to this one.

M. Kornbluth (not sure of the spelling), a very well known SF writer, called ""The Marching Morons"" which has the same basic plot as this movie but was a more serious story.The story ended very differently, but, again, the basic idea of the story and the movie were the same.

508,phrednash@hotmail.com,It's not about the fart jokes...,7,2 September 2006,"As social satire, Idiocracy is just as good as Office Space, but with a wider scope. To criticize this film as too puerile due to potty humor is to kind of miss the point, I think. There are certainly fart jokes etc., but they're not really intended to be funny to the audience - they exist to define the state of ""culture"" in the world of 2500 AD visited by Joe, as a background to the bizarre state of affairs in which he awakes. The real humor of the film lies in the many sight gags and attitudes present in this future society that are just a shade off of what we encounter in our daily lives, and which should serve as a warning. My personal favorite is the depiction of Fox News. The subtle brilliance in the film lies in the fact that it also digs at ""smart"" people, and average Joes like the protagonists. Note the times in the film when Joe and Rita almost subconsciously conform to the idiots around them, and you realize that Idiocracy is not created to pick on any group of people in particular, but on the culture of idiocy in general. I don't know what to say about the ""made for conspiracy theory"" behavior of Fox in releasing this film, but if it's not playing in your local theater, demand it.

509,Froomshanker,Clear why this satire received no marketing,8,1 November 2020,"What is scary about this movie is how conceivable its premise is. I watched this on DVD in the run up to the 2020 US election and we are frighteningly close to being just a few steps away from what the film portrays.Idiocracy was brought to my attention as a film worth seeking out, one that had been denied any marketing on release and thus fallen below the radar. The implication had been that there was some over arching objective to supress the message delivered by Idiocracy. Now having seen it, I am relieved that this was not the case. More likely it was corporate fear that kept this supressed.I well imagine the Fox meeting where the theatrical cut was screened and them witnessing the extent that this film ridicules clearly identifiable household names: Costco as a retail leviathan, both Starbucks and H&R Block as purveyors of services 'with benefits'. To name just a few. This movie was multiple lawsuits waiting to happen. That it was released at all is a small miracle and only then due to contractual obligation.If only those involved had replaced these with some made up unrecognisable brand names, they would have been home and dry. Some comic value may have been lost, but it would have been a worthwhile trade off.So is this a masterpiece? Most definitely not. the visual effects are poor, the sets and props worthy of a low budget TV sci-fi series. At only 84 minutes, it is disappointingly short. The narrator is a superficial mechanism for the plot development. Spoon feeding the storyline to the viewer a clear nod towards the future that Idiocracy foretells.What is left more implicit is Mike Judge's disdain for the smart people who have been rendered extinct by the time the film is set. Those who worked on developing snake oil treatments and systems automation in order to pander the progressively dumber mass market, rather than reversing this decline of society.But it is no trash movie either. It is a light hearted comedy with some great visual gags. There is a running sub-joke involving Joe's wet-behind-the-ear innocence throughout the film, even when he is being hailed as the World's smartest man. But clearly most comedy value is in Joe's despair at having to motivate the utter pond life that society has become. This makes it more fun than outright funny.",Idiocracy

First thing that came to mind was: Dystopia.Now a number of movies and TV programs featuring dystopic futures ran though my mind while watching this show. Several have already been mentioned in other IMDb reviews, but I'll include them for completeness: Futurama, Back to the Future, Buck Rogers, Escape from New York, Wall-E, RoboCop, I Robot, even Blade Runner, Brazil, 12 Monkeys, Rollerball, Westworld.

It's the natural progression of people who like Ricki Lake, Monster Truck Madness, Judge Judy, Pro Wrestling. People who think book readin' and learnin' is gay and that the ""Prezident"" should fire off a few rounds of a submachine gun to quiet the cabinet.It's no great sci-fi or social commentary like Gattaca or Soylent Green.

I wish that this movie was accurately labeled 'fiction', but anyone paying attention to the big picture is well aware that the wheels are already in motion (very reminiscent of the stand-up of Joe Rogan, which I also highly recommend) The idiots of the world have consistently outbred the intelligent, and we have faced war, religion, and countless other monstronsities as a consequence. With the emergence of the technological age and mass communication, humans are living superficial lives of luxury in a world where talentless, pretty faces on the radio are having children and Isaac Newton died a virgin. This film simply portrays a shockingly plausible future in a format that serves to appease the brightest individuals with its wit and irony, while also producing belly laughs for the sharp and dull alike. For example, you don't have to analyze the phrase ""Extra big ass taco!"" being spewed from the Carl's junior machine to laugh out loud, and yet when you do, it only gets funnier.

He said it was his favorite movie and one of the greatest social comedies of all time. Plus I've always appreciated Mike Judge's body of work in general so I thought I was in for one of those overlooked gems I occasionally come across.I really wish this movie hadn't been built up so much, because that is part of the reason it fell a bit short of expectations.There is a lot to appreciate about this movie. Conceptually it is brilliant. The casting was good. And I applaud the message intended. There were some great moments and some very profound humor worthy of the likes of Mark Twain and Will Rogers (who?). The doctor in the hospital made me partially inhale my beverage. The destruction of Frito's car and the fact that his obsession with violence overrode his realization that it was his car was almost sublime. The acceptance by the presidential cabinet of the notion that the plants were talking to Joe Bauers and telling him they wanted water was a pretty sophisticated portrayal of stupidity as kind of retarded mysticism, like Attila the Hun's obsession with magic.Sounds like I should have loved this movie, right? I did like it, but I was far from blown away, which is sad because I really wanted to be blown away, and I think it could have been a very important social comedy along the lines of Dr. Strangelove if it had been done properly. I think the problem was with delivery. This movie must have looked amazing on paper, because the jokes are sound. The movies looks like a movie that was rushed and didn't really get the attention it deserved. I understand that it had been somewhat abandoned by the sponsoring studio, and it shows. And the movie contains one major flaw. The entire ""rehabilitation"" sequence was either badly conceived, badly executed, or shouldn't have been in the movie at all. It seems like a filler sequence that is only there because there was not material to fill a feature-length film (although I disagree with that), and it just runs the premise into the ground. On top of that, the whole thing is boring and almost completely unfunny. It was at this point that I started losing interest.Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that, despite it's shortcomings, there is still a lot to talk about. This is exactly why I was so disappointed, because there IS a lot to talk about, and a film that could have achieved greatness and could have had a lot more exposure did not. Oh well.

I am surprised to admit this film is even better than Office Space (if the true followers can believe that). I have to write this review because this movie is (like office space) under rated and not advertised enough. I find myself laughing out loud just thinking about some of the lines from the film - out of the blue. It is the kind of movie that gets better each time you watch it (twice in a row one day). So much going on in the background. Their is this one scene were Joe freaks out because he sees the date (2505). He takes a look out the window and buildings are tied together, cars are piling up from a bridge that is out. But if you look real close, a cop car drives right past the pile up with a fresh car to boot and does NOTHING. It is the kind of stupid funny that some people might cringe at, but it is far from a mindless shallow movie as I think it points out what we are doing to ourselves as a civilization in a satirical way. I can think of at least 20 one liners that are probably a lot funnier if you see it actually happening. One cute little scene is when he goes to ""St. Gods Memorial Hospital"" (seeing is important because misspellings and hospital didn't fit so they started writing it crooked on the building like a kid that ran out of room on the line he was writing on and shrunk and twisted it). In the hospital (background) their is this guy playing a slot machine to win free medical care. Then you see this robotic floor cleaner that keeps bumping up against the wall saying ""your floor is now clean"", and that little strip is clean, but the rest of the floor is trashed. Just the look on the receptionist face as she is obviously bored and annoyed, completely in her own world the whole time Joe is talking to her. You can see she has a key pad in front of her with pictures of the reason for the visit ( baby born, broken bone, bullet wound). Its great, the receptionist could care less about Joe, but the automated system is so polite. Actually she doesn't even talk to Joe just the computer. And their is this guy in the hospital that is clearly there because he is stuck in his own shirt (background again). It actually took longer to talk about it all than just to see it happen. Its not forced like one joke to the next, its more like another world that parallels ours and highlights everything ridiculous.

I didn't find the movie funny and I didn't find the movie ""awesome"". It came across as a low-budget, haphazardly-put-together movie and was largely a disappointed and waste of 2 hours of my life.

The premise is that Natural Selection is no longer working and that dumb people, (explicitly those not in the Urban Upper Middle Class) are out breeding the UUMC's so that in 500 years time, everybody is a moron. Conceptually complete garbage, but the movie runs with it very well. The Reviewers though often aren't very bright themselves, and 'documentary', 'likely scenario' etc are fairly common descriptions. Many of them and the UUMC explicitly BELIEVE this premise is accurate and this counter intuitive idiocy is fundamental to understanding this movie! Do you really think Evolution would have stopped after 4 billion years, just to make way for UUMC social snobbery? Intelligence is not hereditary and it certainly is not the prerogative of the UUMC. The underlying irony is that these people are lower breeders and they may well be the real losers in Natural Selection terms because their focus on careers and money over procreation is... well simply an aberrant behaviour that is of no longterm value! One Reviewer says this is an 'elitist' movie. That's correct. It's an elitist premise that the UUMC's are the intellect of our society, and without them, everything would fall apart cos everybody else is stupid. Because this concept is so flawed, it's expansion in this movie, is too crudely ludicrous and transparently snobbish even for our pseudo intellectual UUMC's, as it appears from many of the Reviews! That may answer the much asked question 'Why did Fox not promote this movie?' Because it's audience demographic is very uncertain, the elitism of its premise attracts the UUMC and alienates it at the same time with the depiction of the crude consequences! To us non UUMC ie- social low life scum that have the brains not to ape worthless UUMC values, the movie is a brilliant piece of double bluff. Rare indeed between the Scylla and Charybdis of Hollywood drivel, and pretentious Independent irrelevance of most contemporary cinema.",Idiocracy

The one thing I did not expect was how this movie stayed with me as it,as it makes you look directly at the stupid things in society today, which normally you put aside and shrug off as out of your control to change.

Some may even find it offensive. Those people are probably the ones that this movie is pointing at. This movie is a great example of who should breed and who should not as well! This movie is sure to challenge ridiculous new age beliefs that we are destined for a greater and higher consciousness by simply feeling good.

In my summary, I say ""educational"", which is, admittedly, an extreme word to use, but at very least, this comedy has a valid point to make.The fact that Fox made such stupid decisions with the release of this film is disappointing, but not surprising.

This film is completely warped and will make you laugh your head off (literally). If we are this dumb in the future then I'd just love to see what it's like, also the show in it, ""OW, MY BALLS!"" looks absolutely hysterical. The story line of the film is funny too as it is set in the future where people are so stupid that they're giving their plants Gatorade and rehab consists of running away from monster trucks in a little car. Also at the end there is an awesome and hilarious twist! It has lots of sarcasm humour, slapstick humour and silly/ stupid humour therefore it's fit for all audiences with all different types of humour.

The movie makes an attempt at satire, but gets lost in the overall stupidity of its characters. The movie has none of the subtle humor that worked so fittingly in office space. Instead it relies on toilet humor that should have been plunged out of the script. Granted the movie is supposed to be about stupid people, but one can only handle so much.

The true achievement of this movie is that it keeps this idea entertaining for a full 2 hours and even manages to deliver a 'punch line' (if you will) that would make many talented stand up comedians jealous.The satire and reflection on our modern day culture present in this film is both hilarious and at the same time frighteningly relevant. You could watch this and laugh until you cry or feel frankly scared for the future of the human race. Within the first few minutes it delivers an observation so sharp and amusingly presented that it justifies watching the film alone.The film is packed with so much great dialogue and background visual humour (rivalling that of The Simpsons and Futurama) that it became exhausting to keep up the frequency of laughs required.I'm sure that if this film had not been made a comedian would have picked up on the idea eventually but I don't think they could do it the justice that the medium of film does here.

A black man was engineered to be President to complete the final removal of any power the people had. This slave, Obama, has the same masters as the Presidents before him.

The plot is thin, but since the movie has such a short running time, it only drags in a few spots. Otherwise, the jokes work, and carry right through until the end.

Michael Moore's Where to Invade Next settles it; Idiocracy is slowly evolving, alongside a similarly paced American societies devolution, into a truly great documentary. Some will disagree, but keep in mind the tremendous parallels drawn by the many scenes acting as great metaphors that can be stretched out over time to encompass the downfalls of many once great societies. The great bumbling bombastic fools as leaders whose electorates have seen their intellects consumed by self gratification and are unknowingly preprogrammed by master marketers into mass consumption cattle. Watch both and see if you don't agree.",Idiocracy

560,mwoodruff-2,I understand why they did not release it wide,3,1 September 2006,"Idiocracy has a few very funny moments, but it feels like something that should have been released Straight to Video.I am a huge Mike Judge fan. I own both versions of Office Space. I saw it opening night just as I saw Idiocracy and Beavis and Butthead Do America opening night. I will continue to support Mike Judge.This movie just doesn't work. You can't win them all.It really sucks that this movie did not get a chance. There is no trailer and I only saw one movie poster. It's a shame that Fox just dropped this into the toilet and then flushed it.Idiocracy is funnier than every other piece of crap comedy that was released this summer. That's not saying much.I hate to say this, but wait until it comes out on video. It will most likely be out VERY SOON.",Idiocracy
561,truegentleman,This is not science fiction !!!,9,20 January 2016,"The movie is definitely worth your time spent to watch it. It is entertaining and is not science fiction; this is exactly what is happening in the US right now (Trump endorsed by Sarah Palin). It is just a matter of observing the trajectory and you will notice that it may happen well before the 500 years the movie indicates. The main characters are well cast. The film rolls on starting in 2006 and moves quickly 500 years later. It is, in some scenes too slow, as if the Director needed to get more minutes in than necessary. A few punch lines are worth remembering and you will enjoy it more if you understand American ""culture"", especially if you lived in one of the Southern States (like I did). Europeans will find it anthropological in nature and will help confirm all possible stereotypes. In a nutshell it is good nature fun but keeps your brain connected. Some scenes are for adults due to explicit sexual references but, overall, the movie is for adult in terms of humour so it should not be a problem. Enjoy it with an open mind.",Idiocracy

It's a good idea but it is executed so badly and in a way that is so anti-funny that I felt like gouging my eyes out or else hunting down every individual involved in it's production and beating them to death with a wheel brace. The script feels like it was written by a group of 14 year old boys and the gags are few and far between. I first noticed that something was wrong after about 5 minutes but thought I would give the film a chance. Half an hour later my house mate voiced what we had all been thinking with the immortal line, ""this is the biggest load of ballix I've ever seen in all my puff."" After heartily agreeing with him I got up and turned it off before throwing the disc into the river at the back of my house and then rang my friend to ask him what in God's name he was playing at recommending this absolute piece of garbage. After being exposed to this twaddle you will feel empty inside and be ashamed to belong to the same species that produced it.

563,dbrucestevens,"Great story, but not Mike Judge's idea",5,28 September 2016,"This was fairly well-done as far as movies like this go. And the idea was wonderful....except that it was not an original idea by the Writer/Director Mike Judge. The original story was written by Cyril Kornbluth, titled ""The Marching Morons"" and published in 1951 by Ballantine Books. In 1959, it was included in an anthology of Kornbluth's work of the same name. Judge followed Kornbluth's story VERY closely for the first half of the movie, but changed the ending to be more upbeat. Kornbluth's story was a dark, doomsday plot.This movie should have been prominently billed as an adaptation of Kornbluth's work. There was only a very small note in the credits which appeared in a version a few years after the movie was released. Judge is tacitly accepting credit for the idea and story line.",Idiocracy
564,slatron,Great comedy - perfectly fits Mike's Judge's style,10,27 February 2007,"I was one of the few who went out of my way to see this in the theater. I've thought about it frequently ever since. After two DVD viewings I'm glad to say it held up perfectly. Like any great comedy, I laughed more on each viewing, both in anticipation of gags, but also after catching things missed before. Mike Judge does very well with creating insanely comedic characters and fitting them into their world so they make sense. In Office Space, the environment make the characters believable. Idiocracy's future gives him liberty to write unbelievably dumb characters and make them work. I'll be waiting to see if they release a better DVD with some actual features before buying it. But this movie deserves the support on DVD not offered to it at the theater.",Idiocracy

Now I know what many of you are thinking. ""Shut up"", or ""this jerk is unamerican""... But that's my point. You won't understand this movie, because it's making fun of you.But if you are a keen social observer who gets frustrated from time to time with mass culture and simple-minded people, you will find Idiocracy to be beautifully cathartic. This movie is very similar to Beavis and Butthead. Lots of poignant social commentary in the form of lowbrow jokes... So much social commentary, that certain corporations (ahem, fox, ahem ahem) disallowed it to be reviewed, released, or marketed. This could be a lamentable condition, but look what happened when Office Space went to DVD. Idiocracy is a martyr! Please make more movies, Mr. Judge! And not in Louisiana!!!!!",Idiocracy

I never even would have know it was in the theaters from the lack of advertising and promotion.I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard during a movie. As far as plot line and character development go, there's not much here, but if you watch it strictly as a satire on how stupid our population gets with each passing year, it's absolutely spot on. The very first five minutes of the movie are worth it, just to scare the hell out of smart people into having more children than the stupid ones. Why didn't this movie get more support from the studio? Did it test badly? If that were the case, then it's stunningly ironic that a move about stupid people would be misunderstood by test audiences. And definitely, definitely stay after the credits...",Idiocracy
568,sdoyle3,evolution doesn't always award intelligence,8,26 January 2007,"This is one of those movies that your either going to love or hate. I fell into the first category. There's all kinds of real subtle humor and things going on in the background ( Jack in-uh box advertisement) that keep a grin plastered on your face throughout. Unfortunately it seems that Mike Judge may be onto something as a lot of the events shown in the movie seem like they could be happen. Reality TV courtrooms are already in effect. (Judge Judy anyone?) And all the shameless advertisement that pops up seemingly everywhere. My only complaint with the movie is that though it starts out highly satirical, the last 40 minutes kind of take a more slapstick approach and some of the humor falls a little short. But its definitely worth watching.",Idiocracy
569,katetyrol,Disappointing,2,28 September 2007,"I was extremely disappointed by this movie. What started out promising - a talented writer/director, a visually striking and memorable future-scape, funny and interesting details of the future world, appealing characters played by two of my favorite comedic actors, and an absolutely wonderful premise - rapidly devolved into the most basic, uninteresting plot: average guy is stuck in strange circumstances and is misunderstood, is stuck by fate with an unknown, attractive woman. Excessively contrived, unlikely, uninteresting conflict ensues. Average guy's whole quest boils down to one over-hyped dramatic moment with an unrealistic resolution.There was no point during this movie when I saw a scene or character in the future world and identified with it or a part of it so that I could see myself or my life in a new light and laugh at it. I felt no sympathy for or connection to any of the characters and saw very few recognizable traits (mine or others) in them.My only guess as to what Judge's intent here might have been is to satirize by poking fun at the genre of stupid entertainment with the very film itself. Indeed, this movie will appeal most to the Ow-My-Balls-watching crowd due to its formulaic, uninteresting, unoriginal plot, but that does not make it satire. That is simply an unfortunate coincidence.I hate to waste time on an uninteresting movie, but my disappointment here is all the greater because this could have been such a great movie.",Idiocracy

571,trmbnplyr,"Amazing movie, but too much for a PC culture to handle",9,1 May 2017,"There is so much I could write about this movie, but I think that the first three minutes sums it up perfectly. The uneducated and irresponsible are reproducing at much faster rates than educated and responsible people. Nowadays, with so many safety measures and warning labels, natural selection is not doing enough to kill off the stupid. As such, the general population is getting dumber and dumber. This movie is a phenomenal prediction of the future. Additionally, it does a great job at showing how unchecked capitalism can take over a culture, as demonstrated by the comical amounts of advertisements and sponsors on everything in the movie. I believe that there is one major reason that this movie did not do so well: It hits too close to home and that offends people. Nobody wants to feel stupid, yet we are all guilty of performing some ""idiocies"" demonstrated in this movie from time to time, like lazing in front of the television for hours or blindly following trends, not questioning the reason these trends exist in the first place. I put this movie on the same level as stories like ""Fahrenheit 451"" or ""1984"" because it makes people take a second look at their lives and question the reason that certain systems are in place. People don't like this reminder. People just want to live in their happy little bubble, continue to sit contentedly in their parlor and watch ""Ow, my balls!"" all day and have it be socially acceptable or even encouraged. I believe, however, that people NEED to be reminded to think for themselves and question the world around them and ""Idiocracy"" does this in a wonderfully silly way.",Idiocracy

I just couldnt explain that because of my bad english, but mostly cause every pieces of movie was irrealistic (not surreal), and illogic. Its not a social criticism, its the stupid person's imagination about stupid people.
The only advantage of the movie was the first scene about intellectual declension, however the intelligence is not only based of genes, and not any type of intelligence could be destroyed by the western society. And at least, if the social intelligent would drop below some point, the people would not be able to operate that society, which would collapse, and after that, the evolution would favors for the clever ones.",Idiocracy

If you've noticed, this long-awaited movie suddenly got a quick release in a VERY few cities with no fanfare, commercials, trailers... a mistake, I feel, because this was a really funny movie. Perhaps Fox was scared because it skewers the dumb people of the world that go to most movies. (Seriously, I left the movie to go to the bathroom and the morons I encountered en route made me feel like I was still watching the movie.) In a world where crap like ... oh, just fill in the blanks ... get huge wide releases, ""Idiocracy"" deserved to prove itself on the open market.

It attacks US corporations - Could a corp take over federal institutions? could gator aid replace water? It attacks both the trailer trash and the yuppies. and that is why it is being under promoted. It is also why it probably appeals more to Euros than Americans. The jokes are too close to home for an American audience to like it. I found it both hilarious and disturbing.
