0,MartinHafer,Interesting but somewhat sanitized,6,28 October 2012,"""Contagion"" is not normally the sort of film I watch. However, my uncle was visiting and he LOVES Robin Cook novels--and a film like ""Contagion"" is right up that alley. So, I sat back and watched and moderately enjoyed the film.The film concerns an outbreak that is akin to the Black Plague of old. Folks start dying everywhere and there appears to be nothing to stop it wiping out the entire planet. Much of the film concerns the government's work to arrest the outbreak but some is about the effects on social order--and a breakdown of civility and law BEGINS to occur in the film. This aspect of the film was by far the most interesting to me. Oddly, however, this plot line seemed to disappear very quickly and the film did little to exploit this interesting plot. Instead, the film focused on more conventional plot elements and while it IS a good film, it seems to have missed out on the much more interesting aspect of such a global catastrophe. Worth seeing but I wished it had focused much more on the dark side of human nature, as it's bound to expose itself in spades if such a disaster would ever strike.",Contagion
1,TheLittleSongbird,An excellent film,8,29 October 2011,"I heard much about Contagion and having loved Traffic and Oceans Eleven and also the concept, I was really intrigued into seeing it. And I was very impressed. Okay, Contagion's drama and tension levels are not quite as effective as those of Traffic, and some scenes could have done with more conflict.However, it is not devoid of any of those things, and there are some shocking and suspenseful moments to savour as well. As you would expect from Soderbergh, Contagion is a slickly made film, with an intelligent and taut script, efficient directing and a well paced and interesting if sometimes wordy story.And I can't not mention the cast. Of an exemplary cast, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Ehle, Bryan Cranston and Kate Winslet are solid, and Jude Law in an unlikely role is much better than expected. Elliot Gould's cameo is nicely understated, and Laurence Fishburne and Marion Cotilard are as usual very good. Matt Damon was the standout for me, and one of the highlights of the film.Overall, excellent, while not either among the best or worst of the year, it was one of the most interesting. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Contagion
2,Leofwine_draca,Soderbergh just doesn't cut it...,5,8 January 2016,"CONTAGION is the latest addition to the cinematic sub-genre of 'virus' films detailing world populations suffering from various epidemics. Other favourites over the years have included the Dustin Hoffman film OUTBREAK and the Japanese epic VIRUS. This one takes a pleasingly global tone in its look at the rapid spread of a virus with devastating consequences, but the problem with it lies in Steven Soderbergh's direction.I'm just not a fan of Soderbergh and I never have been. This guy seems to be like anti-cinema to me; his camera-work always seems obvious, and it's as if his direction is constantly obtrusive, when in fact it should be unnoticeable. His attempt to direct a martial arts film, HAYWIRE, was pretty pathetic, and his direction was the worst thing about the otherwise involving CHE two-parter.CONTAGION is thus a frequently dizzying viewing experience in which a vast tableau of characters are involved with the epidemic in various ways. I was delighted when it turned out that Gwyneth Paltrow had very little screen time, but there are so many main characters in this that nobody really registers. Epidemic films should be thrilling and suspenseful, but CONTAGION never is; it does have a level of gritty realism going for it, but it's a film that it's hard to get excited about because it's just so ordinary.",Contagion
3,SnoopyStyle,Overall sense of dread,6,13 April 2014,"Director Steven Soderbergh has gathered a cast of big name actors to do this scattered storyline virus movie. There is no doubt that these are brilliant actors, and Soderbergh has great skills who has done multi-storyline movies. However in this case, the people die off and we can't built any emotional attachments to the characters.Soderbergh does inject a sense of realism in this movie with the exception of the conspiracy blogger Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law). The realism has its own sense of thrilling suspense, but none of it is memorable other than an overall sense of dread. Maybe it's a little too much matter of fact.",Contagion
4,Prismark10,Contagion,6,27 August 2021,"The Covid pandemic of 2020 led to renewed interest in Steven Soderbergh's star studded ensemble movie, Contagion.Contagion deals with the spread of an airborne virus from Hong Kong to around the world.The movie deals with Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon) as he loses his wife after a business trip to Hong Kong and later his stepson but he is found to be naturally immune.The virus spreads swiftly causing panic and terror. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in America leads the response for public health and search for a possible vaccine.It is rather prescient that writer Scott Burns used terms such as Social Distancing. Even have a disease that was borne by infected bats.Contagion gets a lot right that was mirrored in the real life pandemic. Conspiracy theorist Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) blogs about the virus. Later he peddles a homeopathic cure.Despite the international settings, it fails to display the sheer horror of the virus quickly spreading globally.Although there is a reference to cronyism, insiders using knowledge to keep their families safe. The real life pandemic highlight just how much cronyism by politicians was used to make profit for friends, families and themselves.Also Soderbergh was would have thought unthinkable that some Presidents and Prime Ministers would have been so lax about Covid. Calling it fake news or acting like Nero who fiddled while Rome burned.The multi narrative storyline means that characters are not well developed. I seemed to care little about Matt Damon's family.On the other hand the story moved swiftly enough and it was not heavy going.",Contagion
5,claudio_carvalho,"""Contagion"" Revisited in Times of COVID-19",7,4 January 2012,"In January 2012, I saw ""Contagion"" and I did not like it. Consequently I wrote a very critical comment comparing ""Contagion"" with many other outbreak horror movies. However, in times of COVID-19, I decided to see this film again and now I think I was unfair with Steven Soderbergh and Scott Z. Burns. Their work is a movie ahead of time indeed and a must-see in the present days. I apologize with them. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Contágio"" (""Contagion"").12 Jan 2012
Disappointing, Pointless, Boring and Unoriginal FilmThe executive Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) returns from a business trip to Hong Kong with a stop over at the Chicago airport, where she has sex with her former lover. Beth feels ill but she believes that the problem is jet leg. She travels back home to Minneapolis and spreads the virus to her son Clark (Griffin Kane) and her husband Mitch (Matt Damon). When Beth and Clark die, Mitch goes in quarantine where the doctors realize that he is immune to the mysterious virus.Meanwhile in Hong Kong, London and in a small province, people have the same disease. The American CDC and the World Health Organization give their best effort researching the virus that is spreading in a geometric progression. The outbreak is threatening the worldwide population of annihilation, unless a vaccine is well-succeeded. The scientists begin a fight against time.""Contagion"" is a sort of ""Full Frontal"" of the outbreak movies, with a collection of cameos of great actors and actresses but that never works. Actually it is a disappointing, pointless, boring and unoriginal film, with a storyline that any viewer has seen in at least half a dozen B-movies ""wrapped"" in a pretentious screenplay with several subplots that go nowhere. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Contágio"" (""Contagion"")",Contagion
6,nogodnomasters,BLOGGING IS NOT WRITING. IT IS GRAFFITI WITH PUNCTUATION.,8,18 April 2019,"The opening of the movie reminds me of ""12 Monkeys"" were a world wide epidemic is started by a person in an airplane. I really enjoyed the ""geek"" aspect of the movie as those who look at the virus infection do so from a logical, mathematical, scientific aspect as one might expect. We also have the personal aspect of people dying from the infection and their stories and of course the reporter/blogger who gets no respect. (My title is a line from the movie and is not to be considered my personal opinion.)As you can imagine, the virus structure is unique, it travels rapidly, and the body doesn't know how to handle it. Fortunately it has a short incubation period and acts like typical viruses, i.e. not spreading in colder environments. The movie centers on isolating infected people and trying to figure out the origin of the disease. It also deals with the more mundane aspects such as the specifics of burials, quarantines, irrational thinking, and big pharmaceutical companies. In doing so it jumps around a lot, with numerous subplots and no real central character. I believe this is done to give the audience ""the feel"" of the mobility of the virus, and world panic and not because the film director and editor are idiots. The movie also deals with the legal question of limits of ""free"" speech.I would classify the movie as sci-fi drama.No f-bombs, sex or nudity.",Contagion
7,kosmasp,Not an event movie,8,13 March 2012,"Not in the traditional sense that is. Because events are happening, just don't expect it to be something that will follow too much of a big drama you might expect from Hollywood. There are quite a few big names here and I guess some things may seem like a cliché to some people. But it's tough to make a movie about something like that and not touch some nerves or do something that people may expect.Still the movie has impact (even if it is slow driven and may feel ""senseless"") and is very well thought of. It may not satisfy your every need and may not fulfill what you'd hope for, but if you reflect on it, you may be able to see the real value of it. On the other hand, I can see that people really hated it (it's Soderbergh and should therefor be expected)",Contagion
8,Sleepin_Dragon,A surprisingly thought provoking watch.,7,3 March 2018,"Initially I thought I was in for a horror movie without the scares. How many zombie movies start of in the same way, Ill person on train collapses, carnage follows, however, consider a film that substitutes the carnage for reasoned plot. In some ways Contagion felt like it could have been made as a TV drama, the threat is very, very realistic, as you watch you find yourself thinking this could really happen. Immediately after watching I bought a hand sanitizer and checked for bats :-) Surprising parts for Damon and Paltrow, but each perform very well. Overall it was more contained then I expected, that in itself makes it scary, that safe feeling you get knowing blood thirsty monsters are on the other side isn't here, instead are a series of events that cause real unease. A good watch.",Contagion
9,jboothmillard,Contagion,6,18 November 2012,"From director Steven Soderbergh (Sex, Lies, and Videotape, Erin Brockovich, Traffic, Ocean's Eleven), I saw a few trailers for this film that had a good looking all-star cast, and the title certainly made it obvious what the subject matter would be, I was keen to see how it would fare. Basically executive Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) has returned home in Minneapolis from a business trip to Hong Kong, and before arriving she had a sexual encounter with an old boyfriend in Chicago, and she seems to have back with a bad case of the cold, but two days later her symptoms have become severely worse, to the point when she collapses from a seizure. Her husband Mitch (Matt Damon) rushes to hospital and hopes for the best, but her seizures continued and she died from an unknown virus that affected her brain and central nervous system, and worse comes when their son Clark (Griffin Kane) dies from a similar infection, so Mitch is put into isolation until he is proved to be immune from the virus. He and his daughter Jory (Anna Jacoby-Heron) plan to get out of the city and away from the contagion spreading, as he is unsure whether she is also immune or not, but quarantine has been imposed by the military, making sure that people stay in their homes and cannot spread any further symptoms they may have contracted from someone. Representatives from the Department of Homeland Security in Atlanta have gathered to meet and discuss the virus situation, including Centers for Disease Control and Prevention member Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) and Epidemic Intelligence Service officer Dr. Erin Mears (Kate Winslet), they discuss whether the outbreak could be a bioweapon to cause terror during the Thanksgiving weekend, but of course the virus is on a global scale as well. While Dr. Mears also becomes infected by the unidentified disease and eventually dies, scientists such as Dr. Ian Sussman (Elliott Gould), against the orders of his superior Dr. Ally Hextall (Jennifer Ehle) to shut down and destroy his samples, is investigating the cause and beginnings of the disease, and he finds a connection and cross between bat and pig DNA strains that locate back to Beth. Conspiracy theorist Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) has his opinions about the virus and posts videos and claims that he has found a cure for the virus and therefore cannot become affected, he is gaining the attention he wants, but of course eventually they find out he was never sick at all and was helping a company to make their money, he is at first arrested for fraud and conspiracy, but released by his followers who pay for his bail. Dr. Hextall identifies a potential vaccine to be released to the public to cure or relieve their symptoms of the virus, but it is impossible to make enough quantities for the thousands and millions infected, so a lottery is created where if you fall into one birth date number you will be treated, while the surviving samples of Dr. Sussman are put away in cryogenic storage. Dr. Leonora Orantes (La Vie en Rose's Marion Cotillard) was also looking for the origins of the virus in Hong Kong, working alongside Sun Feng (Chin Han) and other local Chinese epidemiologists and public health officials, and they are the ones who confirm Bet was the first to contract the virus strain, but she is kidnapped to help a community gain the rights to the vaccine first, and when they do get some they turn out to be placebos, and when she gets the opportunity she rushes to get away after finding this out. The last scenes of the film see the scientists slowly relaxing that the vaccine will do good for people, Mitch is allowing her daughter some contact with the young man she wanted to spend the prom with, and we see a flashback to Day 1 of the virus spread, when in China a tree is taken down and a bunch of infected bats fly away, one takes a piece of banana that drops into a pig pen, and it gains the bat's disease, this pig is then killed, a chef who is using the meat smothers his hands in its mouth and casually wipes his hands on his apron, and we see him shake hands with Beth, who would eventually touch her face and contract the MEV-1 Virus. Also starring Bryan Cranston as RADM Lyle Haggerty, John Hawkes as Roger, Sanaa Lathan as Aubrey Cheever and Demetri Martin as Dr. David Eisenberg. The recognisable and talented stars of the film all their parts pretty well, Damon, Law and Winslet are particularly memorable, I suppose you could compare this in some ways to the film Outbreak for a couple of reasons, it could have done with much more threat or perhaps more hideous scenes of the infected people, but it is scripted just about well enough, it's an alright medical drama. Good!",Contagion
10,rmax304823,Outbreak For Adults.,7,22 July 2012,"I missed the first half hour so my judgment may be flawed. I hope that's why it's so hard to rate this movie, because it's about one of a very few issues that seem very serious, inevitable, and aren't being earnestly addressed. (Among the others, earthquakes and population control.) It's an ensemble cast, full of stars and near stars. It moves along from one episode to the next, with time lapses indicated by the day count in red at the bottom of the screen. It's more like ""And The Band Played On"" than like any of the several other films of recent years dealing with some kind of microbiological outbreak. It's made for a mature audience. There are one or two small riots. Nobody gets shot. Nobody's head is ripped off. Nobody turns into melting plastic before your very eyes. There is not a bath tub full of blood to be seen anywhere. The subject is too terrifying for such cheap tricks.There are misunderstandings and Jude Law is a profiteering con man but there are no obvious evildoers. There's no government conspiracy, no corporative cover up. There is no madman out to destroy the world, and the Arabs or Chinese or North Koreans aren't behind it all. The musical score is sparse, suspenseful, and not very loud. And it's all supported by decent acting.So why does it seem dull? Partly because it moves slowly from one conundrum to another and they're all social in nature. Who gets the vaccine first? Does the vaccine work at all? What part does the internet play in the spreading of rumors? It's all vaguely interesting but it has nothing to do with what I, at any rate, think of as the root of the problem. Where the hell did the virus come from? We don't find out until a montage that takes place under the end credits.There are structural problems too. Maybe they were dealt with in the half hour that I missed. We need more information, spelled out slowly to accommodate the audience. More about the virus, in other words, and a bit less about the public reaction to it. I understand that others may feel differently. Fortunately, many years ago I took a course called Microbiology 101 and therefore I understood all the technical argot. I know how an enzyme fits into its substrate and am an expert on virology, immunology, epidemiology, posology, and the ashes of trichinopoly cigars.One way this difficulty -- and it's a considerable one -- might have been eased would be the traditional device of having an ordinary ignoramus (that is, us) being guided through the conundrum by the cognoscenti. ""You see, a virus is a very small thing. It's so tiny we're not even sure it's alive."" And so on. There is a passing reference to the flu epidemic of 1918 but it's gone too quickly. One of the investigators should have sat down with the audience's proxy and patiently explained what that epidemic was LIKE, because it's not likely to ring many bells in today's viewers. Anyway, it's refreshing to see a disaster movie in which skyscrapers don't crumble and cities aren't destroyed by epic fires. You know how the extent and impact of the disaster is suggested? The sidewalks are lined with bags of garbage that have never been picked up. You know how a massive amount of grief is shown on screen? Matt Damon has lost his wife and child and we see his face only in deep shadow as he flicks, one by one, through photographs of his dead family. We can't see his expression. If he's weeping, it's left to our imaginations to accept it. As I say, it's an adult movie.",Contagion
11,Tweekums,Worth catching!,7,1 November 2012,"When Beth Emhoff returns from Hong Kong to her home in the United States she brings something unwanted with her; a deadly virus that will soon kill her and then her young son. At first doctors have no idea what killed them but soon more cases emerge around the world; at first it is just a handful here, a handful there but soon it is a major pandemic that threatens to be worse than the outbreak of Spanish flu that killed one percent of the population in 1918. Medical researchers battle to find a cure but they aren't immune to its effects; both physical and emotional as they both succumb to the illness and break the rules to try to safeguard their loved ones. As time passes panic sets in amongst the population and people will do whatever it takes to get hold of any rumoured cure. The film follows the action of medical researchers, the husband of Beth Emhoff and a blogger who is convinced that there is a known cure which is being suppressed so pharmaceutical companies can profit. We also see recordings of Beth Emhoff while she was in Hong Kong and Macau as people try to discover just how she caught the disease.This is a fairly grim film; characters played by well known actors die fairly unpleasantly as do children and things keep getting worse before there is any sign that a cure might be found it was so bleak that at times I wondered whether the film would end with a cure or extinction! It obviously plays on common fears of illness such as SARS, bird flu and swine flu but does it in a way that makes a gripping story. Despite its grimness it is well worth watching; it is well acted by a cast full of well known names none of whom acts as though they were the 'star' of the film; each just plays their role well.",Contagion
12,paul_haakonsen,I was genuinely disappointed...,4,18 December 2011,"Admittedly, then I had really high hopes for this movie, because the reviews I had read and the words spoken about it had been praising and commenting well on the story. So I sat down to watch this movie with a great level of expectation. And also, I wanted to see it because I was in Hong Kong when SARS broke out, so this movie had an additional initial appeal for me.And now having seen the movie, I sit here somewhat dumbfounded. Was that really it? There movie wasn't all that and a bag of potato chips. Sure it deals with a topic that is constantly lying under the surface, a global pandemic crisis. And that storyline was great. However, the movie tried to tell too many tales at the same time and tried to weave them in together somehow, but it just didn't work. The end result was half-hearted because none of the characters had any chance to evolve or shine on the screen, and the story was jumpy, trying to be everywhere at once.Sure, they had a great bunch of people on the cast list, lots of nice actors and actresses, well-established names, however, the performers just had very little to work with in their characters, and that put the movie back a notch. The most memorable performance was the one by Elliot Gould, and he didn't even have that big a role.The music score for the movie was quite good, on another note. And it was actually what worked out the best for me, because the movie was a tad jumpy and shallow, wanting to accomplish a lot, but failing to do so, spewing out only mediocre results.Aside from the music score, what this movie had working for it is the fact that it leaves you with something to think about once the movie is over. Sure, it will not be the performances that will linger in your mind, but the possibility of such a viral outbreak. It happened with SARS and H1N1, so is it just a matter of time before the next? I like that in movies, when they leave you with something to think about. However, I did rate the movie from its entertainment value and its storyline.""Contagion"" is a good attempt at a modern viral outbreak movie, but it just didn't even reach the 1995 movie ""Outbreak"" to the knees. That movie was far better executed and entertaining.",Contagion
13,edwagreen,Contagion Negatively Infects Us **1/2,5,21 July 2012,"The predictable film where an unknown virus spreads like wildfire throughout the world with the usual havoc resulting among the populace.We see the usual in such things-brave people, who are willing to risk their lives in search of a cure, those ready to exploit the situation such as the drug companies, people panicking while debate rages how much the people should be told. Of course, the president is hidden underground and various U.S. cities are quarantined. What else would you expect from this Irwin Allen-like disaster film?I don't have to tell you about the predictable ending. Imagine, the near beginning, when Gwyneth Paltrow, a victim of the virus, was cheating on husband Matt Damon and the Disease Control commission has to inform him of this. Terrible.The ending credits thank the Disease Control Commission. I say no thank-you to this routine rip-off film Jude Law, as the cynical reporter, has the best idea in that everything stinks-that sure includes this picture.",Contagion
14,michaelRokeefe,Don't touch anyone!,8,5 October 2011,"This is a subtle thriller that could have used a finale with a bigger bang of our bucks. Nonetheless intriguing and fascinating. There are so many stars, but then people are dying off pretty quick. This film is good enough to tell your friends about. Beth Emhoff(Gwyneth Paltrow)is flying home to her husband Mitch(Matt Damon)and family. She brings back from China an illness that mimics the flu...a very serious flu that causes her rapid death in the hospital. The Center for Disease Control and World Health Organization must quickly identify this bug and wipe it out. Dr. E. Cheever(Laurence Fishburn)of the CDC is stifled and sends out a contemporary Dr. Erin Mears(Kate Winslet)to find and contain it. The Who deploys Dr. Leonora Orantes(Marion Cotilard)to search for this deadly disease's origins. Mitch seems immune for some reason and wants to help as much as he can at any cost. To make things interesting a freelance photojournalist Alan Krumwiede(Jude Law)appears to be a prophet, but authorities don't take him very serious. But Mitch wants to believe him after losing his wife and stepson to the deadly contagion and wants his daughter to survive. If CONTAGION doesn't satisfy you, it is not because directer Steven Soderbergh went too cerebral. Emotional and chaotic, sustaining hope for the characters. Some disturbing images that are needed to provide muscle for the story line. This is an epidemic you can hardly hide from the world's populace. Also in this ensemble cast: Monique Gabriela Curnen, Elliott Gould, John Hawkes, Tien You Chui and Armin Rohde.",Contagion
15,sunwarrior13,An Excellent Medical Disaster Film,10,5 April 2013,"""Contagion"" is a medical thriller disaster film that features an ensemble cast that includes Marion Cotillard, Bryan Cranston, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, and Jennifer Ehle. The screenplay documents the spread of a virus transmitted by fomites, attempts by medical researchers and public health officials to identify and contain the disease, the loss of social order in a pandemic, and finally the introduction of a vaccine to halt its spread. It was written by Scott Z. Burns,who was inspired by various pandemics such as the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2009 flu pandemic. Steven Soderbergh directed the film.Tense, tightly plotted, and bolstered by a stellar cast, Contagion is an exceptionally smart and scary medical disaster film. Adopting a clean, chronological and punchy approach, Soderbergh holds a steady eye on panic and chaos. Though lacking in intensity, this apocalyptic cautionary tale nevertheless presents a chillingly-plausible peek at how quickly civilization might unravel in the face of a rapidly-accelerating, extinction-level, biological event. What's more,the presence of the cast helps as their authority is part of what keeps us fascinated by the gruesome fable, juicing it a bit, so that we can actually enjoy it. It is must-see indeed.",Contagion
16,Theo Robertson,Slow Moving Apocalypse,5,13 September 2012,"I once sat in a room with a bunch of film students discussing Wim Wenders films mentioning how much I hated his movies in general TILL THE END OF THE WORLD in particular: "" I was expecting something in the vain of British apocalyptic novelists like John Wyndham or John Christopher . Oh the world ends in three hours so what does everyone do? - sit around and discuss the human condition "" In many ways this is very similar to a Wenders film . It'll appeal to all these high brow critics who want a bit of existentialist substance instead of action and the film does get off to an arty chin stroking start where "" hierarchy of image "" takes precedence over such concepts as dialogue or a jump start opening . This shouldn't be taken as a criticism but if you're looking for an exciting Hollywood thriller please look elsewhere because this is slow burning introspective drama BTW don't be fooled by all the big names in the cast . It's similar to all these big names who appeared in THE THIN RED LINE in that the big names are mostly cameos and it's actors you've rarely heard of that carry the movie . Still it's a movie that'll appeal more to pretentious film students rather than the multiplex crowd",Contagion
17,Scarecrow-88,Contagion,8,10 August 2013,"Truly terrifying (with the ending providing rays of hope after such horror) account following a series of days after a contagion (brought to the States by an American from a Hong Kong restaurant) starts to globally develop into an epidemic spreading at an acceleration that produces nightmarish results. Because desperation and fear (and the need to survive) take over the human psyche and emotions, soon stores are looted, nurses strike, the police force dwindles, thieves in masks raid homes, hospitals become breeding grounds for disease, and before you know it, mass graves become commonplace as a result of this disease (because it is unlike anything scientists have encountered, producing a vaccine becomes difficult and the urgency of developing one is of the utmost importance). The film is expertly directed with a sense of clinical precision by Steven Soderbergh (his comments on retiring from directing after seeing this has me gobsmacked; he's still firing on all cylinders, even after the popcorn ""Ocean's"" movies seemed to indicate he was content on providing entertainments instead of confrontational movies about the human condition) who documents the disease and its effects on a group of talented actors.Jude Law stood out from the cast, to me, with his reprehensible character, as a blogger who confronts issues, such as the pharmaceutical industry specifically, that are controversial (particularly after he gets done with them), taking a drug that supposedly helps combat (and possibly cure) the disease, basically pocketing money for something that doesn't cure at all (in fact, Law was immune to the disease!). Matt Damon is a grieving husband and father whose wife (Gwyneth Paltrow; her part isn't hefty, but its significance to the outbreak is of special importance) and son perish, but when his daughter returns from a visit in another state, he takes it upon himself to shield her in a basic quarantine situation so he doesn't lose her to. This causes much strife for the teenage girl because of a boy she has a particular romantic interest inshe obviously feels trapped. Laurence Fishburne is employed with the CDC, and working in concert with Kate Winslet (when he sends her to Minnesota researching the disease she falls victim to it and is unable to return) and Jennifer Ehle (she winds up, with help from Elliot Gould's own disease specialist (he defies her orders not to research and investigate the disease), to uncover a vaccine after studies regarding how it attacks cells), tries to find a vaccine. Fishburne's fear for his wife (Saana Lathan) to get out of Chicago (knowing that the city would fall under a systematic quarantine after being told by his boss (Bryan Cranston)) opens him up to public scrutiny thanks to Law's investigation of any behavior from the government he could use against them. Marion Cotillard rounds out the impressive cast as a doc in Hong Kong, working with their investigators to research the root cause of the outbreak, retracing Paltrow's movements prior to returning home, soon kidnapped by one of those she was in communication with (his village, full of children, had yet to contract the disease, and he was using Cotillard as leverage for the vaccine). Cotillard, in a development that might be surprising to some, and not others, while ""held captive"" was actually teaching the village children and supportive of their getting the vaccine. When a member of her government brings what appears to be a chest of the vaccine, Cotillard is released, but she soon learns a devastating truth regarding what exactly was in those vials.It is almost like a documentary in its approach, but Soderbergh doesn't leave out a sensitivity of human goodness and decency (Matt arranges a ""prom"" of sorts for his girl, with her beau later invited over to dance, and it didn't hurt he received the ""lottery"" vaccine; Cotillard truly cares for the children of those who kidnapped her, a willing accomplice in their need for the vaccine; Fishburne gives his vaccine to the son of a janitor in his building), and the devastating effects (Matt looks over his wife's last digital photos; Fishburne returns home to find his wife had been victim of a home invasion; we see streets with garbage, looters running around leaving destruction in their wake, buildings with store windows broken and engulfed in flames) are shot in a way that leaves a gulp in your throat. This leaves an impact because it could happen. The conclusion shows that a simple fruit bat, if its environment is destroyed, could cause such an outbreaksomething as seemingly insignificant as a bat could leave behind such significant wreckage is food for thought. Soderbergh is at the peak of his powers.",Contagion
18,Hey_Sweden,Definitely worth a look.,7,5 June 2018,"Gwyneth Paltrow plays a ""patient X"", a woman who travels abroad and ends up contracting a lethal new virus that doesn't take long to kill the host. Things escalate fairly quickly, and soon the whole U.S. of A. is having to deal with an outbreak of massive proportions. The death toll is high: approximately one out of four people perish from contact with the virus. Dedicated doctors like Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) deal with the crisis as pragmatically as possible, while we see how it affects ordinary people like Matt Damon, in the role of Paltrows' husband.""Contagion"" is an interesting film, worth seeing, that attempts to show the more serious, ""realistic"" aspect to stories such as in ""Outbreak"" (1995). Director Steven Soderbergh, working from Scott Z. Burns' script, handles the material using a documentary-style approach. While some time is made for personal drama for assorted characters, Soderbergh and Burns would rather show you how places like the World Health Organization and the Centre for Disease Control would function in such a case. It does require the use of much language that the layman such as this viewer would not understand, but the points do still come across.Much like it would happen in real life, there is always a certain amount of cynicism and opportunism going on, as some individuals try to see how they can best profit from the situation. But then, this has always been the case. Just as we often see humanity at its worst during these times, we also see humanity at its best, as people like the Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Kate Winslet, and Jennifer Ehle characters diligently work to solve the problem. In addition, we see how a cocky, smarmy blogger played by Jude Law undermines the efforts of Fishburne, yet the man does have some pointed comments to make himself.A gallery of familiar faces turn up in roles big and small: John Hawkes, Demetri Martin, Elliott Gould, Enrico Colantoni, Bryan Cranston, Sanaa Lathan, and Sanjay Gupta as himself. Each actor does get his or her little moment to shine, but this is truly more of an ensemble piece than a vehicle for anyone in particular.Key to the films' effectiveness is the fact that it remains fairly fascinating throughout, and its 107 minute run time moves along quicker than one might realize. It just dives headfirst into the story proper, with all credits, including the title, saved for the final several minutes. (And it waits until the concluding moments to show us how the virus got started in the first place.)Seven out of 10.",Contagion
19,LeonLouisRicci,"Views Like a Visual, Tedious Textbook",4,22 July 2012,"Straightforward matter-of-fact, and rather dull. The Director's laconic pacing is ever present and his oh-so contemplative concept of lingering on shots and scenes is a matter of style that actually keeps some of his films from ever being enjoyed as entertainment, or for that matter enlightenment.A realistic global pandemic where people just get sick and die and don't turn into zombies or vampires is a tough topic to tackle. But this is like viewing a tedious, jargon laden textbook. There are a few, if very brief, bouts of interactions and encounters with a panicky public that introduce some terror and tension. These, however, dissipate quickly and the slow beat goes on. So we are left with a so-so exploration of a societal situation of depression and despair that looks like we are watching it all from a satellite, distanced and detached.",Contagion

21,ferguson-6,Can't Touch This,5,10 September 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. Fellow germophobes beware: the first few minutes of this movie will have you reaching for disinfectant and a surgical mask. Just remember - it's only a movie. The scary part is that we have already experienced much of the terror that the film presents. We have seen first hand the effects of Swine Flu and Asian Bird Flu. We understand the fear of uncertainty and helplessness. What we need to remember is that a virus is a living element capable of mutating and spreading ... it looks for a way to get stronger and survive.The movie goes for the gut punch in the first few minutes. We see Gwyneth Paltrow returning home to hubby Matt Damon after an overseas business trip. We immediately know she is sick, but we aren't sure of the source ... though the film provides many possibilities. Simultaneously we are shown numerous people with the Paltrow symptoms all over the world, and quickly understand that these are related and the ""monster"" is spreading quickly.Cut to Dr. Cheeve (Laurence Fishbourne) and his team at CDC. He partners with Dr. Orantes (Marion Cotillard) of the World Health Organization and Dr. Mears (Kate Winslet) from the Epidemic Intelligence Services. We are left to fill in the blanks on how these organizations work together to study and interpret the source and danger of an outbreak.The true heroes of science are those in the labs. Here we have Dr. Hextall (Jennifer Ehle, from The King's Speech) and Dr. Sussman (Elliott Gould). We understand that these are highly talented people with the very specific skills needed to save the planet.From a movie making perspective, the film is technically fine. The camera work and acting are all excellent. Director Steven Soderbergh is a superstar director and well-respected. Writer Scott Burns has quite an impressive resume. The cast is as deep and spectacular as any you will see this year. Then why am I in such a funk about this film? It disappoints me to say that the film plays like a disjointed mess. We get bits and pieces of numerous stories throughout, but never do we really connect with a single character. Matt Damon and Lawrence Fishbourne have the most screen time, but neither are accessible or give us any reason to believe we know them ... only their desperation. Jude Law plays a super-blogger who teeters between exposing governmental conspiracies and his own insider trading for personal gain. There are subplots with Marion Cotillard, Jennifer Ehle and Laurence Fishbourne that all could have been intriguing, but we get the glossy outline version, rather than an actual story.The film wants to concentrate not on the personal side of the outbreak, but rather the process of damage control, scientific research and lab work for a vaccine. But we only get scattered bits of any of this. Same with the political side. We see a ""world"" teleconference with the CDC and leaders from many countries, but never an explanation on why they are all looking to the U.S. for a miracle cure. It would have been fascinating to see how or if the experts from Japan, China, India and the U.S. work together in times of a global epidemic. Instead, we get thoughtful poses from Mr. Fishbourne. What a waste.Despite the potential for greatness, this film is neither thrilling or dramatic or informative. Mostly I wondered how much time the endless stream of movie stars actually spent on set. It appears Mr. Soderbergh now enjoys hanging with an all-star cast more than really making a statement with a movie. Additionally, I found the quasi-Techno soundtrack to be distracting and annoying. There are numerous virus outbreak movies that are superior to this one.Whether you see this movie or not ... remember to wash your hands!",Contagion
22,HotToastyRag,Typical disaster flick,3,9 December 2017,"As you might be able to tell by the title, Contagion is one of those ""everyone's going to die"" movies. It starts with businesswoman Gwyneth Paltrow who dies of a mysterious disease, but who else did she pass it to? Since she flew home from a business trip, everyone on the plane might be infected—is it too late to stop it before the entire world becomes extinct? Everyone knows I hate these types of movies, so if you actually like them, you won't be happy with my review. I find these movies extremely frightening and, as a rule, I try to avoid them. But, with the all-star cast of Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Elliott Gould, John Hawkes, Sanaa Lathan, Jennifer Ehle, and Bryan Cranston, I thought I'd give it a try. Thankfully, the film wasn't so traumatizing that it's burned in my brain and will give me nightmares in the years to come, but I could have done without seeing it. It's a very typical disaster flick, with an overview of varied characters that you quickly become attached to and then cringe when they get killed off. There are some gruesome scenes, but unless you're particularly sensitive, it won't be scarier than anything you've already seen.Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

23,gradyharp,Epidemiology and Terror,8,4 January 2012,"CONTAGION is an important film for the general public to see. It addresses the etiology of contagious diseases, how they begin, how they are introduced in to the world population, how they can be viewed as instances of germ warfare, how they are examined by both the US Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization, how they are disseminated, the processes required for creating a vaccine, how the treatments are managed, how individuals are affected both directly and indirectly, who decides the priorities of treating large number of people around the globe, and how in the face of a world crisis certain evil people can take advantage of the fear and make millions off unsuspecting terrified people. Yes, this information is in articles readily available for public consumption, but nothing surpasses a well-written film for getting the message across in a memorable way. Writer Scott Z. Burns produced the script and Steven Soderbergh mold this story with great skill. The cast is filled with major actors but in a film of this size few of them are given much screen time.Interestingly the film begins with the marker 'Day 2' and the significance of that move is held until the film's satisfying end. Beth Emhoff (Gweneth Paltrow) is returning home form a business trip in Hong Kong, has a layover in Chicago where she calls her husband Mitch (Matt Damon) informing him of the delay. She arrives home ill and son is dead form a seizure disorder brought on by encephalitis - and infection of unknown type that has spread to her brain. Soon after her death her son dies leaving Mitch terrified by the unknown disease. The US Center for Disease control is headed by Dr. Cheever (Lawrence Fishbine) who engages Dr Mears (Kate Winslet) and Dr. Hextall (Jennifer Ehle) and Dr. Sussman (Elliott Gould) to investigate the disease. The World Heath Organization represented by Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) becomes involved as the point of origin of the disease seems to be Hong Kong: her attempt to help the Chinese is at first assisted by young Sun Feng (Chin Han) until the Chinese forces decide to hold her hostage until the vaccine can be sent to save a province in China. As the contagious disease is studied, identified, and a vaccine becomes available some smarmy people such as 'journalist' Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) goes on the internet blogging the use of forsythia as the cure, bilking millions of dollars around the world for his fake cure. The story is both catastrophic and immediate as Soderbergh intentionally develops personal stories to demonstrate how a severe contagious disease can impact both throngs of peoples and individuals as well.The supporting cast is filled with fine actors and the momentum of the story is almost intolerable fast. Steven Soderbergh provides his own cinematography and the electrifying musical score is by Cliff Martinez. This is a fine cinematic accomplishment and one that should be seen by every citizen in the world - for many reasons. Grady Harp",Contagion
24,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Contagion,9,8 September 2011,"Probably Steven Soderbergh's final film for now as he embarks onto a new artistic career, but as with all things, never say never to a medium he's so masterful in, balancing art and commercial sensibilities in most of his films. It's been a long time since I've seen a bona fide disaster like movie that dealt with a pandemic (although there's a recent Japanese film that didn't make it here), and most virus-like attacks on cinematic Earth coming more from out and out science fiction films. The last film I remember was Wolfgang Petersen's Outbreak way back in 1995, but that was more action-adventure with its principal cast involved in almost every step of the way from outbreak to containment to cure. Here, Soderbergh orchestrates his ensemble of stars in a very well-oiled fashion, compartmentalizing as would be in real life, each of the characters to their respective areas of responsibility, so that the film felt its scale and magnitude, and hammers home how so well connected we are these days that transmission methods whether airborne or through close proximity, will still spread like wildfire before we know it, geographical boundaries and constraints notwithstanding.It's a more documentary like approach starting from Day 2 of a fresh outbreak of a disease that we know inflicts death at the extreme and most unfortunate, that gathers momentum with the passing of each day, stressing upon the urgency to identify, classify then nullify the cause and effects. In the last decade we've lived through the SARS period as well as the H1N1 pandemic outbreak, so the issues that underline the film will not get lost with any modern audience, since the film chronicles in almost similar terms how one would follow a newsreel in getting to know about the disease, the steps taken to combat it from extending distances right down to full quarantines, and especially the fears faced when mortality enters the picture.From the get go the film promises proceedings to move at a punchy pace, with the opening montage being a very sly approach in highlighting the various ways to transmit any contagious illness, such as the common touchpoints that exist which we take for granted and nary bat an eyelid. This will open one's eyes and serve as a reminder again just how easy it is for anything to be passed on from one body to another. In some ways it's educational, yet chilling when you witness and agree with what's being played out on screen,Written by Scott Z. Burns, Contagion doesn't mince its messages about social and new media's power and reach when they go up against establishment, especially when establishment here is seen to be slow, bureaucratic even, when it lumbers along trying to combat something small, nimble and generally unknown in the earlier stages. It's also very pointed politically about things like morals and the pharmaceutical companies, and how certain countries utilize different unorthodox techniques to force and outcome, all these while under the same breath demonstrating through the different story arcs the workings of respective CDCs, how health experts go about their job scopes in the WHO, providing a macro as well as a micro look at the issues at hand to save mankind from eradication.Most will be drawn by the trailer or poster which have boasted an A-list star-studded turnout, with the likes of Marion Cotillard, Laurence Fishburne, Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law and even cameos by Josei Ho and a supporting role with Ng Chin Han of Singapore who seems to be going places these days in Hollywood, though if one compares his outing here and in The Dark Knight, he may be getting stereotyped with the roles being offered. But we'll see.And with some remote experience with dealing with the unknown during H1N1, it's fairly accurate in its portrayal of how humans react in self-preservation mode, where only a select few will step forward and be counted, with many others preferring to take care of their own first, which is perfectly understandable, such as how a father forbids his daughter to interact with friends, or how healthcare workers start to dwindle and refuse to carry on with their duties. The authenticity of human behaviour and reaction to the big unknown, some opportunistic with its unrelated looting, is something that will strike you and make you think about, since they're not as far fetched as you might think, or maybe even succumb to!Those in power too will also have within them influence to ensure survivability through some leeways in the system of a ballot and luck, and leaves some room to ponder over how those high up in the echelons of society and the system would act as well when faced with moral decisions. It is not really stranger than fiction, and totally believable in our real world, which is what makes Contagion stand out if not for Soderbergh's hand to avoid the pitfalls into making this something like an all out action flick like what Outbreak had become.Some may find issues with how neatly this all wraps up, but seriously if you use recent incidents as benchmarks, it's not quite far off in how things tend to taper down whether with or without the absence of a cure if we reference both SARS and H1N1. Its shades of real world sensibilities is what makes this something highly recommended, and especially relevant in our world today.",Contagion
25,siderite,Clinical view of the human society when faced with a biological crisis,9,17 October 2011,"Usually, a film with the same subject as Contagion features a valiant hero, his girlfriend, some helpful characters that either die, betray and die or don't really matter and a egotistical bad guy. In the end, they save the day. Sodebergh doesn't do that. Instead, his perspective on the matter is so clinical that the film ends up exaggerating in the other direction.The directing is close to perfect, great actors act great while leaving the stereotypes we are accustomed of associating with them, the story is so realistic the scientific community applauded it. There is, however, no real lead character. There is no major character development, either. In lack of a few people to identify with, one empathizes with no one or with all people at once. And it is hard to feel that way with a human society described realistically.Bottom line: This was like a Hurt Locker for contagious diseases. The movie missed an important human component, though, and failed to connect with the audience at the level it deserved. Other than that, it is just perfect.",Contagion
26,siderite,"Realistic. As always, the virus is the least of the problems.",9,10 March 2020,"This is not a zombie movie. It is not an overdramatized race to catch the carrier before it infects everyone. It is a rather realistic depiction of a fast spreading contagion with a high mortality rate. As I am watching the spread of Covid-19, I see numerous parallels with the film. OK, the virus in the movie was way too deadly and with a short incubation period, but that made it more easy to contain. The vaccine was developed incredibly fast, too. I mean, it had to all fit inside less than two hours. In other words, it is describing exactly what is happening now, but at a much faster rate. It is therefore important to note the predictions of this film: idiots spreading rumors online, violence from desperate people, supply shortages on every level.I loved how Contagion did not exaggerate almost anything. There is no huge number of deaths, relative to the world's population. There is no dramatic save from the heroes, no karmic retribution against the obvious villains. Even the bad things, they happen, they show the animal nature of humankind at its basest, but the world doesn't end, civilisation doesn't collapse. It's easy to imagine 5 years after the vaccine everybody has conveniently forgot how they stepped on their neighbors to steal their stuff and instead they commemorate the innocent victims.I am still waiting for the epic movie or TV series about the 1918 epidemic.

It's 2011, how would things be handled? If you're smart, you know how most of the world would handle it, most people would turn into animals while the rich would benefit off the death of others. Movies have been created the past few decades on plagues hitting again, The Stand (even if it's a miniseries), 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead, etc. It's terrifying to think of, hard to grasp even. Contagion was made on a more realistic documentary type of movie on ""what if"" factors. With an all star cast, we find out how fear can spread faster than a virus and what would life be like if everything and everyone we touched could kill us.Beth goes to Hong Kong on a business trip to participate in a groundbreaking ceremony for a new factory. While in Hong Kong, Beth visits a casino and plays a dice game with colleagues from the plant. Once the ceremony is complete, Beth flies back to her husband, Mitch. Later that night Beth collapses on the floor in what appears to be a seizure. Beth is rushed to a hospital for treatment and passes to an unknown cause. Dr. Cheever of the Centers for Disease Control leads an investigation into disease related deaths, all exhibiting similar symptoms. As the contagion spreads, hearings are set up to discuss possible solutions, airports within the state are shut down, and the national guard is deployed to Minneapolis to cordon off the city, set up treatment centers and provide general order. But as the disease proceeds to continue taking millions of lives, the question is not only how to be cured but to stop the contagion from spreading.Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist or anything, but this movie makes me wonder if it's either trying to prepare us for something or spread propaganda. This weekend, I'm writing this review on September 9, 2011, is the 10 year anniversary of 9/11. My boyfriend and I were watching a documentary the other day and I told him how since that day, we have lived in a paranoid society of fear, somewhat good on the fact that we know we can't be ignorant forever otherwise we'll get bit hard or is it bad; where everything has been so horrible to the point where we can't enjoy anything. Germ-X sales are way high because people are so terrified of catching something. In a society where we are cleaner than ever but we are so panicked to catch a disease of some sort and I wonder because of our media if this causes the problem.I digress onto the movie. The cast is very exceptional, the main reason I went to see this was to see Kate Winslet, my favorite actress. The cast is an all star, though in some ways it could be a bit distracting as Matt Damon looked a little like Mark Wahlberg to me for some reason. But each actor did a great job holding their own and each one having a little sympathy as you hoped for the best in the film. Although I wanted to throw a fit for Gwenth Paltrow's character spreading the disease to Chicago first, thank you very much! The style of the movie is done very well. I have only 2 complaints, one being that the film could have been a little more shocking, since we are thrown right into the disease spreading, it's hard to latch onto any character because we know there's a chance of them dying. The tension could have been a little more there. The ending was also a little off, thought this is a mild complaint as I would see this like how it fizzled out just like if this was for real, if the human race had fizzled out. But it left me a little unsatisfied; I wanted more at the end. I think I would recommend this as a rental or a matinée for those who want an intelligent film. It does keep you frightened on some level making you wonder if you could be next in a plague that will kill millions of people.8/10",Contagion

This movie has constant dialogue constantly just talking about the virus and also a bit of bickering. This movie goes in a compelling direction because of it's intelligent and realistic approach to the premise. After finishing the movie you will want a bottle of Germ X to carry with you where ever you go. The movie gives an idea that has been around of not very serious virus that can get but this one is a hardcore virus that basically kills very quickly by first starting with continuous coughs and the symptoms gets worse as it progresses. This movie however gives homage to people in the medical field or researchers that analyze to help people. What drives this movie is how something like this can really happen and the human nature and doing what is right even when facing chaos, especially when it comes to the media and quarantine. Unfortunately the number of people that care about sanitation is very low, but this movie has a chance of turning those into a bit of a germaphobe.

30,sddavis63,I Was Expecting This To Be A Lot More Exciting,3,17 September 2011,"""Contagion"" gets off to a pretty strong start, and after the first 15 minutes or so you're settling in for what looks to be a pretty exciting medical mystery-thriller type of story. Those first 15 minutes establish that a virulent virus is on the loose all over the world. It's obviously a mysterious virus and obviously a powerful one, and it's also obvious that once it's discovered no one has a clue what to do with it or how to bring it under control. That opening has the shocker of a mother-young son death, as Beth (Gwyneth Paltrow) brings the virus home after a business trip to Asia, and passes it on to her son Clark (Griffin Morrow). Both die quickly and suddenly and unpleasantly, and this movie seems to be on the way to a great ride. And then ... it fizzles.After that very exciting start, it just fizzled. It tries to establish its credibility by often using too much medical jargon, which meant that there were a few things I never really understood, and there were extended scenes that had no dialogue at all. Usually this was for the purpose of giving us a sort of slide show of images of what was happening - crowd shots, illness shots, looting shots, etc. But you can only go so far with that and make it interesting. This isn't without value. It is interesting to see some of the strategies that probably would be used by officials faced with this kind of threat, and with repeated warnings in recent years of the likelihood of a global pandemic striking eventually, the movie has a sense of relevance to it. There's an interesting twist on the type of ""conspiracy"" angle you expect to see in this kind of film. Free-lance reporter Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) claims to have stumbled upon a cure that the government is deliberately holding back, but the twist comes when he himself is revealed to be out to profit on this epidemic. ""Contagion"" also features pretty decent performances from a solid cast (so you have people like Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne and Kate Winslet as well as Paltrow and Law playing prominent roles) but to me it lacked power. It wasn't a gripping medical thriller. It was a basically ho-hum medical mystery lacking in any real or sustained excitement. (3/10)",Contagion
31,Hellmant,Soderbergh's virus thriller is good but not contagious.,7,16 September 2011,"'CONTAGION': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Director Steven Soderbergh tries his skills dabbling in the horror/sci-fi field with this virus outbreak disaster film. Working from a screenplay by Scott Z. Burns (who also wrote 'THE INFORMANT!' which Soderbergh also directed) Soderbergh tells the story of a highly contagious virus that quickly spreads throughout the world by mere contact, turning deadly in days. It's an ensemble piece featuring Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Marion Cotillard and Gwyneth Paltrow all as leads in intersecting stories. Like all of Soderbergh's films it's strongly character and dialogue driven and the horror/thriller elements kind of take a back seat to them. I found the film interesting at first, as well as engaging, but the characters not fleshed out enough and the material a little too dry for my taste.The movie opens centering on the first person, Beth Emhoff (Paltrow), to contract the virus while on a business trip in Hong Kong. She returns home to her husband Mitch (Damon) and son Clark (Griffin Kane) appearing to be sick but dies days later after being rushed to the hospital, by Mitch, for going into seizures. Clark soon follows but Mitch appears to be immune to the disease. While Mitch and his daughter Jory (Anna Jacoby-Heron) struggle to deal with their loss the virus spreads like falling dominoes and members of the Department of Homeland Security and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, like Dr. Ellis Cheever (Fishburne) and Dr. Erin Mears (Kate Winslet), rush to try and figure out what the virus is and stop it as well as the fear it quickly causes (which of course becomes more dangerous than the virus itself). The film centers on other characters in other areas and positions around the world as well.While the film does have a lot of character development I think it probably centers on too many characters leaving most of them underdeveloped as a result. We never truly see the basic relatable side of most of the characters, in their natural element, as the film centers far too much on their anguish and desperation. This is why I think the film was a little lacking in my opinion. In the hands of a more fitting director it could have been a much more polished out character driven drama or a perfectly decent genre film with social commentary (or both). This film tries to straddle the line of both and fails, falling a little short in both areas because of it. A filmmaker like George A. Romero could have truly done justice to a film like this in his day. Still the film is technically competent and it delivers most of what it promises. A little slow and unfocused in places but for the most part it works to a certain extent. Soderbergh has been really hit and miss for me throughout his career so I can't say this film was a disappointment. I'd say it's about average for him, maybe even a little better.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mlB8eyvpck",Contagion
32,thesar-2,Killer Blog,7,14 December 2011,"Steven Soderbergh, one of my all-time favorite directors, makes a Ripley-Reunion, of sorts. All three main players (Jude Law, Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow) in The Talented Mr. Ripley return for Contagion. But, it's not like they share much screen time together.Of course, that's not the point of this virus-movie. It's more of an adult, realistic update of Outbreak. And don't get me wrong, I did like Outbreak, but this seemed more real.Okay, here's the problem: I never felt like 2+ (or much more; I might have missed the final count) million people died. This is because the entire movie about a killer flu-like virus spreading like wildfire is in the doctors/CDC's POV and an idiot internet-blogger (Jude Law) that really p*ssed me off.I'm gonna go off on a tangent here. This blogger of ""truth"" reminded me a lot of the animal activists in the opening of 28 Days Later. Oh, they think they're doing the right thing and they're both giving into and spreading fear & conspiracy theories. But, in reality, they're so wrapped up with spreading their version of the ""truth"" they never stop to think about what they're doing. Or who they're harming.Yeah, you might be asking yourself: Isn't Steve Reeves blogging at this very minute. Ah, you would be correct. But I am not trying to spread ""facts"" around, teach people government is not only evil but trying to kill us and I'm certainly not a believer in other ""popular"" conspiracy theories. I am giving my opinion. Take it or leave it.I digressthis was a good movie, well acted, well shot. It's scary to think that this obviously could happen and in the few and small shots of looting and uncivilized behavior, it might be even worse.I don't normally say this, but this movie was far too short. It was 106 minutes and I would've invested another 40 or so minutes if they gave more grand scale examples of cities ravaged. Director Soderbergh seemed to have wanted to make a smaller movie, more toned down. Sadly, in doing so, he took a lot of the terror away. Think about a Godzilla movie where he's always in the background – and only for 10% of the movie – and the camera focuses on the military and ah-hem, animal activists discussing on how to solve the problem. Sure, you'd hear a lot of talk about the city being destroyed, but it wouldn't mean as much unless we saw it.That all saidit's still recommended. The opening letters on the screen (no spoiler) impressed me and put a smile on my face. Those two words made me remember how much I enjoy the craft that is Soderbergh. Further, the finale is nice to see, and though it was kind of irrelevant by that point, it was still a pleasant final shot.",Contagion
33,cherold,absorbing and refreshingly realistic,8,7 June 2013,"I like Contagion for some of the reasons that others on this site dislike it. This is not a movie with scenes of wrenching emotion, frenetic rioting, shocking plot twists, and break-neck, last minute rescues. Instead, this is a movie that portrays, in a way far more realistic than what you would find in 99% of science-themed movies, how something is likely to play out. This movie breaks with the clichés of Hollywood disaster films. Instead of one superior character who diligently finds the answer, we have a team of hardworking, dedicated people who approach the problem thoughtfully and methodically, each making small but significant contributions. Instead of trying to hide the science, this movie explains things, letting you see and understand the process. At the same time, Contagion keeps you connected, not by making unreal archetypes but by showing you very real people, sometimes brave and noble, sometimes understandably selfish (and in the case of one character, despicably selfish). While the movie avoids those big emotional scenes where the music swells up, there are amazing little touches, like a character's incomprehension of a loved one's death or a dying woman trying to help a fellow patient. The movie does, in fact, have emotion, riots, suspenseful moments, noble actions, but they are never allowed to overwhelm the film or turn it into something formulaic. And this seems to be what a number of people don't like about it. They want this to be a movie about the breakdown of society, or a movie that personalizes a global disaster by focusing more on victims than scientists. And I like this movie precisely because it refuses to do things like that.I found this movie fascinating in the way I found The Andromeda Strain fascinating; I like science and I like to see it portrayed believably. And while I sometimes do find Soderberg's movies a little too cold and the color palette a little too drab (my feeling about Traffic), for me these things worked beautifully in the context of this narrative.Highly recommended.",Contagion
34,Robert_duder,A warning film disguised as a thriller,7,25 January 2012,"I liked Contagion. It was reasonably entertaining if this subject matter can be so. It had an outstanding ensemble cast although no character spent a lot of time on screen which is how they got so many of them I am sure. Ultimately this was an hour and a half give or take of a ""More You Know"" commercial where celebrities tell you what could happen if a virus like this ravaged the country. Its poignant in many ways and it is really a realistic look which can leave you feeling a little afraid more than anything but the characters and the actors are good enough that its worth seeing and perhaps will at least be thought provoking enough. Another IMDb reviewer really nailed this on the head when they said that it focuses on the pandemic and the characters are not fleshed out. That is exactly what the film is. There really is no hero to the story, or even a main character, just some whose story is focused on more than others.You can just look at the cast list to see how many great actors are in this. Its a virtual whose who of Hollywood. The people that spend more time on screen are Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, and Jude Law. Damon is terrific as the doting father, and husband who discovers more about his wife than he wants to know in the wake of her horrifying death. He really does a great job in this film considering how little depth the characters are given. Laurence Fishburne is good in his role though I don't think its much of a stretch for him to play a scientist looking for answers. He's very straightforward. Jude Law is also great as a very popular internet blogger looking for the truth. If there was any character that could have drawn out the story it would have been Law's character. I also have to give kudos to Hollywood heavyweights Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Winslet who have small but vital roles and give away their beauty to make themselves look absolutely ravaged by disease.The film director is no newcomer either. Steven Soderbergh is well known his stylish story telling. Truth be told I'm not a huge fan of his work. I find his style sporadic and jumpy but for this type of film it almost works. If you're a person who is afraid of germs this film could outright terrify you. Its probably worth seeing for its ensemble cast but it really isn't the type of movie that is watched again and again for entertainment value. Its light on story and character depth but heavy on reality and the pandemic that is truly on the world's mind every day. 7/10",Contagion
35,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Tense, atmospheric thriller that brings the killer virus movie back into the sphere",9,5 September 2012,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningA woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) dies mysteriously and her son shortly after, in what is soon revealed as a killer virus. Her husband (Matt Damon) is left with the remaining child and finds himself quarantined along with her. As the virus spreads and many die, pandemonium erupts as people become desperate for the cure. Renowned doctor Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) gets people to place their faith in the pharmaceutical companies, while internet ranger Alan Krumweide (Jude Law) uses his blog to urge people to seek out alternative therapies.While many (most, even) are content to regurgitate age old franchises to make a cheap buck, there are still some more savvy movie producers out there who rely on more inventive methods of drawing in an audience, such as tearing stories straight from today's headlines. With the H1N1 nightmare from 2009 still fresh in everyone's minds, the plot line to Contagion is, if nothing else, a relevant one, and playing on everyone's inevitable fears as it does, is a hook, line and sinker success in terms of creating a believable, frighteningly real set up and scenario.But all that would be in vein if the film just wasn't any good, so it's a relief that the reliable Steven Soderbergh has crafted a genuinely tense and atmospheric thriller, that makes good use of location, drowned out colour and soundtrack. The 'killer virus' genre was one that had stagnated, maybe even as far away as 1995's Outbreak with Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman, and was in danger of becoming stale, and at least in need of a good, modern re-booting, and Contagion manages that quite admirably.Cast wise, Law probably makes the biggest impression and throws the most energy and gusto into his performance as the conspiracy theorist internet blogger, always out to expose apparent corruption, whenever one apparently doesn't exist, while Damon is equally decent as the bereaved father/husband who holds all his grief in till the end. It's quite surprising for a star as big as Paltrow to give herself such a minor cameo role in a film like this, but kudos to her that she did. And kudos to Soderbergh for giving us such a decent 'killer virus' film in quite a while. ****",Contagion

Unfortunately in reality the experts never develop a vaccine as swiftly as they do in the movies, snake-oil salesmen like the Jude Law character are everywhere (including the popular press and The White House), listened to and believed; while in the movie the authorities move promptly and responsibly, are better funded and better organised than in reality.And they don't have Krusty the Clown as President...",Contagion
37,bowmanblue,Life imitates art (nine years later),7,29 June 2020,"A virus that starts off with bats in China, quickly spreads across the world causing mass death and destruction, not to mention 'social distancing.' No, that's not a brief history of 2020, but the plot of the film 'Contagion' made some nine years earlier. Despite life imitating art quite scarily, luckily 2020 didn't have as many deaths as we can see on screen here - I guess we'll have to forgive Hollywood for upping the stakes a bit.'Contagion' is quite a good little film, or at least it was at the time. Now, it almost seems a little outdated as it shows us what COULD happen during a global pandemic, whereas today, we only really need to look out the window to see what the effects really are. I guess it's main use now is to compare how the 'fictional' take on such a situation can be held up against real life.On the plus side, it certainly has an A-list cast. Ignore any promotional marketing regarding Gwyneth Paltrow - I don't really feel like it's a 'spoiler' to say that she's barely in it. The main stars are Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet and some actress I'd never seen before! Anyway, it's a decent cast, but because the story skips from place to place across the planet, most of these cast are only given a certain amount of screen time for us to get to know them. Some of their plights are more interesting than others, so you sort of may find you want to skip some of their tales in favour of getting to the better ones.However, due to such an excellent cast, you can't really fault anyone's performance, but if a film is going to tackle a story of such grand scale, I couldn't help but think 'Contagion' would work more if it was a ten-part TV series instead, as it suffers from being a bit of a 'whistle-stop' tale of what would happen in these trying times.It's not a bad film. It's was definitely entertaining for its time and, in some ways, it's turned from being a simple and entertaining 'what if?' scenario to a scary prediction of things to come where we - with the benefit of hindsight - can see what the script-writers got right and what they got wrong.",Contagion
38,dromasca,chaotic,5,26 July 2013,"Having seen a few weeks ago Side Effects I was reflecting that maybe Steven Soderbergh would not necessarily do a bad thing taking a break from directing. Well, I had not seen 'Contagion' yet, one of his previous movies. To use the terms of the story in this movie, the origin of the disease can be traced way back.The world is in danger in Contagion as a deadly flue virus originating (where else?) in South-East Asia is spreading around the world, killing first individuals, than thousands, than millions. Governments, corporations, the World Health Organization, become all engaged in a race to find the roots of the disease, to stop its spreading and contagion, to find a cure. The problem with the film is that there are too many threads, none of them extremely interesting or surprising, some going nowhere. For example a researcher seems to have found a cure but is ordered to stop research and destroy the samples - we never learn why, last time we see him he seems to disobey the orders and then he just disappears for the rest of the film. An Internet blogger and journalist claim that cure exists and proves it on its own body, but this thread never connects with the rest of the film. If the purpose of director Soderbergh is to show chaos on screen he did succeed, but it's more film-making chaos than everything else. There were a few moments when it seemed that the film heads towards showing the impact of a catastrophic disease on the fabric of the American society, but these were also wasted in too expected scenes of army in the streets and supermarket plundering, lost and forgotten soon enough, as brave scientists discover the cure and test it on themselves to speed the solution. The script is disappointing, a collection of TV soap episodes concentrated to a few minutes each and badly interconnected.The cast is certainly impressive. Heaving on screen in the same film Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Matt Damon, Marion Cotillard, Gwyneth Paltrow, and a few other who would alone hold a movie on their shoulders is certainly a performance for the producer and a pleasure for spectators. Fans should however be warned that some of them die young in this film, and none has the opportunity to play a role that will be remembered for a long time. Despite the gathering of talents Contagion is a confusing and chaotic film.",Contagion
39,MLDinTN,what you expect to see on the Discovery channel,4,23 July 2012,"This movie was dull, mainly because it was so scientific, like something you would see on the Discovery channel. There isn't a lot of action and people just die with not much drama behind it. It seems like what might go on behind the scenes if something like this was to happen, but that doesn't mean it will make for a good movie. Also, just because you have all these big stars, it doesn't mean it's going to be that great. Plus, a movie about a deadly disease outbreak has been done quite a few times.FINAL VERDICT: Not really anything original, it is sort of slow. I don't recommend it.",Contagion
40,Cineanalyst,The Rate of Stars and Truth to a Soderbergh Ensemble,8,11 February 2020,"""Contagion"" is receiving reappraisal of late due to the coronavirus outbreak. Unfortunately, it wouldn't be surprising if this continues to happen periodically in the future, elevating this Steven Soderbergh ensemble-cast movie to the status of a classic. Of course, back in 2011, ""Contagion"" was already relevant and seemed prescient, what with the the history from smallpox, H1N1, polio, SARS and other epidemics and pandemics. ""Contagion"" is usually praised for its scientific realism, which plays into why I think it succeeds and will continue to whereas other efforts from the filmmaker and his revolving host of movie stars in so-called ""hyperlink"" cinema may not. Regardless of one's position on the Drug War, for instance, ""Traffic"" (2000) is weighed down by proselytizing for its political message. More endemic of the potential pitfalls of these type of pictures, however, is the director's more recent ""The Laundromat"" (2019), which follows the money instead of the spreading of a virus. ""The Laundromat"" is all about exposing artifice, including that of the movie itself; ""Contagion,"" on the other hand, is about researching facts. The result is that ""Contagion"" represents what few motion pictures actually achieve in seeming true.The actors playing it straight is important to this, too, as the well-known stars also serve an important function in the nationally-crisscrossing narrative as familiar signposts. The one appropriate exception, perhaps, is for the role portrayed by Jude Law--as a conspiracy-theory blogger who profits off of bunk herbal remedies. But this part, too, fits into the picture's search for truth. Meanwhile, Marion Cotillard, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet and Jennifer Ehle personify a medical and scientific sense of authority. Matt Damon, Private Ryan himself, is a natural fit for an everyman immune to death. Gwyneth Paltrow serves well as his counterpart, even though her character's fate is conflated with sexual promiscuity and corporate contamination. A good score helps keep the drama tense, as well.""Contagion"" does especially well at connecting the narrative of infectious spread. In a sense, the picture's search for facts is a deconstruction of its own plot, but unlike in ""The Laundromat,"" not one that calls attention to its own fiction. We see this in the connective tissue of Hollywood stars, of the search within the virus for its spreading and cure, including via video surveillance and still photography, and of the symbolic company that Paltrow's character works for and for which her metropolitan and globetrotting travel and her firm's encroachment on nature initiates the plot. An honest deconstruction.",Contagion
41,g-bodyl,Effectively Scary!,9,17 April 2013,"Contagion, directed by Steven Soderbergh, is an effectively scary and brilliant drama about the spreading of deadly pathogens. It's a scary film despite not being listed as a horror film because this is something that can happen for real one day. It's not out of the question to see a brand new disease crop up out of nowhere and kill millions of people. This film is smartly made and has lots of tense, dramatic moments. It also has a fine cast to support the story.This film is essentially about what happens to the world when a virus epidemic breaks out and kills many people worldwide. This story is told from different views of people including a doctor, a journalist, and a man whose wife was one of the very first victims.The acting is very good in the movie thanks to the top-notch cast. Matt Damon headlines the film and is very good and dramatic. I did find it kind of funny when his wife played by Gwyneth Paltrow died within the first few minutes. The rest of the cast of Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Marion Cotillard is very good.Overall, this is a good example of excellent filmmaking. I found it surprising that many of the general audience found this film to be flat and boring but I found it to be almost the complete opposite. It's scary, emotional, and portrays a tight screenplay. I hope this film wakes up people who don't believe in these kind of epidemics. I rate this film 9/10.",Contagion

46,tabuno,The Normalization of the Infectious Epidemic Movie,7,18 January 2019,"17 September 2011. Forty years ago, ANDROMEDA (1971) brought to the big screen, a powerfully intense, seriously authentic depiction of the infectious epidemic movie genre, in this case brought back from outerspace by a satellite. OUTBREAK (1995) presented the basic outline and plot points of the infectious disease movie thriller, along with the requisite political intrigue and emotional melodramatics of familiar script themes used in almost all traditional horror movies. 28 DAYS LATER (2002) refined the infection movie genre, keeping the horror mystic intact. Now CONTAGION brings back the infection epidemic scenario with a more authentic disaster depiction along its much more unshocking normal view of what America's response to a now feasible outbreak might be now. Since the reality of such a disaster has shifted the movie from sci fi, horror, to more of a medical mystery drama, some of the action and compelling thrills have waned into a much more cerebral and tame drama. I AM LEGEND (2007), WAR OF THE WORLDS (2005) placed the bar of melodramatic chaos high with the emotional expectations not experienced in CONTAGION. Instead, CONTAGION plays out more like SYRIANA (2005) as a more methodical medical drama and as with SYRIANA, a confusing chaos of chaos in that there were too many movie strands that did not offer sufficient depth to character development and plot development that each connecting scene deserved.CONTAGION offered a great and new look at the societal and environmental impact of a global infection and also had a great beginning arc that circled around to the end with a conclusion that provided an insightful timely awareness as well as continuity of the human family. Nevertheless, the movie did not reach the heights of its potential, with is slow pacing, and disparate weakened, thin story lines that bordered on the stereotypical disaster movies of the past.",Contagion
47,The-Sarkologist,Best left on the shelf of the video store,3,28 October 2011,"I actually found this movie to be quite boring with no real plot to it and the only reason that I went and saw it was because my brother wanted to see it. In fact, I really wanted to fall asleep during this film it was that boring, but that is beside the point. What surprised me was that this film has so many big name actors in it I am wondering how it is actually going to make any money back and what the actually purpose of the film was, simply because I did not find it entertaining, and I guess that is what we all want out of a film.This is a disaster movie, but it is not one involving huge aliens or fancy special effects, but rather a silent and invisible killer that all of the sudden begins to rip through the population and the authorities must race against time to find a cure. It uses special effects where necessary, but in the end it is a film about a deadly disease and has the potential to destroy us as a race. Well, that it is bit over the top because the writers do try to be scientifically accurate when discussing the disease, but while interesting, it turns out to be a lesson in micro-biology (something which I generally don't like paying money to have).Look, not everybody is going to be killed by a new disease, and this is made clear in this film, but it is also interesting how this silent killer is able to bring society to the brink of collapse. It is also interesting to see just how delicately balance the order in our society is. I note that there are a lot of anti-government videos out of the internet that argue that the police force is the arm of the state that keeps us enslaved to the state, but these people do not seem to realise that if we were to take the police out of the picture then there would be chaos. In this film this happens, because people fear death and the contagion is a silent killer, which means that if the police aren't dead, they simply do not have the numbers to maintain order in the world, and this society collapses.I guess in the end this is a 'what if' movie. The writers are obviously trying to speculate what would happen is a deadly contagious diseases were to really break out over the world, and would we be able to fight it before it destroyed us and our society. I think this film does speculate about it quite well, but despite that, it is still a boring movie and I am unlikely to watch it again.",Contagion
48,Rodrigo_Amaro,Brilliantly informative and entertaining,10,17 January 2013,"Steven Soderbergh took us through the narcotraffic business and its main characters with the ambitious ""Traffic"" and the connections existing between oilmen, the CIA, political officials and their interests in the outstanding ""Syriana"" (as a producer, directed by Stephen Gaghan). Now he takes us on a race against time to find the causes of a deadly virus spread around the world and to find a possible cure for it. ""Contagion"" combines efficient dramatic elements with a nervous thriller going beyond just being something entertaining but also informative, authentic, and to leave you wondering about events of this nature that happened in the past, or are happening in the present, and even imagine future situations and think on how they're gonna be dealt with. Never thought something would break the somewhat invincibility of ""Outbreak"" (1995) but this one definitely made it through. That is a great film but quite formulaic, very systematic and self centered on a few places. ""Contagion"" is a little more realistic, going through the several countries showing how one virus is spread in such a enormous velocity. Nipah was the one used as an example in here, an epidemic plague responsible for several deaths in Asia and Africa, coming from an animal source (the movie used as a basis to ""create"" its own mortal and fictional virus). ""Outbreak"" seemed too focused only in the characters who were fighting the disease and some of the victims; ""Contagion"" has time and space to follow the victims (one of them briefly yet greatly played by Gwyneth Paltrow); the people from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) who search for the causes, cure and prevention (played by Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet and others); world health organizations doing the same job in other parts of the world (represented here by Marion Cotillard); one free-lance journalist (Jude Law) trying to cover the truth behind the disease and everyone involved; one family man (Matt Damon) trying to survive the threat of dealing with contaminated people and saving his daughter; and many other characters. It really shows the global scale one disease can run through and the way it does it, spreading to several social classes, getting people from many different backgrounds.Gladly, Mr. Soderbergh and writer Scott Z. Burns choices in making this were wise and well handled. When it's time to thrills us with the panic and the commotion that took over the nation, going hysterical when the disease got out of control, food and medical supplies ran out, this had everything to go melodramatic, exaggerated or over-the-top. No, it never went that way. It kept solid, interesting, presenting a moderate sadness which is compelling without overplaying or depressing us. Another great choice was the style developed for the film, Soderbergh made it right with the editing and the cinematographic aspects, shifting away from the unusual camera angles or choosing different colors to represent different places, states or countries, a worrying characteristic of some of his previous works. Everything is satisfying in here. Main attractive of this project is the cast and they're all great. Besides the already mentioned names there's Bryan Cranston, Elliott Gould, Jennifer Ehle, John Hawkes, Sanaa Latham and Demetri Martin.If interested in the theme, I also suggest giving a worthy check on ""And the Band Played On"", HBO's film with a super-stellar cast and based on the acclaimed book of same name which presents a historical register of the early years of AIDS discovery. I recommend it due to its similarity in story treatment and because it also presents the hard work of the same true heroes of ""Contagion"", the people from CDC, who deal with epidemic diseases and their control. 10/10",Contagion
49,tomgillespie2002,Occasionally thrilling film that fizzles out towards the end,6,3 February 2012,"Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) arrives back in America after a trip to Hong Kong displaying symptoms of a serious illness. Her husband Mitch (Matt Damon) rushes her to hospital after she suffers a violent fit, only for her to die there. Puzzled about the virus, doctors quarantine Mitch and alert Dr. Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) of the CDC. Cheever sets about growing the virus to find a potential cure, and sends Dr. Mears (Kate Winslet), an Epidemic Intelligence Officer, to begin the investigation. Internet blogger Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) runs with the virus and apparently cures himself from the disease by taking forsythia, an alternative medicine, and therefore causes a mad panic for the drug. While Dr. Orantes (Marion Cotillard), an epidemiologist, travels to Hong Kong to discover the root of the virus.Similar to director Steven Soderbergh's film career, Contagion is a mixed bag. The first two thirds of this film are quite exceptional - exciting, intelligent, and often fascinating. Yet it burns itself out towards the end, as the distribution of the vaccine becomes the central focus, and the film loses its edge. But at the same time, the film's dedication to realism is admirable, even though it does affect the films quality. The ultra-talented and multi-Academy Award nominated/winning cast are exceptional, with Jude Law's slimy, dentally-challenged journalist, and Winslet exhausted yet dedicated investigator proving the stand-outs. I usually hate Jude Law, but he is at his best when he plays arseholes - Closer (2004), The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), I Heart Huckabees (2004) - and he is at his most despicable here.Law's character is at the centre of one of the film's themes about mass hysteria and panic, as he uses the power of the Internet to send the country into a spiral of looting and violence. It's an interesting commentary on how small the world has become with the introduction of blogging and social networking, and how this can be abused for personal gain. Krumwiede has no scientific fact or support behind him, just a webcam and a computer, and the results are quite terrifying.Soderbergh wanted to make this as realistic as possible, and Contagion received praise from scientific institutions for its accuracy. Similar to his excellent 2000 film Traffic, Soderbergh explores the subject from the ground floor upwards. From Damon's struggling father trying desperately to shield his daughter from the virus, way up to Fishburne's CDC agent fighting against it on a global level. Watching it unfold, and seeing the political and social implications that stems from it is quite fascinating. But when that final third arrives, story threads become stale, and Soderbergh seems to lose interest in certain characters (Cotillard suffers the most), and the film fizzles out. Disappointing, but the film's thrilling beginning and middle certainly make the film worth a watch.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Contagion
50,Floated2,"Too many characters, not much detail",6,31 July 2014,"Contagion is a 2011 film directed by Steven Soderbergh. It is based on a globe-spanning epidemic thriller. Contagion is full of many off putting moments, and Soderbergh has great fun expertly grossing us out, while telling a story, vetted by experts, we're told, that seems all-too plausible.The film is shot as a docudrama, and it certainly propels you through its sub-two-hour running time: You'll never be bored, except perhaps during a dead-end subplot about a kidnapping in China. I found that there were too many characters that didn't go into much detail, and that the film could have been better had they reduced these subplots. Matt Damon's character plot is the main plot, which is the most engaging. Followed up by Kate Winslet's subplot which also includes Laurence Fishburne.Contagion is smart and well-made as it is, makes few emotional connections, perhaps because it's too ready to skip on to the next anecdote. Everyone on the planet is at risk, but we don't get to really know any of them.Filled with an ensemble cast: Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Marion Cotillard, Jude Law, Gweneth Paltrow, Laurence Fishburne, among others. Only Winslet, as a no-nonsense epidemic investigator willing to get close to the plague, rises above her few pages in the script.Any thriller needs a villain, and Contagion finds its in Law, who's wearing an ugly snaggletooth that's a little too obvious a sign of his rottenness. The real villain needed to be the plague. But lacking much of a human touch in the storytelling, it stays just a remove or two away, even as it spreads across the planet and civilization breaks down. There's anarchy in the streets and they're running out of body bags, but Contagion keeps us at a distance: Rarely has the death of millions seemed so inconsequential. However, the film should have been more engaging and interesting.",Contagion
51,TheMovieDiorama,Contagion is as brisk as a sneeze but less hostile than a cough.,6,4 December 2018,"A disaster film like no ever. Replacing CGI extreme weathering and aimless zombies for a far more intellectual affair. The common cold. Yes, the mysophobic may wish to look away in fear, however that's the sole purpose of this lesser thriller. To genuinely convey the ease of spreading germs and how quickly a pandemic can arise. It's just too clinical in its execution to be a thrilling story. A mother and son die from an unknown mutating virus, to which a variety of organisations must try to develop a vaccination before it spreads and wipes out the world's population. A multi-narrative story that occasionally has interweaving plot lines, from the conception of the virus to the investigation that follows from the World Health Organisation. A meticulous scientific plot that upholds a vast amount of accuracy, showcasing how rapid a virus can spread and cause hysteria amongst the public. It's a horror film, but one that relies on realism as opposed to disposable jump scares. The ensemble cast, featuring excellent performances from Law, Winslet and Damon, add power and conviction to the story. It can be slightly distracting, deterring away from pivotal plot points, however the dialogue remains sharp thanks to the consistently good performances. Although, much like its professional environment, it's all too clinical. The wide array of characters to which they embody professional roles as opposed to relatable characters, results in a narrative that almost feels documentarian rather than thrilling. Soderbergh and Burns' perception of a pandemic breathes information, to a point that it diminishes any thrills to be had. Accuracy is important, however the story still needs to be accessible for audiences to become involved in. For instance, if a character was to meet their untimely demise caused by the virus, you don't care. You feel nothing. The characters and the plot are too cold to care about.

53,imseeg,Haunting true to life portrait of a world wide spread virus spiraling out of control. Magnificent direction by Steven Soderbergh. Great acting. Riveting from beginning to end.,10,23 October 2018,"Wow. This story creeps under my skin, because it is depicted in such a true to life fashion, that it feels as if it could happen to all of us tomorrow. This is NOT an action movie. It has a slowburning documentary style approach, with lots of science talk and research scenes, yet they still do deliver some chilling suspense!The story of ""Contagion"" is about a virus that has spread world wide, which has to be combatted with all powers available to avoid an epidemic catastrophy. Science fiction? No way, it happened for real in 1918, when millions died world wide. More recently several (potential lethal) virusses kept popping up worldwide, but those were (thankfully) restrained from spreading any further.This haunting storyline of ""Contagion"" was created by the same writer of the Bourne movies. Besides a great riveting story, the acting and direction are one of a kind too. Directed by the genius Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Eleven, Traffic), this movie rises far out above all the other average disaster movies. This movie excells in its credibility. Credibility means everything to me, especially when a story like this is about the real world dangers we live in today. Great roles by Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bryan Cranston, Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburne and Marion Cottilard.""Contagion""is spooky. Spooky in the sense that sudden contagion with a virus really could suddenly happen to all of us, who ( falsely) think that we are safe and protected from any far away diseases.
""Contagion"" stays thought provoking and chilling to the bone, every time I see it. Seen it over 10 times already! Really unique in its credibiltiy and riveting with suspense! Highly recommended!",Contagion
54,jzappa,"Traffic 2.0, Only This Time, Drugs Are Good",9,11 November 2011,"A black screen. We hear a severe cough. We're already vigilant when, shortly after, a bartender takes a customer's coin and then dials into a cash register. Germs, we're pondering. During an autopsy, we see a dead woman's face, and hear the buzzing of a surgical saw. Her blood-spattered scalp collapses onto her face. Two doctors inspect the brain and stem. We do see nothing, but they're troubled by what they see. A piece of photographic ingenuity and intricate, quietly deliberate editing ahead of the overwhelming majority of wide-release American movies, Contagion is a docudrama about a fictitious but staggeringly real worldwide epidemic. It's a startling supposition of how a new airborne disease could penetrate humans and increase uncompromisingly in startlingly little time.This notion is already proverbial to us through the seemingly yearly rashes of influenza or swine flu. The journalistic sequence never varies: panicky plans, large-scale roundups, the fight to create a vaccine at the Center for Disease Control, the making and supply of this year's ""flu shot."" The disease in Contagion is an inexplicable one, flouting seclusion, rebuffing medicine. Soderbergh, as he's demonstrated before, is dexterous at chronicling the multi-narrative via the lives of numerous crucial characters and the chance communications of various others, and this way it illuminates how we don't give each other a virus, but that it's an organism advanced to pursue new hosts. Its bearers die, and like any life form, it must constantly keep ahead of death. Also, his inclusion of the population on the introductory captions for each city in the story is a global education in itself.The cough we hear before anything else is from Gwyneth Paltrow, a Minneapolis woman returning from Hong Kong. Her husband Matt Damon, evidently immune, is disbelieving that death could so abruptly ravage his life. An analysis exposes a secret appointment of Paltrow's during a layover in Chicago. And yet, she didn't catch the germ through sexual contact. While the director of sex, lies and videotape., Out of Sight and Ocean's Eleven is surely in love with dialogue, Soderbergh's amalgamation of score and montage never take less than top spot in the primacy in his uncompromisingly procedural storytelling. We've seen even minor Soderbergh outings where imagery and score are the overriding narrative machinery, and that occurs here too, and though the ultra-naturalistic jargon and interplay between the international web of characters is essential, Contagion is thickly tiered in pivotal sequences totally without dialogue. Cliff Martinez creates the atmospheric and aural terrain into which Soderbergh interleaves his many fast-sketch characters.At the tail end of the movie, Soderbergh adjoins a succinct montage unraveling where the virus may have originated, how a handful of degrees of separation there were connecting its source and a woman from Minneapolis on a trip to Hong Kong. It takes no more than a day for the bug to reach a new continent. The film tracks the procedures of techno-thrillers and hyperlink cinema, with subtitles keeping count: Day 1, Day 3, Minneapolis, Geneva, ad infinitum. It tethers to and fro between such linchpins as Laurence Fishburne in the CDC in Atlanta; Kate Winslet in the Epidemic Intelligence Service, who attempts to chase the contamination with ad hoc stopovers; Marion Cotillard, an investigator from the World Health Organization in Geneva. They have teamed up before, are accomplished and function immediately. And in a lab, there is Jennifer Ehle, struggling to hone a vaccine and in the face of the time being lost before she can try it on humans.Contagion is an uncommonly immersive portrait of existential threat and crowd psychology, about everyday people doing their jobs under horrendous conditions. It's ultimately a race against time between 2 toxic spreads, one of a deadly virus, one of rampant misinformation in the digital age, an eerie highlighting of how the things that make the modern world smaller make it that much more exposed. It's also one of the most tremendously well-shot films of recent release. Soderbergh continually lingers and focuses on the objects touched by the infected that link the global cast of characters and reinforce the multi-narrative style in which he has proved his proficiency before.",Contagion
55,Turfseer,"For Soderbergh, creators of vaccines are new worldwide saviors!",2,4 October 2011,"In his new pseudo-documentary, Contagion, Steven Soderbergh has endorsed the idea that modern medicine has taken the place of world religion and elevated the physicians and research scientists to the role of high priests. Soderbergh is in perfect sync with fear-mongering health organizations such as the CDC, who manufacture health epidemics in order to peddle vaccines to an unsuspecting public, who have gladly given up any sense of individual responsibility for taking care of their own health. The 'Contagion' is an event that government health bureaucrats probably unconsciously wish for; after all, such an event would confirm all their dire predictions and place them in a position of complete power and control. Victims in the 'Contagion' must undergo suffering akin to Christ on the cross. Their rite of 'baptism' is through the modern vaccine, where their 'demons' are exorcised and they end up owing a life-time debt to the medical and research establishment for supposedly saving their life.Unfortunately for modern medicine, contagions as depicted in Soderbergh's film, are strictly a work of complete fiction. Invariably, every few years, the CDC, partnering with local health organizations, warn of crippling health pandemics, which can only be prevented by mass inoculations (leading to billions of dollars of profits by pharmaceutical companies). Take, for example, West Nile Virus, one of the latest health scares which was supposed to cause havoc throughout North America. Usually its small sample of victims turn out to be elderly people who already are suffering from a myriad of health problems. But of course the pundits of orthodox medicine conclude that all these peoples' problems stem from a single source: a mosquito bite.In Soderbergh's perverse world, alternative practitioners are the 'heretics' who must be suppressed. Jude Law's blogger, Alan Krumweide, has the temerity to expose CDC head Ellis Cheever, who has given advance warning of the impending contagion crisis to family and friends so that they're able to flee Chicago before a quarantine has been imposed. Soderbergh's strategy is to temporarily have Krumweide take down the saintly Cheever a peg, in order to show that he's 'only human'. Later saintly Cheever, gives up his own precious vaccine to save the son of a janitor who works at CDC headquarters. The 'fallen' Cheever (also blamed for delays in the dissemination of an effective vaccine) is restored to the pantheon of saints after his self-sacrifice involving the janitor's son. Meanwhile, Krumweide is exposed as a fraud, after peddling a homeopathic remedy as a cure (which he's surreptitiously marketed to investors) and pretending as well that he's been infected with the virus. Homeland Security partners with modern medicine, just as the Catholic church found their own government allies in bygone days, to take down anyone who dared to question their dogmatic belief systems. Soderbergh is smugly satisfied as the 'evil' blogger is taken away in handcuffs by 'valiant' government security agents! If the imperfect Dr. Cheever is 'canonized' at film's end, there's no need for Dr. Ally Hextall to have her reputation sullied at all. After all, it's Dr. Hextall who identifies the characteristics of the MEV-1 virus , linking it to a genetic mix of bat and pig viruses. Hextall's role here is way beyond a mere priest. She can be likened to a modern day Jesus, a veritable Savior, who miraculously discovers that elusive cure, a vaccine that immediately provides the immunity to the deadly contagion. At the conclusion of 'Contagion', we learn of the pseudo-science behind the MEV-1 virus' origins. It's simply a matter of a bat dropping part of an uneaten banana into a pig's trough. The pig who eats the infected banana ends up in the kitchen of a Macao casino; and because the chef merely forgets to wash his hands, he somehow transmits the virus to Beth (Gwyneth Paltrow). On the other hand, it's unclear why others, such as everyman Mitch Emhoff and his daughter Jory, are immune to the virus, despite close contact with initial victim Beth.If alternative practitioners are directly linked to the work of the devil, bureaucrats who seek to stymie the 'godly' work of vaccine researchers, run a close second. Dr. Mears (Kate Winslet) an 'Epidemic Intelligence Officer' is rebuffed by local bureaucrats who are reluctant to commit resources to handle the impending crisis. Worse are the officials who send a ransom of placebos following World Health Organization epidemiologist Orantes's kidnapping by a Chinese epidemiologist after he attempts to save the remaining survivors in his own village who have no access to the 'precious' vaccines. Note more saintly self-sacrifice: Dr. Mears succumbs to the deadly contagion and Orantes nobly runs back to the village to warn them that the vaccines they've obtained, are bogus!In the 1950s, orthodox medicine elevated their first 'miracle worker' to the pantheon of modern day world saviors. That man's name was Dr. Jonas Salk--creator of the polio vaccine. Now Soderbergh wants to outdo even Salk; his 'Contagion' can perhaps be seen as an allegory, likening the deadly plague to cancer itself. Soderbergh's vaccine is so powerful, that it prevents the eradication of the human race.Ultimately, Soderbergh never questions the 'gospel truth' of modern orthodox medicine but always sticks to the 'company line'. Instead he would do well to listen to Edda West who cogently sets the record straight in regards to that earlier 'epidemic' in her article, 'Polio Perspectives': ""That the polio virus is the sole cause of polio is accepted by most people as gospel, and that the Salk and Sabin vaccines eradicated polio in the western world is etched into our collective consciousness as the major medical miracle of our time. But the history of polio and its vaccines is shrouded in a murky mist of politico/scientific manipulation, altered statistics, redefinition and reclassification of the disease, increased cases of vaccine induced paralytic polio, and monkey viruses transmitted by contaminated vaccines to millions of people worldwide.""",Contagion
56,thinker1691,""" Don't Blame others! We did it to ourselves """,7,12 January 2012,"This story was written by Scott Z. Burns for the big screen which was directed by Steven Soderbergh. The film "" Contagion "" assembles a whole plethora of fine actors and actresses who then do a remarkable job of frightening the audience into an awareness they should already be practicing. The film's subject is taken from everyday world headlines and depicts what would happen if a dangerous, transmittable airborne pathogen were accidentally transported from Asia to the rest of the world. It begins with an American tourist vacationing in Japan and who contracts' a dangerous virus and unknowingly brings it home to her unsuspecting family. Like the proverbial wildfire, the virus infects them and then leaps across the continents to threaten the global population. The film is well structured in that it begins with a single individual, then with little effort, frightens everyone in it's wake, up the social levels to include the President and his staff. While skilled professionals do their best to locate, identify and contain the lethal bio-hazard, other, less scrupulous individuals seek to capitalize on the problem for their own gain. It is to the CDC, World Health Organization, Red Cross and to the tireless individuals that this picture is dedicated to. Easilly Recommended. ****",Contagion

59,estebangonzalez10,Great Thriller! Will make you want to stay away from people for a while,8,7 November 2011,"¨It's figuring us out faster than we're figuring it out.¨The first thing I wanted to do after the movie was over was to wash my hands and get disinfected. Contagion is a great thriller about an epidemic that is spreading around the world and taking millions of lives while at the same time spreading panic and fear everywhere. The film is a great case study on human behavior and it felt very authentic (especially after the Swine-flu scare that spread over the globe a couple of years ago). Some may complain due to the pace of the film or the multiple stories that are going on that don't let you focus on any of the characters, but I really enjoyed it and thought Steven Soderbergh made the right decision by focusing on the virus and letting it be the true central character as we see it spread throughout different parts of the world and affect almost everyone in the same way. The virus and the fear combined together produced sufficient thrills for me despite the slow pace of the film, and I really enjoyed the script from Scott Z. Burns who had previously collaborated with Soderbergh and Matt Damon in the 2009 comedy The Informant. It's very difficult to typecast director Soderbergh since he makes a wide variety of films and it's almost impossible to compare his works due to the variety of his projects, but I would have to say Contagion is the most similar to his Oscar winning film Traffic due to all the multilayered plots that were going on. In Traffic the main character was the drugs, while in Contagion it's the virus. Out of Sight remains my favorite Soderbergh film however.The movie begins with Day 2 of the virus where we see a sick woman named Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) who is travelling from Chicago to Minneapolis. She had been on a business trip to Hong Kong but spent a few hours in Chicago. Once she arrives home, her husband Mitch (Matt Damon) finds her really ill and decides to take her to the hospital after she suffers a convulsion. Apparently some guy in Hong Kong died from similar symptoms, and so did someone in London, Japan, and Chicago. The virus seemed to have started somewhere in Hong Kong, but it is spreading all over the world. Some doctors in the U.S. Center for Disease Control decide to investigate what could have caused the deaths. Dr. Ellis Cheever (Lawrence Fishburne) is in charge of the investigation, and he sends Dr. Erin Mears (Kate Winslet) to Minneapolis in order to try to pick up as much information as she can and see how Beth's death could be related to the one in Chicago and across the globe. Erin has an interview with Mitch who seems to be immune, but he won't take chances with his daughter Jory (Anna Jacoby-Heron) and overprotects her. Dr. Ally Hextall (Jennifer Ehle), who also works for the Center, is in charge of trying to find a vaccine or a cure. Meanwhile the World Health Organization decides to send one of their own to Hong Kong to try to point out where the virus could have begun. Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) arrives to the populated city and begins her investigation with the help of a local named Sun Feng (Chin Han). Everyone is working against the clock as the virus continues to spread over the world at an alarming rate, and conspiracy theory-blog writer Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) doesn't help control the chaos as he complains about the government working alongside pharmaceutical companies to make a profit.There are so many different stories going on that it can be hard to track what is going on if you aren't paying attention. Everything happens so fast, and the urgency has to do with how quick the virus begins to act and kill people. Many characters or stories get sidelined at times, but that is OK because the main character is the virus itself and it is everywhere. Soderbergh makes sure we get this point across by filming a lot of close up shots of people shaking hands or touching objects that someone else later picks up. The threat is eminent and everywhere. In a way Contagion is a disaster movie, but it is different from most films which usually tend to take an all-action approach or that focus on a few characters. In Contagion there are so many characters and stories going on that some don't even get a resolution, but it is OK because we find a resolution to the main character: the virus. I know some might find this difficult to deal with and would have wished for the story to have focused on one character, but that isn't the way Soderbergh works. The only downside to this is that some great actors such as John Hawkes, Marion Cotillard, Elliott Gould, and Bryan Cranston don't get enough screen time and their talents seem underused. It really doesn't matter because Contagion is a smart and entertaining thriller well worth a watch. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Contagion

The opening is fantastic, good music and instantly scary as we watch the initial spread of the disease. The director shows close ups of various contaminated objects, peanuts on a bar, a credit card machine, a handrail, a binder in an office, doorknobs, a taxi, its super horrifying.There is a large extended cast here but for the most part I would say this follows unassuming family guy Matt Damon upon his wife's return from Hong Kong. She (Gweneth Paltrow) has picked up a nasty little virus which quickly becomes a global pandemic. Its pretty intense and there a several ongoing story lines: Jude Law is a blogging activist, Kate Winslet puts her life at risk as a member of WHO, Laurence Fishbourne deals with the politics at the Center for Disease Control. This movie also spans the globe which I really liked.As the contagion spreads to millions worldwide, society begins to break down as people panic. I felt like this gave a petty accurate portrayal of what would actually happen. Really the only fault with this movie is that it wraps things up a little too fast.

So much was eerily similar to our real situation that it was very scary & this excellent Thriller came out in 2011, almost they saw this coming!!!! The science & politics & panic behind the scenes with the government's & everybody was pretty much exactly how it really happened with Covid, anyway put aside the dark & grim realism, Contagion is one hell of a gripping Viral Thriller that is not just science fiction anymore.
This incredibly well made & constructed Thriller boasts a fantastic ensemble cast of excellent actors & each star gives a memorable performance with their characters especially Lawrence Fishbourne, Matt Damon & kate Winslet who really stand out but all are excellent here.
Another great point to this gripping film is the unique Music score that really is Primal at times & weird that totally suits the dark & Alien situation & is very unique music i loved it so much.
Contagion reminded me of the 90's forgotten Viral Thriller OUTBREAK with Dustin Hoffman & Cuba Gooding Jr & that film was an excellent gripping Thriller too with a grim reality to it but Contagion is scarier in a way because it feels so much like our situation right now!!!!

Starting with fantastic cast choice, this movie stars Kate Winslet, Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard just to name a few. All did a great job portraying their characters.
Plot is what you'd expect, a virus, people scared, crime raise etc. But it isn't a view from above movie, this movie focuses on many seperate life stories of people who all have one thing in common - they try to survive the virus outbreak. This movie is as great as it is a suspense thriller as it is a heart touching drama.
Soundtrack is great, it has creepy and suspense tracks which fit very well into this film.
Colour pallete was well done too, each of character arcs use different colour pallete, so we feel the bigger impact, it distinguishes the stories a bit.To summarise, this was an impressive creepy thriller.

65,3xHCCH,"Disappointing, but Kate Winslet Shines Through!",6,25 September 2011,"Steven Soderbergh is one of my favorite movie directors because of his unique approach to story telling as displayed in what arguably was his best movie, ""Traffic."" He is already planning on winding down his directorial career and had lined up a number of prestige projects, one of which was this one, ""Contagion.""There are always a lot of police dramas or legal dramas. But medical dramas are few and far between. I was excited to watch this one because of the relevant topic. The array of top draw stars in the cast is also formidable: Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Marion Cotillard, Lawrence Fishburne. I think I may have expected too much.The story about an pandemic of global proportion of a deadly viral disease is definitely not new. It had already been tackled very well in ""Outbreak"" more than 10 years ago. ""Contagion"" does not offer much new perspective on the topic, except perhaps for the conspiracy theory blogger character played by Jude Law. The initial conceit of having events happening in real time was very good.Also, the presence of so many big name stars meant that there would be less for each of their characters to do. For me, only Kate Winslet was able to create a real moment with her character. She was riveting in her role as the dedicated epidemiology expert who stopped at nothing to investigate the spread of the disease. She was simply too good an actress as she was able to do so much in the short time that she was on screen. If you had never seen a previous movie about a viral outbreak before, you will find ""Contagion"" fascinating, interesting and thrilling. However, I have, so that limited my appreciation. It seemed I had seen this movie before. Also, I thought the scenes of violent mass panic happened much too quickly, as did the scenes of vaccine research. Overall, I have to admit I was disappointed.

Her symptoms resemble the flu. In Chicago she cheats on her husband. Once home she infects her son and soon both are dead. Her husband, played by Damon, is immune but he becomes overprotective of his daughter from a previous marriage. Little by little as more people start dying the CDC gets involved. But there people are dying in China, in Hong Kong, San Francisco, Chicago, and eventually everywhere in the US.Homeland security wastes no time and gets the CDC's attention as well, thinking it could be a bio-weapon. The head of the CDC, played by Fishbourne, warns his wife to leave town, who in turn tells a friend, setting off a panic, by then the state borders are closed, supplies and food are in shortage.The CDC and a university researcher discover the origin of the virus. While in Geneva, the World Health Organization tries to track down patient zero. They conclude that Paltrow's character could well be it. In Hong Kong, the WHO's researcher is kidnapped and taken to a small town in the country to ensure that they will get the vaccine quickly, once it is developed.Back in the US, work is done feverishly on finding a vaccine. But it would take months. A scientist, played by Ehle, decides to vaccinate herself soon after animal trials. That vaccine works and it's distributed among the population according to a lottery based on birth day and month.A blogger though, claims early on to have found a homeopathic cure and is suspicious of the vaccine.Contagion is an exciting, fast-paced thriller, that imagines a rather gloomy scenario following this virus outbreak. This isn't humanity at its best and solidarious as in Japan after the Tsunami but more like New Orleans after the hurricane. Nurses and law enforcement refuse to work. There are home invasions, robberies, attacks over food and the vaccine. It's fairly realistic I presume. FEMA starts distributing MRE food. Homeland Security is paranoid and war hawkish. Authorities are ignorant. The government is incompetent.There are a lot of characters and stories to track, most of them very interesting. The story involving Damon's family is the least interesting. Following the CDC's research is the most interesting. The two more fascinating characters are two of its researchers and those are also the best performances by Ehle and Winslet- they truly shine in their roles. This is one of the few movies that makes science interesting and even cool. It doesn't cartoonize it thought. This isn't your usual Hollywood science, were stuff gets resolved in 2 minutes. The movie covers about 5 months. The scientists don't look like ugly idiots, but like real people.Direction is good except when things are fast-forwarded and we cover a lot of events in a quick time, that's when character's are put on mute and instead we get loud music. The music is good though- thankfully digital and not orchestrated, but still, music should never be turned into a character and it shouldn't be used to cover up dialog.

It's simply a different type of movie than a lot of people are used to, so they don't know how to process it. Anyway...One of the many things I love about this film is that it starts with Day 2, not Day 1. We don't see the actual origin of the outbreak until the very end of the film when it jumps back in time, so we spend the majority of the film trying to navigate the confusion that is the outbreak. We want to know the source, but we know as little as the WHO and CDC officials trying to track it. Alongside that tracking, though, is the human cost of the disease.That's mostly handled through Matt Damon's character who watches his wife and stepson die as some of the very first victims of the disease, though he seems to be immune. I expected the film to follow a convention that Damon would be the key to the cure, but it simply never brings up the idea and he's just left to tend to his daughter as they navigate the breakdown of law and order.The disease spreads quickly, though, and no one in the disease prevention industry can get a grasp on it. They first have trouble limiting it, all efforts of which prove to be futile. Then they have trouble replicating it in a lab setting, which only gets fixed with a non-government doctor ignores orders to destroy his samples and continues his work. They then have trouble figuring out how to actually attack it, until one of the chief scientists circumvents procedure and injects herself with the most promising vaccine they've developed up to that point. Then, the story's still not over, because while they do have the vaccine, they also have millions and millions of people who need it, and they can only make so much at a time, so a lottery gets developed to distribute it out by birthdate.Another way the movie captures the messy reality of this situation is how it uses its characters in the press. There are two, a journalist for a San Francisco paper and a blogger. The journalist is completely uninterested in the first steps of the disease as they unfold because it's just not corroborated or big enough. The blogger, though, is an anti-vaccine advocate and jumps on the story to feed his own biases. The journalist is too slow, and the blogger ends up using his position as a perceived prophet to profit off of the hysteria by pushing a bunk cure.The use of major movie stars in seemingly small roles is a very smart decision as well. One of its biggest stars, Gwyneth Paltrow, dies in the first twenty minutes. Another of the major stars dies within an hour. The movie uses star power intelligently, telling the audience that this disease can take out anyone. It increases the tension by helping to cloud the resolution.It's a movie about this ever changing process to get an unseen threat that's debilitating the world order under control. It's not about characters going through big emotional changes with catharsis for them at the end of the film. It's a thriller on a global scale. What it sets out to do, it does extremely well. I think it's one of the most effective thrillers in decades.",Contagion
73,Seraphion,A nice ensemble of top name cast on a beautifully dramatized subject,7,3 July 2014,"The uncommon basic premise is having a new take with this movie. Compared to similarly theme movies about disease outbreak, Contagion (2011) has a unique proposition for us by reducing the scenes set in the impoverished African regions. It instead turn to the theater of the recent viral outbreaks, Asia, as the origin of the epidemic. The story takes us further by displaying the situation when governments are literally overwhelmed by the spread and chaos starts to fill the people. Also the movie is good due to it succeeded in conveying the condition of the disease's seriousness although it reduces the shots of victims that usually feature quite disturbing gory and bloody imagery. The acting overall is nice, just what is expected from the kind of cast ensemble like this. The diverse sets where the scenes are shot are great addition to make this movie standout among other similarly themed spectacle.",Contagion

75,vengeance20,Mirrors Reality!,9,11 January 2021,"Remember watching this in cinemas back in 2011 & didn't think too much of it after watching. That's not to say I didn't like the film or think it wasn't great because it is. It's more so due to the current events we find ourselves in that I can relate to it more!The film follows a deadly virus outbreak which quickly turns into a global pandemic & the government are at a race against the clock to get a vaccine ready as people start dying from the virus.The film is pretty good! It's realistic to life & I'm saying this now after watching it for the first time in nearly 10 years! I honestly never thought much of this film from first viewing & sort of forgot about it, but as of now given the global pandemic we now find ourselves in this film is terrifyingly relatable! Hell, the film only had a couple of hundred people viewing it on Netflix, iTunes & Sky Movies before hand & now suddenly after a decade it's shot up in popularity!Never did I ever think something like what we see in the film would happen in real life! The film is well written, well directed & well acted! Given it's fiction, it IS based off of real events & isn't far from the truth, the film feels so much more relatable now than it ever did before!Give this a watch! 9/10",Contagion
76,moviewizguy,Nothing spreads like fear,8,11 September 2011,"CONTAGION tells the story of an unknown virus that spreads through air and contact with the skin. Make no mistakes, it's deadly, killing people within mere days. With this, the film follows several different characters as they react to this global epidemic, including an epidemiologist (Jennifer Ehle) quickly trying to find a cure to be mass produced and distributed to the world, a father (Matt Damon) whose wife is the unfortunate first victim to the virus, a government official (Laurence Fishburne) working for the CDC trying to calm the public down, a doctor (Kate Winslet) trying to find the origin of the virus, among many others. Although there have been many viral epidemic films that have come out in the past decade, CONTAGION is the most realistic and one of the best.Because of this, the information and events that occur in the film are given in a matter-of-factly way, and I can see why that may be a problem for some in terms of becoming emotionally invested with the story. However, I actually liked the way director Steven Soderbergh handled the film, and it didn't stop me from feeling emotional once characters start to die. The film is also quite gripping and intense to watch. There comes a point in the film where we see the breakdown of society as people start to loot and steal, which I found to be very disturbing. It's similar to BLINDESS in terms of style, and although taking over in a span of months, the film is fairly fast paced, helping give the sense of urgency to stop the uncontrollable virus.Soderbergh also manages to balance the multiple story lines that run throughout the film, devoting enough time to each, although some are better and more interesting than others. For example, the storyline involving Jude Law, who plays a blogger conspiring against the government, isn't really engaging compared to the others because his character is frustrating and annoying to watch at times. Many people seem to find Marion Cotillard's storyline to be useless and isolated from the others, but I thought it was just fine and her performance was great too. However, the best ones are Matt Damon's and Jennifer Ehle's, which is partly due to their terrific performances.Jennifer Ehle, in particular, one of the more unknown actor in the cast, really shines above the A-list stars because the way she delivers her lines are subtle, yet you seem to feel a surge of emotion coming out of her. I also liked Kate Winslet's storyline, which plays like a detective mystery, and you can almost always do no wrong with her. She's an incredible actress, and she's great in the film. Another castmember I'd like to mention is John Hawkes, who's pretty good for the limited screen time he has, along with Bryan Cranston.CONTAGION is also wonderfully shot and has a unique, trippy score that's really another character in the film. Overall, it's a well made film in an exercise in tension, and the cast is pretty great. Once the credits roll, you'd feel like wanting to wash your hands more often along with being more aware of your surroundings.",Contagion

79,Luigi Di Pilla,Very good research,6,3 September 2020,Steven Soderbergh directed this movie with high precision on epidemic details. In fact many issues are exactly and incredibly the same ones of our actual Corona time. I think the soundtrack could have been better. At the end of this film you will see one theory about the origin of this virus. All actors played good their roles. This DVD could be helpful for example in schools to understand better the social consequences.6/10,Contagion
80,stensson,Fewer,8,1 November 2011,"What happens when the next world flu comes? Who's first in line for treatment and who's first in line to die? That's two questions Steven Soderbergh puts here in this disease thriller.It's quite competent. We meet the expected stereotypes like the father who tries to protect his daughter, the admiral responsible for law and order during serious national crisis, the same old politicians and the same old hero doctors. But we also meet a newer kind of stereotype, which means The Crazy Blogger, well performed by Jude Law.A couple of parallel stories here, well handled. Not a genius's work, but Soderbergh has so far never made us disappointed.",Contagion
81,valadas,Lukewarm narrative,6,8 July 2014,"This movie begins almost like a crime story whose murderer is a very dangerous virus of unknown origin that begins to kill people here and there all over the world proceeding quickly from a small number to tenths, hundreds, thousands and millions of dead. Scientists fight desperately against it mainly trying to discover an efficacious vaccine. Some or some other chief character shows some relief in his/her personal and familiar situations and we see also some social convulsion due to the people's panic. Nevertheless the movie starts losing drama and emotional weight as far as the story develops itself and it never has great dramatic or emotional scenes although it refers to a great human tragedy. The story is narrated and shown in a lukewarm rhythm and style where the most important feature dwells in the dialogues. The narrative style, oral and visual doesn't correspond to the magnitude of the subject and the final scene which pretends to show the real origin of the epidemics is trivial, unrefined and lacking any kind of dramatic weight.",Contagion
82,intelearts,470th Review: A Disaster Of A Movie,4,23 December 2011,"Frankly, dull. What could have been a triumph of plotting and explanation of how governments and people would cope under the all too present real danger of a global flu-type epidemic falls between all stools - it is neither rigorous enough to be truly scientific, or driven to be a disaster movie - or even innocuous enough to be a bureaucratic take on a global dilemma - so what the viewer gets is a half-baked, half-produced, and half-finished film. Given the stars on display, the ideas involved, the scope this truly is probably the most disappointing film of the year - it is not terrible per se, you can sit through and not cringe, but it never goes anywhere. Static film-making, a turgid script, and frankly incredibly underworked ideas, all leave the viewer going meh at best.By all means see it when it comes round on TV but paying to see this in the cinema might encourage more, and honestly, if you can't, with the resources available, make a great film out of these stars, this plot, and this budget, then it's time to call it a day.",Contagion
83,jjnxn-1,Middling thriller with an outstanding cast,7,12 October 2013,"A very strong cast, an interesting premise and assured direction but something is missing to take this from an decent story to a gripping white knuckle drama. Matt Damon is strong in the role with the most depth giving the film a solid center while the other actors are relied upon to flesh out their characters without a lot of help from the script. A case in point is Marion Cottilard a very fine actress who does a lot with a part that really doesn't offer much and gets no real resolution. Kate Winslet also makes her part of a first responder more memorable than it would normally be although hers is a part with a bit more emotional impact than most. A good film, it just could have been better if the script had been more focused.",Contagion
84,Troy_Campbell,Monumentally gripping.,9,1 November 2011,"Steven Soderbergh's latest is not entertaining. Nor is it exciting. It is, however, monumentally gripping. Shot in an almost documentary fashion, this meticulous thriller outlines how a viral epidemic could nonchalantly begin and, after tearing the world's population to shreds, finally be contained. If the thought itself isn't creepy enough, then Soderbergh has employed a viciously effective score and wonderfully executed shots that instil a dread rarely seen in mainstream films. The A-list cast – Kate Winslet, Matt Damon, Jude Law, Marion Cotillard, Laurence Fishburne, Gwyneth Paltrow – are all terrific, and the early departure of a couple of them only amplifies the intensity. When a major Hollywood star dies and has an autopsy on their brain conducted, all within the opening 20 minutes, you know a movie means business. Contagion deserves to gain a wide audience, even if it's not easy viewing. Oh, and do everyone a favour: wash your hands.",Contagion

86,oneguyrambling,Gwenyth Paltrow dies. But then things get depressing...,6,17 February 2012,"Contagion is many things, well crafted and acted, chilling, hopefully extremely unlikely but unfortunately not implausible.Ironically given the title one thing it is not is catchy, which given the subject matter – a mystery virus that kills millions worldwide – is totally understandable. This means that it is another film worth watching but probably not revisiting, as entertaining is another word that doesn't belong in the introductory sentence above.Put another way this film joins Babel, 21 Grams, Schindler's List and Hotel Rwanda as films that would raise an eyebrow if they showed up in a friends DVD collection.Contagion is everything Outbreak wasn't, but to save time I can say that the main difference is that it is 'good'.Once the virus commences it's worldwide tour there are no quick fixes, no supercomputers, 'Rain Man' savants, brilliant kids to suggest it's origins, no flame haired hero with abs of steel rides in on a white horse to save the day with seconds to spare and no convenient near misses. Just long sequences that allow the stark truth to unfold over several continents, often without a musical accompaniment to let the silence and desperation sink in.Make no mistake, Contagion might be PG, but people die. Lots of people.Hell, Oscar Winners die! As with so many things the unnamed virus is simply another thing 'Made in China', unfortunately tourists and business people have a habit of touching things and breathing, which aids and abets the virus to spread to all areas of the globe swiftly. (Thankfully we are spared an overdose of sciencey looking charts and diagrams, though in the early going we are told the populations of the various initial hotspots.) An all star cast peppered with award winners and surnames like Winslet, Fishburne, Damon, Cotillard, Law, Hawkes and Paltrow get cracking at either being infected or helping the infected. (I mention Paltrow first because as the trailer shows she is infected early, and gets only enough time to make a few of the faces that her offscreen hubby must've made when she suggested 'Apple' would be a good name for a kid before gurgling her way from existence.) As the death toll rises so too does the level of social network chatter, blogs fire up with conspiracy theories, some wonder if it is an act of terrorism, and the government opine that all this death is so inconvenient.On a related note Jude Law features as one of the more prominent and active bloggers (which is a waste of his good looks), and he sports an accent that changes through the film of indeterminate origin, at times I swore he was supposed to be Australian, others his normal UK twang shone through, and still others a bland confusing melange of accents. Not important. Just weird.Confusion turns to desperation, which leads inevitably to panic. People are warned not to contact others and to stay indoors, which is difficult when days stretch to weeks and in turn to multiple seasons. Which also proves that there is few as daring as a horny teen In fact the likely worst case scenario would see a race of pimply teens all shuffling out of their parent's basements, squinting at the sudden exposure to sunlight after months playing Gears of War 3 oblivious to all the goings on outside in the real world.Strangely enough given the subject matter the film largely ignores the grieving, sure we see the bodies and sense the desperation of the as yet uninfected, but precious few moments are committed to showing the sorrow and impact on those that have lost loved ones. Even Matt Damon – who plays Paltrow's husband – only wants answers, not seeming to spend time considering his loss.Ultimately as mentioned earlier Contagion is a sadly effective movie. We all know that new viruses spring up periodically (H1N1 and swine flu are both name-checked here) and that eventually one might arrive that laughs at our scientific geniuses and air-proof suits. This unknown makes viruses scary, and Stephen Soderbergh milks this for every gosh, sigh and sniffle he can without resorting to histrionics, stunts or a cute little infected monkey.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. An effective human drama for those that miss the good old plagues and epidemics of centuries gone by. Contagion is a very good movie, but not a date movie, after this you won't even want to touch yourself",Contagion
87,napierslogs,Life and death as been done before but now with debates,7,9 November 2011,"""Contagion"" is the fight against a contagious disease. The fight against time, against the virus, and against fear. Humanity being threatened by a deadly illness is not new for cinema. But it is a better adventure than most. There's science, heartbreak, death, life and young love, and all with more characters than you can count, but played by some of the best actors that Hollywood and the world have to offer.Gwyneth Paltrow, the beautiful blonde, is the first to get sick. Immediately thereafter, the deaths start piling up. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization start investigating (WHO). Husbands (Matt Damon) want answers, doctors (Kate Winslet, et al) want answers, and everybody else gets to run around with their heads chopped off (figuratively). And we followed everybody, and they were all played by a worthwhile actor, even those with just a line or two. I could have done with a lot less characters.In fact, I probably would have preferred it with one main character. Specifically, Jude Law as Alan Krumwiede, a blogger with personal investments in the outcome of humanity. The great thing is that instead of representing the media as a collective group of non-identifiable people, we got one person, an interestingly-created, modern, selfish person. I think he needed to be much more gray and less evil, but even as is he instigated debates about journalism, and about what traits or actions make one person worse than another. Warning: you may disagree with your loved one, and that is one of the best things ""Contagion"" can do.I'm not even sure that the filmmakers know what they did well and what they didn't do well because they basically just did everything. I had seen most of it before, but they did do most of it well. But as I said before, I got a debate about journalism in a film about life and death and that part was better than I could have expected.",Contagion
88,Prashast_Singh,"Both entertaining and informative, Contagion is a realistic prediction of today's times.",10,3 September 2020,"Watched it last night on Netflix and honestly, I was impressed by the time credits rolled. Who knew a 9-year old film would sound like a foreshadowing of the ongoing pandemic? Contagion blew my mind, and I couldn't decide if I was watching it to be entertained or learn something. The film is as entertaining as it is informative and the fact that the virus it depicts is more dangerous than the one in the real world these days, should scar anyone for life but in a positive way.Contagion is totally realistic and grounded in every way. Let me explain how. The film is entirely focused on the outbreak and the lives of those affected by it directly (infected people) and indirectly (doctors and others people struggling to contain it). Even in terms of action, it's grounded and low-key. There's a little bit of action, but it's all unconventional and apt for a film like this. There's ample emotion and suspense too. The film benefits a lot from its cast, especially Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Laurence Fishburne and Marion Cotillard. Every actor breathes life into their respective characters and that results in an intense atmosphere.I was totally glued to the screen and by the time it ended, I was both entertained and informed. The film is relevant in today's times and that alone has resulted in a renewed popularity, but I'd say it's still a great film if you forget its uncanny resemblance to the real world. It can still be enjoyed and appreciated as any other medical disaster film. It not only has a great story replete with drama and suspense but also a great score: make sure to check it out. It's indeed scary, again, to see a film that would go on to predict the ongoing pandemic and its impacts on both infected and uninfected people at the same time, with finesse.",Contagion
89,TheUnknown837-1,"Steven Soderbergh's ""Contagion"" is the best American movie of 2011 thus far",10,14 September 2011,"When the lights went down and the projector started casting the wonderfully-choreographed images of Steven Soderbergh's new film ""Contagion"" upon the auditorium's screen, I knew right away that I was in for a great experience. And what a relief! The ominous, underlying subtext of the last five or six reviews that I have written has been my proclamation of just how lousy of a year 2011 has been for movies. Thankfully, there are three wonderful movies that have stood out amongst the herds of duds and forgettables. One was ""Source Code"" a wonderful thriller with touches of humanity. The second was ""The Lincoln Lawyer,"" held up by one of the best performances by an actor this year. And now comes ""Contagion,"" the surprisingly grand new apocalyptic thriller about a horrible virus wiping out the world and it not only stands out as a great movie, but it's the crowning achievement of the year.Thus far.There have been a lot of movies focusing on an epidemic wiping out most of the human race. Some have been good, some have been bad. But so few have captured not only a sense of terror, but the refreshing touch of humanism as Mr. Soderbergh's new film. The movie opens up with several people dropping dead of, what else, the titular contagion. And from there a simple premise evolves: what would really - really! - happen if an epidemic like this happened? How would people react? How would the government react? How would the sick react? And that's part of what's so special about this movie. That it does not go over-the-top with some exaggerated fantasy about nuclear weapons, mutated creatures, werewolves, and not-so-impressive computer generated imagery. The movie instead chooses to focus on people caught up in the wrath of a seemingly incurable plague. And they're ordinary people. They're thinking people. They're realistic people. Through the wonderful performances by the cast (which includes Matt Damon, Marion Cotillard, Laurence Fishburne, Elliott Gould, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Sanaa Lathan, among others) we get dynamics of just about every angle of humankind. The family fighting to stay alive, the loners fending for themselves, the sinister, avaricious types concerned about their own sake, the scientists making a noble effort to save the world. And there is the way they play off each other, best personified in a key moment where Mr. Law, as an Internet journalist, questions the honesty of Mr. Fishburne, playing a disease control official, tries to assure the public of progress against the virus. But among this, we also get reassuring angles, such as when a man is asked to forgive his wife for having an affair, even though she is already dead. Forgiveness! That is a theme so rare in pictures these days.The picture has a broad cast of characters, set in locations at all corners of the earth, and Mr. Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns find just the right amount of time to space between them all. They do not overstay their welcome or become forgotten just because they're not currently on-camera. And they do not all intersect at some crucial point just when the plot figures it's time for a climax. As I sat in the theater, utterly wrapped up and consumed by the story that was unfolding, I kept waiting for it to cop out and go on automatic pilot. I was all the more delighted when it never did.But best of all is the sense of horror the plot makes of the virus. We don't get any cheap shots of zombies, no blood spurting out of people's eyes, none on that unneeded, B-movie debris. Instead, it accomplishes it through not only scenes of slow, agonizing death, but dialogue. Dialogue between characters. Again, those characters, who are so important to any great movie! We don't see the virus fighting against science, we hear about it, then observe its effects. It also communicates the horror of an epidemic through its great supply of information about how contagions work. How they survive, how they infect, how they (sometimes) kill. The precautions necessary, it has that too. Again, how refreshing to see characters reacting to logic and knowledge instead of just plot conventions. And thus, whenever a step is made toward the bad, it leaves a petrified sensation. When it takes a step toward the good, it floods the viewer with relief. Relief - as well as hope - as though it were really happening. And Mr. Soderbergh's directs it in a way that is not hyperbolic or smarmy but smart and attentively. It's further from the junk-filmmaking of the misguided Michael Bay and closer to artists like Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese.Performances all around are excellent. I could praise all of them, especially Mr. Fishburne and Miss Winslet but I want to single out special praise for Matt Damon, who took not only a supporting role, but a very small and nevertheless important supporting role. It would have been all too easy to expect him to play a heroic lead, maybe one of the scientists looking for a cure. But instead he chooses to play a humble man, an average man, and sacrifices lots of screen time to prove that he can still be a great actor as well as a movie star.""Contagion"" is a picture monumentally better than its cheesy trailers and hack-job poster lead me to believe. And it passed a test for what I consider to be the ultimate litmus experiment, if you will, on movies of whether it is truly great. A picture qualifies on my judgment if it leaves me with that wonderful sensation that I would want to see it again. And I cannot imagine being satisfied with just one viewing of ""Contagion."" It is too refreshing, too strong, too well-directed and acted. Too reaffirming that the movies can be great as well as just a way to pass the time.",Contagion

92,hall895,Avoid like the plague,4,31 January 2016,"A medical disaster which could potentially kill millions of people all around the world...well that shouldn't be boring. But in Contagion boring it is. This is a medical thriller which is not at all thrilling. The film is a largely tedious, totally unfocused mess. You have a great cast filled with some of the most renowned performers of our time. You have a highly acclaimed director in Steven Soderbergh. And you have a story which should be absolutely gripping. How could it all go so wrong? A woman drops dead in Minnesota. Soon people are dropping dead all over the place, felled by a new disease doctors can't figure out. The world goes to hell in the proverbial handbasket. We see doctors investigating the origin of this new virus and trying to find a cure. We see ordinary people trying to survive in a society which is crumbling all around them. And, in a subplot which should have been excised from the film, we see an unscrupulous blogger who professes to have the cure. There are a lot of strands of the plot and these strands don't come together at all satisfactorily. Honestly the whole thing is a mess. And a quite boring mess at that.With the film being so unfocused it's hard to form attachments to any character. If there's one person we come close to connecting with it's an ordinary man, played by Matt Damon, who just wants to keep his daughter safe. But any time you want to invest in his story the film abandons him and goes off somewhere else. We go to Atlanta where Laurence Fishburne plays the man heading the efforts of the CDC. We go to Hong Kong, where Marion Cotillard's character investigates the origin of the disease and ends up in a surprising situation which does absolutely nothing to advance the plot. We have Kate Winslet playing a doctor investigating things in Minnesota. Her story has a little juice to it but it isn't sustained. And we have Jude Law, playing that incredibly annoying blogger, whose story sends the film completely off the rails. All the while there's a global disaster going on so the film should feel big, have some real weight to it. But it doesn't, it's all very mundane. An easy film to compare Contagion to is Outbreak. In that film, the focus was on an outbreak in one town. Not as big a deal as a worldwide pandemic. Maybe Contagion is too big for its own good. Outbreak was a taut, tight thriller. It had focus. Contagion is all over the place. And the thrill is gone.",Contagion
93,KnightsofNi11,Very unique take on the viral outbreak subgenre,8,10 September 2011,"One would think that the last thing we need is another outbreak movie. But that's not the case when the latest of the genre is directed by the always interesting Steven Soderbergh. Contagion wins for this years most ridiculously impressive cast lineup, as it is an ensemble picture about a deadly viral outbreak that affects the entire world. We follow various characters like a man who loses his wife and step son to the disease. We follow various doctors who work to stop the virus, along with CDC officials who must control the spread and influence of the virus. The whole film is a tightly woven dramatic thriller that presents a lot of characters and a lot of ideas, but keeps them all in line and pulls its story off very well.It's not always easy to keep an ensemble cast straight, especially when the main plot of the film is run by subplots from the various characters and their stories that continue throughout the film. The stories weave in and out of each other at times, but often they are all separate, just lead by the same main plot of a viral outbreak affecting the entire population of the world. Thankfully, Contagion interweaves its characters and story lines at just the right intervals, forming a very structured and well crafted end result. There are essentially four main stories that intertwine. There's the father character's story, the CDC, the scientists trying to stop the disease, and a blogger who claims to already have a cure for the disease. These four stories get basically equal screen time and all serve a purpose towards thickening the film's plot. The way they work together and separate is impressive and makes for a very strong overall narrative.Soderbergh takes a very minimalist approach to Contagion, steering clear of anything flashy or exaggerated and avoiding over-dramatic relationships and big budget set pieces. This makes Contagion a very unique experience and something much different from your typical viral outbreak flick. It does lag in spots as the film attempts to stretch out certain things without doing anything flashy. The film takes a very low key and eerily monotone approach to its storytelling. It seems to choose the simplest solution to things which in turn makes it a more fascinating and much more realistic feeling than something glitzy and spastic. I certainly feel that Contagion paints the best picture of what would actually happen should a serious outbreak like this occur. This, of course, makes it all the more frightening.Contagion is certainly a film worth seeing. It takes a much different approach to a genre we thought we were so familiar with. Soderbergh's poignant direction and Scott Z. Burns' sharp script give this film a great atmosphere, and the incredible cast lineup makes it all the better. It is undeniably slow at points, but when you put in the context of a film of this quality it doesn't matter nearly as much. This is a great way to kick off the fall season for film.",Contagion
94,gregsrants,Frightful Reality,7,11 September 2011,"Looking to feed off our fears realized in recent years with H1N1 and Bird Flu director Steven Soderbergh assembled an A-List cast for his new film entry, Contagion.In this frightening and all-too-real depiction of a deadly disease that has international mortality rate, Contagion shows us that a deadly outbreak could be far worse than any terrorist attack or war due to the political and budgetary red tape that would stand in the war of doctors attempting to find a cure.Contagion starts on ""Day 2"". Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) is returning from a trip to Asia and is returning through Chicago and Minnesota already showing signs of a new disease. Soderbergh works the camera showing everything that Beth comes in contact with – the peanuts at a bar, her phone, poker ships at a casino – to heighten our awareness of how powerless we would be to contain a fast spreading virus.Upon her return to her husband Mitch (Matt Damon) and young child, Beth continues on her downward spiral and soon seizures and is brought to the hospital where she dies soon after. Doctors are baffled, but when Mitch's young son dies and an autopsy is performed on Beth, the CDC (Centre for Disease Control) in Atlanta, Georgia immediately begins operations under the instruction of Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne).Dr. Ellis Cheever hires Dr. Erin Mears (Kate Winslet) as his legs on the ground and we watch as the CDC along with doctors and scientists around the world work independently in an attempt to find a cure to a disease that may have infected as many as 1 in 12.Not since Outbreak in 1995 has there been a film to play on the fears of a reality of an unknown virus infecting a mass populace. The realization of the potential actuality of such events hit audiences like a sledgehammer to the body. And anyone that thinks Contagion could never unfold in our developed world where a search for a cure would overtake any political or corporate profiteering, you would have to look no further than HBO's And The Band Played On back in 1993 to see how personal glory stood in the way of progress in the diagnosis of the AIDS virus in the early 1980's.With a supporting cast that includes everyone from John Hawkes to Bryan Cranston to Marion Cottilard, there are enough characters in Contagion for everyone to find someone to which they would relate. Whether it be the over protective father (Damon) that won't let his daughter out of the house or the janitor father (Hawkes) that wants nothing more than to protect his child and believes that the CDC is his only hope, there is someone of personal relation to any audience member and Contagion does everything including initiating its viewers to ask themselves ""What would I do?"" Steven Soderbergh does little to provoke confidence in the CDC or pharmaceutical institutions. Nor does he spare the world populace of unspeakable crimes that include looting and murder for supplies and suspected serums containing antibodies.With so many plot lines being thrown at the audience, it is expected that some would work better than others while still others will fall flat in both personal involvement or plot development. Jude Law's character, Alan, is a blogger that attempts to use his internet followers to raise awareness of a government cover-up. He goes from crusader to profiteer and has the biggest transformation of any of film's characters. Marion Cottilard plays Dr. Orantes who gets kidnapped for an exchange of vials of the new cure. Although both stories take up a large part of the film, neither really drive the plot forward – in particular the Cottilard storyline – and could probably have been left on the cutting room floor and replaced with more backroom research and boardroom table conversations on dealing with the obstacles deterring the development of a cure.Contagion is a good film, and maybe more interestingly, an important one. It will do nothing to open our eyes or change the events that would occur in the event of an outbreak, but it does show how helpless our independent thinking and process acknowledgement would interfere if such a disease ever became our nightmare. It ends 135 days after it all began (which is the one element that just didn't feel believable amidst all impediments) and Soderbergh takes us full circle back to Day 1. It is a 135 day journey into our darkest fears and our worst terrors.www.killerreviews.com",Contagion
95,markthomassintek,Coronavirus similar film,9,14 March 2020,"REVIEW - CONTAGIONWhile the world faces the effects of the Caronavirus I came across this 2011 film which actually shows how such a virus is spread, exactly in the same way the Coronavirus is spread but luckily the virus in this film is much worse.Very interesting watch but as with most films in this genre they happen to find a cure and use it to cure the world, but so far with the Coronavirus there is not.The similarities between the new virus in this film and the new Caronavirus are simply uncanny and due to the situation the world currently finds its self in actually turns this film into quite a scary watch as to what could happen and what has and is happening all around us.The only downside of this film was that they found the cure.Rating 9 out of 10",Contagion

Of course, ""Contagion"", being a Hollywood film, the virus spread much faster than the real thing as well as caused way more fatalities. As of this writing (2.21.2020) there are 77,767 cases with 2,360 deaths and 20,833 recovered around the world. And that's pretty fast for a virus that was just recognized 12.31.2019 - not even two months ago. Some of the ideas and behaviors in ""Contagion"" seemed far fetched, but in the end, it wasn't really that bad of a production consideration the nature of virus infections tend to be mysterious and unknown in the first place.",Contagion

A few days ago, I was going over Jude Law's filmography and I found out about this film. At the same time, I remembered that I have this film stored in external HDD. But, I haven't watched it yet, so, I watched it just now.At first, I thought it was just a normal film. And I was kind of right for half. When the film started, it was kind of boring because it's just a film that shows they are finding a cure for a disease which spreads very fast. And between that, there's also some blogger is misleading people. Cheating people to get more fans and money. As the film went, although it didn't get exciting, but it's kind of interesting to find out how they found out the cure for that disease.What I love the most is the way they chose to show how that disease happened. In the middle of the film, I wondered how the disease spread and how it became. It's good to see that they have explained at the end.To say this film in overall, the plot is so simple, and some scenes are a bit boring, but it's still watchable. Hence, it's just a fine film.",Contagion

After researching it though and figuring out that it is not going to be an R rating I was very disappointed and rightly so. This movie was just so boring and light and it should have been dark and exciting.This movie is about a disease that hits and starts killing mass amounts of people all around the world. Medical scientists struggle to find a cure.Even Matt Damons acting could not save this movie it was just not interesting at all.

100,jdkraus,A Germ Phobic's worst nightmare,9,10 September 2011,"""Contagion"" is the perfect movie to be released this time of year, for it is hay fever season. This is also the perfect movie for Stephen Soderbergh to direct. Like his films ""Traffic"" and ""Ocean's Eleven"" the story is made up of a collection of characters and their subplots, which all tied to one theme—an epidemic. There is the average man (Matt Damon), who loses his wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his stepson to the disease. He tries to keep himself as well as his adolescent daughter alive. There is the government agencies who are trying to stop this outbreak, which includes stars, such as: Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, and Marion Cotillard. There is even a blogger (Jude Law), who is out to expose the truth about this epidemic, but he is not all what he seems to be. There are even more subplots, yet screenwriter Scott .Z Burns and director Stephen Soderbergh hold the magic of making them all mesh together without losing the audience, nor going too technical with the biology behind the lethal virus. There are no doubt similarities between this film and Wolfgang Peterson's 1995 release of ""Outbreak,"" but this feature focuses more on the characters. The fact that the story is told from many different perspectives makes it all the more enjoyable. ""Contagion"" is a great feat of movie-making and interweaved character drama. We care for the characters, and we don't know who's going to get infected next, much less die. Soderbergh captures the paranoia and the impeding world anarchy flawlessly. Some of my favorite shots are of the empty stores and airports, and the streets full of looters. If the world had another terrible epidemic like the Spanish flu, would the world come to this? I would certainly think so, but I'd pray not. The tension and paranoia of characters not being able to touch one another is more icing added to the cake. The cinematography, editing, and music are brilliantly executed too. After seeing this movie, I can't help but think of what Kate Winslet's character said, ""We touch our faces two to three thousand times a day."" I can't even imagine how many more times we touch each other and not cover our mouths when we cough. My point? We are so insensitive to the germs and bugs that are all around us, which makes a germ phobic's worst nightmare.My rating: 3.5 out of 4",Contagion
101,CountZero313,the end is nigh,5,28 March 2012,"A new, deadly virus emerges in Hong Kong. As the pandemic grows, disorder spreads and the search for a vaccine becomes ever more frantic. Meanwhile, a leading blogger emerges as the counter-culture voice suggesting more sinister conspiracies are afoot.Contagion works well in the documentary-style slow build from one sickly, coughing woman, to an unprecedented catastrophe that threatens the very existence of our species. Events are both sublime - researchers forced to use themselves as guinea pigs - and banal - a blogger who uses the whole event to carry out a money-making scam. We start on Day Two, and work our way inexorably to Day One.Where the film falls down is the lack of focus on any one character to relate to. Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon in yet another post-Bourne everyman role) suffers more than most, losing wife, child, and then discovering he was a cuckold. A doctor derails his career by using inside information to save his family. A researcher dies a lonely death in the field. An WHO bigwig finds herself kidnapped and held to ransom. This sprawling, scattergun approach would work better if we felt an urgency to events, but perversely the presence of Winslet, Damon, Paltrow and Fishburne reminds us of the artifice of it all. A strong argument could have been made here for the casting of more anonymous actors in order to better serve the story.Some plot holes niggle throughout - which territories exactly are affected? Why do power and mobile networks remain unaffected? There is also a sense that only the USA is working on the vaccine while the rest of the world waits. And Jude Law's blogger seems an obscure detail unworthy of the screen time given to this story strand amid such bigger concerns.Ancient Mayan babblings driving the superstitious into a frenzy mean this is a crowded genre at the moment. Perfect Sense dealt with life-threatening viral threats, and the way events played out seemed plausible. Contagion is never quite convincing that this is how it could be.",Contagion

A must see film.",Contagion
103,JohnRayPeterson,Hypochondriacs stay away from this one,7,2 January 2012,"The film is disturbing on two levels, the plausible major epidemic and the financial conspirators who make it worse. It appears to have disappointed many viewers for whatever reason they wrote; I compared it to the 1995 film 'Outbreak "", and so it did not turn me off. I thought it had more to offer than the 1995 film. Both movies have a big cast of star actors and this has a certain appeal.In 'Contagion', the epidemic is far more reaching and the institutions that get involved are international (though the CDC gets predominance). The chaos portrayed is of greater magnitude and the solution is ill explained (no pun intended). There are more sub-plots than in 'Outbreak' and that made it more interesting. Many reviewers expressed that the movie made no point or that the point was lost in too much sub-plots that lead nowhere. I disagree; the point is obvious, the world is always at risk and will always be at risk of epidemics, now more than ever. The sub-plots were conveying indirect effects of a worldwide epidemic as lived by several different characters from around the world.The word is out, good or bad, and the box office will tell one story while over the long run, the Blue ray/ DVD sales & rentals will seal that part of the movie's story. I did not pass on it and felt the trailers and promos do it a fair justice, but I find it difficult to give it a full fledge recommendation. The big name actors have short parts, no one has a big role, with perhaps the exception of Laurence Fishburne whose role gives him slightly more screen time that others.",Contagion
104,Christian_Dimartino,"Dazzling, gripping, and frighteningly real, Contagion is the best film of the year so far.",10,10 September 2011,"Some people strongly believe that America will end in 2012. I think its ridiculous, and thats why director Roland Emmerich's 2012 didn't scare me. That, and because it was made two years ago. But now its 2011, and the time is getting nearer. And now a much more gifted director, Steven Sodebergh, is trying to scare Americans with his latest art work, Contagion, and he has succeeded.Contagion's plot is simple. A woman(Gweneth Paltrow) has just gotten back from Hong Kong and two days later, she bites the dust, and is named ""Project 0"". But as it turns out her disease is spreading across America, and its up for the scientists to get to the bottom of it, and the citizens to get away from it.Contagion plays like your usual plague movie. It involves a bunch of characters, including a father(Matt Damon) and his daughter, a crackpot journalist(Jude Law), scientists(Including Kate Winslet, welcome back by the way, Laurence Fishburne, and Marion Cotillard). The genre is hard to capture, mainly because a lot of the ideas have been used before.But the film is what i'd like to call the""Magnolia"" of disaster movies. The one that others should look up to, and remember and cherish forever. Contagion is more of a character study, and all of the characters are real and we deeply care about them.This is also the most stylish plague movie ever. The way the music and the mood transcend together works so well. The performances are strong from everyone, and the film is chillingly real. I may not believe in 2012, but Contagion makes you wonder. It makes you wonder a lot. Germs just keep spreading and spreading. And I hope people's love for this film just keeps spreading and spreading. This is the best film of the year so far.A",Contagion

Seem familiar?!Filmmakers spoke with infectious disease experts and produced this realistic scenario, perhaps too realistic, of what such a pandemic might look like. They got many things right including fear being as damaging as any virus and doctors pleading for social distancing. It is eerie how similar many things are, but even in their wildest scenarios they probably never envisioned a major world leader more concerned about scoring political points and protecting their own image than science, the truth and helping people. The virus portrayed in the film is considerably more lethal, 25% kill rate as opposed to 1-4% for the Covid-19 strain.I heard about Contagion on NPR while listening to one of the experts that the filmmakers included for their research. While Contagion includes impressive and realistic scenarios, and heavy hitting actors such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburne, Matt Damon and Jude Law, the story-telling is not nearly as impressive. If only their imagination and artistry equaled their research talent. Still, Contagion is compelling for all the truth it reveals about human nature in times, like now, of contagion.",Contagion
106,Darkside-Reviewer,Coughing and Dialogue,8,7 June 2019,An interesting movie showing the spread of a virus from its very beginnings until it's cure it's an interesting look at something that is very real that has and more than likely will happen again in time people become desperate and will do anything to survive going from civilised to paranoid and violent the movie also shows the reality of what could happen to the families of people who work on developing cures them being attacked kidnapped it is a look into a frightening world which feels very real and realistic.Matt Damons performance is the best part of this movie as a father trying to protect his child and not giving up even when things are at there worst his character shows the best of humanity in this kind of situation.I recommend this to people who enjoy a slower more realistic take on disaster movies no action scenes or gunfights just dialogue science talk and emotional scenes.,Contagion

Who could afford to pay the salary of all of these people?Several reviewers refer to Contagion as a ""predictive propaganda piece"", clearly preparing the unwashed masses for Covid-19. It is truly amazing to me that the narrative of this film is precisely the story being told about Covid-19, with one notable exception: the R figure in the film (reproduction rate) is for a virus which wipes out everyone it infects. In contrast, Covid-19 kills nearly no one but the elderly and infirm. So all of the measures laid out so painstakingly in Contagion, for a virus which kills most of the people it infects, make no real sense for a case where the actual probability of death to anyone under the age of 50 is in fact less than 1%.Many reviewers are calling Sodenbergh a prophet for having predicted the current Covid-19 ""pandemic"", but the two cases are alike only in the political response, not in the danger of death. The virus of the film warrants all of the extreme lockdown and quarantine measures, and the rush to deliver an experimental vaccine. But what about a virus which 99.5+% of humanity will survive? Strangely enough, the virus of the film is said also to have jumped from a bat to human beings, which may be why people are finding the cases eerily similar.The film is fast-paced and interesting, under the circumstances, but it veers toward blatant pro-vaccine propaganda in the final minutes. Watch as the protagonists rejoice at the arrival of a simple, sniffable vaccine which will save all of humanity!",Contagion
108,anselmdaniel,A scientific thriller,7,6 June 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Contagion is a medical thriller movie that premiered in 2011. The movie is directed by Steven Soderbergh and written by Scott Z. Burns. The movie features an ensemble cast of Marion Cotillard, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kate Winslet. A new virus called MEV-1 has spread like wildfire across the world with a mortality rate in the 20s. The characters in this movie must react to the global pandemic and find a way to stop the spread of the virus.Contagion is a slow thriller. There are no gun fights or large action sequences. The movie uses the slow burning virus to offer introspective into how a society would be affected by a catastrophic virus. This introspective and view into various parts of society is the primary draw of this movie. There are no action set-pieces but rather human drama and a reflection on how a society may act with a devastating plague.Contagion does well in its presentation of a virus that collapses society. The movie takes place chronologically as the virus spreads and personnel across the world are contacted to combat the virus. This presentation is authentic and realistic enough in its portrayal. I felt that the movie does play the virus' spread realistically. The science described in this movie is adequate and it makes for the movie becoming authentic.Jude Law's character of Alan Krumwiede is a realistic character that is based on many conspiracy theorists that exist in the world. This character is frighteningly realistic as the character dispenses with logic to use the situation of the virus to his benefit. There are many people that utilize what Alan Krumwiede does to influence people in the world for profit. This character is one of the most terrifying in the movie as he does much more damage to the world than actually helping.There are some strange endings for the stories in this movie. For the story that centers around Dr. Leonora Orantes, played by Marion Cotilliard, she investigates the origins and index patient of the MEV-1 pathogen. Once she does identify the index patient, she is kidnapped and held in order to retrieve the vaccine early. This story ended with Dr. Leonora Orantes rushing away from the airport upon realizing the vaccines provided to the village were placebos. This ending for this story felt anti-climactic. It ultimately made me feel that the story did not need to exist the way it did in the movie.I would recommend 'Contagion'. This is a solid medical thriller that attempts to be a realistic movie.Grade: B",Contagion
109,virek213,Going Viral (Quite Literally),10,25 September 2011,"The fears and realities of global viruses have always been in existence since travel was basically invented; but with the explosion of all kinds of technology and modes of transportation, those fears and realities have exploded. Even as far back as 1918, a virulent strain known as the Spanish flu killed 800,000 people in the United States alone, and as many as eighteen million more across the world. In our time, such things as bird flu, swine flu, SARS, and H1N1 have put health officials in all corners of the world on edge, especially when it is found out that the strains often develop immunities to the very vaccines we use to treat them. This is the subject dealt with in CONTAGION, a solid medical science fiction/suspense docudrama that has a degree of realism fueled by a combination of fact and speculation.Like more than a few disaster epics of the 1970s, CONTAGION puts a large cast of all-stars in an insightful, disturbing, and highly charged situation as an unnamed virus, which begins its deadly spread throughout the world as the result of an innocuous occurrence involving a female executive (Gwyneth Paltrow) in Hong Kong spreads into America, infecting just a few people at first, but pretty soon exploding into a health crisis the likes of which no country has ever seen. Laurence Fishburne and Kate Winslet are the doctors based out of CDC headquarters in Atlanta who try to develop the appropriate vaccines for this strain, which, like so many flu bugs, has a genetic code to it seemingly meant to ward off any kind of medicine applied to it. Marion Cottilard is the French doctor sent by the World Health Organization (WHO) to Hong Kong to track the exact origin of the flu. Jude Law portrays a conspiracy blogger who contends that the CDC and governments all over the world have the antidote in their hands but are not willing to share it so as to cash in on the deaths of what eventually turn out to be tens of millions of people. Matt Damon portrays Paltrow's grieving husband who has to stand watch over his two motherless children who might be infected, even though he himself already has the right amount of antibodies to avoid catching the strain.While there have been more than a few ""virus/disease"" films over the years, CONTAGION seems to be the most realistic of the bunch, and, as a result, probably the most frightening. The tendency to have the entire cast go into hysterics over people dropping dead like flies all around is wisely avoided by director Steven Soderbergh, whose credits include ERIN BROCKOVICH and TRAFFIC. Instead, he opts for a docudrama-like approach, with numerous sequences of hand-held camera movements that make the drama seem as realistic as possible without dipping into technique for technique's sake. The situation is highly realistic, as anyone who has studied the history of previous viral epidemics will easily attest to; not only are such pandemics possible today, they are practically inevitable when taken into account the way technology and travel have evolved, and given the everyday habits of people that can lead to viruses being spread around without anyone knowing about it until it has already happened to them.Instead of being another scary Hollywood shocker (though it is definitely scary), CONTAGION largely succeeds at putting up a plausible scenario for an infectious disease mutating into a worldwide problem in which a cure can't come fast enough. Furthermore, it also urges us to think about how the entire world's population has become so interdependent on others in times of crises, such as viral epidemics of the kind depicted in this film.",Contagion
110,DonFishies,"Incredibly disappointing, even with the talent involved",6,30 August 2011,"I was taken off guard when I first watched the trailer for Contagion. It looked like a crazy, off-the-rails thriller that was genuinely terrifying in its depiction of something too close to reality. When I got passes for an advanced screening last week, I had to contain my excitement. With Steven Soderbergh at the helm of a plethora of Oscar-winning/nominated talent, how could I possibly go wrong?A deadly virus has been discovered after multiple deaths begin surfacing around the world. As various members of the CDC and WHO race to find a cure, the world stands at the brink of a rising epidemic. While some are safe, others must do everything they can to avoid infection, or risk the fatal consequences.It may sound vague, but with so many characters and story lines going on at once, it is slightly difficult to nail down a synopsis without giving too much away. The film takes the approach of giving us the events on a day-to-day structure, showing how quickly and destructively stretches and mutates. Characters drop in and out to give us varying points of view of the effects of the virus, whether it be from an almost random citizen, a doctor on ground zero, or the scientists in the lab. We learn early on that no one is safe, and the film pulls no punches letting you know that sentiment again and again. While I was a little flabbergasted at the almost ludicrous amount of montages early in the film, it became clear exactly what kind of slick look Soderbergh intended for the picture. Depending on the location, the colour scheme modifies and reinvents itself. Some scenes look simply stunning in their production values, making a big budget Hollywood project look like a down and dirty, gritty amateur indie. Soderbergh has never been easily classified, and with this film, his first major motion picture since Ocean's Thirteen, he maintains and furthers his enigmatic nature. The pounding 1980s synth score was a nice and bewildering touch too, but I would have expected nothing less.Despite what the trailers and some of my early praise would have you believe, Contagion is actually a slow and meticulous film that is only partially thrilling. Yes, there is a panicked tone that carries the film for a good portion – one that frequently veers into claustrophobia as it dawns on the characters and the audience themselves just how widespread and devastating the virus is – but this tone never seems right. It jumps and fluctuates, disappearing almost entirely in some instances, and overdoing it in others. It seems completely unable to settle on any one ideal, and as a result, feels very all over-the-place. It saddens me to say it, considering what a master filmmaker Soderbergh truly is, but the film starts unraveling the moment it starts and never seems to be able to find its footing. But I think this can also be blamed on the script by Scott Z. Burns. He partnered with Soderbergh before and gave us the moderately entertaining The Informant!, but he suffers here by building a complex, dense and incredibly verbose narrative around a mere nugget of a good idea. Instead of developing the idea into the thought-provoking and horrifying vision we are meant to take from everything we have been shown, we are given a cross-section of stories that intersect at points and fail to come to any sort of fruition. By the time the film comes to a close, after more than a handful of screeching halts and asinine character motivations and reactions, I just found myself asking what the point of it all was. There is some heavy handed satire buried within the picture, as is a treatise on some disturbing realities of the healthcare system worldwide. But outside of these vague notions, it all feels like a huge build-up to nothing. It feels like Burns and Soderbergh simply stopped caring after the basic idea stage was completed. And if they do not care about what is happening, then why should we?And really, with all the jargon and technical terminology being thrown around, did they really need to talk down to the audience on more than one occasion? I am by no means a genius, but I felt kind of offended that the film found the need to hint and then spell things out entirely for me.While it was initially impressive to see such a diverse group of actors in roles of varying importance (including Canada's own Enrico Colantoni in a fairly substantial role), sadly there is no real time for any one actor to really make something of their role. No one drops the ball thankfully (they let the film do that for them), but at the same time, no one seems like they are putting any substantial effort in either. Singling any one actor out is practically unfair, because there are no standouts. I realize this is a very ensemble based film, but even the most hardened examples of this type of film have one character that the audience finds unforgettable. This film does not have this character in any capacity. And for such a great pool of Oscar-calibre talent, this is the most disappointing and disheartening element of all. While I went into Contagion with excitement, I came out let down. For what little the film actually has going for it, it just seems like it all went to waste (including the absolutely shocking death that is ruined by the trailers). Whether it wanted to be a paranoia-driven thriller, a not so subtle satire, or just an exercise in fear, Contagion fails on all counts. It is overly slow, and at the worst of times, incredibly boring. You are better off watching the trailer on loop and imagining just how much better the film looks, than it actually is. 6/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",Contagion

I've always enjoyed films that challenge my expectations, but am equally pleased by a disaster film that delivers good performances and as a bonus, perhaps a little social criticism with it. This film is called Contagion, and concerns global human behavior in the 21st Century,how much we are interconnected with one another even as something happens on another continent that ultimately impacts us. This held my interest from start to finish, and although with cameo star turns tossed in fairly rapidly, one tends to get into the star name game it delivers on its promise, and if you hear someone cough the morning after you've seen the film--you're apt to think back to all the doorknobs you fingered in the last 24 hours.",Contagion

It's truly incredible how many things in this movie come to fruition nearly a decade later. It's a testament to the writer, director, and most of all the scientists who were consulted for this movie.The film itself is fascinating and fast-moving. Bolstered by an all-star cast, the movie is brutally realistic and unflinching in its bleak view of how quickly a virus can spread throughout populations. Matt Damon anchors the cast and keeps the human drama at the forefront. All of the science used in the film is very accurate and also very easy for anyone to understand. Contagion is a tense, brilliant thriller which isn't the typical three act movie, but a more focused look at the scary potential of a global pandemic.",Contagion

Most people suffer from it for no more than a few days and then go on with their normal lives. What would happen though if we were met with a more serious strain? One with a higher mortality rate and even higher contagion factor? This film tells such a tale. Starting as patient zero is admitted to the hospital with unknown ailments, and going on from there, getting worse at an alarming rate. This is one of the best things about this film - the way the sickness progresses is more than believable and sometimes even too close for comfort. It is not impossible to believe how the people respond to it and the actions they are willing to do to be able to survive.What works against it in my eyes is the appearance of a plethora of big time actors and actresses, where it really does not need them. It feels like the directors didn't feel too sure about the film and tried to apply the age old trick of adding known faces in hopes to improve the film (it never works, and in this film it makes it worse by pulling the attention from the backing story).Add to that the final minutes were unnecessary - the film could have done (and in my opinion should have done) without them and you get to the final result: a very good film which is hindered by just two problems, but rather drastic ones at that.8 out of 10 needles in a haystack",Contagion

It's a rare film I must say that dares to take an ensemble cast, and go the whole hog of creating an epidemic. The film has Matt Damon, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Marion Cotillard, Gwyneth Paltrow and many others. This implies that this is a script that convinced so many stars to be a part of it. So the script is great in itself. What makes it greater is the way it is directed. As a good director, Steven Soderbergh takes this script and adds pace making it a thriller than a medical autopsy of an epidemic.Yes, I must say it's a thriller and that's the genre of this film. It thrilled me from the word go and made me sit the very end and even after it's over it made me ponder. It actually gave me a lump in my throat. Kudos, to all those involved in making this and I rate this as one of the very important films for doctors and patients above the normal film viewers.Also, I stay in Hong Kong currently so I can relate to this film. I have seen, the MTR, the ferry and those streets that are shown in this film and actually felt very happy. But from Hong Kong to the USA and meanwhile citizens of other countries should be aware of any epidemic. There was SARS, there was Ebola, and now there is MERS and ZIKA now. We do not know their origins and the investigation is on and in future, there shall be more such epidemics if we are not careful.This film just acts as a mirror in showing to us, what life can be like if we are not just doing the right things. One person's carelessness, can cause a lot of damage.

I didn't find it realistic at all especially since we have gone through one recently with H1N1 and we have all seen first hand how quickly the CDC can work. If this movie wasn't about realism then it should have been about interesting characters but it wasn't about that either. Though I like most of the actors in this movie and their acting the parts that they were given to play were poorly done at best and worst at most. The only really flushed out character was Matt Damon. The worse character was poor Judd Law, what in God's name were they smoking when they created his character.

I really appreciated that while the breakdown of social order is a part of the backdrop of the movie, it is not the dominant theme, which would have been a disappointing though not surprising way for the writers to go.I also thought it was interesting that because of the way the movie draws from an ensemble cast, none of the big names in the movie dominate the way you might expect such big names to.

I was prompted to review that title and I noticed a goodly amount of reviewers stating that this was a far superior movie, so I gave it a chance. It barely held my attention, and not because I am the kind of person that only enjoys fast moving films. I am a huge fan of the more cerebral films out there like Ex-Machina and Under The Skin and Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless mind to name a few. While this film did a vastly better job on the science, it lacked a soul to me. I did not care when characters died, or fell ill.

For me - Contagion was one long ER episode, and that's a big compliment.The story is compelling and interesting, and shows a very realistic picture of human behavior is the described situations. Everything is relatable and easy to follow. While not too original, it's fun to watch and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Unlike what the audience might think in the beginning - finding the life saving vaccine to the plague described doesn't end the film, but rather only starts another aspect of it.As for the ending - it as a nice wrap up, finally showing us the origin of the problem - but I felt it lacked a twist.

This movie basically details how a virus spreads. The first 4 minutes alone should be a PSA for right now! All the close ups of people touching things - so creepy! Really, everything in this film seems like now - the fear, hate, misinformation, greed, violence, etc. The only thing missing from now is a horrible president who undermines the CDC and WHO. That probably felt like 'fiction' to the filmmakers, but for us living now, it is all too real.
Excellent ending! I also 'liked' the question - who gets the vaccine first? Something to think about if we ever have one for COVID-19.

126,akcenat,Realistic but somehow unremarkable film,7,9 April 2020,"The ""Contagion"" is, mostly, skillfully paced film which stripped disaster movie genre of its usual soap opera-like melodrama, while still exploring the ways how virus spreads. Film often skimps on giving many members of its heavyweight cast (G. Paltrow, J. Law, E. Gould, K. Winslet, M. Damon, L. Fishburne, B. Cranston) suitably rich material to explore, because as good as an impressive parade of stars they are, they are often there just to make technical terms palatable to viewers. It may be important to the story, but it's not the strongest way to connect the audience with the movie (characters). Actually, the lack of detail in the characters begins to wear thin as the story progresses, while (later) subplot in Hong-Kong is dragging the movie (quite a lot) down. Also, conspiracy theory blogger sub-plot prevents the film from providing more insight into public response to the virus. By concentrating on J. Law character that much, movie is robbed of the horrors of the everyday impact of the pandemic. Ultimately, what makes movie so effective and yet somewhat problematic is that it is sleek, efficient and intelligent yet detached and cold. As end result, ""Contagion"" may be a case of excellent addition to the disaster movie genre, but ultimately it will leave you with little besides thinking about current (2020/COVID-19) pandemic.

Indication of dates, chronological orders of events, focuses on circumstances rather than on characters, multiple stakeholders, and etc.Epidemic and cases happening in the movie are disastrous and hopeless, but the narration is very calm and professional. The director avoids the emotional approach but displays the facts surrounding this epidemic in a clear and pungent way. Of course, there are political complications and partisan interpretations on such events, but it is obvious and redundant subject. Soderberg brings new but very relevant-to-present-days factor, memedia and social media. Scientists fight virus itself, but people and governments have to fight against conspiracy and fake news. (or sometimes government can be the source of them all) Spread of contagious disease can really make people cloud their clear judgements, and that's when fake news that looks so real contaminate the sense of community. If I watched this movie a year ago, I would have thought Alan Krumwiede was one-in-a-million psychopath, but now, I see him everyday in every twitter, facebook, and comments in the internet.

I'm sure lesser known actors would have done a competent enough job but this cast does take it to another level. I did feel that there was maybe one too many threads to follow, but it's all done quite well as we see the effect this global virus has on society. There is a bit at the end which explains how the contagion started and I really wish that scene had been missed out; by then it wasn't relevant. Over all though, an interesting film that has some attention-grabbing imagery; you will be washing your hands afterwards (I guarantee it).

136,krachtm,Perhaps more for Soderbergh fans,7,5 August 2012,"When I first heard about Contagion, I too thought it sounded like an Outbreak rehash. However, I became interested again once I saw that it was directed by Soderbergh. I'm not really a Soderbergh fanboy, but I do like his style, and I think that, in some cases, his movies are a bit underrated (though certainly not in the artsy indie world, where he's constantly hailed as a genius). While not one of his strongest movies, this is still quite a well done medical thriller / disaster movie. It's certainly not as focused as Outbreak, which will annoy some people. Contagion is the story of a viral outbreak, not a story of the heroic researchers who try to save the world, even though that's an aspect of the story. So, I would probably characterize Contagion as being closer to Traffic than Sex, Lies, and Videotape.If you like Soderbergh's style, then I'd definitely suggest you check this movie out. If not, then you might still like it, but there's less to recommend. Soderbergh has worked in recent years to establish himself as more of a mainstream director and less of an art-house auteur, but I think he's always going to be more popular with the art-house snobs than the mainstream audiences.",Contagion

AAAAAHHH!!!! As a Minneapolitan, I know as a fact that L.A. style rioting would NOT break out. We Minnesotans are very orderly and tidy. It has become a movie cliché that people take the time to throw all their clothes out into the street before bolting out of town. Again, too tacky for Minnesota. I hate to laugh at such a serious calamity, but the clichés started rolling out about mass chaos and people breaking into banks. Wait, what good is a bunch of money from a bank if you are simply trying to stay alive? It felt cliché, whether the story intended to avoid it or not. Did I start paying attention to how many times I touched my face? Yes I did. It was no where near a couple thousand times a day like Kate Winslet said.All the great actors and a pretty good director only slightly elevated the ""Hot Zone"" freakout attempted by ""Outbreak"" a while back. Replace Dustin Hoffman with Laurence Fishburne. Toss in that younger guy from comedy central. Almost got away with it. There are scenes that are supposed to tug at your heart at the end. For some reason it felt more like a TV movie, somehow less affective. I will give credit to the screenplay for not trotting out strange twists or unrealistic reactions to unfolding events (save for the clothes in the streets). One should be aware that although Matt Damon has adequate screen time, many other actors are featured. Primarily Fishburne, with more urgency in his position as head of the CDC to save the planet than the other major characters. I can't say I've been a big fan of Marion Cotillard, the go-to lady for films such as ""Public Enemies"", ""Inception"", as well as the upcoming ""Dark Knight Rises"". She's pretty, but put her in the same movie as Winslet, and it's two different levels of acting. Damon seems to wander aimlessly, not knowing what to do in the darkest moments of the pandemic. Again, I credit the screenplay for letting Damon's character act normal, not become some crusader.Jude Law gives off a different vibe. His scenes are played a little more over-the-top than the gravitas given to the rest of our characters predicaments. Perhaps he is serving the role of comic foil to take a break from the doom we are feeling. Clocking in at less than two hours, the constant doom facing everybody nevertheless gets stuck in cliché territory. I was getting impatient waiting for the resolution to transpire. The moments of deliberate confusion were better moments to visit, but I guess it would be unfair to confuse the audience too much. So a lot of expected character arcs begin and take their course, only to skip into a different arc. Thankfully, these alternate arcs spares the audience from the hokum shoved down our throats in ""Outbreak"". Almost. I say wait for the DVD.",Contagion

This movie is eye opening, and terrifying. It is a film by Steven Soderbergh, that will wake you up to mass pandemics.The movie begins on day 2 of the pandemic, after Beth Emhoff( Gwyneth Paltrow) returns from Hong Kong, China. She is so sick she ends up in the hospital in Minneapolis, MN. Despite their efforts they are unable to save her, her husband, Mitch( Matt Damon) can't believe it. He not only looses his wife, but also is stepson. This sets off a chain reaction, that gets the attention of the CDC in Atlanta. This virus is a highly contagious that transmits via respiratory droplets, and inanimate objects, dishes, cell phones, chairs, e.t.c.. The name given to this virus is MEA-1. When the CDC realizes they have a mass pandemic, they need to find the original carrier.In Contagion, you see people in panic, hospitals overwhelmed, complete shutdowns, states closing boarders, and finally a vaccine. It is so similar to what is going on now it is scary. When the movie comes to a close, there's a flashback to DAY- 1 of the pandemic. A company in China is clearing the rain forest that is a bat habitat. One bat, finds shelter in a pig farm. The bat drops a piece of infected banana that a pig eats. That pig is taken to the casino in Hong Kong. It is prepared by a chef that lack good hand hygiene. The virus is then transmitted from him to Beth via handshake, setting off the deadly virus.This is a great film with an excellent cast, Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, and a Cameo appearance of CNN's Dr. Gupta.

The worldwide medical community then tries to beat the clock, while finding a cure to this lethal disease, and controlling the panic that spreads faster than the virus itself. The virus also affects the lives of ordinary people, struggling to survive in a society that falls apart. This movie deserves total Oscar consideration for the directing and the writing. Steven Soderbergh knows how to make a classic thriller, and how it can react to audiences. The script provided by Scott Z. Burns is filled with sharp dialogue, dark moments, and a thrilling climax. Also, the casting ensemble is just wonderful. Oscar-winners Marion Cotillard, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kate Winslet, joins with Matt Damon, Jude Law, Lawrence Fishburne, and Elliott Gould to make a smart casting ensemble filled with brilliant and smart performances. This movie is indeed, super freaky. Each moment will either shock you, put you on the edge of your seat, or just plain freak you out. ""Contagion"" is a gruesome and graphic disease film, but this also mostly a well-written, well-directed, and well-acted disease breakout film. Well, audiences will not be really impressed, because they'll might think that this is a stupid and boring film. But cinema lovers will love this movie, saying that it's a thriller with well craft. Steven Soderbergh is truly a talented director, and he has brought one of the most freakiest thrillers ever seen on screen, and this movie will make you scrub your hands with wipes and hand sanitizer throughout.

Right now what's happening in our world is almost exactly shown in this 2011 film. Steven soderberghs direction is awesome. He keeps the thrill and chills throughout the film. Bgm is creepy.
Coming to performances, I liked matt damon's performance more. His act of disbelief of knowing his wife's death was great. I felt sad for kate winslet's character. She was trying to help others but she herself becomes its victim. Laurence fishburne was standard. Marion cottillard looked beautiful. The climax showing the virus transmission was deadly.

That's not to say it is the greatest, but it could've been. Compared to other films in the genre, say ""I Am Legend"", ""28 Days Later"" and its sequel, and Wolfgang Petersen's ""Outbreak"", ""Contagion"" is the most downbeat, grim and most importantly, chilling of them all.Soderbergh rounds up an all-star cast - Matt Damon, Marion Cotillard, Jude Law, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet and Gwyneth Paltrow - as different characters intertwined with the pandemic - a storytelling method similar to Soderbergh's own ""Traffic"". It's just as gripping and effective here, as Scott Z. Burns' script leaves little room for dramatics and more on the effects of the pandemic, directly and indirectly.While the actors do a credible job, notably Law, Winslet, Fishburne and Damon, some of their characters are underwritten. Had Burns wrote more dialogue, or Soderbergh kept more juicy dramatic scenes in, it would've been a classic. There were some really great scenes and really interesting questions posed - ethics of personal problems against responsibility, fear being more dangerous than the actual pandemic itself, questioning and accusing the government for taking financial advantage of the situation - yet these themes are scraped upon without going deeper. At least the atmosphere of the film is grim and chilling enough to be highly engaging.On technical points, Cliff Martinez scores an excellent, tension-filled low-key electronic score that hits all the right notes at the right moments; Soderbergh (as Peter Andrews) frames the scenery perfectly (nice to see a movie in a long time that is all steady-cam and not shaky-cam) and gives some scenes an ominous feel about it. The editing is fluid and keeps the film moving coherently although the film is relatively slow-paced.In short, as a thriller it is effectively creepy and disturbing and will no doubt leave some people paranoid for some time. But it could've been so much better. At least Soderbergh had the great idea of making this virus movie as realistic and close-to-home as possible, offering up a different and unique movie of its kind. Although if there was an extended cut needed for a movie, this one is it.We're often told that some of the viral diseases like SARS and H1N1 are deadly and will kill us, but in truth the media's exaggeration of the danger scares people, and this causes fear. Too much fear is far more dangerous than any virus in the world because fear causes people to panic and thus do irrational things. I think this is the film's main point and for that it succeeds strongly.Overall rating: 78/100",Contagion
142,Med-Jasta,Scarier than originally intended,10,1 November 2021,"I watched this in November 2021 and it's pretty scary how accurate this is to Corona. Of course not the virus itself but the way people react to the pandemic. And of course an exaggerated version. The only thing that really got me and I think that the screen writer predicted the best was the part that social media would play in the modern age. Jude Law's character was painfully accurate to the social media/conspiracy response to it. Especially the fact that he uses some over the counter supplement or whatever it was and claims that it cured him based off of nothing but his own guess and then everybody is going crazy to get it. Then he is using unrelated cheap tricks to discredit the people whose job it is to fight this. And going after the people that aren't political and trying to do what's right for everybody? And then everything he says about being anti vaccine... Wooo...Because all of this pandemic stuff has happened in human history and pretty much plays out the same way every time. As much as we like to think we're unique and that this has never happened to anyone before, we're not. But the social media aspect is a new piece on the table. Of course people always thought crazy stuff, some people refused the Polio vaccine as well, but the internet spreads it much quicker and allows these people to mobilize and to choose what they want to hear. Just like everything related to Jude Law. His weird tooth was a nice touch. Subtly making him less attractive and a little creepy. But he's a good enough actor that he can do that with his face.If anyone is sensitive to all the Corona stuff going on you should wait to see this movie. Or never even watch it. It was also very fitting that Gwyneth Paltrow was patient zero. Since she is no stranger to spreading misinformation herself. And I'm not gonna lie, it was pretty satisfying to see her die. I don't even really hate her nearly as much as a lot of other people. But I choose not to read about her crap so I don't think about it when I watch movies like this.But anyway now to the actual movie. It's very good. Well told and quick. Classic Soderbergh. I also like that he played the part of the guy cheating with Paltrow. That's a good director cameo. Great cast as Soderbergh always does. He really puts a large amount of A listers in there. I don't know how he does it. If they take a pay cut or he's just that great to work with. And they're not just A listers, they're good. I really, really love Laurence Fishburne. I'm always happy to see him in something. He's not only good but he brings an energy or a warmth that only the greats have. From this to the Hannibal show to Dream Warriors he naturally adds something to a role that can't be defined.When the movie started off with ""Day Two,"" I thought it was a little weird. Soderbergh does little weird things like that all the time but I thought that we didn't need to see day one, so whatever. But then you get that kick in the balls right at the end showing day one and how it started and then it all made sense. I love that deforestation was essentially the cause. Causing animals to mix together that shouldn't be together. Or maybe it was anti meat. Either way human interference with animals. So we kinda did it to ourselves? I don't know exactly but maybe there isn't an exact message or even a message. But that's the way to do it. Just to get you thinking. And how simple it happened was really the scary part. Actually I guess the message was: butchers, WASH YOUR HANDS. Haha.Also this movie looked amazing. I watched it in 2K and it looked great. I can only imagine it in 4k. Sodenbergh (I'm a big fan, if can't you tell) jumped on digital really fast. He's really one of the few A listers of his generation to do it. Of course the hipster generation that still listens to vinyl still uses film. But Sodenbergh knows what's best and it really shows. The clarity and the colors were something you don't get on film. Made it stand out and look much more realistic as digital does. And the music was really good. Kinda electronic and classical. But did it's job of fitting the scenes perfectly.",Contagion
143,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Another master piece of cinema from Soderbergh.,8,11 December 2011,"Steven Soderbergh has long been one of the best directors working in the industry and a large part of that is due to his immense diversity. This is a guy who is constantly challenging himself, someone who can make the wildly unique The Informant! in the same year that he makes The Girlfriend Experience. He'll jump from the most mainstream projects to the most independent ones within less than a year and Contagion is further proof of his desire to always be doing something new. Going in I thought that this was going to feel done before, as pandemic movies have come along quite often, but I was surprised at the unique approach it took to taking on every level of this kind of virus.It's amazing that Soderbergh, along with writer Scott Z. Burns, were able to encompass practically every facet of this kind of pandemic into a two hour film. If this had been a mini-series I think it would have had potential to be one of the best ever, but their ability to condense the large scope they have here into this kind of running time is pretty impressive to say the least. A lot of this comes with the help of their very talented cast to portray dense characters without getting a lot of screen time.Burns and Soderbergh use each character as an important display of a certain aspect of this pandemic and the actors all do a remarkable job of hitting their marks and leaving an impression. It's difficult to do so much with such little time but thanks to Soderbergh assembling this caliber of a cast there isn't a note that feels under-developed, which could have happened very easily if there weren't the actors to bring this level of gravity to their characters. Laurence Fishburne takes on things from the most internal level, Kate Winslet shows us the life of a soldier on the front line, Marion Cotillard gives us a look into the international status of the crisis, Jennifer Ehle displays the medical side, Jude Law represents the internet and media and Matt Damon grounds the picture with the basic human struggle that's at the core. They all manage to bring a lot with little time and every actor impressed me to some level.Most impressive for me though was Matt Damon, who stole the show with one of his best performances in years. I would have loved to have seen a separate film just showing his character in this crisis and how he has to deal with all of the things that are thrown at him. This character was so interesting and empathetic for me and I have to give a lot of credit for that to Damon. He brought a world of emotion and humanity to this character and without him I think the film would have been a lot more cold and distant. He made it feel especially real to me.Like I said, I think a mini-series would have been able to give us a much more intricate look into these complex characters, but as it goes for the film we are given just enough depth with them without taking any of the spotlight away from the real star; the virus itself. I can't think of a film that has dealt with a pandemic like this in such intricate detail, from patient zero all the way through to the end of it all, and the fact that it kept me hooked and fascinated the entire time surprised me quite a bit. Soderbergh has a knack for sucking me into a story right away and he absolutely did it again here, utilizing his unique flare for visuals and brought me right into it. I really can't think of a director who would have been better suited for this.The most impressive aspect of the film is the one that all of it's fans talk about, how real they make this seem. It's not some random outbreak that comes from nowhere and spreads wildly and presents itself very much as a film that you can sit and watch and never think about it being a real-life situation. Instead it hits at the home, with Soderbergh giving it an almost documentary-feel that gives you the sensation that maybe you should think twice before taking a step outside your door. There were several times where I found myself going to bite my nails or scratch my face and making the decision against it instead. That, in and of itself, is quite the achievement and something that I've never experienced with a film like this.",Contagion

This soon becomes a pandemic and the start of a race against time to find a vaccine.Starts well but then loses its way.

146,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,Soderbergh's ecocatastrophe thriller pins the blame on habitat destruction and Gwynneth Paltrow,7,12 August 2012,"In a brief, wordless epilogue we see how a bulldozer knocking down palm trees in the boonies of South China could (conceivably) touch off a global pandemic that ends up killing millions, starting, I'm sorry to say, with Gwynneth. I mention this first because ""Contagion"" is about as suspenseful and involving as it wants to be for the first hour or so, then gets lost in a thicket of dead-end subplots and unengaging characters--so if you're tempted to bail, don't miss this last scene. GP plays a freewheeling executive who parties at a Macao casino, hooks up with an old boyfriend in Chicago, then returns to her family in Minneapolis, thereby spreading a deadly virus halfway around the globe. Matt Damon gives a solid performance as her stay-at-home husband, but most of his scenes after the halfway mark seem like standard disaster-movie filler--foraging in a looted supermarket, queueing up for emergency rations, getting turned back at a sealed border (of Wisconsin no less!). Then things really slow down when the focus shifts to Larry Fishburne as an embattled bureaucrat and Jude Law as a Drudge-type blogger who's peddling an herbal cure on the internet. Elliott Gould is welcome as an outside-the-box research scientist (it's a long way from meatball surgery to fetal-bat cell lines); Kate Winslet has a grim little part as a CDC researcher, and Marion Cotillard gets stuck in one of the dead-end subplots. Kickass CDC virologist Jennifer Ehle and her solemn assistant Demitri Martin pretty much carry the second half of the film; the sly little grin she flashes while she drives home from the lab is pure cinema magic. Final grade: eight stars for the first sixty minutes and the last five (watch for the corporate logo on the 'dozer; Mother Gaia is sending us a message, accd'g to Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns); six stars for the rest.",Contagion
147,shanayneigh,"Amazing film, before and during covid-19",9,31 October 2021,"I love this movie. I must have watched it 3-4 times, one highlight was watching it with a doctor friend years ago. I've rewatched it now for the first time since the outbreak of covid-19. It's quite amazing how prescient it is.There are only two things that it underestimates:Firstly, tinfoil hat antivaxxers with a PhD from Facebook University, of which there are plenty in these covid times, are virtually absent from the movie. The filmmakers and their scientific advisors clearly didn't foresee the level of vaccine denial which occurred in real life.The second point follows from the first. The one character which represents the group above, played by Jude Law, is a simple blogger. Perhaps ten years ago when this movie was made, it seemed ludicrous that the antivaxxer alternative bogus medicine movement would be lead by politicians on the highest levels - spearheaded by the orange buffoon impervious to science or even basic facts - and their idiotic cheerleading squad in certain mainstream media, who now have the blood of untold thousands on their hands.But even before the outbreak of covid-19 this was a fantastic film. They could have taken the easy way out and made it into a basic survival story with Matt Damon caught in the breakdown of civilization, shot gun and all. But instead they focused on the scientific aspect. Sure there are some shortcuts, but it isn't a documentary.",Contagion
148,reb-warrior,Eerie and surreal given what is happening today. Too many characters making it hard to follow at times. Plot holes. Didn't care for the stunt casting.,7,12 April 2020,"A pandemic breaks out and healthcare workers, government officials try to find a vaccine, determine how it started, and deal with trying to organize citizens.I have to say there is a lot of similar things in this movie compared to what is happening now with the COVID-19 pandemic. A lot of familiar words and sentences: ""don't touch your face,"" ""it can be on surfaces,"" ""it's a novel virus,"" ""being contagious without having symptoms,"" ""incubation period,"" the virus is named MEV-1 similar to COVID-19. Probably a lot more that I'm forgetting. It's eerie and surreal.I thought I had a low opinion of humanity, but the movie-makers appear to have an even lowers one. For example attacking pharmacists, setting liquor stores on fire, breaking in and shooting people, basically acting like wild animals. People going to their most base instincts as they panic. But right now in this real-world pandemic, I don't see this behavior. Nor do I in other countries. I mean yeah, there are some bad actors, but they are just a few in comparison with the overall population.Hoo boy, I could not stand that Alan. The conspiracy theorist nut who profited off of selling a fake cure at the same time as casting suspicion on the CDC and others. I'll leave it up to you to figure out who he reminds you of. There's probably more than one possibility.They got a lot of things right. Empty shelves in the grocery stores, quick sell out on hand sanitizer, people going around with masks, and homemade plastic things for protection, suspicion of the CDC, suspicion of WHO, a conspiracy theorist, panicked people, political interruptions. They totally missed the toilet paper thing tho. And the price gougers that bought everything out in order to resell and make a profit off a crisis. Also, they missed essential workers, such as grocery clerks being hailed as heroes.There is a lot of stunt casting and plot holes. For example, Kate Winslet's character is killed early on. I thought she was going to be a bigger part. The main characters are really Mitch Emhoff, played by Matt Damon and Ellis Cheever, played by Laurence Fishburne. One of the plot holes is with Leonora Orantes, who takes off after discovering her kidnapper was giving a placebo for his village. We never find out what happened. I think there were too many characters to be honest, that it was hard at times to keep track of who was who.There are some people that may not like the ending. Which shows how the virus started and spread. Listen, we can't pretend a thing didn't happen. We need to know so that the same thing doesn't happen again. Hiding history is how bad things happen over and over again. That being said, it doesn't mean we should vilify an entire people, sometimes getting the wrong people mixed up. It's not helpful. There will always be dum-dums in society. We need to raise ourselves above that nonsense.The movie-makers must have mixed feelings. Obviously, no one would want a pandemic to happen in real life. But this movie, which is almost like a warning vindicates them in many ways. I gave it a 7/10. It would have been an 8, but with too many characters making it hard to follow the story at times, plot holes, and stunt casting it lost a point with me. After all, this is a movie review.",Contagion
149,Meven_Stoffat,"There's an evil virus that's threatening all mankind, not state of the art, a serious state of the mind...",8,15 September 2011,"My review's title comes from Iron Maiden's 1996 song, ""Virus"", in which Blaze Bayley sings of a life threatening virus. That line is followed by ""The murderers, the backstabbers, the two-faced elite, a menace to society, a social disease..."". The ""virus"" in the song evidently takes in a double meaning. And what's really odd is that once I left the cinema at the end, I realized how well the song fits the movie. In Contagion, the main force of the film is people's perception of fear, just like the song.Over the film's opening black screen, we hear a cough. The film's first shot then appears, and we see a very miserable looking Gwenyth Paltrow. Boy, she has clearly had better days. Sadly, this is the best she looks in the entire film. Even adding to the sadness, the film's subsequent subtitle reads ""Day 2"". It does indeed get worse; a number of people all the world have this virus. One even gets hit by a bus, he's so controlled by the virus.The person most affected is Mitch Emhoff. His wife has returned from a trip, and has contracted the virus while in China. She dies right as soon as she is taken to the hospital, and the son soon follows. Meanwhile, a blogger attempts to come up with a scheme to get more information from the CDC about the virus, The CDC keeps track of the virus, tracking where it goes, a Swiss worker in China is held to stay in a village where the population of living and healthy people is minuscule due to the sickness... Ad the tension explodes, thus only building to an unforgettable conclusion.Soderbergh has managed to do here what most movies nowadays don't. He dares to go outside the typical comfort zone of viewers and give us a story that begins right in the middle of it all. Normally this would annoy me, as I like to have things developed before the story begins to take off. But here it's masterfully done, to the point where more shocking secrets shout the virus get revealed. And the film's coda is... Well, let's just say, jaw-dropping.Another thing that makes this a special one is it's lack of a climax. You may argue as to whether or not this film had a climax, but, to me, the film was anti-climatic for a reason. Because really, in the event of a real epidemic or pandemic, the vaccine never is really the end... One place a vaccine emerges, another the virus manages to take over. Like I said, the major force in the movie is fear. It's everywhere in the film. One person fears for his village because of the fact that there's very few healthy left. Another person fears because he only has his daughter and her boyfriend. Two people fear to then point where they go on a rampage, searching for a possible cure. The fear itself is like a virus, leading to the decay of mankind. To use another line from the Iron Maiden song, ""Watching beginnings of social decay, looting and sneering at life's disarray...""In addition, the acting is fantastic. Matt Damon gives a stellar performance as Mitch. This may be his first believable performance since The Departed... He puts so much emotion in the role, and inn general just really gives it his all. Jude Law, Marion Cotillard and Kte Winslet are all fantastic in the movie as well. The film's cinematography is nothing short of stellar too. Shot in the Red Epic camera in 1:78.1, the film is essential IMAX viewing too, as not only did it take up most of the screen, the look of the movie also is something quite different as well.In short, Contagion is a masterfully done thriller, a total recommend, and will leave you thinking long after the credits have rolled. If you want a good movie among a recent s--t storm of bad movies, do check this movie out!""Watching beginnings of social decay...""OVERALL: 10/10PROS: Beautifully shot,, well written and amazingly acted and directed, Contagion is the provoker of the year for sure. you will be discussing this film with who you saw it with for hours after you have walked out after the cinema.CONS: None to speak of, though those expecting a conventional narrative or action packed film may want to see another film instead.",Contagion
150,yris2002,"Tense, realistic, paranoid drama, featuring a top-notch cast",7,24 September 2011,"""Contagion"" , since from the title, leaves little to imagination as far as the plot: it's the story of the outbreak of a tremendous virus threatening the whole world health. Not new, indeed, but what is interesting above all is the realistic, almost documentary style chosen by the director. Criticised for being impersonal, in my opinion this style allows him to explore the subject from different points of view, along multiple and intertwining story lines: the point of view of science and medicine, the political, sociological worries, the exploitation by the media, the pharmaceutical involvement, each of them carrying its own interest, which does not always correspond with the interest of the population. The result is a well studied and well elaborated handling of the theme. Of course, also the common human side is not neglected, on the contrary we feel panic and paranoia increase, as the number of infected people jumps from a few cases to thousands and more. The cast is of high range, and definitely help increase the quality of the movie. Whether you like the movie or not, you will certainly be more aware when you touch anything, and you'll probably wash your hands more often! And if you are a germophobe, do not see it!",Contagion
151,troyputland,A tense drama that cares more about statistics than audience/character relationship.,7,20 January 2016,"Contagion is a slow burner, a mildly tense thriller about an unknown disease that spreads as fast as wildfire. We're spoon fed with information from different sources, from Kate Winslet's support aid helper to Laurence Fishburne's CEO of a company who're attempting a cure. On ground zero there's Jude Law's 'tell it as it is' blogger and Matt Damon as the only representative with any feelings. And here lies the problem with Contagion; it may have kept my attention for the duration, but I didn't really care who lived and who died, bar Matt Damon and his daughter. This film feels like could have been a documentary in its early drafts, and the team behind it decided to take a different route.",Contagion
152,deepfrieddodo,A* For Accuracy,8,31 January 2021,"Having watched during the COVID-19 pandemic, the accuracy of this film released almost 10 years previous is eerie. Contagion does not skip on the science, and every scene was like a dramatic recap of press conferences in reality. The level of detail the filmmakers went into is phenomenal, and they cannot be credited enough. Even beyond the science of a virus, the human reaction is spot on, notably Jude Law's character, a convincing keyboard warrior.The cast is packed with A-listers, and although there are a lot of characters, they all have a relatively compelling arc to follow. Evidently it is a big budget film, and the use of sporting venues as medical centres, etc., is perfectly life-like. Obviously, this fictional virus is a lot more aggressive than what is being witnessed currently, but it would be a very dull film if this wasn't the case, and it does well not to jump the shark and doesn't succumb to the urge to make the virus something truly cinematic.Having said all this, and whilst I don't think for a virus film it could be improved, I do feel that living through something spookily similar does desensitise the audience. You're compelled by the accuracy, but the shocks of the progression and decline of society are hugely lessened when they're lived through every day.",Contagion
153,pkpera,Will be watched more this year than when released - just like was with 1984,7,23 March 2020,"Somehow George Orwell's famous novel 1984 came to mind. As majority, I read it in 1984 (written, published first in 1948) . And I dare to say: both were prophetic in some extent, or in other words predicted some global bad events - well, most likely near to max what is even possible to imagine.About movie self: it is incredibly hard task to make movie like this. Too much locations, people, interconnections, and so on. My biggest complain is character played by Marion Cotillard - she played probably key character of movie, but we knew almost nothing about her. Was always somehow aside, except few scenes, like those when was teacher during her captive days. Really should add few minutes to show little more about her. Btw. interesting is that Marion Cotillard was listed first in end credits, while not present at all here, at actor list on movie start page ????OK, there was no clear main actor/character in this movie, and that's good, considering complexity of events. Stellar cast indeed, who did great job. For me Jude Law and Matt Damon were best.Direction was quite good too, and yes, nobody can accuse Steven Soderbergh to use cliche.

154,Ryan_MYeah,"Made with the best intentions, but I was expecting a lot more from it.",5,17 February 2012,"Steven Soderbergh is a very versatile director who is constantly challenging himself with new projects. This time, he takes a stab at a 28 Days Later style thriller with Contagion. If only he had done as good a job as Danny Boyle. Stephen Mirrione's film editing is honestly the best aspect of the film, and a lot better than it deserved. He tries his hardest to make sense of the uneven and confusing script, and make the most of the talented cast. Jude Law and Jennifer Ehle stand out amongst the all star ensemble, but Soderbergh's direction feels misguided at times, and despite an intriguing first 70 minutes, things take a turn for the boring and undercooked in the film's third act.

Led by an all-star cast the film portrays the world gripped in terror by a lethal virus that horribly claims it's victims and the eventual chaos societies undergo as authorities, experts and civilians alike come to terms and grapple with the deadly killer in their midst. Eerily prescient, the movie foretold what the world would experience with the current Corona Virus problem: face masks, quarantines, ghost towns, social distancing, riots, conspiracy theories and the search for a vaccine. With its slow, spare, dark and grimy approach the film comes across as a quiet and languid unravelling of a global tragedy with no end in sight.

On one hand, it might have only been so effective because of its real world parallels, on the other, there is a lot of science babble that I just wouldn't have known the meaning of this time last year.I think ultimately the paranoia this film carries is earned whether or not you happen to be in the middle of a real pandemic though, there is a real sense of anxiety in knowing anyone could have the virus, and the film knows it and really plays on that fear too. Shots will linger on a door handle after someone has touched it, the frequent montages of the disease spreading make me even more cautious of what I've touched, the soundtrack is amazing, and while I wouldn't say it's directed amazingly throughout, it certainly has its moments.I didn't really care at all about the characters, but then this isn't really a character-focused film so I guess I can't complain...although I couldn't help thinking this could be even better as a miniseries with more time to flesh out the characters. Especially Marion Cotillard's part, which feels kind of pointless to the larger picture. and Matt Damon's story, which features probably the worst performance in the film and is also the only one that isn't directly involved with the attempts to cure or contain the virus, so it could have really benefited from a bit more character development.But all you have to do is look at the news to tell that someone really did their homework when writing this, right down to the virus originating in China and transmitting to humans from a bat. Well bloody done, Scott Z.

The virus spreads worldwide and doctors from the CDC and WHO are committed to finding a cure. Meanwhile panic sets in worldwide.This starts out at Day 2. This is hard to watch with most scenes in the beginning as we see many people worldwide infected and dying, but this is definitely a Must See as we are undergoing similar scenarios with the Covid-19 virus.Notables: Laurence Fishburne as Dr Ellis Cheaver of the CDC, who is unconvinced the virus is a bio-weapon, but Homeland Security liaison Lyle Haggerty (Bryan Cranston) suggests that terrorists are using it like the Avian Flu, but Dr. Cheaver says that the birds are already doing that to us;Marion Cotillard as Dr. Orantes believes Beth's death is the first cause of the virus;Kate Winslet as Dr Mears who believes the virus is being spread by touch;Elliott Gould as Dr Sussman who tells Alan (Jude Law) that he is wrong about the drug companies using the virus to increase profits;Jennifer Ehle as Dr Hextall who lets Dr Cheaver know what they are now dealing with and now a vaccine can be developed.Robert G. Beck as john Neal, Beth's lover who dies from the virus and Mitch is shocked to learn his wife Beth cheated on him during her layover in Chicago;Bryan Cranston as Lyle Haggerty of Homeland Security holds a lottery to give out the vaccine to those born on certain days of the month;Marion Cotillard as Dr. Orantes who is abducted as a hostage until a village can obtain the vaccine.At the end of the movie we see what happened on Day 1, when it all started.Not sure we can learn from this movie to help us to get rid of the Covid-19 virus, but we are waiting for a vaccine as did the people in this story.

161,theinaniloquent,"""Nothing Spreads Like Fear""",6,1 October 2011,"A thriller centered on the threat posed by a deadly disease and an international team of doctors contracted by the CDC to deal with the outbreak.I sat down into the movie theater, popcorn ready, and HIGH, HIGH, HIGH expectations! But I expected way too much. The only reason I'm sure this movie has gotten popular is there is a great set of actors in it ranging from Matt Damon to Laurence Fishburne. The film started off great, showing the spread of the disease from Day 2. But then slowly went downhill with lots of parts where I wanted to leave the theater... But then the film picked up again! The suspense grew and the tension grew and then once again it dropped down. This film is like a roller coaster ride, you expect so much and get half of what you wanted. I would've gave this film 5 stars but the ending saved it. See it with friends for a better experience. 6/10.",Contagion
162,stills-6,Blah,4,20 September 2012,"Speculative mockumentary, social-consciousness motivated afterschool special for adults has at its heart an interesting premise, but sadly does nothing with it. There is nothing special here except for the basic idea, which for some reason was made into a movie. It's given the ""actual"" movie treatment, which makes the lack of action, plot, or characterization rather uncomfortably weak and banal.Some of the sequences have the potential to be compelling drama, but this movie isn't interested in drama. Instead, it's interested in trying to scare the hell out of us by showing just how fragile our existence is, which it does rather clinically. A 500-word article on the subject would have had the same effect.I would have been happy if it had explored the thin line between human civilization and the animal survival instinct. Or the exploration of anything with any sort of depth -- you know, a movie -- might have been nice. I think there were too many slugs in the shotgun here to portray anything with depth. Focusing on two or three of the stories and actually using narrative technique could have turned this into a nifty scientific object lesson. Instead, we are left with a questionable campfire story with little or no actual narrative value.",Contagion
163,talisencrw,Very underrated medical thriller from Soderbergh makes you think!,9,2 May 2016,"I have a special place in my heart for the medical thriller. Looking back, I believe it stems both from being sick a lot when I was a kid, and from really enjoying great ones over the years, like 'Coma' and 'Outbreak'. As well, more recently I remember the panic both my son's mother and I tended to have when our son was born during the SARS epidemic back in 2003. Needless to say, when one of these films comes along, it's only a matter of time before it crosses my path.Director Soderbergh is intelligent enough to really make this material work, going at it from every conceivable angle (and many inconceivable ones!) yet still giving it coherence in a decent runtime (not a Bay-esque three hours) and there's enough star power to keep one's attention. The best kind of review for these sort of films is that it leaves you thinking twice before you have an affair, or even throw out your Kleenex, and that's specifically what Soderbergh's work here does.",Contagion
164,Tcarts76,With the cast involved it should have been much better,7,6 October 2012,"Contagion is a movie with an all-star big name cast collection movie that you would expect should be outstanding. To me it didn't live up to it's cast, or at least, the cast didn't live up to their supposed talent.The story is decent enough. The emergence of a worldwide pandemic that spreads rapidly and is deadly. It has no known cure when it breaks out and the CDC and the World's doctors rush to find a vaccine before panic, riots, and of course the illness itself engulfs the world throwing us into an apocalyptic chaos.Yes, it plays on all the fears we have of sneezing, coughing, sick people spreading their germs, and is probably a great, if not down right affirming movie for germaphobes worldwide. Sounds like a good movie. It was a good movie. Interesting, pretty sophisticated, and well constructed, but for me it had one glaring problem.A cast that includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, and Jude Law, should make this a Oscar worthy movie. It was not the case. Paltrow's character is gone fairly quick, so no great acting there. Matt Damon gives an average if not boring performance, Laurence Fishburne is just OK and devoid of emotion. In fact the only one of this All-star cast was Jude Law playing the part of Alan Krumwiede, an investigative reporter with a conspiracy theory to spread. He was the only one that I think actually tried to act in this one. Sometimes these blockbuster casts just don't work out. Let's face it these people have big egos and if they aren't the main attraction and have to share the limelight it just doesn't work out.That all being said, I think Steven Soderbergh did a pretty good job pulling together all the different intersecting story lines. It was an interesting movie, but occasionally felt like just too many unfolding story lines to totally grab your interest. So for me it's a 7 out of 10.",Contagion
165,pivic,Money unwell spent,2,4 November 2011,"Well, this was pap. Fodder. Nothing. Depressing.The actors behaved like they were actually depressed: very little happened. I'm all for non-Hollywood-esque acting; indeed, I was betting on Soderbergh's helming to be of help, but instead this seems about as failed as ""The Island"".The story is simple: a germ has been released and is quickly spreading. The incubation time is next to nothing, and people start dropping like flies.A bunch of celebs turn up to die, conspire, try to find a vaccine and live.The best part of the film: the soundtrack. The worst part of the film: the rest.I didn't much care for the characters in the film. Some turned up, some vanished, some turned up later. There was very little building of sympathy for the characters, which I felt was really odd considering what kind of film this is. Sure, I liked the callous scientific sense of the WHO researchers, but that quickly delved from being this-might-turn- interesting into sheer bureaucratic dribble, almost like a chemistry lesson: this cell goes in there, and turns that cell...I didn't care much. It was like playing Grand Theft Auto for too long in one go: once you go there, you end up doing stupid stuff, like shooting people or wrecking your car just to get a rise. Watching this film was like that, except you couldn't control any of the characters and they were just...below plain.Not even the conspiracy bit - courtesy of Mr. Jude Law - was captivating, despite seeing him in hefty breathing apparatus which was funny.I must admit: the bit where the kids dance was lovely.

167,ThomasColquith,Mediocre film,5,14 August 2021,"""Contagion"" is a mediocre film for me. It goes exactly as one would expect so there is little suspense and few surprises. The large cast of characters precludes the viewer from caring or learning much about any one of them. The music is grating, the hue is gray - reflecting the mood. All in all a depressing slog as one would expect for a film named ""Contagion"". It was probably a better watch back in 2011 when the content was novel, but now in 2021 it is all rather passé.Of course the film ends with everyone fighting over the vaccine which supposedly saves lives, though it did not have any clinical trials completed or long-term data to prove such alleged better outcomes. How do we know the vaccine doesn't cause antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) as has been seen in Dengue Fever or SARS/MERS research which yields worse outcomes upon exposure to a new strain of the virus. Also, based on the R-0 figures given in the film, the highly contagious virus would have quickly spread around the globe and infected everyone by the time the vaccine was widely distributed, making it moot. People would either survive or die based on their own immune system and genetics. The vaccine would be too late for most.In summary, this is not a film that I would watch again and I sort of regret watching it once. 5/10.",Contagion
168,BillBayard,A little something from a visionary director,8,15 August 2021,"I cannot help but wonder how many more have seen this film closer to now, 2021, than when released in 2011 as it is sadly so much more timely now. I don't recall it being much of a hit a decade ago when I saw it upon its original release and had little memory of it other than Paltrow, which is odd as she is not among my favorite performers. This somewhat uncannily prophetic film has so much more impact today, but is still oddly emotionally uninvolving for some reason. Perhaps that's due to the style in which it is filmed. It almost has a clinical documentary feel to it despite a big and well known cast who all do very well with the always appealing and reliable Matt Damon sort of in the lead. Despite my criticisms, this is a mighty interesting film from beginning to end. It is multiple stories about multiple people, those who help with a pandemic and those who wish to profit off of one; those who do the right thing and those who don't. Thus far (August of 2021), the pandemic in this film is more extreme and rabid in nature than the one we are currently experiencing and I hope that continues to be true. The most memorable moments to me belong to Damon, Paltrow and for me, Marion Cotillard's final scene and the very ending which were the only times it affected me emotionally. Warning: This could be a very disturbing film to some.",Contagion

Kate Winslett is probably the worst of the lot at playing Americans, coming off more like a one-legged pirate (any word with the letter 'r' sounds like ""ARRGH, mately"") than a modern American. 20 minutes after this movie started, I had to take a break from Winslett's grinding voice (which is lovely and soft in her native English accent).

171,ivko,truth in fiction,8,12 March 2020,"This movie is proof that the most terrifying concepts aren't always rooted in monsters and jump scares; sometimes the scariest concepts are based upon the unthinkable but all too possible. As I write this review the world is getting a small dose of the plot of this film. Not as deadly, but still terrifying in its own way.What sticks with me isn't so much the risk of death so much as a vision of society breaking down; the possibility that our solid-seeming civilization could have cracks we don't want to consider. That all the rules we've spent a lifetime learning about how to live alongside one another might go out the window, defeated by something too small to even see.But the movie also offers a glimmer of hope, a sampling of the best humanity has to offer right there next to the worst. For every slimy Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) there are heroes like Dr.Hextall (Jennifer Ehle) or imperfect heroes like Dr. Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) who are fighting to keep society from collapsing in on itself. It's a nice reminder that even in the worst circumstances there are reasons to hold out hope.While not everything would play out exactly as it does in the movie, the director Steven Soderbergh has gone out of his way to try and get the scientific details correct, which both keeps the events from becoming hyperbolic and adds to the chills of the movie since it feels authentic.My only problem with the movie is that, as in real life, sometimes villains get away with their misdeeds. Despite undoubtedly costing many people their lives, one of the characters that got rich exploiting peoples fear and desperation appears poised to escape punishment for their crimes by the end of the film, something that bugs me every time I watch. In my mind I always add a scene at the end where this person suffers a painful and ugly death, which makes me feel much better lol, but that's just me. I'd recommend this film both for its compelling story as well as its accurate description of the life cycle of a pandemic, but be prepared for the general sense of unease it might bring you.",Contagion

173,mirwais-orbit,Soderbergh finally translates and makes Romero accessible,8,9 January 2012,"Back in the late 60's Romero wrote and directed a classic called Night Of Living Dead (1968), the first of his so known ""Dead Hexology"". Romero also stated during the decades that his movies aren't just movies about zombies and that he doesn't make ""zombie"" movies just because people want them, but he does make them when he feels that something needs to be said. That's why his movies has a lot of heavy disguised political connotations because he always believed and tried to alert people that government may be responsible for most of human diseases. And what he tell us about ""disease"" isn't just caused by virus or bacteria, but by everything that surround us and make us sick, including each others.Now Soderbergh cleared up most of what Romero tried to say, but while Romero used allegories and metaphors to do that, Soderbergh was explicit and truly put his finger on it. The results are tragic. The movie is uncomfortable since the first cough and that's the way it is till its end.Soderbergh tried to stay faithful and accurate to reality and he succeeds. He doesn't measure efforts to ease audience from the cruelty of the events. Once again, while at the end of Romero's movies people were scared and thinking ""that may happen"", people finish watching Contagion also scared but thinking ""that happens"". Contagion is not an ordinary horror movie, it's a drama featuring real horror facts, showing that the great danger of the human being are themselves.And that's the way it is: explicit and provocative.I dare you finish watching Contagion and keep thinking that getting a door handle, shaking someone's hand or just scratching your face will continue to be something as banal as they were before watching it.",Contagion

Our accent is rather difficult to do, it has many subtleties. When done dilletente-style it comes out sounding absurd - like Jude's did.

191,JPfanatic93,Shocking substance but overly clinical approach,7,20 October 2013,"Steven Soderbergh's cautionary tale about the dangerous reality that is (and/or could be) a deadly global pandemic and its disastrous effects of human society and sense of morality proves an often harrowing but ultimately overly clinical film. Gwyneth Paltrow returns home from a business trip (which included some secret bedding out of wedlock) and is struck by seizures. Her husband Matt Damon rushes her to a hospital where she soon dies, much to everybody's shock and surprise. Her demise is only the beginning, as the disease that killed her – a fictional form (fortunately!) of meningoencephalitis – soon manifests itself all over the globe. The social order starts to break down everywhere as governments are unable to cope with the sudden onslaught that plagues their citizens. Experts from the CDC and WHO attempt to find a cure and to locate the origin of the outbreak but are hindered by problems as diverse as boundaries in their professional ethics, conspiracy bloggers inciting public revolt against the rule of law for their own profit, and the overall fear and hopelessness that drives people to extremes they would otherwise never consider, just to survive another day. The result is a carefully woven mosaic of various plot lines that never merge but end up making for an excellently rounded structure as a whole in terms of exploring the nature of the virus, its effects on global society and the race for ending its reign of terror. Though credit has to be given to Soderbergh and his team for keeping this narrative as close to reality as possible, both for chilling us to the bone and for the benefit of our education, it's hard to deny the film's occasional uneven pace and its constant need for overexplaining the more technical situations portrayed, even though it's tremendously helpful in understanding the motions of science in hazardous scenarios like these, and provides some always welcome intellectual uplifting of the audience in general. At times it feels a documentary would have better suited this topic (and no doubt some have). An all-star cast is brought on board to demonstrate how swiftly a lethal, worldwide viral outbreak makes an end to everyday life and in some instances, human values we claim to hold dear until circumstances prove us otherwise.Though convincing performances are found throughout, in hindsight it would have been more apt to have these characters be played by less known talents to increase the level of realism Contagion aims for. Though the likes of Matt Damon, Marion Cotillard, Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburne and Jude Law are undoubtedly just as susceptible to nasty diseases as the rest of us (unless fortune really is a cure for every illness), their struggle against the horrible infliction in question doesn't feel as grounded in reality as it ought to because of the high level of internationally familiar faces and the lack of ""normal people"" in major roles throughout the whole. The movie's overall style is rather cold and detached, a tone many spectators would expect a scientifically accurate story to convey, while the human element is relegated to the background a little too much. Soderbergh focuses on the microcosm of things, so scenes of mass panic and rampant lawlessness are absent though they are referred to abundantly, which doesn't make the concerns addressed in this film feel as immediate and as serious as we are meant to experience them. Contagion is a fine attempt at explaining in a scientifically correct sense what very well could (and most likely would) transpire if it came down to a global pandemic of this magnitude – the death toll at the end of the film reaches 26 million people – but its reliance on letting science determine the course of the film doesn't make for as compelling and intense a drama as it should have been.",Contagion

It starts out a tad slow, the it speeds up in the middle then it gets terribly slow again, the pacing was the main problem for me.The storyline is fantastic, a smart medical thriller about an epidemic/ pandemic that very quickly starts cutting the world population dramatically, it's a great storyline that at times will have you really thinking about all the things you do each day, shaking hands, coughing, chewing nails etc, it is packed with medical facts which give this movie the smart boost that Hollywood films lackMost of the cast are OK, Gwyneth Paltrow stands out in a very tiny role and Kate Winslet shines as usual, the rest kind of plod along with the story, Matt Damin is boring and Marion Cotillard is terribly underused, and don't even get me started in Jude Law's ""Australian"" accent, how embarrassing for him, it's pretty bad. Contagion isn't all bad, it has sine really great moments, the scene where Kate Winslet is on the phone with the guy telling him to get off the bus is very tense and also the scene where a mass amount of dead bodies are being buried has a very apocalyptic feel to it.I mean it could have been a lot worse, but it also could have been a lot better too, there's just no highs or lows, not good or bad. Unmoving I would say. But give it a go, maybe you might enjoy it more than I did.",Contagion
194,julian-mumford,"May have audiences vowing to never touch anything, ever again.",7,30 April 2012,"What would actually have happened if SARS had really taken hold and spread like wildfire across the world, with no antidote and the cause unidentified.Director Steve Sonderbergh, takes the SARS epidemic and runs with it to create a worst case scenario, playing events out for real, with almost no glamour, gloss or usual Hollywood movie staples. The movie is very scary, not in a ""jump at the cat"" or ""man in a mask with an axe"" frightening, more along the lines of, this could happen and what might transpire if it did.Sonderbergh's one concession is to employ A-List actors, lots of them.Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon) is an ordinary family man who's wife Beth (Gwyneth Paltrow) travels a lot, returning suspiciously late from a business trip, she is taken unwell, very unwell.Unknown to all, the seeds of disaster have already been planted and it is now only a matter of time, for air travel and modern life to carry out it's deadly work.The reaction of Mitch to his wife's condition feels surprisingly real, 'Yes, but can I see her now?"" he asks.If anyone is touted as heroes, then the staff of the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) are the only candidates on display. Dr Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) asks his investigative staff to go to great lengths to attempt to control the outbreak. Dr Mears (Winslet) dashes from one crisis to the next, hunting the source and placing herself in ever increasing danger.Back at CDC Dr Hextall (Jennifer Ehle) works remotely with Dr Sussman (Ellitt Gould), to attempt to find an antidote. Monkey lovers should look away at this point.The tension is cranked up well, there is a real feeling of events spiraling out of control as the thin veneer of civilization gradually and then very quickly, falls away. Would you wait in an orderly line in the hope of buying medicine that might help your family to survive. Not for long one suspects, not if your family's lives truly depended on it. The truth is laid out quite simply, when such situations occur it is everyone for themselves, there are just not enough Police and Health staff to cope. Faced with their own family crisis, it is unlikely they would turn up for work in the first place.A subplot involving an influential blogger/conspiracy theorist (Jude Law) appears tacked on and unnecessary. This introduces social commentary, painting large corporations as exploiting the crisis and takes a simplistic ""all pharmaceuticals are bad"" approach. This may at least be partially true but this is crudely drawn and coupled with Law's dodgy accent, seems out of place. This together with the complicated family arrangement, step child, possible unfaithfulness, distracts from the main event and pulls the audience away from the central virus outbreak dilemma.To exacerbate this further, a secondary subplot involving Dr Orantes (Marion Cotillard) working for the World Health Organisation, who is then kidnapped by a colleague and forced to assist a tiny local village, is again ancillary to the main story.Perhaps director Steven Soderbergh did not believe the central story strand was strong enough to capture audiences imagination. Bearing in mind the strength of the story and acting, together with an audience willing to accept how real this could be, this is an incorrect assumption.Of course, whether audiences want to be reminded just how easily millions of people could die during an outbreak with no antidote, is debatable. Box office numbers would suggest that fighting Robots and Vampires is infinitely more bankable and much less scary.Summary A thriller which provides a frightening glimpse into how events would actually unfold during a large worldwide virus outbreak.With only minor concession to Hollywood glitz, this may have audiences vowing to never touch anything, ever again.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",Contagion
195,wandereramor,Basically bureaucracy porn,5,15 April 2012,"Let's get the good out of the way: Contagion is a beautiful-looking movie. Soderbergh makes everything flow together nicely into a slick, attractive package, with the opening disease-spreading sequence being a masterful piece of filmmaking. And the all-star cast assembled is genuinely impressive, ranging from big-name stars like Matt Damon and Gwynneth Paltrow to cult heroes like Bryan Cranston and Enrico Colatani. Contagion had all of the necessary pieces to make a great movie.Unfortunately, the script is beyond saving. The massive cast is used only to have shallow plot lines in between spooning out exposition. There's a weird thinly-veiled allegory about Matt Damon defending his daughter's purity. There's Jude Law playing an evil blogger character that the movie beats up to an unintentionally hilarious extent. And there's a bunch of things happening. That's what the vast majority of the movie is: things happening, without any particular reason to be interested in them or any particular meaning. For a hundred-minute mainstream thriller, it's shockingly dull, and I found myself checking the time constantly in the last half.The messages that the film does impart are pretty skeevy too: in the event of a crisis, the government will save us from both the external threat and our own beast-like nature, never mind what those crazy people on the Internet tell you. This is basically a film that tells you to quiet down and let the system run its course. And don't even get me started about the portrayal of the dangerous East, where the disease originates.There's too much money and talent invested in it to make Contagion a complete turd, but it never really becomes more than a nice-looking potboiler. And that's a shame, considering how great it could have been.",Contagion

199,DanLives1980,Lazy!,5,5 April 2012,"Contagion promised to be a thrilling story about a devastating global flu pandemic and I was interested by its trailer enough that I bought it on DVD after not having seen it at the cinema or having heard anything about it. Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Marion Cotillard, John Hawkins and Jude Law is a pretty tidy cast for any film, and you trust it'll be good by that knowledge alone. This film was so badly made that when I saw Steven Soderbergh's name on it, I shouted, 'NOOOO (expletive) WAY!' At first I felt like I was watching an indie film, until I started to decode the blatant television drama media text within every single scene. Maybe it's just me but high definition, badly-planned cinematography and fictional docu-drama go together like popcorn and a BBC newsflash. It doesn't.According to IMDb, the budget was estimated at $60,000,000. Where did that go? To the Japanese as an apology for insulting their entire race?Contagion sports a very minimalist style of story telling in the sense that character and story development are largely ignored and not even for special effects, action or a world class film music composer. Where sixty million went to, I have no idea. Note: when I say action, I mean EVENTS HAPPENING, not guns and explosions. This film is boring.The things you might see in a realistic scenario, you don't see so much in this film, even though it wants to dramatise how bad things will get if this ever happens in real life. It borrows a lot from a particular film called 'The Andromeda Strain'. But just the boring bits.Most of Contagion's scenes based around the government's doctors soldiering on through a possible apocalypse to get that damn paperwork done and save the world (and their reputations) are some of the most pointless I've ever sat through. Sure, I know that in a realistic scenario, the government would not be very popular and neither would the people working to preserve their infrastructure. But not even the humanist aspects make me want to like any of the characters outside of Winslet and Damon.Gwyneth Paltrow delivers us the opening scenes as a business woman leaving Japan after a business trip/extra-marital affair. She gets home and drops dead the next morning. She was incubating a fatal strain of flu that has no known cure. Oops.Instead of making this look like a danger to the human race, it's treated like a crime, and the film's professional saviours set about looking for patient zero.As the brains - Lawrence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard and Kate Winslet - set about racing against time in an ill-fated attempt to stop the virus from spreading, Matt Damon and daughter, family of Paltrow, hole themselves up at home while the USA goes to hell in a riot of market store looting and armed burglaries.Hilariously, Cotillard is held hostage by a Japanese government official because he and his friends and family don't believe the Americans will give them the cure when or if it is produced. Jude Law is a freelance journalist fond of pestering government officials over conspiracies and blogging about it. His purpose in this film is to portray the internet people that publicly damage the reputation of governing bodies while Soderbergh just balances this by making them out to be hypocrites in their actions to prove otherwise.The most convincing acting in this film comes from Kate Winslet. The majority of the cast are otherwise emotionless and lost. But smaller parts portrayed by Elliott Gould, John Hawkes and Chin Han prove more colourful than those of main characters that are just lazy.Apart from Winslet, there is no emotional involvement. Not a single tear or panic attack from Damon when he finds out his wife has just died in the next room. Not a nervous twitch from Law who's stuck in the middle of it all. Some seriously bland performances here, and that being said, I can't figure out who IS a main character. Soderbergh can't seem to direct suspense or tragedy all of a sudden. Contagion is a glorified public information film about spreading germs that likes to make the general population look like mentally challenged bastards with no understanding of hygiene.. It takes stereotypes of all kinds and dumbs them down and tries unsuccessfully to redefine the politics of what effects widespread panic has on the world, seemingly based on how people will protest to the simplest things, therefore panic and loot and murder over the first sign of trouble. It makes me want to take sides with the germs and I think that's actually what Soderbergh did. No faith in humanity.Overall, I'm insulted that I have to work my fingers to the bone and yet when I part with my money to be entertained for two hours, actors, writers and directors making hundreds of thousands if not millions just can't be bothered to pull their thumbs out. I could do a bad job for a lot of money, but I wouldn't shame myself!",Contagion
200,SeriousJest,Humanity is the Protagonist,8,15 August 2013,"This extremely-entertaining project uses an all-star cast, as well as skillful camera work, engaging sound, well-timed editing, and appropriate special effects to show you how easily an epidemic could spread, the effects that the disease could have on the world, and what systems the world has in place to stop the contagion from happening. If you want to get a young person interested in science, show him or her this movie. I know it made a little part of me wish I was a CDC scientist.Part of the film's brilliance stems from its lack of an individual protagonist or antagonist. Humanity is the protagonist, and the disease is the antagonist. The cast is full of top-notch actors who play supporting rolesin fact, I would dare to say that there is no clear-cut lead. Each of them has an important part of the story to tell, a slice of humanity to illustrateand they do it very well.To that end, the movie's makers did a great job of keeping individual character development to a low, fleeting level. You identify with or dislike the different characters because of the aspects of humanity that they represent, but not because you spent a half hour learning about their particular lives and growing particularly attached. Too much individual character development in a project like this, during which you don't really have the time to fully develop those characters, and you end up with World War Z, in which you feel like you're supposed to care about the individual characters but you don't because they're only halfway developed.",Contagion
201,jburtroald95,"Soderbergh knows what he's doing, and does it well",8,5 November 2011,"This October has seen the release of some very daring and confident films that engage with consistently treacherous genre material and, unlike many other foolhardy adventurers to go down similar routes, emerge unscathed and proudly victorious. On this occasion, we have proved director Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Ocean's 11) tackling the age-old disaster film, a field of cinema that is teeming with trials and booby traps that have snared many a well-meaning director. Melodrama has been unleashed without anyone there to tame it; improbability and plot holes have sprung up eaten and away at films like a parasite; characterisations, performances and subplots meant to flesh out the paper-thin overlaying narrative have all been left to rot or ignored next to the overpowering spectacle of the overall premise; and many other nasty factors have combined to spoil the earnest aspirations of enthusiastic film makers. A few directors, such as Steven Spielberg, have fared well because while they know how to play with fire, but Soderbergh seems to have avoided the Hollywood glitz and glamour altogether.In his depiction of a deadly disease that has been spreading like wildfire, ever since it mysteriously emerged from an unknown source, is extremely truthful and convincing and makes the scenario seem very viable to the audience. The first victim is hit very suddenly and terrifyingly, as one would expect, but Soderbergh doesn't overstate this. He recognises that his audience is generally going to be aware of the film's basic premise, and are anticipating such an event, so he doesn't try to take them by surprise, nor does he design the circumstances to be implausibly perfect for the moment. The effect is that the audience directly absorbs the fact that this sweet young mother is violently choking to death, right in front of her son and husband, without any conscious thought of an artsy-fartsy middle-man. A few days later, her son is sent home from school exhibiting similar symptoms, and in yet another act of prudence, Soderbergh doesn't prolong his decrepitude to milk as much easy sympathy as he can, only to reveal that the innocent cutiepie is thankfully going to survive, which would make the film ""heartwarming"" and, like the mind-numbing E.T.: The Extra- Terrestrial (1982), exempt from any sensible criticisms. The child does die, because that is what was most likely to happen, and everyone just has to move on and address the wider problems at hand: What is the disease? Can it be treated? How soon? Who will be cured first? How should the risks be managed? When countless innocent people are dying each day, should proper, formal procedure still be followed, or has the time come for taking desperate chances and hoping for the best?These are just a few of the dilemmas explored by screenplay writer Scott Z. Burns (The Bourne Ultimatum, The Informant!), as he hones in on a few of the more controversial people involved. Watching the desperate actions of characters such as top doctor Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne), who using confidential inside information to give his wife Aubrey (Sanaa Lathan) an unfair advantage in the race for survival, and assistant medical worker Chin Han (Sun Feng) kidnapping senior doctor Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard, recently seen delving into very different material in Midnight in Paris) and halting her all-important progress towards finding a cure to save the world's population to attempt to preserve one village. Although perhaps the most interesting and very atypical figure in this piece is audacious blogger Alan Krumwiede (a very impressive Jude Law) who in any other film would be the daring and valiant crusader for justice, but here, with a severe shortage of serious corruption, is a mere Rebel Without A Cause, a shameless attention-seeker who is never taken seriously.Still, amidst all of this restrained subtlety, Soderbergh does find time to let off steam with a few intensely dramatic scenes showing the collapse of civilisation, the influx of crime and the frequent appearance of volatile angry masses that have become rampant on the streets. However, he also acknowledges, through the story of the first victim's grieving yet thankfully immune husband (Matt Damon) and his plucky daughter Jory (Anna Jacoby-Heron), that as doctors may take months to find the cure, and then many months more to have it mass- produced and distributed on such a large scale, the experiences of the ordinary citizen would consist less of pulsating terror and breathless activity, but more of unbearably boring waiting around to be released from home quarantine. This is something that is very rarely incorporated by filmmakers, and I'm sure members of Jory's generation will all relate to the miserable texts she sends to her well-mannered boyfriend (Brian J. O'Donnell) stating that she is stuck in a horrible prison, while those precious teenage years are wasting away.One other thing that Contagion has in common with Midnight in Paris is its cleverness, perceptiveness and thoughtful consideration of the often harsh realities of life and, most importantly, the intelligence and movie-going experience of its audience. I hope this audience will be a substantial amount of people, a though that isn't too far-fetched considering its exciting premise and impressive line-up",Contagion

Number one it will feel very uncomfortable because you know that can happen. Number two is that although we have people dying and businesses and people going broke it could be even worse if the infection and death rate was higher.So it is an accurate movie but is is it also good.

Boy, was I wrong. Fast forward 10 years and Contagion has become the most relevant film out there. We are in the final stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. And virtually everything we see in this film, has played out in real live. Thank God the virus we are facing today is not as lethal and random as the one in the film. But apart from that: Contagion now almost feels like a documentary. Suddenly there isn't a more realistic thriller out there. It is a extremely well made film, that everyone on this planet should watch. Let us never again say that film can't teach or warn you.",Contagion

205,rebecca-ry,Don't forget to wash your hands,10,23 March 2012,"'Contagion' is a really interesting film, there's a lot of zombie-horror films out there which meant this film became even better because it still talked about world devastation, just made it seem more real. It starts off on day two of infection and escalates more and more. This film is really informative, not about the disease which is fictional (thankfully), but about how germs are passed, with long shots of door handles, glasses, buttons and phones, it begins to scare you before the film's really started. The plot is a great one, it slowly begins to terrify you as the world becomes more and more barren. The soundtrack also heightens this terror and works really well. There are no weak actors in this film, it has a lot of big names which usually means it won't be as good as expected but this was better. Matt Damon's character development throughout the film is really good, he starts out your average man and you see him having to adapt to the changing world. Jennifer Ehle is also a very prominent character, she works really well in this film. Despite Jude Law being an absolute horror in this film he does portray the character extremely well and is probably the best actor in this film aside from Damon. The plot of this film is really great and although you are constantly asking yourself throughout how this disease began, you're not desperate for an answer because you're so caught up in the story. The ending however, is just amazing. It will terrify you, I obviously will not give it away but it really shocks you.Overall I would recommend this film but it is not for the faint hearted, there is a lot of blood and sickness which can make people uncomfortable. It's a really great story and will leave you thinking.",Contagion
206,williambendavis-933-218958,Disappointing and really boring unfortunately,4,5 March 2015,"Well this was extremely disappointing for me. Directed by Stephen Soderbergh and it's a mass epidemic film? I should have loved this! But I didn't. In fact, I found it to be quite boring film with little to no tension and featuring zero characters I actually cared about in the slightest. It isn't all bad of course. I do think this is a very good portrayal of how the world would have handled this situation, but my praise stops there. The film just drags on and on, having characters go from place to place doing the same thing and ultimately accomplishes nothing. It also has 3 other plot lines, one about a web blogger who kept going on about some conspiracy, one about Matt Damon and his daughter, and the other about Marion Cotillard being kidnapped by Asian people. Actually was that last plot line even resolved? Now that I think about it, I'm not sure if it was. Anyway, the plot about the web blogger was really just kind of annoying. The actual web blogger dude I didn't really like. He was a bit of an asshole. Matt Damon's plot line should have been the best thing about this film, but no. Neither him or his daughter were given any development whatsoever, making the film more boring. His daughter is actually quite stupid. There's a scene where sneaks out of the house to see her boyfriend. Like how unintelligent do you have to be? There's a infectious disease out there, that you could catch, but you decide ""the hell with it, I'm horny"" and could have possibly ended up dead. Marion Cotillard's plot line was mostly just forgettable and not at all necessary. All that combined makes for a really stupid and boring film. Pass.",Contagion
207,rawiri42,Not Sci/fi.,7,24 October 2014,"Contagion is listed as a sci/fi movie but I don't think it is. It has also been listed as a horror movie and that it certainly is. The only problem is that I doubt many viewers will realise just how horrific it really is.Made in 2011, some 35 years after the first outbreak of Ebola in the Congo (then Zaire) but before the much wider-spread epidemic that began in 2012 in West Africa and is still spreading internationally and making headline news every day, Contagion may yet prove to be far from science fiction. Ebola has every potential to be a true manifestation of the virus of Contagion and, unless it is contained - and very soon - future movie-goers may be watching not a drama, but a historical movie entitled ""Ebola"" in which half the world's population die. Now that WILL a horror movie!Getting back to Contagion though, it is, in actual fact, only half drama with the rest being more of a documentary. Leading actors die early and, apart from Jude law's redneck character, most are highly professional medical people sincerely trying to save the world. After all, isn't that what thriller movies are all about? There are very believable scenes where people, intent on self-preservation, commit random acts of anarchy and, of course, some who behave extremely stupidly but, before vehemently condemning them, just try to imagine that the story is real and not just a movie and imagine what YOU would do in the same circumstances - especially if it concerned your children and other loved ones.Depending on your own personal viewpoint, this could well be the scariest movie you will ever see.",Contagion

Sporting an excellent cast, no one stole the show - many of the stars do not last very long (thankfully Gwenneth kicks it early - that probably saved the movie). The story is tight and does a good job of representing the feelings of helplessness that the authorities would feel given these events. Some of the deaths in the film are surprising and represent the way that the real thing could happen.And it took several acts of heroism on the part of the medical community for the breakthrough. One of the highlights for me was the way the film was shot - it looked like a documentary without the current (trendy) ""Lost footage"" approach. The acting is solid, the actors made the story believable.And the explanation of how it all happened and who was Patient Zero is well done. I very much enjoyed this latest chapter in pandemic film.

The doctors are dumbfounded as the disease manages to spread not only in the Emhoffs' hometown of Minneapolis but also in other communities across the U.S. and the globe. The resulting fears are then stoked by a conspiracy-minded blogger named Alan Krunweide (played by Jude Law) who sees the disease as an attempt to further trim the civil liberties of ordinary citizens while drug companies and medical professionals rake in untold profits. All while actual medical professionals (played by Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard and others) continue to work tirelessly and gain little, if any, advantage in the fight.As already mentioned, this is a very impressive cast.

Thankfully like SARS a few years earlier, the outbreaks were rather small thanks to a wealth of precautionary information and measures. In the new film ""Contagion"" director Steven Soderbergh paints a frighteningly realistic look at a worldwide pandemic that spread without warning, and its devastating aftermath. When businesswoman Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow), returns from a business trip to Hong Kong with what appears to be a simple case of the flu, her husband Mitch (Matt Damon), figures it's nothing to be overly concerned about. When Beth all of a sudden begins to convulse and later dies unexpectedly, doctors are at a loss to explain what happened.Over the next few days, more and more people become sick and die including Mitch's young stepson, which gets the national and international disease control organizations working overtime to try to trace, identify and treat this mysterious ailment that sweeping the globe. Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) leads the investigation in the United States and calls in Dr. Erin Mears (Kate Winslet), to track who may have come into contact with Beth upon her return to the Minneapolis. The World Health Organization sends Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) to Hong Kong trace possible origins. As the first week passes more and more people become sick worldwide, cities start fighting a losing battle against frenzy and panic. In time the virus is identified but due to its unique nature, finding a vaccine and producing it can take several months with thousands of lives lost with each passing day. With chaos breaking loose and the bodies piling up, the authorities find themselves unable to deal with the threat they are facing and go to extreme measures such as closing the state borders to try to contain the spread of the virus. Adding to the confusion is a freelance blogger named Alan (Jude Law), who has amassed a large audience with his conspiracy claims that there are indeed cures available for the mysterious virus. He contends the government elite and the pharmaceutical companies are exploiting the situation in order to milk maximum profit from the inevitable release of a vaccine.The film deftly moves around the world showing the victims, scientists and investigators and how the crisis is affecting them. It also shows how quickly society can break down as scene after shocking scene of chaos and devastation are introduced juxtaposed with the number of days since the outbreak of the virus.Soderbergh keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesn't give you a moment's rest. Characters are introduced and given just enough of a back story so that you understand their place in the film. Most heartbreaking is Matt Damon's role as a father who was watching over his only remaining child, going to great measures to keep her safe while also dealing with the death of his wife and the unfolding secret of the last days of her life. There is truly an impressive array of stars in the film, some of whom play brief but significant parts in the overall story. However, the movie's strength is also its weakness in that with so many primary characters, there were some diverging story lines with that did not get fully fleshed out.While ""Contagion"" is not the first film to deal with viral outbreak, it is perhaps the most realistic as it doesn't resort to any Hollywood standards such as car chases, explosions, starcrossed lovers and so on to tell its story. Instead it focuses on stark, somber scenarios and the struggles of each character is very easy to relate to. Kudos has to be given to many of the stars of the film for their understated but pitch perfect work in very unglamorous roles. Their subtle & poignant acting underscore the dire situations that their characters find themselves in. It was refreshing to see leading men and women looking quite ordinary and letting the story carry the picture rather than focusing on one individual to save the day.All throughout the film I found myself captivated and never once did I lose interest in the scenarios or characters nor did I find anything in the film impossible to believe. The film doesn't go overboard on pointing fingers instead it gives an honest and unflinching look at a scenario that we can only hope will never happen. But as the film points out, viral outbreaks have occurred all throughout history. Hardly an encouraging message, but thanks to the stellar cast and gripping subject matter ""Contagion"" is a film you will not want to miss.Gareth Von Kallenbach Skewed and Reviewed",Contagion
217,sjarja,"I should not have been bored, but i was...",7,9 January 2015,"Well - what i liked about this movie was that it seemed fairly realistic in terms of containment and countermeasures - although it always felt like it only scratched the surface of many of the questions/problems it addressed. (like distribution, false/or right but poorly timed rumors, spread, containment measures on a larger - international scale etc. ).The separate story branches of the various protagonists were interesting - but it felt like they were given too little time to ""mature"" enough to make me care.In the end - i kind of wondered what this movie actually was about. Was it about the dangers of misinformation? the personal fates of different people facing deadly dangers? the desperation and what men are capable of? the scientific finding of a cure? the infrastructure of how all that is connected? Now it may be ""funny"" (not funny as in laughable but funny as in coincidence) - but the year 2014 saw a larger epidemy of Ebola which was large enough to keep the news focused on it for some time. The news about real life Ebola, the fears, the doomsayers, the optimists and pessimists in real life was equally if not more interesting than this movie. In retrospect - if i combine the real life news and the movie - things fit in ... reasonably well actually.The movie is not over dramatic (no forced in love interest, no stupid action scenes etc. ) but seems to portrait what happens when faced with a pandemic quite well.now - i have given that movie a 7/10 - which kind of contradicts that i was bored sometimes. But i do have to say that i highly appreciate the movie and how it was made, but couldn't help but be bored a little. It is hard to say - usually being bored is a death sentence for a movie... in that case however it should not be like that (although being bored is hardly ever praise)",Contagion

Based on three-year-old memories of the publicity and star interviews for Contagion, I had thought it was a straight dramatization of the worldwide bird flu outbreak of a couple of years before. It wasn't, but the mistake is a telling one: the differences between fact-based drama and actual dramatization of real events are key to the successes and failures of this film.The star-studded cast, featuring 6 household names (Marion Cotillard, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Winslet) and another two or three known actors, is characteristic of director Steven Soderbergh. He is best known for the Ocean casino heist movies, but this film is more reminiscent of his earlier film Traffic, which explores the drugs trade through multiple viewpoints, most of which include well-known names. Contagion attempts to get an overview on a deadly flu pandemic using a similar multiple viewpoint method.As with the award-winning Traffic, the method works quite well. However, there are problems. The techno-jargon falls down at times, failing to convey the logic used to track down the source of the infection and develop a cure. Note that I am being charitable here in assuming there actually is logic, rather than just whatever narrative imperative screenwriter Scott Z. Burns deems is required to make an exciting story.The drama is certainly ramped up in every way, from the stakes - including a death rate well out of line with the well-established virology wisdom - to the tension, to the risks taken by those involved when they flout the rules placed upon them for the protection of the public. I am perfectly happy with taking liberties with the strict realities every now and then if it makes for a more entertaining watch (and it does), but it must be understood that there are costs and trade-offs here.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/contagion-2011.html",Contagion

221,austin-takahashi,Contagion - 3.5 Stars,7,15 February 2013,"It's a nervous feeling, you know, to wonder what kinds of dirty little monsters crawl all over my keyboard when I'm in peaceful sleep. The scariest killers are always those whom we cannot see. ""Contagion"" is a frightful film because it preys on the universal fear of germs and the diseases they carry with them. It treats its topic with a level of maturity that we can apply in our own surroundings. During the screening I attended, I became more and more cautious of the coughing guy seated in the row behind me.The epidemic crisis in ""Contagion"" finds a realistic tone by lining itself with other historical events. If we look back at the time where a major outbreak like The Black Plague took its toll, we'll learn that we don't always get the cure or vaccine as soon as we need them. Some diseases are still without a cure until today. (What would things be like if the common cold was fatal?) The movie gives a convincing depiction of how the present world would handle a similar crisis.An element that elevates ""Contagion"" from other ""outbreak movies"" is that it fully realizes the weight of its threat. As a result, we are spared with the false need of a tangible villain in the form of organizations with nothing but money in mind. Though there is a character by Jude Law who theorizes such things, his accusations only exist to be proved wrong. Every health official in the movie does their job, and they do it well. To watch this movie is to grow a renewed sense of cleanliness. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go wipe my keyboard.Official review here: http://localmoviereview.com/contagion-movie- review/",Contagion

225,brent_or,Take it as it is; very to-the-point and thought-provoking.,8,5 September 2012,"For the most part, I was pretty impressed with Contagion. It is something in between a ""normal"" film and a documentary. I think that the cinematography and editing are well handled, and of course the large ensemble cast of big-name actors helps in terms of immediate interest and accessibility. (I especially love Jennifer Ehle, and was glad to see her in a key role.) Beware, if you are squeamish, there are a few intense moments; easy enough to look away, but just a heads up. The best thing about this film, in my opinion, is how thought-provoking it is, with regards to ""what would you do"" in the event of an actual epidemic. Of course, the CDC/scientist angle is covered, as well as the experiences of random affected individuals, but I also appreciated the attention given to the media/public relations side of things. Some difficult ethical questions are raised. The film is not a complete downer, but it is very sobering. I have seen others' criticism of Marion Cotillard's story arc; I agree that it is perhaps a bit far-fetched.

First, I tried the exorcist, which is called the greatest horror movies of all time. Well, tbh, it was laughable in most parts and overall mediocre. Then, I watched Contagion, and believe me, it scared the hell out of me. After all, reality is the scariest thing ever. The actors have done good job. Matt damon, kate Winslet and the others are good. The best thing is that it is paced realistically, not too rushed like the World War Z, nor too slow. And, finally, the ending is everything.

The disease itself is rather frightening...convulsions and frothing at the mouth. However, after about 30 minutes or so, one realizes all the good parts are over. The movie drags on with various little subplots that really don't add much drama to the film...it gets a little tedious, especially after a cure is found (the movie goes on quite a bit after the cure...not too exciting at this point).

There'd be chases and dramatic lab scenes where the hero scientists rush against time. Except that's not how it would happen, if we were to experience a pandemic. There wouldn't be some lone scientist who has the cure, we wouldn't be saved at the last minute, there wouldn't be some happy ending where we all breathe a sigh of relief...there would only be death and waiting.This film does a pretty good job of capturing how a pandemic would happen, and how it would affect everyone. The movie tells the story through the eyes of various people; from a head doctor at the CDC, a representative from the WHO, to a middle class guy helplessly watching the events around him to a blogger who thinks he has the answer.The movie captures the anxiety and fear that would/will grip the world as we face a pandemic. Despite all our knowledge and technology, we are still vulnerable to disease, and this movie captures that. It also captures the human element. How would the world react? Sure, early on we might be civil and brave in the face of the disease, but as the pandemic stretches on...and the death toll rises...survival becomes the paramount driver for every one of us.If you're looking for an action-packed thriller, this isn't it.

233,FilmFanatic03,"Not too dramatic, but not too bland. The perfect balance.",7,15 November 2011,"Steven Soderbergh manages to create a film which is between a documentary and a drama. ""Contagion"" is one of those films where it has enough drama to engage an audience and yet doesn't overdo it, because it follows each character at a certain pace and doesn't over dramatise everything. Of course the cast is worth mentioning, an A-Lister cast which I think without them this film would not have been great. From Kate Winslet, to Laurence Fisburne, to Matt Damon etc. they all played interesting characters and despite all having different backdrops they all blended into each other and it felt like the same film.

That protagonist is, of course, the virus itself.Although every character's story revolves around the deadly outbreak— from the unfortunate Patient Zero (Gwyneth Paltrow) to the compassionate WHO doctor (Marion Cotillard) to the earnest CDC investigator (a disturbingly stiff Kate Winslet) to the muckraking blogger (Jude Law) who sees a conspiracy at work —the film tells the story of the virus: its insinuation into the world population, the havoc it wrecks on humanity, the race to find a vaccine, and the ultimate resolution. Steven Soderbergh creates an appropriate sense of chaotic detachment, mirroring what in all likelihood would actually happen in the event of such an outbreak, and he quite realistically depicts the almost bureaucratic way in which such a pandemic would be ""managed,"" leaving us with a sense that a global viral outbreak would prove to be more than ""just"" a health crisis.

237,Marc_Action,"Predictable, Yet Still Somehow Very Compelling",7,30 December 2012,"Contagion is a movie that relies totally on star power with few, if any, special effects. But don't give up on it just yet because these are the film's two strong suits. We are treated to an ensemble cast that includes veteran actors like Lawrence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon, Jude Law and French beauty, Marion Cotillard. It was great seeing all these stars work together, even if some made short appearances. The film was directed by Erin Brockovich's Steven Soderbergh, and his relaxed/collaborative style of directing lends itself perfectly to a cast of highly-skilled actors and actresses.The plot, dialogue, and settings are all very straight-forward, and for a film that has an apocalyptic theme, it's a welcome sight to see it doesn't need to reply on smoke and mirrors to carry the movie (or in most cases, the director ""hopes"" smoke and mirrors will carry the movie, often resulting in failure). This is a thriller/drama film based in reality though, so it's not like it has to compete with the likes of 28 Days Later or Doomsday, which are decidedly more sci-fi. (By the way, what is it with the Brits and these killer virus films anyway?) Overall it's a great effort, but my biggest complaint with Contagion is the pacing. It seemed as though some parts were really, really rushed (like when they had a breakthrough in discovering the vaccine). Also, despite the great cast, I often caught myself wondering when this movie would end. Maybe I felt that way because everything just seemed so predictable, and if you noticed, I haven't gone into detail about any of the plot elements. Well, the reason is because Contagion's plot is pretty self-explanatory. It's a movie about an epidemic resulting from a rare, unknown virus. I don't need to tell you how this one will go, though I will say that the film's closing scene is highly effective.Predictable as it might be, the movie gives us a very surreal look into the dark side of modern globalization. Specifically, it exposes the negative aspects regarding the ease at which we now transverse the planet, and how we throw caution to the wind with our daily sanitation habits.It gets 7 stars for having a stellar cast and for its refreshingly simple, yet compelling presentation.",Contagion

I was expecting an exciting thriller, but this was no where near the excitement in ""28 Days/Weeks Later"".This isn't a documentary; it's supposed to be a movie. Sure, there are multiple story lines and they seem to be handled fairly appropriately and there are a few dramatic moments, but nothing is special enough to make this movie good. It hasn't done well on the side of excitement, and on the side of drama it is definitely sentimentally inadequate and powerless.And you can't help but think this is a waste of talents with such a all-star cast, and all they are told to do is something that many average or rookie actors can manage.Then again, perhaps it was my expectations that went in overdrive and I was hoping for something huge.

Being fortunate enough to be a social animal turns out not so fortunate in this beautifully crafted movie, where how a single handshake or just by simply touching anything around you can send you spiraling down to the verge of your extinction. Until of course a vaccine is developed.The gravity of such situations have been portrayed by the struggles of a dad and a daughter having no time to grieve yet having all the time being quarantined, challenges to find peace with the situation (vaccine) by a doctor aided by the chief who dares to take chance in such a horrid situation-which i assure will win your heart. And few other carefully knitted stories of people and the state of the world during such terrible times, will make you wanna re-think every time you make slightest of human contact.
Although mankind had its fair share of pandemics in the history where black death, smallpox, cholera and more recently SARS and even AIDS rolled the dice wiping out millions at once.

Contagion is a slow burning mostly quiet thriller.Why isn't it good? The characters are bland which I figured based on the plot but the acting is great. You easily care about Matt Damon's character since he's a family guy plus Damon is likeable.Contagion is mostly scientists discussing the virus which some will find boring. Jude Law plays a blogger, I honestly found his character and subplot boring but it's minor. One or two Laurence Fishburne scenes were honestly boring.This virus is eerily similar to the virus we have now. It's worst to hopefully give the audience some tension. Unlike most movies, Contagion doesn't have timeframe subtitles.Overall, Contagion isn't a bad movie. It's the kind of movie you see only once or twice, I won't see it again.

250,OGmacadamia39,Enter 2020....,9,19 March 2020,"Currently in quarantine due to the COVID19 outbreak, it seemed understandable that this movie would tick on my radar.The cast of the movie, every actor, every role, did a phenomenal job. I was impressed with the line up and then impressed with their work.It was rather creepy to see so much of our current world language being used. ""Social distancing"", ""R nought"" etc. I believe the timeline of the story seemed a bit unrealistic (as in how quickly it spread and caused pandemonium (based on our current experience) but that being said - it was close enough to be chilling.My only -meh- regarding this film are the holes left at the end.1. What happened to the WHO worker when she found out that the government supplied the people in China with a phony vaccine?2. What happened to the chef that started the entire thing with infecting GP? Or all the people who ate that food that night?3. Why was MD immune?4. Why was the government not really mentioned - considering ours here in the US seems to be so potent in presence?I liked it, I'd recommend it, I would even think that a sequel (all these years later) would be a great idea.",Contagion
251,dutchs-1,"Great Start, Weak Finale",7,23 September 2011,"A businesswoman returns from a trip to Hong Kong, bearing a fatal virus. The first third of the film, where the scope of the disease continues to unfold, is wonderfully tense and suspenseful. In all too rare contrast with other films, the characters behave rationally and reveal their characters through their actions and not long-winded psychoanalysis or contrived personality conflicts. And, most wonderful of all, despite the involvement of FEMA, the CDC, and Homeland Security, and accusations of profiteering by the pharmaceutical industry, the only real profiteering villain is an activist blogger who hawks a worthless homeopathic remedy. And the film doesn't even pretend that he has any legitimacy. The middle of the film is a good fast paced drama as the CDC tracks down the nature of the virus and a heroic doctor volunteers herself as a test case for a vaccine. Even where order breaks down, it's the sort of thing that could realistically happen. Except, for the most part, order doesn't break down. The power never goes out, for example.Even though the virus has a survival rate of 75%, we never see anyone actually recover from it. And the finale of the film fizzles into lethargic anti-climax. The vaccine is produced but it will take months to make enough for everyone, and a lottery system is established to determine the order of immunization. We begin to see signs of a return to normalcy, the CDC puts the virus into cryo-storage along with H1N1 and SARS, and we finally get to see how the virus originated in nature. For an otherwise taut and engaging film, it's a pretty anemic ending.",Contagion
252,Reel_starz,"A ""Contagion"" worth catching",8,26 September 2011,"In an interview, Steven Soderbergh once described Contagion as a horror movie. Truthfully, though, like the lethal disease around which it revolves, Soderbergh's latest film is hard to classify. Not quite a drama yet too talky to be considered an outright thriller, it teeters on that uncomfortable brink between Oscar bait and fall blockbuster, and ultimately, I wonder if it would entirely please either crowd; viewers expecting a fast-paced, high-octane action movie a la 28 Days Later will most likely be disappointed, and critics may decry the lack of character nuance. Nonetheless, that is not necessarily a bad thing. In a world in which every film is catered to a specific demographic, it's refreshing to find one that doesn't fit into a niche, one that cares more about telling a good, smart story than shattering box-office records and isn't afraid to divide audiences in the process. Although it doesn't transcend the prolific disaster genre, Contagion's brutal, ultra-realistic approach certainly gives it an edge.The movie's premise is familiar: a group of scientists races against the clock to stop a viral epidemic. In an increasingly cynical, post-9/11 world, the once-simple zombie/apocalypse/monster plot device has taken on new depth, permeating such diverse works as the freaky, science-gone-haywire neo-noir Fringe and Cormac McCarthy's bleak, introspective religious parable, The Road, and a genre once synonymous with gore and escapism turned into a plethora of allegory and satire; even the screwball British comedy Shawn of the Dead had a not-too-subtle message about consumerism. After a decade of zombies-as-metaphors, Contagion is pleasantly straightforward. Sure, there are some conspiracy theories and anti-government accusations thrown around here and there, voiced mostly by Jude Law's greedy, paranoid blogger, Alan Krumwiede, but for the most part, the movie is more concerned with scientific facts than political statements. This lack of self-aggrandizement is what primarily separates Contagion from its less remarkable contemporaries, and Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns should be applauded for their bold decision to keep their film grounded, even subdued, rather than exploiting the premise for maximum spectacle. It is grim, almost unrelentingly so, yet levelheaded, void of the usual end-of-day histrionics and action set pieces. The movie proceeds with such unsmiling, unbiased realism, in fact, that some parts feel as though they've been taken from a documentary or news program, merely telling you the details instead of trying to pull you into the story.Although it's a stretch to call Soderbergh's claim accurate, Contagion has an ample dose of horror elements. Like Hitchcock and Kubrick before him, Soderbergh knows that the key to suspense is not excessive gore or relentless action but atmosphere, an intricate, deliberate fusion of visuals and sound (not to mention a willingness to kill off seemingly essential characters). The Out of Sight and Ocean's Eleven director's renowned flair for technical ingenuity is on full display here, as he uses startling imagery and a dynamic, heart-pounding score by Cliff Martinez to overcome the believable yet mostly unremarkable script. Note in particular the haunting sequence in which the camera flashes to several worldwide locations, all totally void of human life; those shots, no more than two seconds each, are more powerful than any of the lengthy, methodical dialogue exchanges. The lighting, a wan yellow that anyone who's seen a Soderbergh project should recognize, gives the movie a dirty, claustrophobic quality, perfect for a flick about germs in crowded cities. Even throughout the lackluster middle section, the visual artistry should keep viewers engaged until the surprising, unforgettable last minutes. Also, unlike most actual horror movies, Contagion is just plain disturbing. Germaphobes beware: after seeing this, even the healthiest will think twice about touching a doorknob or shaking someone's hand.Much has been made about the movie's sprawling ensemble cast, which collectively holds four Oscar wins and about eleven nominations. However, despite his proved success in the critically lauded Traffic, Soderbergh doesn't quite pull off the multiple-storyline technique. Matt Damon, in the most interesting and emotionally demanding arc, is the standout; it's no wonder the clip featured most prominently in the marketing campaign is one of his. As a determined, quietly mourning father, he once again demonstrates what has made him one of the most reliable actors in Hollywood: his unusual ability to appear simultaneously commanding and understated, poised and down-to-earth. The rest of the actors are solid, and of them, Jude Law gives perhaps the most memorable performance, but they aren't helped by the inconsistency in their story lines. Marion Cotillard's subplot feels especially superfluous. In addition, the focus on plot and ambiance pushes the characters into the background, rendering them more like figures on a chess board than fully fleshed-out people with complex lives and personalities. They're defined almost exclusively by their actions, and their motivations are largely ambiguous. You could argue that this is intentional, an attempt to mirror the coldness and disconnection of the real world, but even so, the film's detachment makes the horror it depicts numbing when it should be tragic.Nonetheless, all the grimness makes the ending that much more resonant. There is one scene – I won't describe it for fear of spoilers, but those who have seen the movie will doubtless know to what I'm referring – that is simply breathtaking, both because it is crafted so exquisitely and because it is so unexpected. Poignant in its unabashed innocence, this scene is among the movie's best, if not the absolute best, a pitch-perfect juxtaposition of joy and sorrow, love and loss, future and past. In a movie so full of gloom, this moment lights up the screen like a candle in a dark room, a reminder that even in the face of such overwhelming despair, there is always hope.",Contagion
253,michaelberanek275,Big movie about very small things,9,11 June 2018,"Considering the film shows how methodical and painstaking work by government agencies can effect change, the movie clips along at a remarkable pace. it's a breathless roller coaster ride with plenty of science packed in nonetheless. An exponential ascending course is taken exactly like the epidemic. It begins with a slow-burning beginning where a host of characters are introduced, and then comes a building drama up to a fever pitch followed by a dreamy epilogue. There's a bunch of great actors who are wholly convincing and likable (despite limited screenplay help). The interlacing sub-plots work really well - characters are linked together by the virus and caught in the epidemiological timeframe. There's danger and dynamism in the story with some real shocks in store, and above all just brilliant direction that draws all the elements together and grabs the viewer by the seat of the pants.",Contagion
254,antimatter33,Superb film-making from Soderbergh,10,18 August 2012,"This is a gripping, tightly-wound tale whose seams and dramatic devices are few. It feels very real. As usual from Soderbergh, the editing is tight and kinetic, the shots beautifully framed. The visual style is perfectly suited to the subject matter. We meet heroes and villains and those just trying to get along.Some have criticized the film for lacking an explanation of the science of viruses. I have to disagree. In terms of just getting sick, we all know as much about viruses as we need to. If anything, I would object to the somewhat glib way in which answers are found. It must be harder work than we see in the film.The cast is large and excellent - the ensemble acting is right on the money. It's good to see Laurence Fishburne in a lead role again. Kate Winslett has an heroic scene of real emotional impact. The sub-plot involving the Marion Cotillard (Billy Frechete in ""Public Enemies"") character was I thought a little far-fetched, but did not harm the film materially. The Jude Law character is a man our blogging times and delightfully oily. He inspires one of the best quotes of recent times - ""Blogging is not writing, it's graffiti with punctuation"". This is said by Elliot Gould, who should have had a larger part.One thing that must be highlighted is the superb original music. This is done in the manner of Philip Glass and has a throbbing, kinetic quality that suggests both a ticking clock and a straining heart. Absolutely excellent and perfectly fitted to the action.Highly recommended. Five stars. Soderbergh can not only tell great stories, he weaves compelling visuals into them with artistry and superb craftsmanship. The ending knock me on my butt.-drl",Contagion

I can not imagine how people make films like ""Contagion"", especially at time when people think twice before paying for a movie ticket! Even though this movie has an all star cast, It has such a flat emotionless storyline that you will not give a damn if the characters live or die ! The characters are unimaginative clichés that serve the sole purpose of providing the actors with a reason to be in the movie. They a shallow, predictable and boring. This movie tries to focus on the greatness of the human existence, and fails miserably. The creators tried to squeeze in all of the stars they booked (cheaply I would imagine due to the crisis) but they did not give them enough screen time as to make something good out of their parts. So, you find yourself hoping that one of them dies towards the end, so the situation may become a bit more dramatic. No such luck ! The story is so flat that if it were a cardiogram, the patient would be dead ! Having said the above you can imagine that I do not recommend this movie.

261,MosHr,Not contagiously enthusiastic about the movie,6,6 September 2011,"Contagion uses the palette of intertwining and interweaving stories like Babel and Crash against the backdrop of a viral epidemic and boy do they have some wonderful talent among some of those story lines - Gwyneth Paltrow. Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Lawrence Fishburne and many more in smaller roles. This isn't a bio-thriller or whatever you'd call Outbreak but a more ""realistic"" view of how such an epidemic might go.However, the movie is a bit disappointing because after the gripping opening scenes, the story becomes ho-hum and moves in an inconsistent pace, practically screeching to a halt at the end. The movie cannot keep the focus and intensity up since we never get to know any of the characters and just have brief glimpses into their lives. Some of those intertwining stories are probably unnecessary and detract from the major themes.However, the worst part is that apart from the opening scenes, it can never quite give us a visualization of an epidemic. There are many many facets to an epidemic that's explored through the storylets, from the people in the CDC to the average husband, father etc but it always has to resort to simplistic table talks to tell us the status of the epidemic. We never get a iconic image of an epidemic in the movie, lots and lots of talk and people doing things but not the feeling of being in a middle of an epidemic.Hong Kong and China are given the claustrophobic and borderline dirty impression, images of sick Chinese perhaps meant to be perhaps impactful - all the while being standard fare. Back in the states, the images lock into medical drama visuals and it's the same ho-hum we see on TV everyday. We get lots of the TV Fishburne and heaps of the low budget movie inconsistent blabber that tries to imply everything without really meaning anything. All the while the virus never manages to feel more than a big nuisance rather than a global disaster.I suppose intertwining story based on viral epidemic is a brave and interesting experiment for a movie; it's just that the story sidelines the epidemic for human drama and the movie itself is never able to provide a strong enough visceral canvas and background of the raging viral epidemic to really drive the human drama home. Despite showing promise at the beginning of the movie, it slowly drifts into forgettable territory.",Contagion
262,Gin-ster,Inexplicably bland and flat,4,26 February 2012,"My husband and I both felt that the movie was a big ""nothing."" It had all the pieces of a thriller, but there was never an emotional connection with anyone or any event. It came across as completely flat and I can't really put my finger on why that's the case. It had expert acting from Lawrence Fishburne, Matt Damon and Kate Winslet, and it didn't have any corny Hollywoodish touches. For example, SPOILER HERE, when Matt's wife died, I figured ""Well, that has to happen to let us know this is big stuff."" Then when the young son got sick, I thought ""Hmmm, they'll never let the cute kid die - Hollywood wouldn't allow that."" But lo and behold, the cute kid died. Ultimately, even a main character (SPOILER - Winslet's character) dies, again, ""not Hollywood,"" but still, I did not feel even slightly moved by this or any other scene, and believe me, it's not hard to get me crying while watching movies. There were some other areas that fell flat - what the heck was Elliot Gould's character doing? Also, Jude Law's character was just an annoying distraction - and who the heck was that guy he was meeting all the time?. But if I'd enjoyed the film otherwise, I might've overlooked the lack of clarity at times. So, while I can't really account for it, ""bland and flat"" describes this film, in my view.",Contagion

Kate Winslet rushes about trying to look concerned, and trying even harder to do a convincing American accent. She fails miserably on both counts.But worst of all is Jude Law who plays an Australian journalist. He's trying to do the accent too, and he fails.

266,jon-c-ison,Reasonable portrayal of pandemic in very lacklustre film,4,13 August 2019,"As a realistic portrayal of a runaway pandemic of a virulent super-dangerous pathogen, the film did a passable job - so far as it went - but as a enjoyable movie it flops massively. On the upside, the portrayal of the series of events in the months following an initial outbreak - done as a pastiche of scenes - are realistic and not overhyped - more well informed than any movie I've seen. The treatment is shallow though, a deeper exploration of effects on vital services, infrastructure, economy, law and order etc (all mostly ignored), would have been interesting. As a movie it's very poor; completely lacklustre, boring even, with a lot of time wasted on pointless filler. And the scenes have no narrative cohesion at all, really none beyond them illustrating the effects of different pandemic stages. The acting is OK or even good, but there's no material to work with, no storyline (beyond the dry unfolding of illustrated events), fairly weak characters, no character development, no tension, no drama. Which equals boredom. Amazing, considering the subject matter. You'll have as much entertainment reading the events from a spreadsheet, as watching this. Find a good documentary instead.",Contagion

Even though at many points the pace is held slow the movie doesn't get boring and as it shows you the public in panic the director absolutely scored! The film does not scare away to include aspects of politics, the internet's power and basically every character here is potentially vulnerable.

269,markdroulston,Felt like it should have been better,6,9 November 2011,"Few filmmakers have the ability to draw the same kind of star power as Steven Soderbergh, and his latest film Contagion is no exception. In fact, it might be his most star-studded film to date, with a mixture of huge lead names and excellent character actors all coming together in a film that, unfortunately but perhaps unsurprisingly, bites off a little more than it can chew. That's not to say Contagion isn't good; it's arguably the most frightening film of the year, and the massive cast largely turn in solid performances, but the relatively brief running time (106 minutes) sees some of the story threads left underdeveloped, while some could arguably have been jettisoned altogether.Contagion documents the spread of a mystery disease outbreak named MEV- 1, and how people, fed by the media, deal with the epidemic, and it's in this aspect that the film shines. It's familiar cinematic ground that has had some mixed results in the past, with movies like The Andromeda Strain and Outbreak being decent examples, but Soderbergh presents the subject matter in a much more realistic way. Not known for being overly flashy in his direction, Soderbergh takes a much more objective stance, simply letting events unfold in a credible fashion, and the level of research he must have done is clear to see in the procedural, bureaucratic handling from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and various other governmental agencies. There is some subtle visual flair however, with the majority of the film shot in sickly green and yellow tones, and lingering shots on door handles, hand rails and the like, driving home the concept of our lack of awareness concerning the spread of disease, and how easily a virus like MEV-1 could get out of control in the real world. There are plot holes, but for the most part the scenario is a believable and terrifying one.Where Contagion is less successful however is in its treatment of the viral nature of modern media, and how the internet and social media have changed the spread of information across the globe. There are brief mentions of phenomena such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, but the idea that the internet is feeding the developing panic isn't quite fleshed out enough. The biggest problem comes down to Jude Law's character, blogger Alan Krumwiede. It's an interesting idea to place a freelance, whistle-blowing character at the centre of the panic surrounding MEV-1, but given that Soderbergh is juggling several other story threads simultaneously, Krumwiede's presence simply doesn't have the impact he should. Soderbergh clearly wants to critique this concept of unaccountable journalism and fearmongering within the blogosphere, but Law's over-the-top, mustache twirling performance doesn't fit the film's tone, and the issues surrounding Krumwiede and his alleged homeopathic 'cure', while again potentially interesting, aren't pursued enough to be compelling. Soderbergh tries to show as many aspects of the crisis as he can, yet had he excised one of the less vital stories (perhaps those concerning Marion Cotillard or Elliott Gould), the pervasiveness of the internet in the media could have been explored in much more depth, using the disease as an effective macguffin to examine media-fuelled panic in society.A new Steven Soderbergh film is always worthy of discussion, especially given that, if we are to believe the director himself, we're unlikely to see too many more of them. Contagion is a textbook example of the adage that 'less is more', and while it presents a realistically unsettling story, ultimately the film tries to do to much and loses some impact as a result. You will possibly walk out of the cinema more mindful of the unseen dangers that are all around, but because of its mis-steps, Contagion isn't as frightening, or simply as good as it feels like it should be.tinribs27.wordpress.com",Contagion

While in real life the tragedy would still be there, it's clearly meant to lessen it here. He's one of those in the film we have the greatest chance of sympathizing and connecting with in his horrible journey, and then it turns out it's really not that big a deal. His wife was cheating on him and that wasn't his kid. Why do that? What purpose does that serve in the film other than to elicit a temporary ""oh no she didn't?!"" from the audience? It caused much more harm to our emotional response to the film than the paltry little transient twist and surprise positively contributed.

We see people in different cities around the world begin to get infected. Our attention is drawn to their fingers, palms, doorknobs, glasses, and hugs, through which we see the virus transmit. It is earlier than 10 minutes when we see one of the main characters die.Experts start to responce. They try to assess how serious it is, and every minute they find it more serious than they thought. While medical officers try to trace and contain the transmission route, the lab scientists examine the samples to figure out the cure. As the number of cases and death toll rise, people begin to react in panic. A conspiracy theorist tries to take advantage of it.Amazingly talented actors line up on the cast. The characters, however, do not necessarily interact with each other. Plot for each character paralells another, each wandering without knowing the goal. The film goes in a quiet tone all along. There is no wailing for losses nor catharsis for achievements. You might even miss where a scientific breakthrough happens.The film is now reviving its popularity because of the current novel coronavirus outbreak. I myself watched it for the first time because of it. I found it surprisingly coincide with what is happening now, except our corona is, fortunately, much less deadlier.In a meeting of local officers, a medical officer played by Kate Winslet explains on a white board what ""R nought"" is -- it is the number of how many people an infected person will transmit to.

Everything is what we have seen for the last few months.For us in the middle of this situation, it would be felt very unrealistic if it was a film where glorified heroes went through a struggle and eventually defeated a calamity with a climatic ending. Fighting an epidemic is not a fight of win or lose. It is a fight of how you keep alert, what risk you take, whose words you believe, and how you accept losses. ""Contagion"" is exactly all about it.",Contagion
275,jwpicton,Jaw dropping,8,12 April 2020,"In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic its easy to sing the praises of this film but the similarities are jaw droppingly accurate - from bats to handwashes, panic buying to handshakes, it has become a film for our time. Clearly some very level headed research has gone into the making of this. Many of us, most of us, view happenings in life as having a beginning and an end, and then we move on. Absolutely, that's healthy psychologically, but if recent events are anything to go by, this film portends of more to come. As a story it's a little ""clinical"" but it's extremely well acted directed etc. It also shows how close we can come to anarchic behaviour in such a short space of time.
This film does not suffer from improbable catastrophising.

That is what her husband and the rest of the world are asking as this unknown virus multiplies in ""Contagion"". This frighteningly real film continues in this fashion as more and more people die from this infection, which places the world in a state of panic. There are some aspects of this movie that well done, and it is quite gripping but the many characters are not as deep as they should be. There were only a small few characters that I actually cared about. For instance, I would have been fine with the writers completely removing Jude Law's character from the script. I found him uninteresting annoying.

For that reason it would be easy to simply give this movie a 10, but points are lost for the standard end of the world archaic behaviour and burning down of buildings which movies always seem to make look unbelievable.Also the Jude Law character who seems to be a focal point, but never quite gets a conclusion.As a movie the story arc is steadily paced with a perfect level of anticipation and each character is given enough development to make you care about them.If only for the corona virus similarities this is a must watch and I'm surprised more people are not shouting about it.",Contagion
279,trcky1,Technically sound but lacks a soul,4,13 September 2011,"I struggled with rating this film after I saw it. On the one hand, it's very technically sound and precise, with very few wasted scenes or shots. However, the clinical and sterile vibe left it feeling a bit soulless. There are strong performances by Damon and Fishburne, but too many subplots and story lines detracted from the pace and kept me from feeling deeply invested in any of the characters. Still, there are a few elements worth seeing in Contagion. The film is signature Soderbergh with its stylish score, edits, and montages. I also enjoyed the portrayal of events that occur given a potential pandemic after the foundations of society and industry are halted.So my decision between rating it 4 to 6 out of 10 hinged on this question I asked myself: was watching the film worth my time? If I knew how I'd feel about it before I saw it, would I have gone ahead and watched it if I had the free time? It's a pretty close decision, but I think I would have passed on it if I knew how cold it turned out to be.",Contagion

There are perhaps a few too many fractured story lines to really maximise the dramatic impact of the overall narrative, and the somewhat overly starry cast are occasionally in danger of impacting negatively on the documentary feel. As a result Contagion does somewhat give the impression of a TV movie that got lucky with the level of talent involved, but it does what it needs to do with understated yet brutal effectiveness and sets a new high-water mark for the epidemic disaster sub-genre.",Contagion

It is almost eerie to see how well the movie depicts the situation, the information and all the measures that need to be taken. That is for the first part. Later we see scenes of rioting, looting and burglary, turning cities into war zones. This seems to be a typical reflex of a reaction to disaster in many movies. It is harrowing that when the whole world stocks up in toilet paper, canned food and pasta in the US the most sold products are guns.
The present outbreak shows that at least until now we see the opposite of the downward spiral as depicted in the movie. People are social and altruistic, even for poor people sharing their little food with others in even less circumstances.

""The Andromeda Strain"" (1971) was an excellent film, particularly considering what was known at the time. This one adds nothing. It came across to me as a kind of CDC propaganda movie, though I don't think that organization had anything to do with this film (former CDC people may have been consulted, but that would be no surprise). The major ""problem"" I have with these kinds of films involves all the things we've been told to fear since the HIV/AIDS era, nearly thirty years ago.Now I'm not telling you not to never wash your hands, but it's clear that the experts don't understand the reality of the situation. I'm old enough to remember our leaders telling us that HIV/AIDS would sweep through the heterosexual population of the US, killing millions by the early 1990s. That did not happen. Then there was ""Mad Cow."" And swine flu. And West Nile. And _____________.I'm tired of it. They clearly don't understand what's going on, but they want to frighten us for some reason, perhaps to keep their funding coming in. In any case, I would still watch a film like ""Contagion"" if it provided more than this kind of apparently unrealistic scenario, but it did not. There was nothing more than fear-mongering here, and it was boring fear-mongering!

Granted it is good to come out with movies like this every now and then, this one is just as typical as any other movie of its kind. Your pretty much are going to know what is going to happen as you watch the film. They throw a little relationship drama in the mix, but I felt like it wasn't needed. It was a descent sub plot, but it didn't have nothing to do with the movie as a whole. I felt like it was unnecessary drama.If you are a big fan of these kinds of movies, than by all means buy it on DVD. If not, you don't need to see this. I'm giving this movie a 7 out of 10.

I appreciated that it had a more realistic approach to how a virus would work, and how a cure would be developed, but honestly, I was quite bored. It looked more like a documentary rather than a movie, and it wasn't that good. Most of the scenes that were shown and the characters didn't have a connection to each other. It seemed like they had their own world. I think four subparts were shown, and they switched at random. Sometimes you'll be confused as to which subpart you are. You won't feel any attachment to anyone, so why even stick around? I don't get the point of having lead characters that don't have any effect on the plot. We only need the doctor, and possibly the first carrier. Sometimes it seems that they want to fight for something during the scenes, but it doesn't seem like that's the focus, so you'll just brush it aside. Also, you are supposed to fear what they are experiencing, yet it doesn't feel that way.SHOULD YOU WATCH IT: No, I think there are better documentaries than this.

292,richy1024,"Never mind 3D glasses, this film requires a full body masking suit.",7,7 October 2012,"Oscar winning performers and a director with a professional know-how, this film already pounces on us with potential.A deadly virus circulates the globe to devastating effect by the touch of a hand or a harmless sneeze, attaching itself to Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) in Hong Kong only for her to bring the virus to Chicago. It soon begins to infiltrate the world's wall, entering all countries making people feel woozy, twitchy and soon after pitching on the ground with foam escaping the mouth. The intriguing aspect here is the pace of the movie, it moves hastily, rather symbolic of the disease spreading at a haunting rate. The narrative becomes investigatory, inviting us to become members of Ellis Cheever's (Laurence Fishburne) and Erin Mears' (Kate Winslet) specialist detection squad. Throughout Contagion's duration we our questioning what, where and why this has occurred, until we arrive at a rather apprehensive and potentially pragmatic culmination. Jude Law's Alan Krumwiede adds a variety controversy with his journalistic tricks and publishing of a salubrious Chinese alleviate called Forsythia.The film is vastly intellectual, using repetitive jargon and scientific theories way beyond the academic level of an eighteen year old. For once we are fed a virus that doesn't involve the trotting deceased. The germ becomes a bit of a cult throughout. It begins as a small everyday microbe and turns lethal within days. It's like gentleman's flu but more dynamic in its willingness to eradicate its victim. In turn of its intelligence it also projects the denial of science, attempting to illustrate the awareness of the disease but ultimately taking too long to find a cure. Although Forsythia drops in to aid its effect is of minuscule proportions, too little, too tardy and merely not enough to go around for everyone.Soderbergh's imagery of the influenza harassment is rather scholarly. We visualise loneliness before death, the absent-mindedness to cover your mouth with your hands, the burning rage of ignorance to wash your hands and Soderbergh's point of view of the blurriness of death whilst lying in stillness waiting for the delusion of the light at the end of the tunnel to fade. Contagion's sense of panic emotionally intertwines itself within the viewer, leaving us restless and conceivably wandering if one day something as simple as not bathing your hands for a few ticks could become peril.",Contagion
293,MC1-Bjornson,"""Contagion"" isn't that Contagous",6,29 December 2011,"""Contagion"" (2011), Rated ""PG-13"" for Adult Situations, Language, Mild Violence and Mild Gore. Running Time: 1hr&46min. – Two & 1/2 Stars (out of Four) ""Contagion"" is pretty much everything you would expect from a film of its premise. When I first looked at the theatrical poster for ""Contagion,"" I was reminded of the disaster movie posters of the 1970s. Those posters didn't really tell you much of anything beyond the theme of tonight's disaster and boasted a laundry list of big-name stars inside their own picture boxes. Many of those films were over-hyped B-grade attempts to capitalize on previous disaster films. ""Contagion"" somewhat follows suit, but with a few original twists in terms of style and execution.The film opens with Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow), a Minnesota-based marketing director, returning home after a business trip to Hong Kong. Before leaving Hong Kong, she was exposed to a lethal new virus. During a layover in Chicago, Beth cheats on her husband Mitch (Matt Damon), and unleashes the deadly virus there.In just days, the airlines unwittingly transport the fatal virus around the world. In the following weeks, people are dying by the millions. Some of the problems that crop up from the outbreak include funeral homes refusing to perform services for these victims (fearing exposure to the virus), running out of body bags (though more might be coming in from Canada) and people are being buried in mass graves.Government agencies, scientists and pharmaceutical companies work to isolate the virus and develop a vaccine for it. Even if they are successful, the time necessary for mass production and distribution of the vaccine would take several months to years.The film chronicles the epidemic from various perspectives from many characters, with no one person as the main character. These people range from average folks like victim-widower Mitch and his teenage daughter to the people tracking the threat like Dr. Cheever (Lawrence Fishburne) with the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.Director Steven Soderbergh overall succeeds in making a realistic take on public health and scientific response to a pandemic. Soderbergh addresses several situations including mass panic, borderline anarchy, corporate and personal agendas, ethics (in spades), government conspiracies (as alleged by the popular blogger Alan Krumwiede, played by Jude Law) and the quest for a resolution to crisis.For a film with such an ensemble cast of top-name players, you can't help to want them to do a little more than comment on the new pandemic, wonder how to stop it and how to survive it. The viewer doesn't get to know the characters as people at all. They simply exist to take the audience from Point A to Point B and nothing more. Take the case of the Matt Damon character: Both his wife and step son die within hours of each other during the plague's initial outbreak. For a double-whammy loss, Damon sure seems somewhat devoid of any emotion about losing half his family in one grand sweep. All he wants to do is be released from his medical quarantine and go home to his daughter. With the world is such upheaval, I noticed no one in ""Contagion"" ever sheds one tear over this international viral crisis, nor do they tell anyone ""I love you"" during this trying time.Visually, ""Contagion"" is a relatively dark, grim and colorless film to look at. This provides the atmosphere of a constant sense of dread throughout. Cliff Martinez's music score, tonal in its approach, is appropriately foreboding without any grand themes. It serves as an ample narrative to underscore the seriousness of the global dilemma at hand.""Contagion"" is well-made, yet it comes across as a strangely bland film. Despite its craft, it feels remorseless and devoid of any personality. The acting is top-notch, yet the characters feel underdeveloped. The slower pacing and a lack of a satisfying climax will likely draw complaints by some viewers. Maybe those items aren't necessary in a film like this, but I couldn't help but want a little more by the time all was said and done.",Contagion

So I suggest it is better to watch it for 15-20 minutes each with breaks to contemplate, and you'll definitely like it better, like a TV series with short episodes. I promise it will have no effect on the storytelling, as it is not a traditional film; so you should have no problem from the start & pause. It creates and resolves mini problems within a 15 minute time frame, with only the bigger ones solved in the end one by one. It's a hyperlink cinema.Now I don't claim this is a 10/10 movie, but the ratings for this movie is so crazy low & unfairly so. There are worse shallow movies with higher ratings. Somebody needs to even the balance. This is not a movie to expect entertainment from, but to get some education & see some possible truth about our society in times of distress. So watch only if you want to learn & get rewarded in the end. We always see only statistics & measures in news everyday & frontline interviews, but this movie shows us insights that can't be seen in the news.If you want entertainment there are far many other Science Fiction movies about viral outbreaks like 12 Monkeys, I am Legend, Zombieland, World War Z, Warm Bodies, Planet Terror, Rec, Train to Busan, 28 Days Later, Resident Evil, Dawn of the Dead, Shawn of the Dead, etc; but this movie, on the other hand is more about science than fiction. So get some, or don't, but please don't misunderstand it & don't let that be the reason you hate this. Everything is not about entertainment, especially when the movie never claimed it to be.Fair warning : This movie is not for Anti-Vaxxers & that doctor who propagated the anti-vaccine movement & had his licence revoked due to factual error in research. It may hurt the ego of such people, but they should watch it anyway.Once again, vaccine is not a chemical like antivirals; it's the viral agent itself, but weakened, modified or killed to destroy a live one of its own kind should it try to enter your body in the future, as your body itself naturally builds up immunity against the specific virus. And it only or mainly works as a precaution, not as a cure, except in rare cases. So get vaccinated when you still have the chance, especially against deadly incurable/hard-to-cure diseases that are prevalent in the place you live; because antivirals almost never work like antibiotics do with guarantee! Prevention is better than cure, because the cure is chemicals which you wanted to stay away from, whereas the prevention is totally not! Also, it will not only save yourself, but also the world.

While it's captivating throughout, I couldn't help but feel like I was stuck in biology class now and then, particularly scenes that delved extensively into the genetic analysis of the virus. But I am content to have learned a few things about r nought (the reproduction number of a virus/infection), fomites, and how crap-my-pants scary Gwyneth Paltrow's hospital scene really is on a gigantic cinema screen.This isn't much of a thriller. It's more of a slick, stylized, fictionalized docu-drama that is very bleak and pensive with a CSI element to it. It's a sobering look into what could realistically happen during and after a pandemic outbreak. It's pro-science/pro-medicine.

Two days later she collapses in a fit of seizures, dying in the hospital shortly thereafter. Her husband, Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon), returns to find their son (Griffin Kane) dead of the same disease. As Mitch and his daughter Jory (Anna Jacoby-Heron) attempt to survive both the spreading plague and societal breakdown, the CDC - headed by Dr. Ellis Cheever (Lawrence Fishburne) - attempt to trace the genesis of the virus and create a vaccine. Rear Admiral Lyle Haggerty (Bryan Cranston) heads the U.S. efforts to contain the spread of the virus (at least in the United States) while World Health Organization epidemiologist Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) is abducted in Hong Kong by colleague Sun Feng (Chin Han) in an attempt to blackmail the Chinese government for enough vaccinations to inoculate his village. Meanwhile, freelance journalist, blogger and conspiracy theorist Krumwiede (Jude Law) propagates the use of Forsythia to combat the disease, which he claims cured him.""Contagion"" is every bit the film that ""Outbreak"" (1995) tried so desperately to be - an intelligently written, tightly directed and compellingly acted multi-protagonist film that traces the genesis, spread and subsequent effects (military quarantine, social breakdown, emotional human drama, desperate race for a cure) of an omnipresent super virus. Unlike its notable predecessor, however, ""Contagion"" never falls prey to cliché (notably the ""misfired nuke"" which prevents a town from being eradicated after a cure was discovered at the end of ""Outbreak"").The film sustains a palpable suspense from its first scene (which depicts the sickening Mrs. Emhoff the day after she contracted the virus) to its finale (which shows the true genesis of the virus). This mounting suspense is achieved through the carefully administered depiction of societal collapse alongside its dryly executed timeline of the outbreak.Mitch's actions throughout the film are born out of equal measures of love and paranoia for his daughter, his only surviving family. His hostility toward her boyfriend are among the most memorable moments of the film - heartbreaking, yet coldly rational. The family's eventual catharsis (Matt finally being allowed to grieve and Jory's emotional reunion with her boyfriend) perfectly capture the film's binary tones (catastrophic loss and eventual triumph).The fact that this film is capable of achieving so much so well is a truly outstanding accomplishment. It is able to show the devastating breadth of the global epidemic while simultaneously placing a human face on the tragedy. Dr. Mears' (Kate Winslet) death, Dr. Cheever's guilt over inadvertently sending Dr. Mears to her death (and subsequent attempts to keep his loved ones alive) and Mitch's struggle to keep both himself and his daughter alive all succeed at personalizing the epidemic (and its effects) without falling into the trap of being too cheesy or schmaltzy. Furthermore, it manages numerous disconnected (and radically different) plot lines and characters without becoming a jumbled, incomprehensible mess (which is more than most multi-protagonist films can boast).This is hands-down the best film so far this year and the best non-zombie themed virus film ever made. If I had my way, this would be standard viewing in every secondary-level health class in the country for its realistic depiction of viral spread. Fans of ""Outbreak"" (1995) and other like-themed films, as well as suspenseful, thrilling and dramatic films, should find something to enjoy in ""Contagion."" Don't be confused by the horror-centric advertising - which paints it as a cross between ""Outbreak"" (1995) and ""Cabin Fever"" (2002) - however, as ""Contagion"" is far from what it portrays itself as.",Contagion

303,Davor_Blazevic_1959,"Fictional viral outbreak plausibly dramatized in docu-like fashion in an ""effort to accurately represent the science... entertain as well as educate""",7,7 October 2011,"Stephen Soderbergh's latest direction, ""Contagion"" (2011), even though bringing less than expected excitement, is an absorbing movie to watch, efficient as a social and behavioural study, but no less as an accomplished collection of individual case studies, offering sufficiently thought-provoking arguments, such as the fact that--despite all the scientific advances and exhaustive efforts of the thousands of specialists--humankind still stands pretty helpless in the prevention of new viral outbreaks and their many strains occurring globally, when even seemingly well organised societies easily slip into chaos, leaving all individuals to fend for themselves in the ultimate fight for survival, all further fuelled by unstoppable leaks (however, lucrative sensationalism, as well) on an almost inevitable, mutually supportive (money and power shouldn't mix, but mostly they do) corporal and governmental cover-ups. Surely it is a disturbing reminder that even at the most difficult of times, humanity's good traits still get so easily overpowered by the seed of all evil--selfishness and greed.Many good actors partake in the movie: Kate Winslet, Matt Damon, Jude Law, Jennifer Ehle, Marion Cotillard, Laurence Fishburne, Elliott Gould, to name a few, though one cannot expect remarkable character development when action is dispersed and story spread on so many leads. Nevertheless, Soderbergh knows how to make people count and, albeit somewhat shy about it, he's sufficiently confident in decisive difference their increasingly frequent, self-sacrificing actions could make, having faith in ultimately predominant selflessness and benevolence, kindness and compassion, whether among pre-organised, or ad hoc gathered communities, down to the last individual, rediscovering--now under extreme conditions--their altruism and, as implied in a reserved hope raised towards the end, having--this way or another--humanism in humankind still prevail.Ian Lipkin, the university professor and epidemiologist, who serves as the director of Columbia University's Center for Infection and Immunity, agreed to assist as medical consultant in the making of ""Contagion"" because the film was ""an effort to accurately represent the science and to make a movie that would entertain as well as educate.""",Contagion

Some people look at the cast and seem to think - WOW! This is going to be like Jason Bourne -vs- Morpheus in the AI Spiderman Hot Zone!!! Please.This is a fairly paced imagining of what a superflu outbreak would be like. The story is thoughtful, solid, and very realistic, covering all the themes of man-at-his-worst, paranoia, helplessness, being overwhelmed, etc... It doesn't veer into any hard-to-believe covert action nonsense that so fills the cinemas these days. There's no black-ops CDC teams, alien genetics, or grim revenge raids on high-security quarantine facilities.Sorry.

307,Thomas-Giffin,Fascinating.,7,30 April 2012,"Contagion, a 2011 medical based thriller posing an eerily accurate depiction of a lethal epidemic. Created with assistance from the CDC, the film spans a period of time from discovery through control to cure with (seemingly) a very high level of accuracy.Steven Soderbergh very ably intertwines several individual narratives and characters successfully, each one a different aspect and angle of the epidemic. Also, considering the not terrible cast list (wiki), Soderbergh controls every aspect of this complex and intelligent film with a mastery of balancing the micro with the macro, mainly by using Matt Damon.Damon is the emotional core of the film, whilst other characters face trials and hardships, it is Damon's character the film returns to as the small-scale individual effect of the large scale epidemic. Other characters work for the CDC or WHO, others are scientists or epidemiologists but Damon is just a man, a human being on the ground. His story is therefore the most painful, emotional and scary. Damon himself is more than capable of carrying the film on his own, acting with aplomb.The film was described to me as a medical horror, a term I found didn't do the film justice. It was not horrifying in the way I had assumed, I would say it was more of a medical thriller. It makes you think and uses suspense and tension rather than exploiting a fear which horror films usually do. I personally did not find the film scary, I found it a fascinating study of what would (probably) happen if a very nasty epidemic did spread.Although if you are a germaphobe, you will be terrified. Soderbergh lingers the camera on surfaces that could and would cause a contagion to spread, you end up being able to trace the spread back to its Ground Zero as the characters do.One of my main problems with the film was that I found it very hard to place events that occur within the overall narrative structure. It is not an overly long film but characters would get sick, recover or whatever and I couldn't place if the narrative was near the end. I suppose this adds to the realism but it wasn't structured like a regular film. It threw me off at several points where I assumed the end of the film and yet it continued. Overall, I was very impressed with the technical ability of the film, the soundtrack adds a nasty electronic pulsing to the proceedings which helped the film's tone. The main successes of the film are the near real feel of it as well as using one character as the emotional core of the film to identify mostly with.Impressive, and interesting.",Contagion

The beginning of the movie teases that something is going to happen. It sort of starts to happen. The middle of the movie teases that something is going to happen. But the government is all rather relaxed, and seems to have a lid on things. They got their top scientists on it, and they are going to sort it all out. And the end... well, that's what happens... nothing. They find a cure. distribute a cure. and that's it.There was no real tension to speak of. The main protagonist found out his wife and (i don't know if was his kid or step-kid or what) died from the disease, and that he was somehow immune. He doesn't seem particularly phased by this news though. Perhaps he is one of those psychopathic people with no human emotions, but you'd think there would be at least one outburst of ""well, that's completely ruined christmas"".The people talk about millions dying in this movie with all the stale banality of a quarterly sales presentation.There was also a minor kidnapping of a character by the chinese. no-one cares. Nothing happened. I didn't care about that character. I don't even remember what their job was or their name.One of the main characters at the CDC tells a family member. they get out of danger. they are fine. nothing happens. He gets told he will speak before the congress for his actions. that's the last we heard of that. nothing happens.Everyone in this movie acts as though they don't care. Even the weak Alex Jones character... nothing really happens to him either. His story goes LITERALLY NO-WHERE.$60 million went on this. I am telling you where it went.... most of it went to mouldy old Hollywood stars with nothing else to do on a wet weekend to sit there and look mildly perturbed for an hour and a half. It didn't go in the sets, or special effects, that is for sure. They hired a stadium for a couple of days shooting, they had a few black vehicles drive up and down, they filmed one street full of garbage (pick any street in downtown chicago to film that), and they did lots of establishing shots of the CDC, and they had a lab where they were looking at viruses that looked more like the basement of a hospital building than a super high tech virus research laboratory. Probably the same hospital building where they filmed the doctor sawing off the top of the dead girls head.i was expecting aerial footage of washington DC on fire, as the president is hastily flown away because people have over-run the military blockade and are panicking and shooting everyone. I expected the only shipment of the cure that was being delivered to the CDC to be looted by a heavily armed mob of hoodlums and destroyed in the cross-fire.When I watch a movie about a deadly pandemic virus, I DO NOT WANT IT TO END IN A GOD-DAMN PROM NIGHT DANCE.",Contagion

I found that really refreshing. The makers of CONTAGION created a realistic feeling world where the biggest obstacles are egos, government bureaucracies and the human instinct for self-preservation.

313,BlizzyFoxTF,"Realistic while rich with ideas and commentary, coupled with great storytelling by Soderburgh.",8,10 April 2020,"Rich in both substance and style, Soderburgh was on fire in this deft, haunting, accurately realist depiction of a global virus outbreak, prescient of the events that would take place 9 years later with covid-19.The sharp cuts and meticulous script form an intriguing narrative that balances several distinct plotlines surrounding characters from different walks of life, medical workers, normal citizens, journalists etc. The film is both small and large. It is great storytelling with tremendous versatility and intelligence. I can recall many particular shots in the film where the context isn't really clear and the viewers have to decipher the meaning themselves. Soderburgh is a great filmmaker.""We are putting healthy people next to sick people and hoping the healthy people don't get sick."" - Lawrence Fishburne's characterThe virus is not the only enemy in a pandemic, and as pop culture has taught us in zombie apocalypses, people is just as if not more menacing of a threat. Almost every party in the film is morally ambiguous. No character is perfect, even the doctors in this case. There is an interesting scene in the middle where two major characters engage in a debate where they accuse each other of their wrongdoings. Both claims are based, and yet in this perpetual one-upmanship for the higher moral ground, what good is done? It is dystopian society portrayed at its most realistic, a scary reflection of modern society even, where many hideous predictions have already befallen on humanity in 2020.As of now, I am still waiting for the day when the governement randomly draws birth dates from a lottery machine to decide which group of people they give the first batch of vaccines to. It is dark humor that could actually come true.The wealth of ideas and Soderburgh's creative storytellings give this film a unique flare, with a lot of details and messages to decipher after the credits roll. I had a blast throughout the film. The ending is brilliant, winding back the clock and answering a very basic yet overlooked question regarding the situation, somehow giving the film's story its perfect closure.

I can watch the goriest horror movie, and not be scared, even in the slightest. But ""Contagion"" got under my skin. It has more effect than even the most well-done horror movie, yet, it's not really a horror movie at all. It's mostly a psychological disaster film, and at one point, it feels like something of a docudrama, and then it morphs into a humane psychology story, and has overtones of the power of paranoia and fear that start when the film begins, and don't end until the last, satisfying moments.""Contagion"" is director Steven Soderbergh's first feature this year. A few years ago, he directed two films in the same year, Matt Damon comedy-thriller studio-produced vehicle ""The Informant!"" and porn star Sasha Grey's first mainstream (albeit indie) film, ""The Girlfriend Experience"". This year, he repeats himself, doing two films in the same year, this, and the upcoming independent action thriller ""Haywire"". I'm intrigued to see that one as well, but I can't see it being any better than ""Contagion"".""Contagion"" scared the living crap out of me. It follows characters, living throughout the world, all effected by a mysterious pandemic that threatens the lives of everyone. It's something like bird flu, but not quite. It has the worldwide reaction that H1N1 had on the world, but worse. It becomes a government conspiracy tale, that proves that something of this catastrophic weight is not a cut-and-dry kind of thing. There are twists coming from each imaginable angle. The biggest mystery is how this thing began, which isn't ignored, like I thought it would be.One thing that ""Contagion"" has going for it, is a lot of big names. Kate Winslet, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow. Everybody brings more to the table than you expect them to. Each character's story becomes vital to how the story unfolds, and, even as it begins to delude into something of a cut-and-dry docudrama, it pulls the wool out from under your eyes, and surprises you with realistic, yet not melodramatic emotion, and becomes quite the emotionally draining and devastating tale, leaving such an impression on the audience, making this one impossible to tune out.I choose, for this review, not to really get into each character's story, because, one, it would take up too much time, and two, it's much better experienced, not knowing very much about it, as the story unfolds.It'll stick with you for longer than you expect it to. I read advance reviews before seeing it today, that claim that leaving the theatre, no one in the audience spoke about it, or touched anyone, or contacted with anyone around them. Paranoia is a main ingredient to ""Contagion"", proving that no one is immune to fear that is unspoken, but completely pinpointed, and like I said, impossible to ignore. Seeing an afternoon show, in the college town where I live with a few friends of mine, I didn't quite experience this. However, it's completely believable. It leaves you in such a state of paranoia and euphoria, that it's maddening, considering that there aren't many films like this nowadays.Another thing that ""Contagion"" has going for it is how it's made. Soderbergh doesn't waste any time here. Keeping it concise, at a humane running time (105 minutes), it's a roller-coaster from the very first unsettling scene, right up until the last frame. It's written in a way that feels overall very clinical and to-the-point, yet becomes an emotional journey that makes you feel something for each one of its characters. The scariest thing about ""Contagion"" is its plausibility. Unlike your regular horror movie, it has a base which actually could happen, and has happened, in the past. The scares come from things that human beings encounter every day. No ghosts or zombies (in the literal sense of the world) pop out and scare you, while the typical ominous, trying-to-be scary score plays in the background. It's proof that the quietest movies can be the most terrifying. There's a horrifying atmosphere about this one, that sneaks up on you when you least expect it to. This is compelling stuff, don't miss it.Grade: A-",Contagion
317,jmcfrancis,"Good, but full of holes",7,29 December 2011,"Contagion will make you think. The underlying premise is real enough to hit home hard. It is similar to the writings of J.G. Ballard, who liked to reflect on what-if scenarios in his books. This is a what-if and one that could easily happen today. Perhaps Contagion's time scale is a bit fast, but the idea of a deadly virus spreading so quickly and catching the world off guard is not really fantasy.Steven Soderbergh once again shows he can handle an ensemble cast and still maintain a story bigger than all of its parts. The deft handling of the roles, in particular the characters played by Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Winslet, give a lot of weight to the events. A sense of panic and urgency never leaves the room, making this a sobering experience.Unfortunately it wallows in shallowness as well. Jude Law's blogger character is an unfair caricature of Internet media (amplified by a total lack of any other news outlets in the film). Chaotic events, such as food and medicine riots, as well as a lack of general services (police and garbage removal) are touched on and then simply pushed aside. At one point civilization seems to be teetering. Then a few scenes later it's a non-topic. The real issue for Contagion is that while its central message is solid, the movie sidesteps several major consequences by pointing to them and then moving on. In one scene a character voices concern that a vaccine won't be circulated for months - an issue that, despite its apparent importance, never surfaces again.

Now Dr. Ellis will be presumed immune and allowed into sensitive areas and around vulnerable people. But he is not and can spread the virus past all the safeguards put into place.

324,dalelawson-1,Contagion Review,7,3 January 2012,"A spreading virus threatens humanity after one woman contracted it. This virus spreads quickly as she was travelling from China to America by plane exposing hundreds to the disease. Within twenty four hours symptoms become noticeable causing seizures, and eventually death. This rapid spreading virus resulted in a global quarantine in a matter of weeks. The film follows multiple characters, some of which have the virus, others haven't been exposed to it and the rest are immune. I take my ""hat off"" to all the actors in Contagion as they provide us with realistic and relatable characters. Jude Law's Australian accent seems accurate, but as I am not Australian I cannot vouch for its authenticity. But accent aside, Jude Law provides an amazing and entertaining performance as the films villain, since the virus cannot be classified as an antagonist. But the actor that stole the show for me was Matt Damon. Pre-The Informant (Steven Sodergergh, 2009) I would have said Matt Damon, whose type-cast career and character choice is best described in Team America: World Police (Trey Parker & Matt Stone, 2004), was just another Stallone or Arnie, but with The Informant and True Grit (The Cohen Brothers, 2010) his acting ability has taken to a new light in my opinion. One thing that really stood out when watching the film was its universality. It isn't often in movies that we, the audience, are given the perspectives of all ethnicities, cultures and classes. By providing us with this wide perspective it becomes clear the whole planet has been affected by the disease. The difference in how the rich are treated from the poor during a crisis is also an important aspect of the film, as it likely resembles political choices that would take place in our present reality. Without trying to throw any spoilers out there, the only part of the film that actually disappointed me was the end. Frequent subtitles appear throughout the film stating how many days it has been since the disease was contracted. The film begins on Day 2 and unfortunately ends on Day 1, showing us how the disease was created and contracted. This seems unneeded. Ending the film without explaining the diseases' creation would have left the audience with an unknown fear that this disease could possibly exist. Yes, Contagion was a little slow in places and the final scene was a disappointment, but the all in all the film was very entertaining. It was probably the first horror/thriller film in a long time that actually chose a fear shared by everyone in modern society. Matt Damon was fantastic as the loving father, Jude Law performed his role as the Australian antagonist with ease and all the other actors kept me engaged throughout the film till the conclusion penultimate scene. http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/",Contagion
325,TheFilmFreak1,Inexplicably Dull,6,19 October 2011,"How does he do it? How does Steven Soderbergh do it? How does he manage to turn a film with a great cast and a bloody terrifying premise into a piece of remediless tedium?! How, how, HOW?!! It's not as though he has to try very hard. The film, after all, is about a damned global pandemic! But Soderbergh, in his independent American film sagacity, would much rather spend the majority of his allegedly terrifying parable of mother earth's diabolical revenge plot showing us static shots of people talking about the direr implications of a disease than actually showing us the blasted chaos. Not that I am adverse to listening to exchanges resplendent in scientific jargon that concern widespread death and pandemonium, but, seeing as this is a primarily VISUAL medium, it would be nice to actually see a few more people falling in front of buses and salivating at an alarming rate than hearing Kate Winslet talking about some asinine supposition that an average individual touches their face four to five times a minute. Call me old fashioned, but I like disaster films to be more aesthetically interesting.I will grant you that my views are slightly barbarous in this regard, but I have a few more 'bones to pick' in the name of a more righteous anger, though. They come in the form of objections to the film's needlessly muddled plot, which juggles multiple story lines and ultimately fumbles with most of them. Certain threads, such as Damon's paternal struggles and Fishburne's quest for a vaccine for the disease, are indeed relevant to the film's overriding story arch at one stage or another, but I fail to see how Jude Law's arch contributes anything to the film other than the overused dictum 'the worst thing we have to fear is fear itself'; and what does Cotillard's story have to do with anything? Maybe in other circumstances I would trust that the writer had included these threads to rectify small plot contrivances that they could not otherwise remove, but by the mere fact that these arches don't even have a conclusion to really speak of, I just suspect they were included simply to fill in time. Hell, even the main stories didn't really go anywhere. Come to think of it, this film doesn't even go anywhere (other than the whole planet, but I assume you know I am writing figuratively). It doesn't even have a third act! It just consists of an admittedly nicely paced first act, an overly long second one, and... an ending. Just an ending; an ending where the fricking twist is something we've already been told about repeatedly within the film itself. I won't reveal the twist to you, of course, but I will inform you that it is only slightly more surprising than the ending to 'Titanic', and only marginally less predictable than the ending to 'Fight Club'.As usual, Soderbergh's direction and cinematography (Soderbergh working under the pseudonym of Peter Andrews) lack any sort of energy or drive. Although the lighting has improved this time around (many scenes in 'The Informant!' were akin to having someone use a mirror to refract the sun's rays onto your eyes), the whole thing still looks like a slideshow (the only difference this time being that the film's globetrotting narrative permits proceedings to be elevated to the level of excitement usually found with a showing of an acquaintance's holiday snaps).The film does have some redeeming features, though. The cast, for one, are mostly very believable in their respective roles, particularly Jennifer Ehle, Jude Law, and Elliot Gould. The script, for two, is also impressively realistic in its depiction of the mayhem produced from the threat of Armageddon. For a final three, there is a refreshing absence of hyperbole, something that is practically a hallmark of this genre of film.All this can't change the fact that Soderbergh is just a bad filmmaker, though. Admittedly he does have a good sense of pace, but his continued efforts to turn fascinating premises into unleaded dullness simply make him a menace to society. This is the man who made a spaceship orbiting an effeminate planet, a case of corporate farce (well, I find that exciting), a heist film about an assortment of Hollywood Adonises draining Las Vegas dry, and George Clooney robbing banks boring. Surely he is some sort of demigod.",Contagion
326,katie-sirles,A billion dead! That's where we're headed!,7,30 December 2011,"Have you ever been on a crowded bus and been standing face to face with the only sweaty, sniffley guy on the bus? And you're standing there saying to yourself ""Great, now I'm going to get sick because this prick didn't have the common decency to call into work."" And then you do get sick and die? But before you die you get home from work and kiss your wife and then she kisses the kids goodnight and they kiss nana and boppy and nana and boppy didn't have much time left anyway and now it's been cut even shorter?This is the idea of CONTAGION. It all starts with one sick guy who doesn't keep to himself and hole up in his apartment on the futon like any good sick person should. The subsequent pandemic is all this guy's fault and he doesn't know it because he's dead. Although, if he had fallen ill years ago then Gwyneth Paltrow wouldn't have been able to ruin Coldplay. But I digress So Mitch is married to Beth (Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow) and Beth becomes the first real example of how potent whatever this sickness is. Now, as someone who is incredibly hypochondriacal, I have a hard time watching any movie in which one man gets sick and then Jude Law is shouting ""A billion dead! That's where we're headed!"" in his wonderful Jude Law accent. The idea of it – to be frank – scares me. When I get a headache I think that I'm probably going to die, so this sort of this is just unacceptable. It is also more frightening because this could actually happen.All of that being said, I didn't particularly enjoy the film. Looting and riots over vaccines? Laurence Fishburne and Kate Winslet trying to solve a global crisis together? It makes no sense! Maybe I am being too hard on this movie. Maybe it just wasn't as good as DRIVE – which I saw right before CONTAGION. Maybe if Ryan Gosling had run into CONTAGION and stomped a guy's head in I would have been more satisfied. I am cheapening the good name of CONTAGION which stars one of – in my opinion – the most talented actors of our time.It's a great idea. Scaring everyone to do anything ever because they might get sick and die. I'm sure that something like this isn't too far-fetched. It is entirely possibly that someday an illness will wipe our species clean. It is more plausible than, say, cowboys fighting aliens or the rising of the apes. This movie is every bit as worthwhile as those two 'summer blockbusters'. One can only hope that if any of these things do happen that we will all have our very own Jude Law scampering about, shouting. He is, after all, the man with the plan. And the garbage bag spaceman suit.****Visit www.mssilverscreen.com for more of my reviews****",Contagion

328,tappingjeff,Contagion: Art of Disaster,6,24 September 2011,"I have rarely been as scared at a film than I was in Steven Soderbergh's Contagion. That's not to say it was a horror movie, but it will seep into your conscience like a disease, and for what it's worth, it really does it's job well.The entire pandemic of fear comes after a mom (Gwyneth Paltrow) comes home from a trip to Japan and begins the spread of a terrifying disease that begins to infect the entire world. People attempt to stop it (Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburne at that) and there are a whole slew of celebrities filling in for characters either working against, working with, or dying from this disease. Soderbergh has an extremely effective sense of detail, and he is able to spin this into one of the most realistic pandemic horror films. Soderbergh uses the state of global anxiety and focuses that through a medical lens, creating a sense of bio-terrorism; one that seems so close to home as Contagion opened 2 days before the 10th anniversary of September 11th. Though there is rarely use of subtlety in his notions, the ideas and concepts of fear in Contagion may just keep you away from restaurants, and up all night long. However nicely Mr. Soderbergh's detailed film plays out, it certainly gets lost within itself along the way. Scott Z. Burns' script gave plenty of hokey dialogue, and though the cast probably has more Oscar nominations between them than anyone would care to count, most of them are wasted here. Almost none of the characters are given sufficient depth; I left the film not remembering a single characters name. And perhaps that wasn't the point; perhaps the idea behind Contagion was the widespread nature of this fear, this disease. But even then, several characters and plot lines were complete unnecessary and only hindered the film from reaching it's full potential. Kate Winslet turns in an excellent performance as Dr. Erin Mears, an Intelligence Service Officer, who is on a mission to figure out whats causing this catastrophe. Winslet is intense, and real, and the audience is with her all the way. Unfortunately, out of the dizzying amounts of people we're introduced to, she is the only one you can feel for. And that very well may be part of Contagion's cold, bleak plan: to disconnect because of fear, only drives the fear itself. Makes you wonder, what's the real pandemic going on here? B",Contagion

I would give it the same rating if my judgment is solely based on the film's entertainment value, but I have to increase my new rating with one star. Who cares, right? Who do I think I am, announcing my rating adjustment like it is a big thing?Well, I mention this adjustment because of the film's current relevance (COVID-19 Crisis) and because of this film's realistic portrayal of a pandemic. The film's accurracy is testimony of the hard work that went into it and it deserves more appreciation for it. I will try to take more aspects (such as educational value) into account in my future film ratings. This is perhaps the best (as in most realistic) pandemic film out there. A must-see.",Contagion

333,ddangtruong23,Extremely boring and cliché,4,4 February 2015,"Despite all the talented people involved, 'Contagion' turned out to be a boring mess. There is nothing remotely impressive about the plot. The characters are incredibly cliché, boring and flat. You have a few responsible but powerless scientists, some selfish dumb-asses that will mess everything up, a worrying father with an annoying teen-aged child, etc. In other words, all the typical people that you can find in any similar movies. Then they are put into situations ranging from family affairs to political conspiracies, which are all painfully predictable and more cliché than the characters themselves. Even when there are some more intriguing plot lines, they will often be abruptly ended in the most disappointing and anticlimactic manners. Consequently, the whole movie feels like just a long list of possible scenarios, not a meaningful and complete story. Furthermore, it's not even merely entertaining since most of the controversial things are not shown but awkwardly told through dialogues, something you would only expect from cheap TV movies, not from a movie with 5 Oscar winners and a bunch of other A-list stars. The directing is even more disappointing. I guess the director, Steven Soderbergh, was trying to make this look more realistic, like a documentary, but the result is an awkward-looking film with static and prolonged shots that sometimes feel like a long corporate advertisement. The acting, on the other hand, is not too bad. Most of the cast deliver, despite being given very little room. The only complain I have regards this aspect is about Jude Law since his performance seems way over the top compared to the rest. 'Contagion' is perhaps somewhat successful at portraying a more realistic image of a world-wide disaster, but that doesn't make it a successful or interesting movie. Instead, it's just really disjointed and pointless, almost feels like a bunch of clichés from many previous disaster movies crammed together.",Contagion
334,theburrus1,"With the coronavirus of 2020 ongoing, this film seems much more realistic than before...",7,28 October 2020,"I think this is my third time to watch this film, twice being ""pre covid-19"" and the third time being during the latter part of 2020 with Covid-19 raging on. After all the news articles I've read about viruses, contagions, biological warfare, scientific names and anomalies related to viruses, in going back to watch this film now there is a very familiar, eerie and immediate sense that this really can and is happening in a sense. Sure, other films about viruses are out there but I think this to me seems to catch the heart, the emotions of real life people and families and agencies trying to come to grip with a fast spreading pandemic.So for the director to capture such an event yet preceding real world events to come, this is a prime candidate anyone wanting a refresher course on viruses should watch. And to the director I give credit for that and rate this a 7/10.Finally, on a side note, there are many familiar faces acting in this film, and all of their roles were excellent, heart-felt and real. Matt Damon, excellent, Gwyneth Paltrow. although brief in her appearance definitely doesn't let you forget this role. Laurence Fishburne, excellent and Kate Winslett deserves credits as well, which obviously goes without saying.",Contagion

Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, and Laurence Fishburne all did an excellent job with the standard tear-jerking life and loss moments.Of all the characters, Jude Law stood out playing an eccentric, conspiracy-theory reporter that provided some great moments and comic relief for the film.Contagion was face-paced and well-directed providing great insights into viral contagions, how they spread, and how they are stopped.But, if you fear germs, or fear that you may fear germs, this movie is not for you.",Contagion

It paints the typical picture of vaccines saving lives and pharmaceutical companies saving us all along with the CDC. They paint one blogger as being the only outspoken person against the whole charade going on.It's similar to real life in that the CDC likes people to think they're independent of pharmaceutical companies and the only people against them are uneducated moms and bloggers, as opposed to entire medical organizations and doctors that risk losing their license just for being honest and blowing the CDCs scam.The movie would have been more interesting had they painted a more honest picture and shown the CDC for what is really is.

338,artalmarcelo,I'll wash my hands after this review.,8,27 January 2012,"Probably many will watch this movie using ""Outbreak"" as a benchmark. For those, it's fair to say this is a completely different movie. Outbreak is an excellent movie that treats an epidemic outbreak from a very fictional standpoint, and Contagion is a movie that treats the same but with a very realistic approach. Put this way: in Contagion, heroes just pass by, like in real life. This is not necessarily bad, because Steven Soderbergh managed to tell the story in a magnificent way. This was a tough movie to make, cause there's 5 or 6 equally important characters whose stories have to be told, and the director does it without missing a single spot. I really liked how the story developed from different angles. This a serious, realistic and especially very well acted and directed movie. Of course it feels a little more informative and far less emotional than Outbreak, but it was intentional. They wanted to make a movie to show the world how an epidemic outbreak impacts the world, and they did it pretty well.",Contagion
339,ViktorDrake,Another steaming pile from Soderbergh...,2,12 December 2011,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOWI saw this a few weeks ago after seeing the various promotions for it on TV and in magazines, and like so many other viewers I was, firstly, misled by the trailer, and secondly, even after quickly realising and accepting that it actually wasn't a fast-paced thriller in the Outbreak mould, I was just seriously disappointed by the whole thing.For me, the first rule of cinema (in fact, cinema's raison d-etre) is to entertain. Now, that entertainment may come in the form of action, comedy, drama, thrillers, or even horror - a film can be disturbing and horrifying and yet still hold the viewer's attention and therefore by extension, be entertaining. The one single thing that a movie should never EVER do is bore the viewer. And bore me, this movie most certainly did. I was looking at my watch literally every 10 minutes after the first half an hour. I should point out at this stage that I'm not a teenager with the attention span of a goldfish due to being weaned on video games since the age of two : no, I'm in my late 30's and have a very broad appreciation for movies of all genres. Some of the greatest movies ever made may be considered ""slow-burn"" by many people, so I have no issue with slowly developing movies. It's just that this particular movie was and is (in my opinion) simply incredibly dull. As has become the norm with a number of Soderbergh's films, random ""plot"" threads appear and then don't go anywhere : conversations seem stunted and peculiar and also often don't go anywhere : people drift in and out of the story with a feeling that they're there to just fill the running time. And talking of filling the running time, what the heck is with all the montages?? CSI eat your heart out! After the second one all I could think about was the ""Montage"" song from Team America!For a movie that was purportedly trying to be as realistic as possible, I just didn't get any feeling of the true terror that would surely accompany such a situation in real life. And along those same lines I was deeply unimpressed with the fairly Hollywood style ending whereby, once again, the Americans very handily find a cure and suddenly the previously killer virus is just stored away with a sample of bird flu. Phew, close call huh? Hmmm yes, very real and true to life I'm sure.....Matt Damon, who has some decent movies under his belt, just wondered around looking confused and (dare I say it) bored. Gwyneth Paltrow was ""off'd"" within minutes so was basically wasted, and Laurence Fishburne (looking even more portly than ever) did his now standard post-Morpheus ""talk slowly and deliberately in order to convey gravitas"" routine. Kate Winslet however did a reasonable job of NOT looking too bored, which she should be congratulated on.But none of the actors are really to blame here. That I lay squarely at Mr Soderbergh's door. For a man capable of directing some very good films (Traffic, Ocean's 11 and Che, for example), he's also MORE THAN capable of directing some complete dog's dinners (Ocean's 12, The Limey and Solaris anyone?) - and this unfortunately is one of them. The whole thing was just deeply deeply boring and uninvolving. And in that respect it totally and utterly failed my test of good cinema - to entertain. A generous 2 out of 10 for the cast.",Contagion

In one of the talks I watched, one guy even predicted the shortage of toilet papers in case of any pandemic. It is just normal people, who don't seem to understand, until they face the situation.

I was expecting something better than 'Outbreak' - which was great, fast moving, suspenseful with a touch of the 'Die Hard' humor in suspenseful moments. This was not fast-moving and there was NO humor. Everyone is serious, all the time. The first part where the infection gets moving makes you think it's going to be good. The way the virus is spread is great - makes you very self-conscious of how this could happen in today's world of being able to get around the world in 36 hrs. That's when it slooooooows down. You hope that the main scientist gets through the film because her character is good - but - at the first cough - you know she's doomed. Pretty much everyone is.

In order to get scared, all you have to do is to come in contact with a rumor, or the television or the internet. I think what Mr. Krumwiede is uh... is spreading, is far more dangerous than the disease.""Upsetting audience members and riveting critics upon release in 2011, Steven Soderbergh's ultra-realistic take on health authorities battling a viral pandemic is a gripping and uncomfortable experience, notwithstanding its cold and clinical approach. Unsettling in its scientific accuracy and harrowing portrayal of societal order breaking down amidst a global crisis, the film disturbs for a chilling 106 minutes that's sure to have moviegoers buying hand sanitiser and face masks by the pellet, with several sequences straight out of a germaphobe's nightmare. Only a director as skilled in this 'hyperlinking' style as Soderbergh can keep our heads from spinning when we jump from character to character and continent to continent, barely giving viewers and the all-star ensemble cast enough time to breathe. Frequent collaborator Peter Andrews, who mysteriously only ever works this director's projects, makes the most of the RED One MX's 4k resolution with gorgeous cinematography shot on-location across the globe, and Cliff Martinez' score is solid if unremarkable serving as the film's ticking clock, far from his best in 2011. Viewed today as an eerily prophetic and frightening mirror of current real-world events, even boasting the infamous phrase 'social distancing', the movie lacks an emotional core despite the best efforts of a powerful performance from Kate Winslet, a paranoid and vaguely political Jude Law, Jennifer Ehle spinning techno babble like it's Shakespeare and longtime Soderbergh muses Matt Damon and Elliott Gould.",Contagion

354,lamiaaos,Simply Incomplete,6,29 September 2011,"With all the stars contributing to this work; the first thing that pops into your head is just how grand it ought to turn out and how you're going to keep your fingers crossed for it to surpass all expectations - negative.With all the big names involved in making this film the only one who dared come close to living up to his/her reputation is without a doubt Kate Winslet. Her character was by far the most captivating and her acting was spot on. Whenever she needed to say something, she said it and whenever she needed to convey a certain emotion to the audience; she did it without hesitation. Sadly enough, all the other characters were either played superficially, without allowing the viewer to get to know any of them in-depth or to fully understand them in order to decide whether or not we actually like them. Let's look at a few, shall we; Gwenyth Paltrow's role was just too shallow to judge and if you've watched this movie you'll know why.Matt Damon's performance was just FINE, but although he had the greatest number of opportunities to connect with the audience; he failed to do so every single time...maybe the only thing we seem to understand is that he's a father trying to protect his kid, but that's about it. With all that's going on with the character you'd expect him to be a roller coaster of emotion, but he's not. Maybe he's trying to play the tough guy whom nothing seems to get to, and at that he might've succeeded just a bit.Now we move on to another interesting character,Dr.Leonora, played by Marion Cotillard. She's understandable enough, yet by the end of the movie we are left in the blank about her. We feel like she's a good character in many ways, but then we're never really given the chance to really know her or to even understand what she's doing in the movie; other than of course carrying out her work duties.As for Jude Law, his character leaves us just clueless. I, for one, did not understand what in the world he was trying to do, or whether he was a good/bad guy. I simply didn't get anything about him, his work, his life or even his girlfriend (if i can even call her that). All in all it wasn't a bad film, but it just left you in the theater feeling empty. You're neither angry nor sad, you're neither shedding a tear nor laughing hysterically, you just feel the exact same way coming out of that movie theater as you did going in. And the ending was just...boring, i can't really find a better word to describe it. It's not lame or involving a twist, it's just boring. This is one of those movies where there are just too many characters and too little time for any of them to develop or unravel before the viewer's eyes. Most characters left no impression on the audience, if not all. And when you did find a character that was appealing enough, the camera simply didn't agree and you never get the chance to see that much of them. This movie was a disappointment in so many ways and I have to admit that it's one of the most unmemorable movies I've ever seen; since after all, for a movie to be memorable it actually has to leave you feeling something..but this one failed to stir anything inside me.6.5/10",Contagion

Through out the film there seemed to be no problems with petrol (gas), power or communications and the effects of something that based on the figures given in the film should have accounted for more than 7% of the worlds population long before the end of the movie were completely absent.Anyone with a basic grasp of maths and science is going to pick holes and find the script laughable and possibly insultingly oversimplified.Watch it, you might be entertained, but don't expect to be impressed.",Contagion

367,jennifer626,"Great cast overcome by bad editing, gaping plot holes, and shallow characters",4,16 January 2012,"We were looking forward to seeing ""Contagion"" on PPV and ordered it the first day it was available. The first 15-20 minutes were mesmerizing, then the movie lapsed into mediocrity.I won't detail the plot, the outstanding cast or the thinly drawn characters, which other reviewers have captured perfectly. In my opinion, there are two major flaws in this film - - each caused by a combination of poor writing and editing - - which prevent the film from being truly engaging and effective.The first problem is the lack of consistency and rationale in the characters' decision-making. For example, Matt Damon is a grieving father who will do anything to protect his daughter and one surviving family member. He prevents her from opening the door to take flowers from her boyfriend because he doesn't want her to touch anyone or anything from the outside and contract the virus. (The boyfriend has no signs of contagion.) But in the next scene featuring these characters, he has taken his daughter to the grocery store to look for any remaining goods, elbowing away the looters running through the aisles. How do 500 strangers pawing through cereal pose less danger to the daughter than one lovelorn teenager on the other side of a screen door?The second problem is the introduction of several major characters and plot threads that receive huge emphasis at the beginning of the film, then vanish without explanation or are resolved in a manner devoid of logic. For example, Marion Cotillard plays a WHO representative who is aggressively investigating the origin of the virus and attempting to find a cure. She's kidnapped by a co-worker and taken to his remote village in rural China. Purportedly, the village can only survive the epidemic if she is held hostage and exchanged for rare vials of the vaccine.This plot line is entirely implausible because:* No vaccine exists at the time Marion is taken hostage. The kidnappers could not know if & when it would be developed. They also would have no way of knowing that due to the vaccine's composition and the small number of facilities that can manufacture it, the vaccine will be available in extremely limited quantities. Thus, the kidnappers are assigned a motive -- improving the village's position in the waiting list for the vaccine - - that they could not possibly have at the time of the kidnapping.* When Marion is taken out of her lab to a small village without any research capabilities, she can no longer make progress on finding a cure. Taking her away from her work could significantly delay (if not prevent) the creation of a vaccine and the end of epidemic. Her co- worker would be well aware of this consequence, and this is at complete odds with the kidnappers' goal of saving their neighbors.* We are expected to believe that in a global epidemic with hundreds of millions dying and governments collapsing, the WHO will pay attention to the demands of one small town and one kidnapped employee (who hasn't been tortured or threatened in any way). But not only does the WHO respond, it coordinates with the U.S. government to put together a sophisticated negotiation team and sends them to an alley in Hong Kong to secure Marion's release. There is simply no way that valuable time and resources would be spent on such a mission.* Marion is briefly seen at the village teaching a class of small children and sweetly smiling down at them. Later, the WHO pays her ""ransom"" by delivering a case of purported vaccine to the kidnappers. She is freed and gets into the van with the WHO response team. When they tell her that the syringes actually contained a placebo, she leaps back into the kidnappers' van to return to the village. WHY? Stockholm Syndrome? ""Is she in love with her co-worker?"" wondered my friend. We don't know, and we never find out, because we never see her again.In another mishandled plot thread concerning the source of the virus, we are reminded with just a few minutes left in the film that it began on Day 2. We are then presented with a 6-scene montage of Day 1, hand touching sequential hand, tracing Gwyneth's infection back to its origin. The montage is jarring only because it has no connection to the scenes that immediately precede it. Anticlimactic and mind-numbingly predictable, it then ""reveals"" a source that was explicitly identified by some flat-voiced doctor much earlier in the movie. Finally, the movie raises a number of ethical questions that all would have benefited from more than superficial exploration. A blogger uses scare tactics and spreads false information about the virus in order to gain media attention. The film merely observes his conduct with detachment, and we remain similarly disengaged. The issue of ""who"" should receive rare vaccination shots is briefly touched upon, but falls short of meaningful analysis. We had a much more impassioned and thought-provoking debate about the overcrowded lifeboat scenario in my high school sociology course.""Contagion"" has solid production values and some heartfelt attempts by the cast to make the most of their one-dimensional characters. Not dreck, but I am giving it a 4/10 rating primarily because of the numerous and distracting plot flaws.

Soderberg directed this film a decade ago, but some aspects of it seem as real as the Coronavirus Pandemic that began in American in February 2020 and is still going strong due to the unvaccinated being the most vulnerable to a powerful variant that threatens us for at least another year. A big cast of A-list actors, some who die in the first few minutes of the film, make it even more compelling. The cast is excellent. The screenplay is avoid stagey drama and lets the horror of the unfolding story speak for itself. Always one of my very favorite directors, Soderberg anticipates the current Coronavirus by more than a decade. The CDC is exposed as a government organization not above playing politics.

The new sci-fi thriller, ""Contagion"", stars several well-known actors such as Marion Cotillard, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kate Winslet. Beth Emhoff (Paltrow) starts to get sick on her way home from China and assumes it's just a cold or the flu. Once her husband (Damon) witnesses her having seizures, he realizes that this disease is much more serious.Eventually, people all over the world are getting sick and many are dying left and right. Dr. Ellis Cheever (Fishburne) decides to put a team together to stop this epidemic and find a vaccine or a cure. Many scientists are involved to find a way to stop these germs from spreading. There are numerous 'main characters' who are focused on. There does not seem to be a single lead.My description of the storyline seems vague, but that's because this is all that the movie is about. This story has been covered so many times before that ""Contagion"" ends up being unoriginal and, frankly, boring. It felt as if nothing happened. Many questions were left unanswered.Too much time was spent on the disease itself, rather than on the development of the characters. Because there are so many characters, all of the side stories seem insignificant in comparison to the big picture. But the big picture is too simple. The acting was decent, but each character only had a couple scenes. In my opinion, too much talent was wasted with this film.Furthermore, ""Contagion"" is quite disgusting. Many scenes are disturbing and you walk out not wanting to touch anything. This film is not enjoyable at all and not very well done. I give it a 4 out of 10.

375,themuddoctor,"Contagion is cold, nervy, and very suspenseful",9,13 September 2011,"There are very few filmmakers like Steven Soderbergh. Ever since his groundbreaking 1989 debut, Sex, Lies, and Videotape, Soderbergh has become one of the most experimental and daring mainstream filmmakers in history. His newest offering, Contagion, is unlike any film he's made before. It's cold, nervy, and very suspenseful. Boasting about as good a cast of A-list stars of any movie so far this year, Contagion is an unsentimental look at what our world could become, or maybe what it has become, in the 21st century. It's being marketed as a thriller, which to some extent it is, but on a much deeper level it feels far too real to be a run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller, and that makes it all the more terrifying.

376,silverdragon4,Virus...but no Zombies? Realism hits the screen,8,22 January 2012,"To start, I would say If you are expecting fast paced action, forget it. I know most films about a Virus contain Zombies or people being shot etc, So don't go into this film expecting it to be anything like Resident Evil, 28 Day Later or Quarantine, this has NONE of that. This film is more realistic. More similar to the 1995 film Outbreak, except on a worldwide scale.Slow but effective film showing the spread of a contagious virus and the efforts to stop it. These days in the way we live, this film could well be more realistic than we know. Although there are a few big names in this film, it does not continuously follow them. It follows a number of people all over the world.Gwyneth Paltrow plays patient Zero Beth Emhoff. Her part in the film was pretty good. Being Patient Zero will either make you immune or dead within the first 10 minutes. I won't tell you which as I won't be posting spoilers in this review.Matt Damon plays Mitch Emhoff, husband to Patient Zero Beth Emnoff. He plays a good part as husband and father. I do feel his script could have had more to it during his time on camera.Kate Winslet plays an Investigator for the CDC (Centre for Desease Control). This was, by far, the best part given in the film. She was great in her role and could not have done better. Her job is to search for answers as to how it started in the US.Finally, Laurence Fishburne plays Dr. Ellis Cheever also of CDC. As always, this actor plays a great part with style. He has hard choices to make with the spread of the epidemic. What started it? Was it created as a bio-weapon? Is there a cure? Can we make one in time? And what of the people...and his wife?Well made film. Not fast paced, it allows you to follow along and keep up. The storyline is good. Not quite an Apocalyptic story, but shows what could well happen. More chance of this happening than any other world wide catastrophe.I do suggest watching this film. I liked it a lot and even if you were expecting Zombies, it is still a good watch.",Contagion

382,mokhatib,Fear Fear Itself,8,18 December 2011,"CONTAGION (2011)""Don't touch anyone, don't talk to anyone"" is basically what Contagion warns you of once you are done watching this movie, it does and it will do to you what ""Jaws"" did to people especially swimmers and beach lovers back in 1975. This is a gripping medical thriller in the likes of Outbreak (1995) and The Andromeda Strain (1971). The plot revolves around a lethal epidemic and the fear it spreads among doctors and people alike.A solid directorial effort by Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Thirteen, Traffic, The Informant) where most of his movies have this sort of realism in the way they are shot and directed that brings the audience more into the stories and makes them more credible and the list of stars keep coming, joined by a stellar cast and superb performances, Gwenyth Paltrow, Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishburne, Jude Law, and Kate Winslet.After watching this, I felt that the title Contagion is not only relevant to the disease the film talks about but more the contagion and spread of fear amongst people all around the world because of this disease and how it affects their behavior, judgment, and ethics. A father (Damon) who has just lost his wife and son to the disease becomes protective and aggressive around his daughter, a doctor (Fishburne) tries to do what's good and right and ends up being investigated, a cunning journalist (Law) tries to deceive the people and make money off this epidemic while falsely prophesizing a conspiracy by the government and the medical officials to cover up this matter for financial and military means. Scott Z. Burns (The Bourne Ultimatum, The Informant) did a beautiful job writing the script for this where he not only tapped into our instinctual fears but also brought out the worst in some people, showing how this disease makes us not only physically sick but also sick with greed, selfishness, and lust for power. Complementing the sense of fear, thriller, and suspense is the amazing soundtrack or score by Randy Miller that echoes of electronic sounds and ominous and mysterious beats so creepy that it brings you more into the horror of the situation.If you want to take a break from all the slew of supernatural thrillers and horror movies with no genuine story and essence and watch a real serious thriller treat, get infected and watch Contagion.",Contagion

398,alangsco,Predictably disappointing.,4,7 November 2011,"An exciting storyline involving the topical and scary premise of an unknown virus sweeping the world and a large cast of Hollywood A-listers (and B-listers) employed to bring it to life. What can go wrong? Quite a lot, as it happens...Firstly, you've got the killing-off of Gwyneth Paltrow's character 10 minutes into the movie. Now, i'm no great fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but surely the obvious shock-tactic of killing a recognisable face at the start of the feature has become a boring cliché? Then there's Jude Law's appearance. Off the top of my head i'm struggling to think of any movie where Jude Law stood out as a good actor. I don't particularly dislike him. I just don't rate him. One surefire way to make him unlikeable, however, is to give him an accent that he patently can't pull off. Maybe it's childish of me, but incredibly bad accents put me off whatever else is happening on camera. Oh, and if his accent isn't bad enough you've also got the distraction of his dodgy teeth. Perhaps these gimmicks were thought necessary to deflect away from his unconvincing performance.Apart from that the cast is fine. Not exactly challenging roles for the likes of Matt Damon or Marion Cottillard, but they do OK. Kate Winslet probably fares best as she is the one person who seems capable of conveying real emotion (and I didn't think her American accent was too bad).As for the plot, it's predictable. Virus breaks out, scientists baffled, no-one knows what to do, public panic and breakdown of society and then a cure appears from nowhere with no real explanation and everything's fine again. I felt like watching this movie was a waste of time.

403,ncoviell,Contagion captures human side of catastrophe,9,1 December 2011,"It really is stunning how quickly the stale, end of summer cinema can blossom into the quality-driven beginning of fall. After weeks of box office flops, the fall movie season could not have come quick enough. Much like how its story tracks the start of a virus and how it branches rapidly, ""Contagion"" marks just the beginning of the fall movie season. And what a beginning it was. ""Contagion,"" from director Steven Soderbergh, isn't satisfied with the trite and normal idea of setting a world catastrophe around a core group of people who somehow manage to save the day before anyone important is hurt or killed. In reality, no one is special or important enough in these situations. In layman's terms, everyone is in the same boat. Still, ""Contagion"" presents a dangerous environment that each and everyone one of us has to live in, but it's the variety of perspective in which the film really impresses.Jumping right into things, ""Contagion"" centers around several distinct characters and the overall reaction of the world when an unknown virus breaks out, starts killing in numbers and rapidly spreads around the world.The story of ""Contagion"" is carefully crafted around an array of perspectives, the most notable being the average citizen, the members of the medical world and the media with the middle of course representing a high power. In general, the key figures of the average is Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon) and his teenage daughter as he, being immune to the virus himself and having had his wife and stepson already fall victim to the virus, struggles to keep his daughter out of harm's way. Yet, ""Contagion's"" most powerful images occur beyond his character, instead focusing on the average population as a whole. Capturing an astounding amount of emotion, Soderbergh highlights the feeling of helplessness that comes with the inability to control what's happened or what's going to happen. Whether it is physical images such as the near impossible feat of receiving help in overflowing, overwhelmed hospitals or the mental mind state of having to cope with the panic that stems not just from the possibility of death, but from the lack of knowledge around cause or cure, ""Contagion"" portrays the average human as trapped with no way out.At the same time, a state of paranoia is steadily built. Gradually, people start questioning who they may have come in contact with as well as becoming more aware to previously harmless actions like what people touch as well as coughing and sneezing. As panic grows, so does fear, which breeds blame and eventually anger, especially targeting those to whom people look to for information, but can provide them with none.In a wonderfully constructed tie-in, ""Contagion"" fuses average people's concerns with those in higher power (represented mainly by Laurence Fishburne) and the media (Jude Law as an Internet blogger/journalist). Trust plays an important role in ""Contagion."" The CDC is giving the public no answers as well as making no physical effort to show people that they are truly looking out for them. In the meantime, Alan Krumwiede (Law) claims to have discovered a cure and is attempting to reveal the CDC as frauds and money grubbers. It is this scenario in which Soderbergh perfectly compares the issues that come with being in the spotlight: either being a scapegoat like the CDC or not being deemed credible like Krumwiede's supposed ""cure."" All the while there is the forgotten fact that these members of power are people too and must face the challenge of balancing the act of taking care of the world with the act of caring for those dearest to them. Ultimately, underneath the panic and chaos not only lay tough choices, but also sad truths such as not being able to grieve properly for the death a la the funeral homes refusing to take in infected bodies as showcased by one particular scene.The style in which the subject material is presented gives the film its impact. Simply, it makes it frightening how things can come together. ""Contagion"" lacks central characters for a specific reason. The viewer's job isn't to form connections with the characters on-screen, it's to connect with the human race in general. The lack of background or screen time for the characters on-screen desensitizes the viewer from caring about specific, lead characters and instead focuses on the state of being as a whole.In effective use of cinematic techniques, ""Contagion"" also makes the outbreak that much scarier by distinctly showing how little it takes to spread via rapidly edited images and reinforcing subtitles that mark the day number of the outbreak or the population of a city soon to be infected. The spread may start gradual, but becomes lightning quick. The film further represents the inability to understand the virus by way of an eerie score that almost seems out of place.""Contagion"" is scary both in subject matter and in how well it's put together. The film is an experience, one that depends heavily on the magnitude of its material and the fragility with which it's pieced together instead of relying on acting or writing. In the end, it's amazing how quickly society can become unraveled in a state of panic. Likewise, finding an equal balance of chaos and looking out for those you love is difficult to capture. ""Contagion"" does just that.",Contagion
404,peter-stewart866,Less epidemic more a mild cold,6,29 October 2011,"This review will be broken down into two sections; the first section is everything that is bad with the film, the second section is everything that is good about the film. It is important to start with the bad parts as it had many. Firstly, Jude Law's character; there is no need for him, there is no reason for him to be Aussie (and do it badly) There is no reason for him to have a wonky tooth that i could no take my eyes off. None of this added character, not one little bit to his already pointless part. There were many pointless parts in this film, Marion Cotillard would be another example of a character that is pointless. She appears then disappears for the majority of the film, then is reintroduced only to disappear again for some reason. Another big problem is the lack of... anything for the most part after the first twenty minutes, it is just to many characters with not a lot to do. The virus starts well but goes way down hill after that. There is not a brooding sense of danger in this film or for the characters that you think might die, which is a shame because it brings me onto the good parts. What is good about this film is the first twenty minutes. All the tension in the film is in those twenty minutes. It is well acted, well driven and the spread of the virus is very interesting. I would advise however when those twenty minutes are up you pick up your bag and you leave because it is a long, slow and not very interesting film after that.",Contagion

410,ImBoredSoIReviewMovies,"Good Premise, Poor Execution",4,18 June 2019,"So Contagion's a thing....apparently. I don't know how I feel about this movie, on one hand it was a chore to get through, on the other hand my favourite actors are in here. If I have to summarize this movie it would be very unsatisfying. The film shows a world where everybody is fighting against one cause but the world itself feels very small, like it was rushed when they wrote around it. There is tension in the film, don't get me wrong, but all that tension leaves when you see how fast the story progresses that the tension just disappears after 10 minutes. It's a story driven film where characters are just mostly there to fill in the gaps to make the plotline move but even that is underwhelming. The premise is good but the execution falls short, and that isn't even to mention the horrible way the characters were written.The way movies work with their characters is by giving them relatable motivations and decisions that make the character feel human. With that said, no one in this movie is even the slightest bit likeable. Everyone is so one dimensional that it would be very hard to believe that these type of people exist in real life. The science people are science people and the normal people are normal people. There's nothing more to them other than they don't want to die. Most of the cast feel out of place and are either underused or overused, and not in a good way. The great actors don't do much and the average ones get the most screen time for some reason. Also another thing, what the hell was Matt Damon here for? His wife died and after that he sort of just lingers around. I get that the movie needs a relatable everyday person to represent the people suffering the disease but he served no purpose in the story. Sure he was immune but they barely did anything with it. They introduced the concept of immunity once and completely forgot about it. The film has this common theme about forgetting things, such as introducing a character and not doing anything with them or just putting them on screen for a few minutes and completely forget about them.The only time I enjoyed the film was when we see how the world reacted to the disease like rioting. It actually feels real when this is happening, and for a movie that set itself in reality, this is very important, but even that feels lacklustre. People will riot from time to time but in the end it never really does anything. Probably because of the movie's terrible pacing. Also that is another thing. The pacing in this movie sucks. At times its really intense and after that it just switches to slow and calm and it makes the flow of the film very clunky as a result. I think a quick fix for this would be to make this a short series where the characters get developed and the flow is made clearer. Other than that I don't think this movie is salvageable.I didn't like it but some people might and they have every right to do so. As for me I really isn't my cup of tea to be honest. 4/10.",Contagion

It was dull and very soon appeared to loose any 'focus', lots of changing priorities and no clear direction. It seemed as though the plot and theme were only in the title. I don't quite know where or how it could have been brought together better but I nearly didn't see it through to the end. Its a shame such a great cast were all 'drifters' within the film and Jude Law's character appeared to be more of a irritation than any solid part of the plot, mind you I suppose it helped to keep one awake.............just!!!

I thought it had a kind of 'CSI' vibe to me. I liked the way the story showed what day it was, place, etc, and kind of followed the outbreak across the globe. The acting by Matt Damon and Jude Law was great, but overall it just didn't have enough conflict. I felt like I had seen it before in similar movies, and there was no main protagonist/bad guy to fight against (well, besides the virus itself, of course!) The film made me think about germs, diseases, and government cover ups. Which are all too real even today. I did really like the last scene and how the movie came full circle.

But he kinda repeats himself, and his visual style is better in small doses.My rating was between a 7 and 8. Gave it the 8 to counterbalance the philistines who are unhappy that there is no central character they can ""identify"" with. Noticed this over the years, if the main character is a 'bad guy' then movie gets bad reviews. Really?Movie is well done, shows some pain and some conflict. Could have shown more. The plot/script spent more time on the govt. researchers than I thought was necessary. In line with that, it shows them to be competent and hardworking, and finally heroic. That's nice! What we see in 2020? Is anyone impressed by the govt. handling of this current 'baby virus'?Thought this movie was scary? Wait until the real one hits. The hoarding, the violence that follows, and the panic will be 10 times what this movie portrays. The movie ultimately shows humans in control. Believe me, virus mutation is beyond our control. Human herd behavior is beyond our control. I guess that makes the Blogger (Jude Law) one of the best characters. He exploits the wave, and the whole time he is creating the wave of panic by undermining the govt. Very realistic, and I hope more people can see how a charlatan operates in this day and age.

427,marc-895,Open your mind - this might change it.,7,25 December 2011,"There are several reasons I don't like Damon, Paltrow, Law and Winslet. They're rich, good looking and powerful (hey, I didn't say they were good reasons) but this film is not one of them.In this rare cinematic event, Steven Soderbergh, directs this ensemble of wonderful talent in a gripping and quite disturbingly realistic apocalyptic vision penned with believable precision by Scott Z. Burns (Bourne Ultimatum, The Informant! Both also featuring Damon; The Informant directed by Soderbergh).Without giving anything away, the movie alone is pretty of the genre. Soderbergh does away with expensive SFX and brings the characters into a sharp focus against a gritty and frightening possibility placing these usually beautiful people into ""ordinary Joe"" dressed down look with everyday failures.Yet it never feels contrived. Damon in particular shuffles through each scene as a dishevelled dad with unwashed hair and unkempt facial hair; never quite knowing what the hell is going on. Law and Winslett provide brilliant support as equally flawed, but entirely believable characters who are moved by rather than move the story, or worse, are just there for as eye candy.While not a movie for the feint of heart, the hard science in Contagion exposes some interesting questions for us all. The archetypal Damon/Paltrow/Law and Winslet fans are likely to be disappointed (for the wrong reasons) but true movie lovers are in for a nightmarish treat - but the nightmares will come after the credits are a distant memory.",Contagion

The chaos that follows military curfews in affected towns (e.g. Minneapolis) leads to supply shortages and looting to get the increasingly fewer goods.While still a movie, I cannot help admire the thoroughness the US government goes about identifying events from Ground Zero to eventual mass production of the vaccine. The movie avoids a CSI-like graphic screen demonstration of infections and suchlike and sticks to fast-paced drama of a thriller nature.A seemingly random affair kick starts the eventual epidemic that kills 26 million worldwide.

A deadly pathogen that threatens to wipe out humanity. Check! A film that plays off our worse fears. Check! A film that shows us what could really happen and that our present time in humanity is not immune to such diseases that have wiped out past generations. Check! And that's what I think is good about the film, it's like one of those future science fiction documentaries that show us what could happen but it is presented in a story and packaged around people's lives. We follow interconnecting stories seen through the lives of different people. The stories presented to us are solely connected by this contagion, which threatens to wipe out humanity.THE QUESTIONABLE - once we know there is a virus that threatens to wipe out humanity we, as an audience know it is only a matter of time before the good guy scientists stop it. The story is very predictable. I feel like I've seen this film done a thousand times before although I haven't. We just know the course this movie will take from the get go. A little more plot twist and a unpredictable ending would have served this movie a lot better. That brings me to...THE BAD - if it was not for the A-last cast of actors and a seasoned director attached to this movie, this movie would have gotten a notably lower critical grade as the story is pretty predictable. And even when we get to know the characters' lives something still feels amiss. Also, some parts of this movie is just long and boring - to be brutally honest.

It's somewhat lacking in drama and excitement. I'm not asking for a game of chicken between a helicopter and a bomb-laden jet but I would have liked to see more of a sense of panic and chaos as the virus took hold, and more conflict and irrational behaviour resulting from that panic.

Featuring an excellent ensemble cast including Jason Bourne, Morpheus, Rose from Titanic and Goop founder Gwenynth Paltrow, this movie was praised for it accuracy when it was released in 2011.And then, 2020 came along.The COVID-19 pandemic is WAY similar to the one featured in the movie, and immediately it became relevant again. In fact, it was so popular, i had to get myself a Blu-Ray copy of the film, which i had already seen before the virus started. But let's just ignore that, and take a look at the movie itself.Contagion is better than Warner's previous viral film, Outbreak, in many ways. As mentioned, the actors make a great effort to be as real as possible, it has a unique blend of drama and suspense, and it could help you learn a thing or two about the subject.Come give it a watch.",Contagion
439,simonwells,Yet another colourless empty Steven Soderbergh film,4,21 December 2011,"It is a real shame that this film turned out the way it did, as from the outset it had so much potential. A cast of good A-grade actors and a semi-decent screenplay which was wasted by Steven Soderbergh's lack of vision and directing talent.The film tells the story of a group of people affected by an epidemic spreading across globe, but unlike other better films of this genre (like Outbreak and even The andromeda strain), it teases the viewer just enough to keep them interested yet never quite delivers.I have to admit I am no fan of Steven Soderbergh's films. I find as a director he lacks the vision to bring to film something special and instead concentrates far far too much on cinematography and how shots look, rather than telling a story in such a way as it becomes compelling.Honestly I don't think Steven Soderbergh has ever delivered a film which delivers, and yet again here is another.I wouldn't bother.",Contagion

442,b-hodgkiss,Definitely Need to Watch,7,26 October 2011,"When I first went to watch the film I admit I was sceptical about the age certificate it had been given and how it would impact the plot. 12a films usually don't have such paranoia or scary narratives so I was glad when this film didn't skirt around the edges of fear and instead plunged straight in. The first thing about the film you realise is that there are a lot of characters which makes the film uniquely interesting to watch, there are very rarely and slow moments as we switch from character to character and the tension runs throughout. Matt Damon,Jude Law, Kate Winslet and Gwenyth Paltrow all give stunningly realistic and compelling performances all the way through the film, making us emotionally attached in an instant and eager to know the fate of their characters. The only thing that could be improved with this film is perhaps the closure of some issues. A few things are left open towards the end and, although they don't directly link to the plot, you find yourself thinking, what happened with such-a-thing? or what was it in that scene then? Overall the movie remains mysterious and slightly too realistic, but this instills the needed amount of anticipation and dread for on-the-edge-of-your-seat viewing. Along with the music, camera work, lighting and edit, the film comes together into something particularly special, quite an intelligent film which doesn't have to be too graphic to be scary or over the top on emotions. The goosebumps do raise their heads at some points during the film, but in a good way that fits perfectly with the reaction expected. This film is definitely worth watching, maybe not for younger children as it may be slightly too dramatic or sometimes a bit too complicated/fast paced for them to keep up with. The creepy thing is, when I watched it in the cinema, everyone began to cough and sniff, so don't see it if you're paranoid!",Contagion
443,gtmail77,Very disappointing,3,20 March 2012,"I agree with the other reviewers listed under Hated It. A kinda dull movie can still have its good points - artistic, sad, mysterious, left to interpretation - esp when dealing with a pandemic and personal stories using a strong(ish) cast. (rent Take Shelter or Sunshine) But this thing is DOA. The only really interesting character is Kate Winslet as a hard core Dr. But even with the clock ticking as the virus makes its way around the world, this movie has no plot. Outbreak was better, even the original Andromeda Strain (1970) was 100X better and made all the medical stuff real but understandable. Here, the characters are either mixing medical research with politics (Zzsnore) or revert to CGI drawings to help moviegoers understand high school biology. The ending should have been the beginning of the good part, after leaving all the gabbing and Jude Law's trite char on the cutting room floor. I still want to know if Paltrow's 'friend' ever got sick? And why did the woman run out of the airport waiting area? I guess questions like these can be answered by jumping to different chapters of the DVD. But in this case, not worth the time.",Contagion
444,laffnj,"Entertaining and interesting portrayal, but expected a lot more",6,6 October 2011,"This film was one I was so excited to see. It has an all-star cast, and the plot sounded as entertaining as anything. Going into this film with its competition in my eyes being Outbreak (1995), and it did no disappoint. The story was very smart and seemed very realistic. The all- star cast was fairly disappointing, not their acting aspects, but their roles in the film. Gwyneth Paltrow in the film for about two minutes, and Matt Damon play a pretty quite roll, not like the Damon we see in Bourne Identity and The Departed. Laurence Fishburne and Jude Law played the two main rolls in this film, and they really did carry the film, although Jude Law needs to work on his accents. This film is definitely watchable; it will entertain anyone with its interesting epidemic portrayal. I wouldn't say it's a must see but it will top most of the movies out at the present time. Just note that this movie will make you think twice about what you touch and who you speak to.",Contagion

This is a movie far more about ideas than people and that is not necessarily a bad thing. Excellent direction from Soderbergh, masterful cinematography, and while there are a few logical mis-steps, the writing more than makes up for that by confounding expectations more than once in truly creative and credible ways. Unfortunately trailers have many seeking an action thrill-ride, when what it delivers for the most part is a slow boiling suspenseful drama. When will Hollywood learn that setting expectations that don't match the product may sell a few extra tickets in the beginning, but hurts word of mouth and user reviews which are needed for the success of a film beyond the opening weekend.",Contagion

In fact, maybe two many - There were several ""avenues"" I would have liked to seen gone further down.Another problem, several of the ""story-lines"" left you asking more question at the end of the movie than giving you answers.

Well, if you haven't, and want to, then you might want to see Contagion.That's not to say the film is bad, it's just forgettable. The film stays in one pace throughout and if I had to compare it to a track event - I'd say it was a marathon, slow and deliberate without much pace increase. There are many unanswered questions (and not good ponderers either, just frustrations) and there is no 'pay off' - no one single moment of brilliance that makes you reflect and go, ""wow, yeah, that was good"". Fundamentally for me (and I'll try not to ruin it) - there is a scene whereby a child is killed by the virus - and the grief is little-to- none. Not only is there no real grief in the immediate scene but none in the following scenes either - just seemed unrealistic to me and completely ruled out that character - also, ah screw it, I've said there are spoilers so I might as well spoil it... in the film you discovered certain people are immune to the virus - but this doesn't add anything to the movie (unless I missed something in which case please let me know where I missed it).However, the film does flow nicely, the acting is believable and the plot also tangible. In fact, with a better ending this may well have been an 8 out of 10, pushing towards a 9. So much is true for a lot of films... The Road being another example.It is an interesting take on how 'we' would react to a situation of this kind, and it seems plausible enough but give me Outbreak any day of the week over this movie.",Contagion
451,ArtificialLuddite,Warning: May Cause Drowsiness.,5,15 December 2011,"Remember when a science teacher named Eliot Moore attempted to survive a disturbing pandemic in Central Park? No? How about when virologist Colonel Sam Daniels combined monkey antibodies in Cedar Creek? If not, then you are likely to forget Contagion, Steven Soderberg's germ-based disaster movie.In the opening scene, Gwyneth Paltrow unleashes a fast-acting lethal virus on Western civilization, and before long, Laurence Fishburne is making important decisions as Matt Damon's dejected everyman protects his daughter, and a uniformed Bryan Cranston makes concerned faces. In between these frantic scenes, a puffy-eyed Marion Cotillard traces the humble bat-pig origins of the deadly virus, while a host of other famous faces pass through, flogging sensational tales and intense gazes.Critics have referred to this as an ""eclectic cast,"" and ""an ensemble piece,"" but most characters, like janitor John Hawkes or lab-assistant Demetri Martin, are pointless to the point of parody. The sheer number of them makes for some fast-paced editing, and the plot thunders along as a result – jumping from Hong Kong, San Francisco, and Tokyo – but at what cost? No actor successfully escapes from the one-dimensional script, although Damon comes close with his 'grieving husband,' as does Kate Winslet, who is underused.Despite this, Contagion still remains a relatively entertaining popcorn movie, and its realistic take on the disaster-film genre is a welcome change from more recent and hammy ones: Roland Emmerich's 2012 and the Spierig brother's Daybreakers come to mind. With rising death tolls and no cure in sight, society rapidly deteriorates with riots and looting in every major capital. It's fine. It's not ""bloody terrifying,"" or some ""metathriller"" or a ""methodical exploration of the threat of pandemics"" that is ""well worth your time."" It's fine.",Contagion
452,kriptexxxx,Great movie with a bad message,8,21 December 2020,"It is a great movie - and in 2020 very much relevant - but I do not like that it portrays breaking the rules for selfish reasons positively.SPOILER
1. A character playing a key role in organizing the events is breaking the rules by giving his vaccine to a small boy as a ""selfless"" act and what is even worse, he still puts on the bracelet showing that he is vaccinated, thus he is allowed to walk freely everywhere and nobody would suspect that he can spread the virus.2. Another character, the main scientist eventually developing the vaccine, is shown as testing the vaccine herself - again, as a selfless act - but that is also extremely stupid, because if she is wrong, she dies and that would slow down the process.
There is a reason we don't test the vaccine on the president.3. A woman investigating the source in Hong Kong gets kidnapped by people, who selfishly want to get ahead of others in the line for the vaccine, and she is shown as playing with the children in the village of her captors and eventually helping them orchestrating the exchange of herself for the vaccine.They all portray selfish and reckless behavior as selflessness and kindness.
She is not just getting the vaccine out of thin air for that village (which is secluded and rather safe anyway), but also taking those vaccines from others who almost certainly would need it more.Please, stop portraying recklessness as good in movies. If the hero is sacrificing himself that is fine, but when they are ""not leaving until everybody is there"" then they are risking the life of many others as well. And no, don't ask the others if they want to wait for that last member, you cannot ask them to make this decision on the spot.

453,dalillady_24,Great Theatrical Scenario; Not So Great In Reality!,10,13 March 2020,"I watched this movie for the first time about a year ago. It's the first scenario that came to mind, when they started talking about tracing it back to a live market in China. A bit scary, obviously. But, this is a fictional disease, spreading and killing rapidly. The current outbreak of COVID-19, seems to be just as contagious, but a lot more selective about the killing. However, think about this movie in terms of what we have NOT yet seen. The infection wasn't recognized at first, multiple people showed up sick (dozens), the Chinese government was not very open (maybe because they weren't sure yet), other governments continued their daily business/lives as if nothing was going on (again, likely because they didn't realize the significance, AND China's tight lipped practice), this particular virus being contagious during incubation, and the fact that so many have died. Keeping that in mind, think how realistic this movie would be if the virus was deadly to more people than just the elderly/immune compromised.It didn't focus on character development because that wasn't the point. The point was how little our governments are prepared for something like this. How little the human population is prepared. Right now, COVID-19 is really only ""deadly"" to a small subset of the population, but what if it wasn't? We're meant to see just how important constant & consistent healthy hygiene is. We're meant to see that we depend on governments to have stuff like this under control, when in reality, we should've been hand washing and taking care of US all along. That while the government may figure it out eventually; it's up to us to not spread stuff like this by killing germs frequently.The zombie virus won't JUST spread from zombie bites, like in the movies. Who knows, COVID-19 could be the virus that lays dormant until death and then reanimated its host. I mean, that was theatrical, obviously, but the basic premise remains the same. Don't panic.

Previously, l had no desire to see Contagion when I first heard of it. As I predicted, this movie didn't deviate from any of my expectations.
Now don't get me wrong. I love docudrama movies, and also cinema that informs the audience like, Lions for Lambs 2007, to movies of different genres like The Day the Earth Stood Still.

The fact of the matter is I have not seen such a waste of a talented cast in many a year. Charecterisation was at best poorly developed at worst sloppy at best, Matt Damon was probably the most developed of these and I really didn't even care about him. This film suffered from the fact that it was a 12A classification and therefore did not have the elbow room to develop more adult themes and scenarios from the collapse of public order in a 'developed' society, I don't know whether this was a deliberate marketing ploy cashing in on half term break but it really limited the breadth of the film and its potential. I think for me the fact of the matter is that it is a non event of a film nobody you actually care about dies, in fact Gwyneth Paltrow receives divine judgement for her infidelity, a couple of sketchily characters pop their clogs, I include in this the lovely Kate Winslet, but hey! don't don't worry just under 10% of the worlds population dies but the American way of life is not affected one jot the nurses may have stopped working but the power stations are still running, which I find stretches credulity to breaking point, there is a light reference to a run on the banks, a run on gunshops being the more likely scenario, however the effects would be considerably worse with one tenth of the population missing and the rest in mourning. Mobile phones keep working the police are still able to rustle up squad cars and no mention that a state of emergency has been declared in several metropolitan areas and the impact of American armed forces having to shoot looters and yes the desperate.

Unlike other similar movies in this genre, like Outbreak, this movie doesn't have a happy ending. While there is a vaccine and all but the human loss is shown at an unprecedented scale.
Soderberg really make the viewer uncomfortable and is quite hard hitting in his narrative. There are no cute or funny moments to break the tension.

470,Radagast23,It's no Outbreak,7,14 March 2012,"I waited a while to watch this movie for a single reason - I didn't think it wouldn't be as good as 1995's Outbreak. It's a similar formula, a world-threatening virus film packed with star power. Outbreak worked because it cast the right stars and wasn't vague on its ambitions. Contagionwell it got a lot of things right, but lost because it failed on the latter.Contagion is a unique take on the epidemic movie. While there are main characters, most of them aren't connected in any way. You get to follow several story lines across the globe, from a woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) that returns from a business trip feeling extremely sick to her family in Minnesota, to a conspiracy blogger (Jude Law) holed up in San Francisco. These characters and a dozen others are used to give different perspectives as a deadly virus spreads around the world. The film also changes tone as it progresses. There is a feeling of excitement and mystery as cases start to pop up, which quickly turns to a feeling of panic and paranoia when the death toll mounts. By the end, it feels almost like you are watching a different movie from when you began.While I don't think Jude Law gave anything exceptional to Contagion, the rest of the cast was pretty good. Winslet, Cotillard, and Fishburne all gave their usually quality performances. Matt Damon stood out, as he has more and more recently, as a father who finds out he is immune and attempts to do everything he can to keep his daughter alive. Jennifer Ehle, a relative unknown, also manages to draw attention away from her veteran costars, portraying one of the last dedicated doctors trying to create a vaccine.In the end, the success or failure of the film rests on the director. And while Soderbergh is as capable as they come, I have to place my blame on him for Contagion falling short. At first I wasn't sure what bothered me about this film, but in writing this review, I realize it was the identity. After the first half, I was just confused what Contagion was trying to be. While I was engrossed at first, the vagueness of what this film was trying to do started to irk me. It dragged on, good characters were forgotten while average characters were focused on, and the overall urgency of the story was lost. It did, however, have a pretty strong ending. It was just the 40-50 minutes before that that needed to be different.A low 7/10.",Contagion

And I know why they cast Lawrence Fishburne in the lead - the is essentially CSI: CDC. Basically a procedural drama that shows you what realistically would happen (for the most part) if there were some sort of outbreak - but it leaves compelling storytelling and characterizations at the door. It has several plot threads that are left completely wide open in the end, and Soderbergh seems to relish that, but it just didn't work for me. Sadly, I can not recommend this movie.",Contagion

476,jgrizzle358,Not sure what to think...,6,6 April 2012,"Contagion was good, but don't let the trailer fool you. It's not an action-packed post-apocalyptic thriller. It's like a... slow moving, suspenseful drama. The movie focuses more on how ideas can be more dangerous than a virus when placed in the wrong hands. The movie is certainly more realistic then most virus/contamination flicks, meaning that it doesn't go into some overplayed, everyone drops dead like flies, kinda deal. The movie's main focus is on how we should or should not deal with such a crisis. It's not your average disaters movie. No explosions and fights, very little violence. If anything This is more a thought provoking set piece rather than an actual movie. There's lots of emotion and mellowdrama and I'd be lying if I said it was captivating. However, against all odds, and even with it's flaws you still take something out of it in the end. And I believe that's what the writers intended. It's not about the story. It's really not. It's about the idea. It's about the ""what if?"" scenario. It's about that lingering thought in the back of your mind when the credits roll. You come out of not knowing exactly what to think. Did you like? Did you hate it? You're honestly not sure. All you know is it stuck with you for some reason.This isn't the first time Matt Damon has been in a movie with that lingering effect. The movie ""Hereafter"" sort of leaves you with the same feeling at the end...This is a movie that cannot be truly explained in words aside from what I have already done. All I can say is, watch it. And when you start watching it, completely erase your mind, don't try to think about it too much, don't go into expecting something. Just watch it. Regardless of how bored you get, watch it until the end. Then ask yourself how you feel afterwards... You may be surprised to find that you aren't really sure...overall rating: 6/10",Contagion

Made in 2010, this movie is amazingly like a documentary about a made up Covid's brother/sister virus.But then,something in the editing,or rythm,angles,too many static takes...even colour,like if the director of photography wasn't inspired at all, making this movie a bit dull for what it tells even in 2020.",Contagion
478,arcooper,"Don't blame mis-marketing, blame the meandering, irrelevant plot",4,3 January 2012,"I've been looking at some reviews and forum posts on this website about Contagion, and I keep hearing about how its a great movie that was tragically mis-marketed, which is why a lot of people thought it was boring. I think it was boring because the characters were not good enough to get me to to care and the plot was meandering and basically irrelevant to any character arc. It also never helps when you try to jam a phony message into your movie to make up for the lack of plot and character development.A good example is the role of Matt Damon's character in the plot. If I'm writing this script and I have some of Matt Damon's family members dying of the disease but him surviving as a carrier here's what I would think about how the rest of the plot should progress:I somehow have to link Matt Damon's story to the story of finding the cure even though he is not an expert in diseases in any way, I have to use his unique status as a carrier who is somehow immune. If I want to convey a theme of Matt Damon being a lone wolf trying to escape a huge powerful organization (the CDC) I can create some reason that they are at odds with him. 2 things that come to mind are doing some kind of risky/invasive tests on him or his family members that he tries to stop or escape from, or keeping him in quarantine long term when he wants to be free. Then if I want to make an action movie, he can actually run away. If I want to make a drama I would have the CDC using some kind of deception to get him to do what they want and have him try to resist either successfully or unsuccessfully. There are many other ways to do this, but you need some kind of link. There is no point in having a movie with multiple unrelated plots and sets of characters.What did the writers actually do? They have virtually no connection between the Matt Damon storyline and the attempt to cure the disease. All that happens is they tell him his wife cheated on him and then he goes home and obsessively tries to protect his daughter. Since Matt Damon is the only character who actually lets us see some of his emotions, his complete disconnect to the main plot makes me not care about the plot, and it makes the larger events not affect his character. When I was watching this movie, there was basically no suspense during the scenes where the CDC is trying to find a cure or inadvertently leaking info about the disease, because the only 2 characters I care about are Matt Damon and his daughter, and they aren't directly emotionally affected.I read a review which said: ""This is a movie far more about ideas than people and that is not necessarily a bad thing."" This makes no sense to me. Besides the fact that there is certainly nothing wrong with a movie that is just about characters, when you introduce larger themes it means your characters HAVE to still stand up. Gomer Pyle's character in Full Metal Jacket is obviously there to show the brutalizing effect of brainwashing and extreme systemic punishment, but if Kubrick hadn't presented the character as a realistic, relatable, human character, it would only demonstrate the effect that movies have on actors pretending to be brainwashed. Fortunately Kubrick was a brilliant, meticulous director who made Pyle flawless. The whole point of a movie is to communicate a feeling, thought or message using characters and events. If the characters and events don't matter, neither will your message.Which gets me to another point, WHAT'S THE MESSAGE? Is it that Jude Law can incite a lot of people into irrational anger and mayhem (well that may be true). Is it that we should trust the CDC and assume that dissenting voices are just crazed conspiracy theorists? I seriously do not know what I'm supposed to be getting.I should say that Matt Damon played his part to perfection, and that the cinematography was very good, and the pieces could have come together very well given a better plot.",Contagion

My husband, who is not in the medical community, understood less than half of the high flying medical terms and information that was being thrown out. To say the least he was UNDERWHELMED by this movie. Okay, it showed how fast contagion can spread in this modern flat world. Other than that it was a waste of money and time.

481,everythingcritic,"solid, efficient storytelling",8,10 September 2011,"I can see why some people might be a bit disappointed in this movie, because it's a pretty realistic on a pandemic, without a main heroic character or even action really. It's full dialogue-driven scenes, and most of the characters aren't really fleshed out.I was OK with that because it's able to show the different effects of a pandemic throughout the globe instead having one or two main characters. A small Chinese village near the source of the virus tries to survive. A misguided blogger ends up inciting violence . And a recently single father tries to protect his daughter. The way the story cuts between these different story lines kept me from getting bored, and nothing that happens feels unrealistic.So while it's a movie I don't really need to see again, it's good to experience once. It's intense while it lasts, and is a nice reminder of what could've actually happened if swine flu was actually a big deal.",Contagion
482,daniStakset,Boring,1,11 December 2011,"I probably rate this 1/10 since I had huge expectations before pressing Play.What sucks about it is that it ended when it should have began. I got so bored during the first 20 minutes I barely even watched it without Facebooking with VLC in windowed mode. I wanted to see a movie about contagion, about how people react in a apocalypse-like environment. Sadly, we barely got those scenes. Damon had no development, the film should've been centered around him and the choices he has to make to keep his daughter safe. There was 1 instance of that i think; in the line where they handed out food, someone pushed his daughter and Damon pushed him back. And yeah, the kid who stalks his daughter, Damon had to tell him off a couple of times.Twitter & Facebooktime. In the TV interview, it just sounded so stupid when the host asks the blogger ""on Twitter, you wrote..."" Like really? I don't know, maybe i'm just tired but it seems stupid when they're talking about a global conspiracy.The ending wasn't explained at all, they just showed some animals doing animal things. Like 2 minutes. They seriously felt 2 minutes were enough to explain the virus origin, and they didn't even explain it, they just showed how it went from bats to people. I think Contagion would've been better if they shortened the huge upbuilding and the boring lab scenes, put more focus on Damon and his daughter, more scenes from the streets, a better & well explained ending, and maybe even make the movie 30 minutes longer.",Contagion
483,Apollocandybar,"Very good action film, not many disappointments",9,12 September 2011,"We saw this movie the day after it came out. We went into the movie with low expectations, because the previews/trailers made it seem very much like many other movies. And, to be fair, it really was similar to movies like Outbreak in many ways, but much better. Outbreak had sort of a TV- movie sort of feel, low budget in many ways. Contagion does not feel low budget at all. The cinematography is outstanding (not something I'd normally notice!), where different scenes have totally different color schemes and feels depending on the location and situation. Matt Damon was amazing as the concerned father, and Kate Winslet was so good as an American epidemiologist, I totally forgot about Rose Dawson. There were only a handful of scenes that lagged or seemed a bit boring. There is about a two-minute montage of no dialogue, just visuals, that is meant to move the story forward, but it lasts far too long and doesn't give us any new information. It seemed like a bad decision in editing.Also, from the political standpoint, for much of the film you are given the impression this a very right-wing piece of propaganda, yet at the end you are given an undeniably left-wing perspective as well. I won't spoil it by being any more specific, but just to say - don't get offended to shut down if you think the politics are not what you agree with - it'll likely change before it's over.",Contagion
484,pinkseashell09,Disappointment,5,16 October 2011,"This movie had so much potential. The first time i saw the trailer I was convinced it would be a great movie involving a virus that spreads such as in Dawn of The Dead or The crazies that ultimately infects the body and causes the persons brain to die and just live on basic instinct: Feed of fresh blood. I spent my money to see it in IMAX I was so excited. When I left that night I honestly regretted spending my money. This movie was filled with great actors and yet it did not live up to expectations. *Spoliers* PROS: Watching the virus spread was perfect. Not like in Dawn of the Dead or in 28 days later you don't really see people getting infected(other than bites) You see the main character wake up and its Armageddon already. This movie provided the first initial sings of virus spreading. I loved seeing the government at least or the Centers for Disease control trying to fix it. In movies such as 28 days, you don't get a feel of what the government tried to do. In this film you see people also breaking through pharmacies for help. CONS:The virus kills its victim.....I hated this movie because of it since it was so simple. You get the virus you die. There's no coming back and causing hell, distraction and more chaos. The worst thing this movie did was that it had a vaccine. Once the vaccine came out, the movie ended. The chaos ended and all you saw was how the virus came to be Basically this is the movie. A sickness spreads in several countries, people die and go crazy to prevent from getting sick, vaccine saves people the end. It was like watching the news about a flu but don't worry there's a vaccine. It killed the plot. I left the movie thinking what was he point of that? At some points it was so boring I wanted to sleep. Not something I would rent, or buy or dare watch again for free. But its realistic, I prefer zombies.",Contagion

I really love epidemic movies and this was no exception. Sadly, It is very much like many other epidemic movies so, if you are looking for something different and surprising, this is not it. I think the events aren't quite as drastic as they would be if they were real. They show a little bit of chaos but they show a lot of empty stores and talk about no nurses at one point. However somehow there is enough food and running water and electricity. To me, that makes it less believable. The story jumps around a lot at the beginning, which for this type of movie is usual. There are some confusing parts but you can figure them out. I actually watched the movie twice to really piece it all together. Overall it was a good movie. My main complaint is the story was too similar to other epidemic movies. It was not unique enough and it wasn't very detailed in some aspects. I would still recommend it.",Contagion

495,liersenic,http://tgtbtw.blogspot.com/,6,7 February 2012,"When I first saw the trailer for Contagion, I remember thinking to myself that it was going to be a mediocre disaster film, that tried to save itself with a cast full of established actors, such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, and the list goes on. To my surprise though,I was completely wrong, I actually enjoyed every moment of this viral outbreak. The film focuses on two groups, one being the Emhoff family (Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, and the other being the team that is working with the CDC to try and figure out what the virus is, and where it came from. Mitch Emhoff lost his wife to the virus shortly after she returned home from her trip from Hong Kong, and immediately after he lost his son as well. The film is well paced, switching back and forth between groups, showing day by day how the virus rapidly spreads around the world. By doing this, the film shows how an average family most likely would react to an outbreak like this, but at the same time showing us a behind the scenes look at how a government might have to handle a situation like this. For me the most interesting parts of the film was at the labs of the medical groups who were studying the virus. They did a great job of explaining how the virus works, and how it actually evolves to always beat our immune system. They never used fancy medical terms to make the actors sounds smart, but instead kept it simple so all viewers could understand and still kept very believable. The way each scene is shot, close ups of people sweating, and focusing on actors hands touching objects, really intensified the fear that came a long with the virus. Unlike most disaster films this threat is a completely silent killer, and we have no idea who is going to fall victim to the virus. As the story progresses, and the virus spreads, we see how the population begins to react, as rumors spread of the government knowing exactly what the virus is, and how to cure the sickness as well. The entirety of the movie does a perfect job making the virus feel as if though it could be real, and this could happen to us any day. For those who have fear of germs to begin with, this film is absolutely not for you. I am in no way a germ freak, but after watching this, it's almost impossible not to feel sick. My only issue with the movie, is the ending. I am not going to spoil anything, but to me I felt as if the ending was a little rushed compared to the pace of the rest of the film. The ending in no way ruined the movie for me, but I do hope they come out with a Directors cut later on with alternate endings, or do I dare say a sequel...hopefully not. In my opinion Contagion is one of the better blockbuster films of 2011, and definitely one of the better disaster films in the past few years. Rating: 6/10",Contagion
496,jeffallenhammer,Contagions suffers from a bad case of subtraction by addition.,5,24 September 2011,"Contagion suffers from a bad case of subtraction by addition, it never quite recovers. A film of this magnitude needs a protagonist that an audience will walk through hellfire and brimstone for. We like the characters well enough, but there are so many that we never fully get to know them. Any of the subplots with a backdrop of a worldwide pandemic would certainly provide a very dramatic story. We could have followed Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) and Dr. Erin Mears (Kate Winslet) as they struggle to contain and create a cure for the disease. We could have had an every man's point of view by seeing the event from the eyes of Mitch Emhoff, who's dealing with great tragedy and deceit at the same time. Marion Cotillard plays Dr. Leonora Orantes, a woman who is kidnapped, but becomes sympathetic to her captors. This circumstance could made a phenomenal film, as could have the story of Jude Law's Alan Krumwiede, who tries to turn a profit from people's fears and naivety. The point is, the film had promise, there's just not that one person to really latch on to. Sure the film has a scientifically solid story, which I do appreciate, but maybe that's its problem. Movies make people cry, even though they aren't real, yet when we read about atrocities in the paper, we merely say ""that's terrible"" and go on with our day. This is so realistic, it has a newspaper feel to it, it just doesn't quite push the right buttons. There are moments here and there where the dialogue is strong, such as when Dr. Cheever is talking to a man about the history of handshakes; once handshakes were used to show that you meant no harm, were unarmed, yet in the times of Contagion a single handshake could lead to hundreds of deaths, maybe more. But in the sequences of great dramatics, like the tragedy of losing a loved one and debates of how to alert the public, reactions seem disingenuous and poorly written. Soderbergh uses close-ups and cuts of infected items which will strike fear in the hearts of germophobes, but the typical viewer will be less than convinced. The film is better used as a public service announcement than entertainment.",Contagion

This story needed more civil unrest, there shouldn't have been a cure at all; this is the kind of thing people who live in the real world would like to be entertained by.The issue is that just like any melodrama at the end someone saves the day.

498,Pongo000,A lugubrious mess,1,30 October 2011,"Steven Soderbergh's plodding, insipid direction and a host of characters you really can't sympathize this makes this movie one of the worst I've seen. Worst of all, the trailers are absolutely misleading: No one could have watched these and not expected a mix of ""28 Days Later"" with maybe a bit of ""Resident Evil"" thrown in. Instead, we're offered a classic case of bait and switch.Soderbergh hasn't come out with a decent movie since ""Traffic"". What was he thinking here? Trademark Soderbergh directing abounds in this one: Long lingering shots that are confusing or that the viewer really doesn't care about (door locks anyone?). An incredibly interminable casino sequence where we get to watch a character played by Gwyneth Paltrow gamble. For long minutes. I mean, really? Soderbergh has this uncanny ability (shared with Woody Allen) to attract top stars to his films. Unlike Allen, Soderbergh's movies (save for the aforementioned ""Traffic"" and possibly ""sex, lies, and videotape"" are all fluff pieces, here and gone faster than you can say ""It's not just lysine. It's citric. It's gluconate."" What in the world was Matt Damon thinking when he took on this script? I forgave him for ""The Informant!"". But geez, since when do patients get bad news about the passing of a loved one in front of the patient registration desk? Damon is practically devoid of emotion throughout the movie, which I attribute not to Damon's acting ability (he's actually a brilliant actor in the right setting), but to Soderbergh's brain-dead directing. His character is simply one that's difficult to care about, as are most of the other characters.I could go on an on about good actors wasted in a bad film: Kate Winslet handing a sick person her blanket off her own death bed (yeah, we get it: She's a person that thinks about others, but that's why she's a doctor)...Paltrow, so excellent in so many movies, reduced to an adulteress that has zero character development, yet we're expected to actually care for her...Laurence Fishburn, whose character is incredibly egocentric, looking out only for himself and those around him until Soderbergh figures out he should be imbued with a shred of compassion to tidy things up at the end. What in the world were you all thinking?For the love of God, your loved ones, your friends, and most of all yourself: Skip this one.

People who watched it before corona virus outbreak or the people who doesn't have any ideas about pandemic diseases failed to comprehend the importance of this film, and they also could not relate themselves with the film. This movie got so many important things right. I am not denying it added some irrational drama to spice things up a bit, but the film conveys its message successfully. Today(2020) we see people are fighting over toilet tissues, so called civilized humans can't manage to stay civil in a time of crisis. And there are opportunists who are making up conspiracy theories and selling those stories to gullible brain-washed people, eventually people lose faith in their governments; it should be admitted that sometimes governments are guilty of incompetence too. However, in the end, we still can see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel, some scientists, doctors, nurses are sacrificing or risking their lives for others; that's humanity at its best. 'Contagion' successfully covers many important aspect of a pandemic disease crisis. This is a fast-paced movies, and many critically acclaimed actors are starred in this movie like Matt Damon,Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard,Jude Law, Bryan Cranston, Gwyneth Paltrow... you know how much Steven Soderbergh love to cast high profile actors in his films; so this film is definitely not boring.

In that respect, I should admire the scenarist and the director for their foresight.Opposite to some other comments, I think it is ok for this movie to have no protagonist, which is better for a realistic plot like this one, and I find the performance of each of the main characters outstanding. However second part of the movie little bit loses momentum, ie, the vaccine is developed too quickly, some of the stories are left unfinished or unsatisfactory (where Orantes was running after she was told what was swapped was actually placebo?). In addition, it seemed rather strange to me to see only Mitch to be immune. Howcome was that and why was he the only one?Finally we learn how it all started at the end of the movie, and that Beth was the first to get infected and spread the virus, but how about the chef who shook hands with her?

While it does accurately depict alot of what is happening today,the movie fails to dive into the details and dynamics. We see death, alot of it in fact but the consequences aren't really explored. We see government enclosures- excellent, but why? What is their plan? What about the WHO we see the confusion,, but what are they trying to do? We don't know. Theres alot of unnecessary conflict such as the kidnapping tradeoff for the vaccine which is just unrealistic taking away the severity and honestly felt idiotic. The father seeing his wife and son die wasn't very impact-ful yet him finding out his wife cheating was!? Again, little scenes like this take away the virus's potency in the movie.Overall, its just a movie about the virus itself, and the world reacting. The science is sound, but the movie's depiction of the response is lacking. Lack of screen time isn't an excuse either considering some useless cuts we got.",Contagion

Lets face it we haven't had a realistic (non-zombie) Virus epidemic film in a long time so of course I was excited. When the trailer debuted I was hooked; First reason was the amazing cast it advertised in the trailer (Oscar Winner* Marion Cotillard; Oscar Winner* Kate Winslet; Oscar Winner* Matt Damon; Oscar Nominated** Laurence Fishburne; Oscar Winner* Gwyneth Paltrow; 2x Oscar Nominated** Jude Law). Second reason the trailer made the movie look so good and creepy. I just saw the movie on September 9th, 2011 and the movie did not disappoint me. The story kept me intrigued through the whole movie, the score was excellent and creepy, and character development was solid (I was most intrigued by Marion Cotillard's Character the most and wanted to know more about her and her mission but sadly she had the second least screen time just ahead of Gwyneth Paltrow's Character) which leads to my only complaint about the film was its runtime and lack of some character's screen time. The movie could have been 20 mins longer with more screen time and story for certain characters. I have no problems with the ending, I know some people do but thats just my opinion. ""Contagion"" kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and never let go even after the film finished. Lets just say I'm sure most people will try to keep their hygiene as clean as possible and be more careful about touching door handles, coughing, sneezing, sharing drinks, etc. I know I am going to. I highly recommend moviegoers to check out ""Contagion"" for the simple purpose that its a really good movie that should be watched and enjoyed.

The actors in this movie are phenomenal. With a cast like Gwyneth Paltrow, Lawrence Fishburne, Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon, and Jude Law; how could you not expect a truly good movie? Unfortunately, if this movie were on TiVo I would have skipped ahead to the end. The beginning was intriguing, the majority of the movie lacked definition of drama, but included many scientific definitions for why vaccines are important. This movie seemed more a warning to the multiple families who have stopped taking vaccines because some believe children are forming autism from said vaccines. Without Mark Wahlberg making yet another wonderful performance, this movie would have been lost. And, I'm sorry where was Matt Damon in this movie? I saw him for about 10 minutes in the entire movie - as the most minor role I have ever seen him in -- in any movie. I was not impressed. The ending was alright, but this movie had way more room for potential. It reminds me of all the M. Night Shyamalan movies that I've wasted my time on in the past.

And this film was released in 2011, having nothing but research to go on in lieu of experience.Not only that, but the emotional weight and cerebral nuance anyone who's been paying attention has come to expect from a Soderbergh production is in full bloom here. This is a great f*""&*ng movie, maybe his best. And no small attention should be paid to screenwriter Scott Z.

I enjoyed the techno soundtrack and the various locations that this film was shot in, you can see a lot of money has been spent getting this right. As for the storyline, well it's just not very contagious shall we say. The best parts of the film are linked into quite a good techno soundtrack so you almost feel you are watching a music video with a lot of people getting sick in it. I did get quite chilled out watching these sequences in the film. As for the characters portrayed by a lot of big-name stars, I think most of the performances were dialled in for a fat pay-cheque.

The movie is over 100 minutes but I felt it could have easily been longer without any detriment to the engagement of the viewers, in fact I though the ending could have been more descriptive.

There is always 'something' lacking.But this film (aside from a poor Ozzie accent by Jude Law) is absolutely brilliant. Now I know should mark it down for that - I really do know that I should, but this film illustrates so perfectly the balance between the constant quest for survival whilst at the same time needing to preserve some semblance of society - which in this case, is the perseverance of bureaucracy. Shown as before a cure is even developed (and at which stage its quite possible they wont ever find one) they are quite happily planning a tribunal against one of their own for breaching protocol!The loss shown in the film is dramatic and then the realisation that as the numbers of dead grow, the loss of their loved ones means less and less in the grand scheme of things, is simply haunting - the camera scene towards the end bring home all the humanity of the initial loss which had almost been forgotten.

A believable story from start--which takes off like a bullet thanks, in part, to no opening credits--to finish. At one point in the movie I had to remind myself I was watching a fictional scenario and not a documentary. Really. Literally. I was that drawn into the story.For all the elements the movie nailed, there were a couple of gripes. But only one significant one. First, I felt as though the wife cheating on her husband was unnecessary for the story. But, the big one was the abrupt, rushed ending. it felt as though the production was running over-budget and threw together a quick bat/pig/chef montage. And what was with the bulldozer bearing the company logo the dead wife had worked for? Maybe another part of the story that was cut out?In any case, Contagion has become one of my favorite epidemic movies.

521,RobertoLeoni,"thanks to the outbreak, Steven Soderbergh's ""Contagion"" has resurfaced as a popular film to stream worldwide...",6,25 February 2020,"""Contagion"" has resurfaced as a popular film to stream worldwide and it is only one of the many films on epidemics and pandemics in the history of cinema, starting from ""The Seventh Seal"" by Ingmar Bergman...
Contagion speaks of a contagion which starts from Hong Kong, so it's very very current, so much so that streaming is very crowded. The story tells the trip of an American businesswoman returning from Hong Kong to the United States carrying a contagion. When this contagion breaks out, this strange and unknown virus which is a mixture of swine fever and avian created by the fiction story, unleashed an emergency and the film tells about this emergency, tells about the desperate hunt for patient zero, the index case from which the infection started, which is used to understand the origin of the virus and it also serves to block this contagion as quickly as possible. But this zero patient is very difficult to find because this woman left Hong Kong, took a plane probably infecting all travelers, landed in the United States in a transit airport where he met some people, then she took another plane and arrived home after touching the hostesses, having been in bars, getting into taxis and meanwhile the people she infected went on buses, caressed and touched their friends and relatives, ate and used dishes... This explosion of the disease is truly a nightmare and meanwhile in the international medical centers both in Geneva and in the United States there is desperate hunting to try to isolate the virus to see its characteristics, but the virus changes and adapts to any situation. It is one of the most terrible things about these viruses. So you absolutely have to isolate it to find a vaccine, quickly enough to be able to distribute it. Panic must be avoided and meanwhile the states are taking political measures, social measures, health measures, research, investigations meanwhile the fear spreads...
So the film tells all this with a live shot of reality able to describe attempts to get around the pandemic which is called this because it is an epidemic that travels all over the world, a total health emergency. And to fight it, you have to violate rules of privacy and intimacy of people and lovers and secret encounters are discovered, in addition to a whole network of affections and relationships that every person has and maybe doesn't want everyone knows it. In this intricate web that by one person radiates all over the world, we can follow the evolution of the disease with its tragic events and with the possibilities of repair that there may be. The interpretation is very suggestive. There are Matt Damon, Jude Law, Marion Cotillard, therefore a great cast with excellent actors. Jude Law plays a kind of news jackal, one of the first authors of fake news that creeps into this apparatus where everyone tries to repair and infiltrates with false information about plots and about situations that may even be true, also passing off its natural remedy no one knows for sure what the effects are. He even cheats pretending to be ill and to be healed thanks to this remedy and therefore is followed by his followers who are millions. So on the one hand there is the struggle of legal organizations trying to block this virus and on the other side there is another dangerous virus which enters as a metaphor, that is, that of false news and political and social speculation, maybe to be able to fight a government or to break down a status quo. So there is the disease of the disease: there is social disease with physical disease.
Clearly the film has its roots in an atavistic fear of man.

525,nweller,Too dry,4,24 September 2018,"I put on this film knowing full well that I shouldn't expect many thrills from this ""thriller"". since the subject matter of pandemic diseases is a fairly dry one if you approach it from the perspective of health organizations and other public administrative organs - as Contagion does to a large extent. While this isn't for everyone, I expected fine entertainment regardless, since I'm generally interested in historical pandemics, studied some of them in detail, and also enjoyed learning about the public responses.As it turned out, the tone set by Contagion was much less engaging than I expected. This film does indeed spend most of its time showing health organization workers analyzing the outbreak, tracing contacts, developing a vaccine, finding suitable public policies, etc. - but they end up transporting a sober, factual, even statistical view of the outbreak. Death tolls are updated a few times, but we're only given numbers, and no attempt is made to show or explain what it really means. I generally felt no real sense of urgency in what they said or did. Trivially, even the mortality rate of the virus of 25% or so is of course fairly huge in a historical context, but hardly a certain death sentence. It wouldn't even have required artistic license to make the disease more similar to Ebola and get closer to a 90% mortality that way.The second view in this film is from the perspective of the perished patient zero's family, and brings us closer to the ground, but there weren't any thrills or any sense of urgency to be had here for me either. There are hints of a breakdown of civilization, but this idea isn't pursued in any detail and seems to go away before it gets too bad. Putting more emphasis on this could have helped a lot. Similarly, the characters take a rather casual stance on the risks, when there would have been great potential to explore the psychological response to a growing threat that starts out far away, and gets closer and closer until it becomes an immediate threat, and then deep-rooted paranoia, fear and escape plans take over. I guess they shouldn't have depicted patient zero's family for any of this to work.Overall, Contagion takes a fairly sober view on the outbreak and failed to really engage me. Perhaps it tried to explore too many different views without going into any detail, and perhaps the health organization and administration stuff should have taken a backseat to on-the-ground action. It's watchable (and I finished it), so maybe it should be 5 stars, but there are really so many things that didn't work well and nothing stands out positively for me, so I'm giving 4.",Contagion

The infected disease have mostly been produced by species, we human being tempered with: cows, pigs, chickens... How can a bat, flying and living in it's natural surroundings can be a cause of annihilation of the entire human race? It is real sad that Soderbergh decided to blame the nature in the end!!??

I know when the movie came out, people thought that this was so farfetched, but we see now that is not the case. The acting was good. The flow of the movie was kind of fast paced in my opinion, but the storyline was entertaining. I was not expecting one of the main characters to die.

As far as the pandemic goes the movie accurately showed different procedures and precautions that would be taken in a pandemic and how deadly a virus could spread no matter the precautions taken. Where there is a suspension of disbelief is at the end of the movie where it shows how the virus started. The way the virus passed down from a bat to a pig and then from human to human isn't realistic, and even if it was able to pass through all of that it would most likely lose its lethality.

It seems that during emergencies the heroes swing into action and the worms come out of the woodwork. Some humans are worse than the virus. 'Contagion' works the way a good documentary does. There are no bloody- eyed, zombified virus carriers launching their infected selves at terrified innocents. The danger and adrenaline comes with a quiet cough, or when one person sips from a glass and someone else picks it up. This movie gives you a behind the scenes look at the disease control command centres and will have you wondering to the last minute -- if you're interested in that kind of thing -- who was patient zero and how did this virus get started?

It is a realistic look at would happen if the world was overcome with a deadly disease. There is not a dull moment in the entire movie. You will be on the edge of your seat.

The only problem was the rental DVD would not let you do anything until you listened to ALL of the movie trailers and advertising at the beginning. You can't even turn off your DVD. I believe it's WB, so I will make sure not to buy any Warnerbrothers DVD's. They also do not include ANY extras on the rental, and tell you you have to buy a Blu-ray DVD to get that.

At Several points in the film I was in shock like wait is this made up or is this actually happening right now.I think every single person should watch this film to understand the need to social distance, the reason why we should quarantine at home and how fast it can spread with out washing our hand or covering our mouths when we sneeze.As someone that can not simple quarantine at home and have to go back to work after two weeks off- I'm actually very afraid to go out side right now, I have high risk people at home that could die from this- so this film really hit home to me how underprepared we are right now. Like part of the film was a play for play with what our government is actually doing right now.If you want to understand how virus spread and things u could learn from that watch this film.

547,c-foss25,Middle of the road movie,6,29 February 2012,"As usual, Soderbergh's direction and cinematography (Soderbergh working under the pseudonym of Peter Andrews) lack any sort of energy or drive. Although the lighting has improved this time around (many scenes in 'The Informant!' were akin to having someone use a mirror to refract the sun's rays onto your eyes), the whole thing still looks like a slideshow (the only difference this time being that the film's globetrotting narrative permits proceedings to be elevated to the level of excitement usually found with a showing of an acquaintance's holiday snaps).The film does have some redeeming features, though. The cast, for one, are mostly very believable in their respective roles, particularly Jennifer Ehle, Jude Law, and Elliot Gould. The script, for two, is also impressively realistic in its depiction of the mayhem produced from the threat of Armageddon. For a final three, there is a refreshing absence of hyperbole, something that is practically a hallmark of this genre of film.All this can't change the fact that Soderbergh is just a bad filmmaker, though. Admittedly he does have a good sense of pace, but his continued efforts to turn fascinating premises into unleaded dullness simply make him a menace to society. This is the man who made a spaceship orbiting an effeminate planet, a case of corporate farce (well, I find that exciting), a heist film about an assortment of Hollywood Adonises draining Las Vegas dry, and George Clooney robbing banks boring. Surely he is some sort of demigod.",Contagion

I had been meaning to watch it for months, never got around to it, saw Steven Soderbergh's more recent movie that is in theaters currently (Side Effects), finally got a hold of the movie, watched it, and was pleased. What an all-star cast, though, disappointingly, a couple of them aren't featured for very long. The movie actually got me interested in how things like this work and made me want to learn more about sicknesses, diseases, viruses, etc. It also sort of reminded me of the first season (or was it the second?) of The Walking Dead as both featured the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Lawrence Fishburne did a great job, as did Marion Cotillard. I would have liked to have seen Matt Damon's character more in-control and bad-a$$ like the old days as Jason Bourne, but I suppose that was not his character this time around.

It demonstrates the possibilities of outbreak and epidemics that could happen and what role everyone plays in that scenario. There is the government and international organizations that work to help eradicate it but are they eve doing it in the right way or is it all for profit, which leads to anger, fear, and hate which caused the destruction of order in the movie.

And it shows in the acting; very bland. Sub-par use of Matt Damon who is shown grieving only at the very end and even worse for Jude Law; a disregarded blogger who's even told that blogging is ""graffiti with punctuation""; cute. What about the origin of shaking hands? That one comes at the very end.What's with one of Law's front tooth on his otherwise perfect grin as any studio picture of him will show? Oh yeah, a blogger has to be a reject leaving out of his parents' basement with asocial tendencies and who he's untrustworthy and a crooked front tooth will make that more believable. Give me a break.And why is Chicago always picked for disaster movies lately? We had Source Code where Chicago was set for nukes (much better film), now it's where a big contagion outbreak gets started. Could that be ""The Lone Gunman - 9/11 predictive programming"" way of letting out where the next ""terrorist"" attack is set to be?

569,justinjaeger,A Build-Up With a Weak Climax,5,11 September 2011,"The fact that Stephen Soderbergh is directing drew me into this film. He does deliver a unique visual style with his mark on it. However, he delivered the storyline in a very literal fashion, making some scenes as dramatic as the screenplay alone. The focus was more on how the disease was spreading, less than what it should have focused more on, the fear of becoming sick. The story included the characters' and their fears, but the fear was never evoked enough to frighten the audience so much. The idea of the epidemic is frightening, but this fear is lost in the story as the characters do problem solving to fix the situation. I was glad that the film ended on this theme, but it seems as though this was making up for what the film didn't focus on. As for the structure/pacing, it was good and not so good. The film exceeded in giving the beginning a rapid pace to show the scale of the illness escalating. The rest felt the same way, giving it the strong build-up with little to no climax. I was disappointed. The score, on the other hand, was great and contributed to the suspense and edge the film required. Overall, the film looses track on what it could do well and focuses too literally on the story (by that I mean it's about what the story IS, not what it could MEAN.) --5.5",Contagion

I kept waiting for a twist or turn but they weren't there. I was quite bored with the whole thing and found myself wishing the film would end. Few of the characters were fully developed. I think this was hurt by the ""bouncing around"" that occurred. The acting was actually very good but the storyline didn't bring the punch that it should have.

But I reserved that 1% in any case...Other than that, this Soderbergh-branded multi-narrative feels very little contrived, well grounded and, most of all, urgent (thanks to Mirrione's typicallly flawless film editing).

A man who lost his wife and son and is desperately trying to keep his daughter alive, a scientist on level zero, even citizens of daily life etc.) - these are all great aspects that gave the movie color and showed many different facets of the society in that of an outbreak, but they seemed to lack a focus point. What is the big build- up? Or even the main point? Was it humanity and the selfish nature of others? Was it the unexpected rise of a disease and how easy it is to take a life?The movie had a thrilling start, showing the start of the outbreak in day by day format, showing the audience immediately the number of problems presented.

It basically closes none of the threads which it opens, and answers none of the questions it poses. The entire audience sat there for 2 minutes after the film, expecting to see the rest of the movie spliced back in.It really is as though they ran out of steam half way through writing this film and completely gave up.

587,lovgrena,A truly horrifying villain,8,9 May 2012,"#10 on movies I saw in 2011No horror movie has ever truly frightened me.I've jumped frequently and been tense at one moment or another, but the most vicious ghoul or hideous monster has ever struck lasting fear because deep down, everything being thrown on the screen is pure make- believe. It wasn't until the smallest attacker presented itself that the paranoia stayed with me as I left the theater.From Steven Sonderbergh, the Oscar-winning director of Traffic, Contagion is a frightful drama in a tangible way that is much too easy to relate to. Instead of relying on frightening characters and using extravagant effects, the doomsday film involves the audience, allowing it to surpass that which is typical of its drama.The concept of a supervirus with no known cure is not altogether unfamiliar. Everyone remembers the recent H1N1 scare that prompted widespread fear and a consequent rushed vaccination. Contagion asks the question, ""What if an infection were as severe and widespread as feared?""Rather than give a concrete answer, the empty shell of characters go through the life of the new disease, starting on day two. The steps that are taken do not necessarily show what would happen or even what might happen, but the story does cast a light on the political, social, economic and logistic problems that come with a virus epidemic.Just as Traffic was a look into the drug trade and the stories of people involved, either directly or indirectly, Contagion is a glance at humanity and the assumptions and interactions that surround public health.While watching, I found myself angry at those who doubted the severity of the situation. I scoffed at the many who disregarded the correct procedures to limit exposure. Yet, during the H1N1 scare I found myself sick in bed for two days after ignoring the suggestion of vaccination.The movie can be slow at times but is driven well by an outstanding score by Cliff Martinez. While still sticking to his trademark of strong guitar riffs and heavy percussion, Martinez takes a note from 2010's Oscar winning score for The Social Network and fills the movie with electronic melodies and fast moving overlays that add another layer of tension to already stressful situations.Where the lead characters played by Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne and Jude Law were primarily flat and empty, the plot was dense and filled with interest. Several different layers existed within each aspect of the virus' progression. Even now, I'm just beginning to realize the huge significance of some of the smallest scenes or pieces of dialogue.During the movie, I found myself fully conscious of every time I went to scratch my nose or rub my eyes and found myself wondering who had sat in this seat before me. Suddenly, the world of germs wasn't just something to be feared.After an ending that makes the on-screen situation all too possible, the next big scare won't be so easy to dismiss.www.andrewlovgren.com",Contagion

593,vedarthritvik,Accurate Representation of Current Situation,8,7 April 2020,"Coronavirus, an WHO declared epidemic that can cause a lot of deaths in the next 3-4 months or so. This situation called for a lockdown of 21 days in India and in other countries, it is extended for months. So, would you believe that a 2011 made film has shown all the proceedings of our current situation with accuracy? Well, you have to believe it because Contagion, the film trending on all social platforms has done that. I watched it today and I'll tell you how the film is exactly constructively without any bias. Note that I am not a medical student and have no connections with medical sciences. So, I am a newbie to this subject. Let us dive in this ride.Contagion is a 2011 Hollywood Virus Thriller film directed by Steven Soderbergh starring Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishburne, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Marion Cotillard in lead roles. The story revolves around COVID-19 oh Sorry, MEV-1, It's origins, effects on people, scams on it and every other thing surrounding it.The screenplay can be described as well documented. The research this team of filmmakers did on this topic is extraordinary. Why? It is because every single detail of this film is exactly accurate to this day and how our world is functioning. Also, the film's emphasis on equality has opened a new door for me. But, the director maybe forgot something important about this film. The characters. First, there are a big pool of talented actors here. Second, they do not get enough screentime to shine. The problem now is that we are not enabled to connect to any of these characters. They are just a cluster of characters running around. This can also be because of Overall, the screenplay has good detail put into it but dramatically, it becomes weak.All the actors as I said earlier have less screentime but each of them shine. First, Gwyneth Paltrow. She just smiles and becomes a dead body. But, her character herself is the pivot to the MEV-1 Virus.Matt Damon who is the husband of Gwyneth Paltrow gets to shine as his love for her daughter is shown via his eyes and his tension. Next, Kate Winslet gets a short character as the Epidemic Officer and she acts well. Jude Law gives the best performance according to me as he gets more character than anyone else. He succeeds in being a writer who wants to faux many people by suggesting another drug instead of the vaccine. Lawrence Fishburne and the other doctor's crew act well as doctors. Lawrence himself brings the equality aspect in front of us. So, he gets the second-best performance.The technical aspects are very good. They move according to the director. The score of the film is especially good because all the silent parts of the movie are elevated by the score. The cinematography is very good. The editing is good but the film is slow. The artwork is well designed with good costumes.Overall, this film is a research-based film more than an actual film. It is dramatically weak and the characters have little characterization. But, the film keeps us engaged throughout while we are bored due to the accurate representation of the Virus and its effects. I would highly recommend you to watch this film with your family to know more about the virus. It is an important lesson for many careless wanderers on the street now. It is available on Amazon Prime Video. Go have a look.",Contagion

As the year 2020 is going through just like the movie contagion(2011).it's a movie that is meant to show the reality of a massive disease outbreak as of now. It's simply a different type of movie than a lot of people are used to, so people might see this in a negative way.
The film starts with day 2, not day 1. Hence a huge curiosity lies in the mind of the viewers throughout the movie until the very end. Story is showing how WHO and CDC come together for this crisis. We see how things are done politically, we see news conferences and we also see how it hits everyday families.The story was all about finding the source and inventing the vaccine. It shows how hard doctors and researchers doing their work . So, we must have the knowledge of that in our recent times and should appreciate their works. As it shows how the disease spreading among people this can be an awareness to the people of our society for being safe during this pandemic .
Few of the scenes seem unnecessary but it all fits together perfectly. So, all together i consider this movie is atleast better than average and a must watch for all in this era.",Contagion

The film's start was intriguing, with some interesting cinematography and editing, but as the film went on, something dramatic was expected, and it never came. There were some mildly interesting plot twists, but all handled very anticlimactically by the director. The actors drew me, and many others to this film, but with so many characters, none could really be explored. The acting was not weak, but there was really no material for such fine actors as Marion Cotillard or Kate Winslet to work with, which begs the question, why did they even audition for these roles? The resolution of the film offers very little, as the only answer the audience is given, is to a question we weren't asking.

Above all I didn't feel thrilled at all, just seemed depressing, also the ending is very disappointing with so many loose ends, and seemed to left off at a sequel based ending. I am willing to bet $1000 that Soderburgh is going to make a sequel to this film later in the years. There is so much talent in all of the people involved in this film and what happen? There is only one good thing I can say about this film is that its style of camera kind of like a Requiem for a Dream fast paced style. All I can say is right now is that this is average and recommend you torrent this, and Mr. Soderburgh you are now on strike 1, and if you receive the 2 remaining strikes, I will purposely troll you at your house like I did to M.

I saw Contagion in IMAX, thinking what was built up to be an 'action thriller' with such an all-star cast would be best experienced on the extra-large screen.It's difficult to describe many of the downfalls without revealing anything about the story itself, but suffice it to say that walking into the theater expecting a movie that's going to thrill you with exciting action scenes, involve you through deep character development/interactions, and spur emotions with a breathtaking climax, you will be extremely disappointed. I was so let down, that I registered on IMDb specifically to input my 2 cents to the community, so I could hopefully save anyone from having the same experience I had with this movie.I consider myself pretty experienced when it comes to film, and I certainly give a movie credit where credit is due, even if it doesn't belong to a genre that I am exceptionally interested in. Many of the actors performed well, and the situation itself is interesting to see in example, because it leads you to wonder what you would do if you were in the characters' shoes. Also, I was also entertained at the way the story developed, and how the turn of events in each of the plot lines kept my attention.However, I have never before felt so tricked in my life after witnessing the film's shortcomings, lack of direction, lack of purpose, and failure to come through with what was promised in the trailer. With so many different plot ""branches"" it was difficult for me to feel emotionally connected with the main characters, and their situations. The film lacked tension, and I was not happy with how suspense that was built from the feelings of worry or sadness was often dissolved way too quickly. More than anything, after the film I was left with too many unanswered questions while I was trying to figure out where the movie was trying even to go.",Contagion

It is everything that was hoped for 'The Expendables' and more. The 6-strong team of heavyweights deliver six separate yet equally riveting stories of a virus that grips the world. The script is enhanced by its uncanny medical accuracy, which rivals the TV Series 'House'.However, the film is slightly reminiscent of the film 'Outbreak', which works to Contagion's disadvantage.

The premise, cast and trailer all gave me high expectations. Unfortunately that just meant there was further to fall.*****SPOILERS****** Hard to spoil this film as all that happens is disease outbreak, control, vaccine, end. That is literally it.Soderbergh tried to cram lots of lead characters in here and the result is that they are all underdeveloped. They are also mostly unconnected which means there are as many weak, barely explored, subplots as there are characters.I honestly think this film has been bankrolled/influenced by big pharma and that its main purpose was to spread some propaganda, rendering the film itself nothing more than a vessel for that purpose.The day count is pointless, and it sets up one of the biggest flops of an ending that I've ever seen. The 'Day 1' ending was presented so arrogantly, it was as if they actually thought that it was a decent twist or a powerful conclusive moral message. In fact, it was just more 'stuff' - which is all this film is.Scientifically flawed doesn't even come close.'Outbreak' is much better as it knows what it is, and it stays true to it's theme. There is nothing wrong with trying to introduce extra depth to a theme which has been done many times before, but unfortunately Soderbergh et al didn't achieve this with 'Contagion'.",Contagion

I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole 2 hours. Not one boring minute. The whole movie is beautifully shot. Every single detail is precise. Contagion is not only fiction, it could happen right now, in real life, and it shows how the population of the world would react to such a crisis, it is a message to humanity. Soderbergh has not made one bad movie in his entire career and is not ready to make one. Contagion is probably one of Soderbergh's best studio movies with Erin Brokovich.

The movie came across like a documentary and I thought the filming was terrible. Besides Matt Damon, I thought the rest of the acting crew did a bad job. Kate Winslet's made-up American accent was absolutely transparent and I personally found it quite annoying. There were moments where I thought something interesting was going to unfold but I was repeatedly met with dismay. They failed to magnify the symptoms of the disease .

622,lucky_hmail,"A break from the usual over the top Hollywood cinema, without making it look like a documentary",9,22 December 2011,"Contagion is a film about America's reaction to a deadly virus-borne disease that spreads within days. ProsThe script was good and did not make the movie boring or monotonous. The reactions of the people were well depicted. And there was a perfect balance between medical research and political reactions. One could see the research done in order to present the situation on screen.The intro of the film was very strong. The focus on things that you touch - the glass, doorknobs, poles in the bus, etc. - that would lead to the spread of the virus helped build the tension. The movie very interestingly starts from Day 2 of the infection and you wonder where is Day 1? Well it comes at the end when the inception of the virus comes into picture.The cast was carefully chosen, I must say. The acting was different from the typical larger than life Hollywood characters. The characters looked real, panicked and sometimes overreacted in situations that they faced. However, more was expected of Matt Damon, he was a bit of disappointment. It was not a movie for his fans, as he looked fat, old and had a very limited role. The rest five roles were very interesting especially of Dr. Ellis Cheever played by Laurence Fishburne.The dialogs were serious but amusing at the same time, especially the ones used by Jude Law or at him.ConsMore was expected from the film, as it suddenly jumped from Day 31 to Day 131, from the time the vaccine is tested to the time it comes to the markets. Also since the movie talked about the effect of the virus on the world in, I felt covering Europe, India, Australia etc. was needed. The research conducted by countries apart from America was not included at all.In a scene where Marion Cotillard reviews the footage of the Casino visited by Gwyneth Paltrow (Mrs. Emhoff) just before contracting the disease comprised of different cuts and angles which are not possible from the CCTV perspective.The movie had a lot of potential to be edited in a non-linear manner since a lot was going on at the same time. But I guess the makers were afraid of taking the risk.The VerdictI won't call the movie a must-watch but I would still recommend it for one time watch. It gives us a break from the usual over the top Hollywood cinema that we are used to see, without making it look like a documentary.Acting and Cast : 9/10 Script : 8/10 Direction : 7/10 Cinematography : 6/10 Editing : 6/10OVERALL RATING : 7.5/10",Contagion

624,roadrunner777,Nice scenery,5,4 February 2012,"Flat and forgettable. Good scenery, nice props. I think there can be issues casting an action figure like MD into a more passive character. Meh... none of the plot lines take leadership, ending was boring. There was a barn-load of talent, yet no central character that I could see. I paid top dollar for HD DVD, disappointing. I should go back to renting.I'm not exactly sure what the right formula is for an epidemic movie. Nobody has done it right, though I liked Andromeda Strain better, at least I can remember the plot lines after 2 days.Well, I'm having trouble finding 10 lines of review to write. That pretty much says it all.",Contagion
625,faithish,A dozen good ingredients with a lousy recipe.,4,26 February 2012,"I had very high hopes for contagion. A fast-paced ""disaster"" movie with an all-star cast including Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburne, and Jude Law - How could such a formula produce a bad movie? Simple. Too many cooks in the kitchen.The basic premise of the plot is that a woman and her young son both die from a mysterious infection that begins spreading like wildfire, and the CDC and WHO scramble to find the cause and the cure before it gets any worse. Meanwhile, the woman's grieving husband attempts to protect himself and his daughter from infection, a freelance would-be journalist (aka blogger) cooks up a conspiracy theory, a WHO researcher is taken hostage by a man who wants to ensure that his village is among the first to receive the cure, an underdog doctor doing unauthorized research becomes the first to discover the vaccine... are you getting tired yet? Any of these characters on their own, or even mixed two or three together, would make for a worthwhile film. Unfortunately, they're all fighting for real estate in this one. The result is a veritable Brandsmart of plot devices, none of which is given the investment of time it needs to grow to its full potential. Adding insult to injury is the fact that there are a good dozen or so tiny plot threads that the film makes it a point to smack the viewer over the head with as if to say, ""Remember this - it'll be important later;"" however, that later never comes.The coup de grace lies in the climax... or lack thereof. It's difficult to say when it happens, because there is no big ""BOOM!"" of a moment, no turning point at which the hopeless suddenly becomes hopeful again, no resolution for all the little subplots that have spent the previous ninety minutes getting all dressed up and ultimately having no place to go. The story ends on a quiet whimper and the credits begin to roll, with the discovery of the outbreak's source being of minor comfort - it does not save any lives, nor does it serve any purpose in the overall advancement of the plot. It's ultimately the proverbial bone thrown to a starving man, having already been stripped of all its meat.Without even realizing it, cinema-goers have been trained by years upon decades of movie history to walk into the theatre with certain expectations - we want to know that if it's absolutely necessary for a ""good guy"" to die, that death somehow contributes to the greater good, or that if a mysterious evil (in this case, a rapidly spreading disease) threatens the population, the ""good guys"" will miraculously discover a cure before half the Earth's population is stricken. In the end, we are given none of these things, and I for one felt very let down.",Contagion
626,murray-fisher,Good film!,7,17 March 2012,"Soderbergh seems to have evaded serious critical consideration thus far. His main attraction to the public is some measure of the Hollywood blockbuster, except always tweaked a little to challenge beneath the dazzle. On the side, he works smaller, more personal projects that go largely unremarked. He is our current DePalma, a talented filmmaker reworking a cinematic eye from New Wave within the only system available for movie-making in America, a commercial industry, packing his essays in genre formats friendly to that industry, but even more inconspicuous than DePalma because he is far less explicit in what he references.The reference here is a purely noir construct, reworked on the outer level to synch with contemporary anxieties about the order of things.Usually in film noir we had some kind of private dick investigating a mysterious chain of events, or alternately an average schmuck caught up in some part of the chain (in this film we have both). Both types of character were shown to be tossed about by unforeseen forces from a higher level, from our end we registered this as a kind of fate, but which, this is what's important about noir, we came to understand over the course of the film were being powered by the protagonist himself. It was never purely the femme fatale or money that animated the accidental world, but our desire for them. From our end as viewers, the effort was to rise above the level the characters experienced as their narrative, and garner a glimpse of where the specific world emanates from and is there an author, a fate, perhaps responsible for what is beind chronicled.So here we have one group of characters, firmly above the common man, on the level where fates are devised, looking to unpack the narrative of a situation that has newly emerged; a story about a pandemic, first encountered on a video from youtube. The film starts at Day 2. One character is specifically tasked with piecing together the chain of events leading back to where it all started. Others are investigating possible scenarios to end it.But these efforts are gradually usurped from the accidental world below, where the mass of humans experience the chain of events as cataclysmic change beyond all control. That first character is abducted and held for ransom. Another one dies, one of hundreds in a field hospital, rendered completely anonymous inside the narrative. The freelance blogger acting as our paranoid eye in the story is brought in for charges of fraud.Chaos ensues as the whole civilized structure is shattered to the foundation. The only thing that can make it stand is a small gesture of humanity, a selfless offer of a vaccine. And the only way there can be any progress at all, is by personal risk outside the rigid order of things.But none of the characters inside the movie are finally any wiser about the cause. We are. Our parting shot unveils the chain of events leading up to Day 1. There was nothing, nada, pure chance. No author or fate behind the design of so much suffering.It is an apt ending, a rare glimpse of the mechanisms that control life. But is it going to interest most viewers, I'm not sure.",Contagion

You might think this is a common thing used by directors but the movie did not end on any climax or anything that made you feel like the film deserved to be over.

There is no climax, no surprising plot turn.Second: There are way to many protagonists.The only one that really interested me was the Kate Winslet plot, but she dies fast. The Fishbourne plot could have had potential, but doesn't get enough time. The Damon plot was just bad and the Cotillard plot nonexistent. The whole thing frays out like an old t-shirt.We could have had a film that focuses on the global epidemic and the strife of an high ranking government official, the global epidemic and a father-daughter relationship or the global epidemic and the fight against it from a low ranking official at the front-line.

The trouble with most horror films is that no matter how scary they are the first time you see them all the horror is dissipated by future viewings. But today I watched the ultimate horror film for the third time. It's still crap your pants scary but what made this viewing different was that it was on basic cable and full of commercials. It was not only still horrifying but if anything it gets scarier with every viewing. The film is called CONTAGION and what makes it so effective is that the ""monster"" is one mutated bird flu gene away from real. To describe the film sounds mundane and almost bad documentary boring...(from the IFDb web site) ""Healthcare professionals, government officials and everyday people find themselves in the midst of a worldwide epidemic as the CDC works to find a cure."" But the film starts on a black screen with a single cough and by the end millions are dead. But what makes the film so horrifying is that each time you watch it you realize that in this day and age of world wide air travel a contagion like this one is not only possible but highly likely. If that doesn't scare you then you just aren't paying close enough attention.

673,liamllark,A Coronavirus Related Review,7,26 June 2020,"I watched this film for the first time in theatres, back in 2011. Back then, I thought the film was entertaining and frightening, but ultimately I walked away from the screening fully expecting to forget this film as it disappears into obscurity. And to be honest, it probably would have if it wasn't for the global pandemic right now. So, I'm going to review this film after viewing it once again in the current context of the world.Now, is the film realistic? In my opinion, no - it's still very Hollywood. However, there are several aspects in the film that eerily relate to the reality of a pandemic close to that scale. It should be noted that a substantial amount of people die in this film, so I'm taking the dramatized aspects with a pinch of salt here. But the way in which the virus originates, the vigorous ability it has to spread and the contraction, the importance of living in a globally connected world, as well as many of social responses all can be drawn as parallels to a serious pandemic in reality.Separate from the comparisons to Coronavirus, this film is also very entertaining. Really high quality cast all across the board, and the acting is very good. The scene sequencing is a little rushed, but when you consider that the film takes place over the course of a single month, I suppose it's not the worst.Overall, if you're looking specifically for a pandemic themed film, this is definitely one of the best representations that has been made. But, if you are simply looking for a film to watch regardless of its relation to the pandemic, then you can do much better than this.",Contagion
674,tnega007-1,Waste of a great cast,4,1 September 2011,"Looking at the poster for this film and seeing the great names attached you might, ""Hey, this looks good, I should go see it."" My advice: save your $10 and go see something else for the second time.I saw this movie a few weeks back and was excited to see what director Steven Soderbergh had done with this great ensemble cast. As great as he is, Soderbergh couldn't make this work. The premise is simple: a deadly virus breaks out and threatens to decimate the entire world. No one is prepared and no one can do anything to stop it. While this ""Contagion"" is the whole point of the movie, it's also the biggest problem. It's a disease, a virus, an unseeable villain. You hate the disease by its nature, but it's not bad guy that you love to hate like the Bond villains or Hannibal Lecter. Now if you're an avid movie-goer you might be waiting to hear about the zombies. Surely a movie like Contagion has some zombies, right? Wrong. Zombies would have made everything better and I never thought I'd say that. This movie was so heavy, was so dramatic that it needed to ease the tension a little. But it didn't. A good zombie might have done the trick. I'd have even settled for a vampire. But instead all you get is a pale and ugly Gwyneth Paltrow and a rather chubby Matt Damon. That should tell you something right there.As I mentioned, the cast is great. The movie moves between multiple story lines, such as Matt Damon and his daughter, Laurence Fishburne (who might give the best performance of the film) trying to figure out a cure, and the cynical Jude Law who likes shaking things up. The problem with these characters is that you don't have the desire to root for them. Because the film is constantly changing from one storyline to the other, you don't get to become emotionally involved and care for them. Not that I was rooting for them to all die, but I almost didn't care either way. This is NOT a feel good movie. You're not going to walk away feeling invigorated and high on life. There is nothing incredibly exciting, humorous, or fun to watch in these 105 minutes of bleakness. The end, which I won't spoil, was a cop out of an ending and left everything to be desired. I've said it once and I'll say it again:A zombie would have helped.",Contagion
675,writingsbymar,CONTAGION!,9,9 December 2020,"Contagion is that film that encapsulates the horror and haunting repercussions of an outbreak of a disease. It definitely portrayed the fear, anxiety, and recklessness that comes along when humans go in to survival mode with a goal to save themselves.
It displayed both the perspective of those trying to contain the disease but also those who only thought of themselves and how some uses their privilege to an advantage.
The film visuals, sounds, and colour contributes to its dystopian effect and it's scary to think of the similarities between the COVID pandemic to this movie.
It's an excellent film and I highly recommend watching it, however, it may be triggering in some way because of the COVID pandemic. Nonetheless, it's a much watch for it's plot and execution! #cens201",Contagion

678,jackwillspillu,CONCERNING FACTS,10,14 April 2021,"May father told me in my young years that what ever you see on the big and small screens has or will come to reality. Contagion is no exception to the rule. One would have to assume that in many movies we are informed or warned ahead of time of where we are all heading. For some reason the majority of society worldwide seems to be very blahzay or closed minded about the realism of movies and what they are showing or trying to inform us of whats coming. From my observations we have all been indoctrinated from birth to only believe what we are fed by the Governments and their loyal yes men. Its called subtle brain washing. Hitler experimented with this back in the day and succeeded. He use chemicals to achieve this. Nothing has changed except for the governments are more cunning in how they do it these days. Even in Divergent it depicts how they do it through injections and nanotechnology. Sounds familiar. Have a look at artificial intelligence and DNA collection, information collection, facial recognition etc etc. In the film industry its obvious that we are being warned of what is happening in real time or what the world Governments are up to. Contagion is no exception to the rule and it perfectly depicts Covid 19. Its gone one step further by saying that our drinking water sources could be a way to administer vaccines into our bodies through consumption and without our knowledge and concent. The movie even went to the point of where China is the source of the virus and to the point where WHO and the so called authorities dont act swiftly to contain the virus. Protocols arent followed in 2020. WHY????? We are all left in the dark (deliberately) so they can mislead society with their lies and deception all in an attempt to achieve their evil goal. In real-time November 2019 to current time millions of people have died from Covid. Its obvious that the elderly are being targeted and culled as they are a drag on society (according to governments) financially. Ultimate aim is to have a young society worldwide. One that doesnt question the system. One that is fully brainwashed and controlled. One would assume a society no one older than 40-45 years of age. Currently they say their are numerous strains of the virus and it just happens to mutate at an alarming rate. Its kind of a joke I think. This is all about brain washing people to accept that the virus will become part of life and its a way to inject people using the fear factor. There are many things at play just like in contagion. I question why relatives arent allowed to view (even from behind bullet proof glass) and say good by to their loved ones after they die. People are literally deleted or erased overnight. If the virus is as bad as they say then why are they burying the dead. Shouldnt they be burnt so the virus is definitely destroyed. I would like to see a sequel to contagion and how it depicts society and governments or the elite 20 years after the virus was released. I think it would shock the world where we will be in 2040. There is too much that doesnt add up with what we are told and shown as from 2020. Something is amiss. Contagion is almost an exact copy of covid and its events. Coincidence???????? I think not.",Contagion

There's a scene where a popular doctor is giving a interview on a newscast. And this doctor is doing this same interview now. There's the social distancing, hand washing and contact tracing information. The worst of human nature is shown between rich, politically connected individuals who gets the vaccination or the poor that does not.

It looked like it was going somewhere exciting, then went downhill from there. There could have been more specifics about the vaccine, the CDC, FEMA, and the journalist.

This great movie deserved a director like Christopher Nolan or Quentin Tarantino who can adapt some scripts to their vision perfectly making the whole structure of the movie amazing . Also directors like Steven Spielberg or many others who could changed the form of the movie completely . Perhaps Steven Soderbergh should have thought about getting of the mentioned as producers or as writers just to put their distinguished touch . Nevertheless , what happened can not be changed but can be avoided . Secondly , where is the famous chemistry among the actors that Soderbergh is known to create ? Well , let me answer that question. There is not any possibility to show that chemistry more than Soderbergh has done as long as the movie is to filmed at its current form . My point is that he got out of his area of expertise when he attempted to make the movie like this . Consequently , he should have taken the mentioned matter above . Don not get me wrong he is one of the great but in a particular kind of movies . For example : we can not give Robert Rodriguez a romance flick to make but not any one .

I didn't get a sense of drama and, at the end, was left with the feeling of: Is that all there is?

It would come from government testing, and used as biological warfare. Then the movie didn't close up right. The denouement was completely loaded with questions. There were some good things about the movie that i liked though. I liked that there was such good acting. People really acted the part well! But even though they acted well, the plot was flawed, and there didn't seem to be an ending that was worth waiting for. The cinematography was great actually. They told a great story with the camera.

This will be broken down into various sections: bad use of cast, failing storyline, not intriguing, horrible ending. Bad Use of Cast: The main problem is this; they have an all-star cast at their disposable, yet they choose to waste the casts' talent, as well as their own money, by not putting them to their full potential. Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Gywneth Paltrow, and the list goes on. However, forming Matt Damon as an immune man with a dead son and dead wife who cheated on him does not start his character off well. The entire movie he is extremely protective of his daughter and extremely furious at everyone. His sanity is also in question when the doctor has to tell him his wife is dead about fifteen times before Matt Damon stops asking to talk to her. Also, instead of making Gwyneth Paltrow a main character and using her full acting potential, they make her die immediately, marking the first victim. WHY WOULD YOU MAKE HER DIE SO SOON???!! Are they INSANE??!!!!! The acting in this movie is much less on the intensity and more on criminals and a killer virus that works it's way through millions of people, leaving them all dead. Failing Storyline: OK, so apparently in three months it will infect a billion people. But since Matt Damon is immune, and the entire world is about to die, why don't we just take his blood and work a vaccine off of that? Oh, no, it's too expensive; money is definitely gonna matter if the whole world dies from this f****ng virus!!!!!! But oh, it takes too much time! Instead, let's wait half a year for it to infect more people before coming up with a solution!!!! Aaahhh!!!!!! IT MAKES NO SENSE!!!!!!!!! Not Intriguing: When you watch a movie you are supposed to get into it. Well, actually, I didn't end up even caring about any of them except for this one head scientist. Everyone else dies and many others who saw it with me also agree you do not sympathize with characters whose stories and lives aren't built upon, so you ending not giving a **** whether they get sick, die, or lose a loved one, except for maybe Matt Damon's son. Horrible Ending: The ending, in all honesty, was crap. The worst ending I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies. It just ends, without telling you if the human race even lived, or if their are side effects to the vaccine.

Despite not recommending it to anybody for anything but that, it was enjoyable and fun to sit down at take in at surface level.Anyhow, the plot-line was very fathomable (understandable) and awfully predictable (....well, that). I don't think the way that this virus started was justified because it just seemed to 'happen' (I'm aware that these things can 'just' happen) without further adventures into the depth of this contagious infection. I think the wrap-up of the story lines was poor, as it left a lot of loose ends, and I don't advise there to be a second film about this (which I doubt anyway) to clear these up, as this wasn't that good at all anyway.

It has a few redeeming factors such as Matt Damon's parts in the film, which should've been the only parts in the film, but was flawed by jarring cuts and bad editing. Every fact in the story seemed like it was only there for med students. If it had been centered on the characters it could have been a really moving and powerful film. Take the road for example. The road is one of the most emotionally powerful films I've ever seen. Something happened to the world that made it almost inhabitable by all but the most stubborn or ruthless. We never have to be told what happened though. We're left to guess at the less important facts while we see a powerful story about a father and his son trying to get through it all.

704,bongcastaneda,Spoilers: Propaganda Machine Don't be Brainwashed!,5,8 March 2012,"Contagion may be presented as a work of fiction, but it communicates several important messages that authorities need the public to accept. To do so, the movie defines a specific problem that has actually occurred in the past, it identifies the agencies that have the right to take charge of the situation and proposes the only solution required to fix the problem. That solution is not pretty: The dissolution of the government, the imposition of martial law, the creation of civilian camps, forced vaccination campaigns and the suppression of free speech. Democracy and civil rights are summarily suspended and we witness the establishment of a highly controlled and monitored society (using barcodes). The character of Alan Krumwiede and the way he is portrayed is interesting for several reasons. First, he reflects the growing influence of blogs and alternative websites on public opinion – a recent phenomena that does not sit well with the elite that seeks to have the monopoly of information. By depicting this character as dishonest, corrupt and even dangerous to the public, the movie justifies the shunning of such writers and even their arrest. alternative media are presented as unreliable sources bent on sensationalism and profit. In other words, the movie implies that information that does not come from ""official"" sources is invalid and potentially dangerous. Not exactly a pro-free-speech message. Wherever regular people are put together, all sort of crap ensues. This goes along with the concept of ""infantilization"" of the masses, who require to be taken charge by ""fatherly"" authorities. And boy do the authorities take over. So, in the wake of a ""biological crisis"", the democratically elected American government basically dissolves and specific organizations (CDC, WHO, FEMA, the U.S. Army) take charge of all aspects of society. And this ""taking charge"" proceeds in a very specific way: Martial law and civilian camps.",Contagion

708,andygeerlings,Only interesting for first 30 minutes,4,21 October 2011,"This is my first review here, and I must say the movie I'm reviewing was a thorough disappointment... and the more I think of it the more disappointing the movie gets. Basically the interesting part of the movie is over after about 30 minutes. They build up suspense in that 1/2 hour, but after that they simply start following/dragging story lines of multiple (8 or so) characters with no dept of all. It could be described as somewhat Crash/Babel-like, but done very wrong: none of the characters involved are either interesting or fleshed out. It's difficult to identify with either one of them. You're just a spectator; after the first 30mins I never really got the feeling of being 'in' the movie, being involved, feeling what the people in the plot are supposed to be feeling. The director builds up parts of story lines with the characters, but does not work those out, does not follow through, and fails to come to a real conclusion on any of them. This movie does severe injustice to its high-class cast, and that's a real shame.Inbetween during the movie infection- and death-tolls are being called or hinted at every now and then, growing into huge numbers, but you never really get the feeling that tons of people are actually sick and dying. Despite the incredible contagiousness, very high mortality-rate, and how fast the virus is supposed to kill after being infected. I won't spoil the ending, but that too was a grave disappointment. Way too easy, sorry. At the point in time the movie suggests a considerable part of the world's population should be wiped out, and a very much more considerable part gravely ill. Don't expect serious/believable plot twists, there simply aren't any mentionable ones. Some twists are hinted at, but then they simply don't follow through. It's actually predictability galore for 94% of the movie, and not in a good way.If you want to get excited about something go watch the Contagion trailer, then forget Contagion altogether and go watch the movie Outbreak. The interesting parts of Contagion are all given away in the trailer. Outbreak works with the same material as the Contagion trailer, but actually gets the movie-parts (as in: ""storytelling"", ""interesting characters"", ""character development"", ""plot"", ""action"", ""drawing you in and keeping you on the edge of your seat"", ""a sense of scale, drama and disaster"" and even ""going somewhere"") right as well.

Matt Damon his role in the movie is quiet small. He is just a normal dad who wants to take care of his little girl.

A great cast, none of whom try to steal the show, but simply play their part in telling a gripping, and potentially very real story.

711,t-addisjones,Dismal,2,26 November 2011,Having read some of the reviews and with a cast of first rate actors/actresses I thought I would be in for an entertaining evening - alas no - weak science - little characterization - emotionally flat - dealt with a number of themes but in no detail - almost cartoonish at times - it was however nicely shot - I left wondering what Soderbergh was trying to show me - yes it was pleasant not to watch Hollywood hyperbole but the trouble was there was nothing in its place - overall the very dull documentary approach left me cold - I think it must be Soderbergh's style as I didn't find Traffic very entertaining either. Would I recommend anyone to see it - if you liked Traffic probably - if not then you will find better entertainment elsewhere.,Contagion
712,consett81,very dull mess of a film,2,22 October 2011,Get the worlds best/highest paid actors and throw them on a 24 hour news channel for a dragged out length of time and you have Contagion.With Jude Law's accent sounding like an Australian Dick Van Dyke and a laughable closing explanatory scene was a real let down.Action scenes are non existent and i did not become close to any of the characters as the internal stories are so poorly thought out and executed.It is a real shame as with a bit more care and attention this movie could have been so much better. It does start off quite promising with clever little close ups off work surfaces and objects that the contaminated public have touched. Then once the scientific and political factors come in to play it turns in to a struggle to stay awake.Avoid like the plague!,Contagion

I will not go into the details of what this movie is about, since so many others have already done so, but I will tell you my thoughts on it. I honestly feel like this film was dumbed down a little to appeal to the general population. I hated all the drawn out mantages they used instead of telling the story. I feel like there was so much left out. They focused more on the government conspiracy than the virus or the people. There was also a lack of interesting characters in my opinion, and the people that were interesting quickly died. I have to say I was also incredibly excited when I saw this movie coming out.

The concept is good, a disease ravages earth as the authorities struggle with it, but it spread its 'lead' role across too many people to continue with that touch of realism that every thriller needs.

The ending feels a bit like watching ""AI"" where you think the movie is over, but it's not, it is just pulling you along for more underdeveloped plot.There is no suspense, rather the presentation was almost more like a documentary where everything just happens without momentum or anything visceral to it.Overall a 3/4 (of 10) movie that seems to be getting overinflated reviews because of the weak streak Hollywood has been on to produce great movies the last couple years.",Contagion

I am a huge fan of Matt Damon and even though he is not given the chance to show the real thing here I still say that he did a good job.

728,westendbluez,Not infectious.,5,14 June 2020,"A friend recommended this movie to me -infected me; however, I won't be spreading this contagion to anyone else. I can't recommend a film whose highlight is the unintended comic relief provided by Jude Law's so-bad-it's-funny attempt at a non-US accent: is his ridiculous character from Orstraylia or London England?
Dick Van Dyke can rest in peace. I exposed myself to Contagion in COVID lockdown, so it's currently relevant and I had 90 minutes to kill (also, normally I wouldn't waste 15 minutes of my life reviewing a mediocre movie but I have time on my hands right now).Almost all of the characters are comic-book: some ridiculous (Paltrow, Law), others have potential but are not fully drawn (Fishburne, Winslet, Damon). The virus is the star. Sub-plots are either unfinished sketches or annoyingly stupid mistakes that should have been erased (the hostage-for-vaccine trade). The plot is simple: new virus causes pandemic and some civil unrest/looting. Scientists search for a vaccine, scientists discover a vaccine. Governments have to decide who gets the vaccine first (vaccine bingo with birth dates on the bingo balls). Then the film ends suddenly and unclimactically. Contagion's unsatisfactory ending is the meeting of two teenagers who have yearned to be together throughout lockdown. The lucky boy has gotten the vaccine and can now take his unvaccinated, at-risk girl to the Prom in the immune Matt Damon's lounge. A lame end but a happy ending for the teens. However, what the writer and director fail to understand is that, although he's been vaccinated, the grinning boyfriend can still give his girl more than she was longing for if he's come into contact with an infected surface on the way over to her dad's house. So remember: wash your hands, stay inside, maintain physical distance (a suitably lame and abrubt end of my review).",Contagion

A few million people die from a new disease with no cure, there's a CDC scandal with vaccinations, then they give out the cure and everyone was saved. This movie was so predictable I was actually glad when it finished. At the end scene they should have made the guys daughter die, that would have been unexpected.

The movie even states it is not the N1H1 virus. Watch the ending of the movie and you will see the connection.

740,abrooke-jennings,An Idea All Too Real,7,5 February 2015,"""Contagion"" is a realistic disaster movie about a global epidemic. It tells a story where a new and previously unknown airborne virus enters the human race and spreads extraordinarily quickly and thoroughly. This movie could be seen as even scarier now because of the scenarios already familiar to us through the outbreaks of influenza or the swine flu scare. The virus in ""Contagion"" defied isolation and a vaccine was nearly impossible to produce from it, making this scenario even more frightening to imagine. One interesting thing that I specifically enjoyed was that the movie made it clear that people do not ""give"" each other viruses, but that viruses are life forms that evolve to seek out new hosts to survive. The methods that viruses use to seek hosts could even be seen as a sort of invasion; as if the virus is an alien invading the bodies of the human race. The quickness of the spread of the virus was astonishing and was a major factor in the fear that the individuals felt. An attempt to find the origin of the virus was also a large part of the movie and this can truly be important to know. All viruses originate somewhere and finding that place can help when trying to contain it. Especially in the case of air traveling viruses, because they could conceivably reach a new continent in a day if not contained. After watching this film, it definitely helps to put things into perspective. Thinking of how many things we touch in a day and the amount of times we touch our face can truly scare us when there is the thought of a disease. What scares me personally is the knowledge that if something like this is unleashed into our world, there is not much that we can really do to stop it.",Contagion

743,BlunderWomansRobotAssistant,Accurate and well-researched speculative fictional scenario,8,31 March 2021,"Who else is here to read the reviews from early 2020 onwards? It's all been said, but if you're in lockdown, the majority of your chatter about what's on your mind just naturally finds expression online.I've added a spoiler tag, even though it probably won't matter at this point. We've all seen how the pandemic has played out, so the only spoilable surprise would be something happening with a character plotline, which this movie doesn't really have. It's actually quite unusual in that respect.I haven't yet read down far enough to see many complaints about lack of characterization, only complaints about the complaints from 2020 hindsight. And indeed, this is not a character-driven movie; complaining about minimal characterization is missing the point. A large number of characters were needed to play out the scenario and perform certain actions to move the plot along, so they basically come across as types, not individuals.It looks like this movie spent all its money on casting the biggest name actors 10 years back, and they're big names for a reason, because you have to be good to make these sketchy roles work. Matt Damon got a lot of screen time and was actually better than I remember.A few points of comparison between the movie and the live-action immersive version we're in today:The movie virus has a case fatality rate of about 25%, which is huge compared to COVID-19. We actually aren't sure what the CFR of COVID is, but it seems to be nearer to 1 or 2 percent. Which is an astounding number of people, but it doesn't result in, e.g., your neighbour's house being empty such that you can break into it, find empty food cupboards, and ""borrow"" their rifle.Food production seems to have been affected, with one scene of the Army handing out rationed prepared meals (and running out). All public venues are shut down completely, for ages. Current experience suggests that a lockdown that strict would suppress the disease more quickly, and therefore be shorter.On the other hand, maybe it wouldn't, because mask wearing in public seems to be sporadic at best. Why is Cheever walking the halls of his office with no mask on? No wonder Kate Winslet buys the farm.There isn't much talk about long-term effects or disability in the movie, it's basically ""survive or die"", whereas long COVID is a problem for a lot of people. The 1918 flu was a big cause of long-term disability as well, and this seems to be a very well researched movie so they were probably aware of it, but chose not to mention it.I thought Jude Law was a bit hammy as the grifting conspiracy theorist, but then the character himself is fake through and through, so it was probably deliberate. He switches accents from Mockney to Aussie at one point, which I can only guess *must* have been intentional. Currently, jerks like him are everywhere, with equivalently damaging effects. He then gets what you think is a highly satisfying, if implausible, legal comeuppance; only to be bailed by his followers and to all appearances get away with it.The sense of physical isolation comes through especially around the household of Matt Damon, with a discontented teenager who longs to be within snogging distance of her boyfriend. Even though most of the technology we use to socialize nowadays was easily available 10 years ago, we don't see people interacting with screens as much as they have been.Understandable, but also annoying, individualistic resistances to public health instructions. Gwyneth Paltrow's screen-mom whines about not being able to have the funeral the exact way she wants it, which is understandable and all, but has she also noticed that there's a horrible disease going around which, in addition to kiboshing public gatherings, makes the corpse too biohazardous for anything short of cremation? Also, when your CDC-boss husband tips you off to get straight in the car with your kid and drive straight across the country to Atlanta without stopping nor telling anyone, you should maybe *not* stop in a supermarket and call your BFF/sister/whoever to tip *them* off, because look what happens.By contrast, at least the scientist from China is looking out for his entire village en bloc when he politely kidnaps the CDC rep. When she gets up and leaves in the airport scene at the end, she could be going to find a hotel room, but I bet she's going back to the village.Speaking of airports, almost the whole film takes place in visually rectangular, industrial/office spaces like office buildings, airports, hotels. I mean a *lot*, to the point where you really notice it. The few flashback scenes pre-pandemic are of crowds partying in a luridly coloured and lit casino, which visually stands out from the rest of the emptiness, but matches up with other scenes where crowd scenes are scenes of potential threat and sometimes violent disorder. Houses are uniform suburban spaces with some homey details inside, but decorated mostly in charcoals, whites and dark greens. Outside is snow, grey, and cold blue.Speaking of colours, this movie is very yellow. Sometimes green. Soderbergh's later movie, Unsane, is also yellow. I wonder if they're all like that.At the end, the dad goes to a mall in person, where he is admitted by scanning the barcode on the wristbands which show proof of immunity. If anything like this is implemented it probably won't be as simple (so easy to fake), and there are a lot more issues of fairness around it too. Not that I expected the movie to thrash out everything, it's just that this is the part of the story we haven't reached yet in real life.It really gave me the heebie jeebies how little the main characters were wearing masks. I have thought all the way through this that we should normalize performers wearing masks all the way through. Though supposedly, the disease in the movie is spread by droplets and fomites (I like that they used the word fomites) rather than being airborne... but from current experience, it still makes me nervous!At the end, we find out who done it: it was the industrial land-clearers who displaced the bat who roosted in the pigpen who crapped near the pig who was stuffed by the chef who took a photo hugging Patient Zero. Which seems to be fairly close to one of the likely explanations this time around.So the moral of the story is clear: leave bats alone!",Contagion

Panic and hysteria ensues, the infection spreads worldwide and the primary focus of the movie then shifts to creating a vaccine. Some of the more interesting characters die early on in the script. Kate Winslet's character showed a lot of promise, her development was handled well. A lot of screen time was awarded to her and I was left feeling cheated when she met her premature demise just as her efforts were beginning to draw empathy. The Jude Law subplot was meaningless and tiresome, it never gained any traction or offered any interesting angle to view the crisis from. By the time the movie reached the halfway point most of the concurrent story arcs were dead in the water and was racing towards the end credits. The movie's swan song felt like a last ditched attempt to salvage anything palatable, but by then I was already too bored to care.

750,cdavis-73352,How prepared are we in the event of a severe pandemic?,7,23 June 2016,"WARNING. CONTAINS SPOILERS.Steven Soderbergh's Contagion provides a glimpse into what civilization may be like during a pandemic. The theme is the reality of human nature in a crisis and our lack of preparedness for a major outbreak. The movie is made up of a few different story lines as the disease wreaks havoc on humanity and the medical community races for a cure. Many prominent actors play the roles in these story lines like Matt Damon as Mitch Emhoff, Gwyneth Paltrow as Beth Emhoff, Kate Winslet as Dr. Mears, Jennifer Ehle as Dr. Hextall, and Jude Law as Alan Krumwiede. The beginning of the movie shows Beth Emhoff during a layover in Chicago on her way home from a business trip in Hong Kong. We see images of the typical ways people spread germs and people who have died from the virus in cities around the world, setting the stage for a deadly pandemic.Shortly after Beth returns to her home in Minnesota, she and her step-son die from the virus. The only reason Mitch Emhoff survives is because he is biologically immune to this particular virus. His story throughout the film portrays the survivor's point of view as he protects his daughter Jory, played by Anna Jacoby-Heron, during unrest and quarantine. After Beth was autopsied, the CDC sent Dr. Mears to investigate the pathogen. She had to fight for proper resources require to deal with the spread of the disease; however, after coming in to contact with people who have been infected, she contracts the virus and dies. Dr. Hextall from the CDC researches the virus and determines it is a combination of viruses found in pigs and viruses found in bats then names it MEV-1. During the chaos, conspiracy-theorist blogger Alan Krumwiede spreads propaganda about the CDC lying about the disease and a drug called Forsythia curing patients. After one of the test monkeys survives a trial of a vaccine, Dr. Hextall takes a major risk by injecting herself with the same vaccine and visiting her father, who has been infected with MEV-1. When she survives, the vaccine has been accepted and distributed globally based on people's birthdays. The movie ends by showing the cause of the virus with a bulldozer dropping a tree with a bat that takes a piece of banana into a swine facility and drops it for a pig to eat. The pig is prepared at a restaurant by a chef in Hong Kong, who shakes Beth Emhoff's hand.Aspects of the theme are seen throughout the film. The scenes of desperate crowds waiting in line for food, empty gyms and cafeterias, and accumulated trash filling the streets gives an eerie look into how humans would act in a crisis. Whenever there was a shortage of food or drugs, the crowd would turn into an angry mob. With the risk of being infected, everyone stays home and society cannot properly function. Another aspect of the theme is the tendency of many to be curious and be skeptical of the authorities with Alan Krumwiede. Despite the fact that what he was posting on his blog was garbage, he still had 12 million followers. The nature of Krumwiede's character is further exacerbated by the fact that he fraudulently claims he was infected with MEV-1 and that Forsythia cured him while he had an interest in the company that makes the drug. The fact that scientists at the CDC were in such a scramble to find a vaccine and Dr. Hextall had to bypass clinical trials by experimenting on herself shows that we really aren't prepared for such an event.One technique used in the film that is relevant to the theme is the use of music. Throughout the film, the music is dark and ominous, which appeals to our emotions of fear and anxiety. The music played when a viable vaccine is discovered is uplifting and inspires emotions of hope. Another technique that is relevant to the film is the dialogue. Jory, being a teenage girl wants to be social, but his father forces her to remain isolated, showing the human nature aspect from those two roles. The dialogue between medical and government officials shows their fear of mass panic from information leaks because they know they are not prepared. The dialogue involving Krumwiede shows how some people can easily lie to millions of people to pursue their own interests.Overall, Contagion was a realistic, but enjoyable film about an outbreak of a deadly virus. It shows the reality of human nature during a crisis and just how unprepared we are for a pandemic. The director uses many techniques like music and dialogue to enhance the theme. If you enjoyed Contagion you might also enjoy Wolfgang Petersen's Outbreak, which has a similar plot and themes.",Contagion

752,austin-93116,"""Contagion"" is an epidemic thriller that brings real-world disease fears into the minds of the audience by capturing the extreme course of a new, untraceable virus.",7,1 August 2016,"""Contagion"" is an epidemic thriller that brings real-world disease fears into the minds of the audience by capturing the extreme course of a new, untraceable virus. Starring Matt Damon as Mitch Emhoff and Kate Winslet as Dr. Erin Mears, the movie follows the spread of a dangerous new virus over an actual epidemic scenario, from origin to vaccine. The general theme of the film follows several characters who are having to interact with and observe the devastating consequences of the spreading virus throughout the film, and the theme is primarily based on the events in the plots. There are several character focuses in the theme. One focus follows members of the CDC, mainly Dr. Erin Mears and Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) who are working to find the origin of the virus to assist in finding a vaccine. A second focus is on Mitch Emhoff, who happens to be the husband of patient zero, Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow), and he must fight to protect his daughter from infection. Finally, the theme focuses on a conspiracy theorist Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law), who believes the government is hiding the true vaccine for corporate profits. This film does well in sticking to the classic epidemic plots formulas, similar to the film ""Outbreak"" in which a virus is spread and eventually a vaccine is found, but there are some notable unique qualities in the plot of ""Contagion"" that sets it apart from the rest. ""Outbreak"", for example mainly focuses on the government entities working to contain the virus, but ""Contagion"" brings us into the grasps of the families in fear as well as in sorrow due to loss of loved ones, as well as the into the shoes of the conspiracy theorists that believes that the government has constructed the virus as a means of profit. The editing style follows a day to day scheme in which the sequence throughout time are dictated with the actual day number on screen, spanning from day 1 to day 135. The director and editor create a solid sense of really just how long this epidemic is occurring from beginning to end, which is nearly half a year in time span. This sets it apart from many of the other epidemic movies because in reality, a true epidemic can take months in real time from origin to vaccine. Other films don't do well in emphasizing or dictating a realistic time span.Tying in the use of flashbacks to the actions leading up to the initial death of Beth Emhoff (patient zero) at the beginning of the film, and tying into the conclusion of the film, was a nice breath of fresh air from the very linear plot that seemed predictable at times. The plot becomes relatively depressing and dismal as conditions just become worse and worse throughout, with main characters even passing away due to the virus. The flashbacks bring us back out of the plot momentarily, back into the first question of how and why this epidemic began in the first place. ""Contagion"" accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is observing the life span of an epidemic from multiple perspectives. Although somewhat linear, it sticks to a true-to-life scenario of a widespread virus, and captures the devastating impacts of such an event on the private and government sectors. Personally, it left me wondering how likely an event like that is to occur and the impacts that would follow, which I believe may have been one question that the director wanted to leave the audience with.",Contagion

754,tombracher,An infectious thriller that succeeds primarily in its portrayal of human response,7,25 April 2017,"Matt Damon's character is immune to a contagion spreading wildly across the globe as a result of human cross-contamination. Tragedy besets a seemingly unblemished family life when his partner, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, falls ill and dies. She is not the only unlucky citizen to fall victim to the unknown disease, as we see other accounts from across the globe in individuals showing similar symptoms. What start's out as a mysterious collection of deaths results in a race to save humanity from the deadliest contagion in history...There's no doubting the fact that Contagion does have flaws - an overloaded cast of A-listers making it difficult to feel sympathetic towards specific characters, a foreseeable drop in tension towards the final act and having to bare witness to yet another accent attempt from Jude Law.Agonising accents aside, the film has you feeling muddied from the off (along with the coughing over the black screen, did anyone notice the almost nauseously-tainted Warner Bros. logo?) The polluted appearance of shots creates a bubble of infectiousness that audience members cannot escape from. There are countless images of basic human contact with objects and themselves; whether that's wiping their brows, lifting their glasses, touching their clothes...all of which causes the audience to feel uneasy and overly-aware of themselves and the people around them (a clever trick to pull in a public environment).The film then settles into its plot, one that owes much to other infectious cinematic experiences such as Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later or any early medical-related apocalyptic horrors/thrillers. So despite it not being original, I find Contagion to be the best attempt yet at portraying the anxiety, tragedy and sheer scale of a real-life contagion; after all, the only thing that's sci-fi about this movie is the disease itself.Contagion does seem to throw all its eggs into the one basket of statistical data and fact; we hear all kinds of different numbers throughout, possibly in an attempt to deliver the imposing scale of this impending disaster as realistically as possible.The problem with this approach is that the audience can quite easily get disconnected from the complex world of medical science to focus more on the sentimental side of the film; of it's characters and whether they will stand the test of time. Films must choose between science and sentimentality to ensure they don't have to share focus between the two.There are some admirable performances from A-listers such as Damon, Marion Cotillard, Laurence Fishburn and in particular Kate Winslett who I found wonderfully believable as a skilled medical expert struggling on many fronts. Unfortunately, I found myself quickly detached from any scene featuring Jude Law; mainly because I couldn't see beyond his adopted accent. Other than his rather brief appearances in Wes Anderson's 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', I find it hard to pinpoint a performance from Law that stands out. With that, Contagion could possibly have benefited from being one A-lister short.The film also features an intriguing score that represents the panic, struggle and disorientation of ordinary human life. Changes in pace and volume are evident throughout, rising in intensity as characters grow more concerned for their safety and human survival.I enjoyed the exhilarating pace and infectious tension of Contagion throughout. I think despite its flaws it portrayed the human reaction to disastrous circumstances very well, created the necessary tension up until the final act to keep you embroiled in the suspense and included enough good performances to make this B movie as believable as possible. I've seen it on a few occasions now and as a medical student, I appreciate its efforts every time.",Contagion

Seeing it now , it is amazingly realistic, almost prophetic.What made me laff was the thought of a writer proposing the disinfo guy played by Jude Law would be The President instead of just a blogger!The response would be 'HA! Funny! And we should cast Donald Trump in the role! Now quit goofing around, we're not making a comedy here.'A serious consideration is where would the world be now if Covid-19 was just a little more contagious and deadly? The 12 months needed to get a vaccine made and distributed would be too long. Civilization could conceivably collapse before then.The best way to keep that from happening when the next deadly virus comes out is for everybody to have very effective self defense ready to pull off the closet shelf whenever there's an outbreak. A UVPK helmet or full face mask, even tho they are more expensive than the chintzy face diapers we are using, would nip the contagion in the bud. No more pandemics.",Contagion

There's too many characters and too many different people to follow you end up not caring about a single person. There was only a glimpse of character development and it was obvious from the first 10 minutes of the film. The only scenes I felt engaged in and cared for were the ones centred around Matt Damon's character and his family (You didn't get a chance to ever catch the characters name).",Contagion

768,steve-lewakowski,really bad,1,10 September 2011,"I had high expectations going in with the star studded cast and a good IMDb rating. The film turned out to be very disappointing. The plot jumps around a ton and because of it it's hard to get a sense of uniqueness and continuity for the characters. Things happen in the movie that are just stupid because a couple times the conclusions are pointlessly left hanging, other times they seem to backtrack. The acting is pretty bad all around, which was surprising. The girl that played Matt Damon's daughter just sucked. The ending was very anti-climactic and somewhat silly, making the whole movie seem quite random. I didn't get a sense at any point that there was a lot of passion put into making this film. There's hardly any action, contrary to it's billing as a action thriller. If they would have added a little more mayhem, guns, boobs, and explosions, it would have compensated for the drab and one- note tones in the movie a little bit. A lot of the characters are outrageously dumb, like Gwenyth Paltrow's character. It's a highly predictable plot with few twists. It keeps your attention most of the way, I'll give it that, but it really wasn't what I was looking for.",Contagion
769,knightsc-09799,"One of the best ""science-mumbo-jumbo"" disaster films out there.",9,21 September 2018,"This film is, in my opinion, nearly flawless. It takes the mold of a typical disaster scenario and throws it right onto its head. The way it achieves this is by showing multiple points of view of the story. We don't just get to follow a lucky person who's immune, we get to follow every aspect. We learn how the people react, how the CDC reacts, and how the United States Government reacts. The movie is constantly moving at a steady pace, even though about a third of the film is explaining the science behind the problem. The way they make this interesting is by not shoving it down your throat by means of average Joes explaining jargon they should have no knowledge of (looking at you, World War Z) but rather with CDC officials explaining it to other characters. Every actor completely nails their performance, even the child actors aren't horrible in this. And oh my God, the soundtrack! This is one of the best OSTs I've ever heard in my life. It perfectly captures the feeling of the story and compliments scenes beautifully. I recommend this movie to anyone remotely interested in science movies.",Contagion
770,geoffermann,Prescient but plodding,3,9 March 2020,"We watched this movie last night as covid-19 is breaking out all over the world. In may respects, the film is quite prescient (Including the bat vector) and mirrors much of the current outbreak (though the film disease inexplicably spreads seemingly much faster despite a lower Ro and is far more lethal).But the film just didn't grab me for a few reasons:
* at least two extended montage scenes - the hallmark of lazy storytelling
* muted acting by Damon, Fishburne, et al.
* Doctor: ""Your wife passed."" Damon: ""OK, can I talk to her?"" Doctor: ???
* Damon sees looters wipe out his neighbors, but we don't see any evidence of iut despite him going through some of their homes the next day.
* Vaccine trials are lengthy but forget all that if one researcher tests it on herself successfully. Yeah riiiiiiiiiight.
* The kidnapped doctor learns she has been freed after the kidnappers get a placebo rather than a vaccine. She rushes away to...well we don't know what she's going to do and never see her again.What did grab me:
* Paltrow going into convulsions. Her best acting in years.
* Peeling Paltrow's skull for the autopsy. Hard to watch but that was a nice effect.
* Jude Law's unseemly character profiting off the pandemic with homeopathy.
* The reveal of how the virus originated though the bulldozer from Paltrow's company is a bit much.",Contagion

773,justin-douglas,"Suspense, Disease, Heroes = Great Movie",9,17 April 2019,"Spoiler
Great action and suspense film with medical professional as the heroes of the day. Contagion follows a team of medical researchers and government officials as they track and attempt to the stop the spread of a deadly new virus named Nipah sweeping across the globe. With and all-star cast of actors to that included Marion Cotillard (Dr. Leonora Orantes, Bryan Cranston (RADM Lyle Haggerty), Matt Damon (Mitch Emhoff), Jude Law (Alan Krumwiede), Kate Winslet Dr. Erin Mears, and Jennifer Ehle (Dr. Ally Hextall) to name a few cast it's hard to get the film wrong.
What makes the Contagion terrifying is the realism and the way fear and death is portrayed with in this pandemic as Dr. Cheever directs his team in a race against time. Contagion manages to show the realities, reaction and effects of the pandemic locally and globally. The director put on full display basic human instincts of fear during eminent societal collapse.
This films highlights my characteristics of humans and society when face with the burden of imamate demise suck as political cronyism, personal sacrifice and heroism. These scientists risked everything to ensure the cure was developed. Conation put on full displayed our social ethics, human morality and courage in a crisis. It should be appreciated because the kind of technological, moral and ethical issues covered in the film. Overall, it was an eye opening film and should be showed to first responders and officials who may have to deal with similar threats in real life.",Contagion
