0,MartinHafer,A really good film but NOT a comedy in any way,8,17 September 2021,"IMDB lists ""The King of Staten Island"" as a comedy/drama. I think this is a mistake as there really is no comedy in the fil...even though it stars Pete Davidson and Bill Burr as well as being directed by Judd Apetow.The film is a slice of life drama about a man who is a loser and going nowhere with his life. Scott (Davidson) is in his mid-20s but lives at home....spending most of his time smoking pot and hanging out with other losers. After a while, you seem to realize that at least some of his problem is depression, as his firefighter father died in the line of duty when Scott was 7. The film is about his journey from an unlikable loser to a semi-respectable guy with, perhaps, a future.As long as you DON'T expect comedy, you'll probably like the film. For much of the story, Scott is a real unlikable jerk....but I encourage you to give the film a try...it grows on you. Well written and unique.By the way, this story was obviously a work of love and a tribute to firefighters. It seems that Davidson's real life father was killed working as a fireman during 9/11 and Steve Buscemi (who is famous for being an ex-firefighter who returned to work during 9/11) makes a nice appearance in the film. A truly unique film...and it would make a nice double-feature with Adam Sandler's ""Reign Over Me""...another story about a guy who can't get his life back on track following the loss of family.",The King of Staten Island
1,SnoopyStyle,infuriating Scott,6,14 February 2021,"Scott Carlin (Pete Davidson) is depressed and self-destructive. He's 24 and still living at home with his widowed mother Margie (Marisa Tomei). His younger sister Claire (Maude Apatow) is leaving for college and worried about him. Everybody is worried about him. He spends his days smoking pot and doing bad tattoos on his loser friends. His ridiculous dream is starting a tattoo restaurant. He sleeps with Kelsey (Bel Powley) but keeps her at arm's length. He is haunted by his firefighter father's death who was killed in a hotel fire when he was seven. His mother starts dating another firefighter, Ray Bishop (Bill Burr).Judd Apatow is the director. I like this less than most of his other movies. After some careful consideration, I think it's Scott that I don't like. Judd's protagonists are often self-destructive but in this one, Scott is also mean to those who love him most. He is basically an emotional bully to Kelsey. I do like his relationship to Claire since she actually fights back. That's a fun bickering sibling relationship. His relationship with his mother is not so fun. At the end of the day, his anger gets sometimes directed at the wrong person and I don't like him for it. It makes it harder to root for the guy. I do understand Judd's method of character growth for Scott. It has to be handled with much more care. Also, this movie is too long. Normally, I don't fret over that for Judd's movie but this one feels it. Maybe if this is a much darker movie... Judd's standard comedic tone doesn't fit Pete Davidson's performance.",The King of Staten Island
2,nogodnomasters,He has nepotism,4,27 June 2020,"Scott (Pete Davidson) has ADD and has severe self-esteem issues, worse than Amy Schumer on crack. His dad died as a firefighter which he blames for all of his woes. After 17 years when his mom (Marisa Tomei) finally meets someone, Scott has issues with it. Scott aspires to open a combination tattoo parlor and restaurant. Judd Apatow felt he needed to write another role for his daughter as she is having a hard time finding work.This is a dramedy that created an unrealistic situation with Scott going to the fire station. Scott did a lot of drinking for someone claiming to have Crohn's disease. Did Bel Powley get implants? The film tried to do too much and didn't do it well.Guide: F-word. Sex. No nudity",The King of Staten Island
3,BandSAboutMovies,I liked this way more than expected,6,31 July 2020,"You know, I liked this movie more than I ever would have thought. I've disliked nearly everything Pete Davidson has done on Saturday Night Live, seeing him as, at best, a one-note stand-up jammed into a show where the best he can do is look sleepy and break in nearly every sketch.Yet this movie, a semi-autobiography as Davidson's father was also a firefighter who died on 9/11, was moving and well-done.It's not without its problems. Like every Judd Apatow movie, there's no reason for it to be two hours and sixteen minutes. The guy has no idea how to end a movie on time.Marisa Tomei again shows why she really did deserve that Oscar and wow, Bill Burr was a revelation. The guy is so natural and perfect here, as is Bel Powley as Davidson's love interest.Pamela Adlon, who plays Burr's ex-wife, is actually the voice of Bobby Hill on King of the Hill, which is a shock. And Steve Buscemi, who was a firefighter while beginning his acting career, is great as usual.I was expecting a self-indulgent mess and got a thoughtful film. I promise not to judge Davidson so harshly in the future.",The King of Staten Island
4,grantss,A bit flat as a drama but fairly good as a comedy,6,27 March 2021,"24-year-old Scott lives with his mom. He doesn't have a job and spends most of his time hanging out with his stoner-slacker friends. Then, for the first time since his dad died 17 years ago, his mom starts seeing someone. Scott's fragile world suddenly got more complicated.Directed and co-written by Judd Apatow, The King of Staten Island is a mix of comedy and human drama. The comedy is pretty good, with some great stoner humour and some funny dialogue.The drama side, however, is a bit flat, not really going anywhere profound or particularly interesting. This is not helped by being unable to engage with Scott, the heavily-tattooed stoner-slacker lead character. The drama does have its moments though, so its not a complete waste of time.Overall, the film would have worked better if 100% a comedy but, as it is, it's okay.",The King of Staten Island
5,george.schmidt,Davidson shines in his first big onscreen comedy lead with Apatow's trademark of hilarity with heart.,9,19 September 2020,"THE KING OF STATEN ISLAND (2020) *** 1/2 Pete Davidson, Marisa Tomei, Bill Burr, Bel Powley, Ricky Velez, Lou Wilson, Moises Arias, Maude Apatow, Kevin Corrigan, Steve Buscemi. Director Judd Apatow delivers the goods with his patented way of mixing humor and heart with Davidson (who collaborated on the script with him and Dave Sirus) as a slacker facing the moment of truth to become something in his life whatever that entails including aspirations of being a tattoo artist while his mother (Tomei) begins a new relationship long after the loss of his firefighter father, whose memory hangs like a cloud over them both. Davidson shines in his first big role onscreen outside of SNL and has potential to be an even bigger comedy star in the making.",The King of Staten Island
6,deloudelouvain,A bit too long for that story.,7,8 October 2020,"If I could I would give The King Of Staten Island a 6.5 rating on here. If it wasn't that long maybe I would give it a seven. The story does not have interesting elements enough to entertain us that long. It wasn't bad though, just not great. It's a dramady (drama/comedy), with more drama than comedy (which is subtle but not bad). As for the acting that was good, a well chosen cast that all delivered. I don't regret watching it, but I won't watch it again to be honest.",The King of Staten Island
7,jdesando,A worthy comedy of the dependable Judd Apatow.,6,2 December 2020,"The King of Staten Island has Judd Apatow written all over it-witty, warm, affectionate, and wildly eccentric. Scott (Pete Davidson: full bore confessional humor straight from SNL) is a 24-year old arrested-development slacker with a smart mouth, charming smile, and dreams of opening a tattoo restaurant called ""Ruby Tattuesday's.""He lives with his youthful mom, Margie (Marisa Tomei, a go-to Oscar-winning actress for this kind of role). For her he's a blessing and a curse.Although nothing that happens to Scott is ordinary, Apatow makes it Seinfeld believable-nothing into something. While Scott rebels against just about everything, he displays a big heart (see him walk the kids to school) and rapidly fires off some humorous lines.Smoking weed in his basement with stoner buddies (Ricky Velez and Moises Arias are especially funny) is typical low-brow Apatow humor. They may be lines not as memorable as in Knocked Up but still warmly funny. Because Davidson co-wrote the script, it has a real-life energy and melancholic tone influenced by the death of his fireman dad.The plot energizes with the arrival of his mom's new boyfriend, Ray (Bill Burr), who is as mouthy and loving as Scott and reminiscent of Scott's deceased dad. That Davidson's real-life FDNY dad gave his life in a 9/11 rescue only adds to the authentic feel for an almost self-parody. The arc of Scott and Ray's relationship can be seen long before the denouement, resisting formula through the talents of the actors to make the characters fresh and likeable.Because many of those around Scott are, like him, out of alignment with where other white guys are fast heading, Apatow captures a sweet longing for the characters to belong even if their humor is better when they are outlaws. In a pandemic when the audience's developments are arrested, it's nice to view The King of Staten Island as everyone's story as well, only with more laughs.On Prime",The King of Staten Island
8,Edvis-1997,8,8,15 August 2020,"I would say it's very interesting movie to watch. Not too complicated to catch main idea and fallow plot. Still the ending wasn't strong part of this film. I'm still missing ending, it wasn't very clear.",The King of Staten Island
9,Cineanalyst,Drawn from Life,8,12 January 2021,"The final shot here of Pete Davidson, nominally as the character Scott Carlin, looking in the direction where the World Trade Center towers once stood is perfect. Even though the 9/11 terrorist attacks are never mentioned, ""The King of Staten Island"" is a semi-autobiography of Davidson, whose fireman father died from the attacks. Although Carlin isn't a comedian like Davidson, I appreciate the irreverent humor here, including its use in deflecting and dealing with grief, which at the least is a change of pace from the usual melodramatics employed in movies about losing a loved one. Even the meandering pacing and extended length that some have panned seems somewhat appropriate in this case given the protagonist's lack of direction in life.I love that Davidson's stand-up comedy, leading him to be a SNL cast member, is replaced here by another, artistic outlet in drawing and tattoo art. It's a Judd Apatow flick, too, so it, of course, also gets dangerously close to rom-com territory in its resolution, but it's really the art, or craft, that pulls Carlin through. He literally resolves his familial conflict with ink on a man's back while honoring his late father and the present firefighters (including one as played by former fireman and volunteer at Ground Zero, Steve Buscemi) in a fire station and, then, with his mother working in the emergency room of a hospital. Of Apatow's oeuvre, only ""Funny People"" (2009) likewise worked as both dark comedy and tender drama. Ultimately, this is Davidson's picture, though, and it's impressively revealing and affective.",The King of Staten Island
10,851222,Good comedy / drama,7,30 September 2020,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The King of Staten Island"" (2020) is a well written, acted and directed comedy drama about a young man in search of him self. And as cliched as it sounds, this plot actually worked here pretty well because of the solid craftsmanship. I also was very surprised when i learned after watching this movie that the story of main character is more or less autobiographic.Overall, ""The King of Staten Island"" is a solid drama / comedy. Simple yet good story, good craftsmanship and good acting makes this film very watchable.",The King of Staten Island
11,ops-52535,pete davidson is just a golden nugget,9,13 June 2020,"He is my new favourite , because like buster keaton did, he has it in the eyes, and wouldve been a star like lloyd, keaton and chaplin in the slapstick silent movie era...just a hint for future products.in addition to that he has a cataclysmal verbalistic talent, along with loads of the others in the large main cast, and thats newage comedy, usually i dont like that linguistic workout in comedies, but this was a nice exception.its also about a man with a set of bad genes in the mental framework, and it has a load of ad/hd in its demeanors. ad the group dynamics of weed puffing group of friends you are really in for a yum yum.the only drawback to this flick is the ver long playtime, not that it isnt nescesarry, but it can be tiring at the late night attendance. but the rest 90 % of the film are just a race over the life of a man on staten island n.y., its filled with surprise and a lot of laughter, for some even tears.so the grumpy old man had a good time, you wont regret a view, and mr davidson will be on my notepad for the years to come. a big recommend",The King of Staten Island

13,Thanos_Alfie,Surprisingly good...,7,28 July 2020,"""The King of Staten Island"" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we watch a young man changing his lifestyle due to some new parameters that were added in his life. From smoking weed, relaxing with his friends and dreaming of becoming a tattoo artist to the real life in which you have to work in order to receive money to do whatever you want.I have to admit that I was really surprised by this movie and I did not expect to like it so much. I enjoyed it very much because it had a nice and very interesting plot, a very good direction which was made by Judd Apatow who is one of the writers and some very good interpretations made by its cast. Regarding the interpretations, Pete Davidson who played as Scott Carlin (and he is one of the writers), he was simply outstanding and I believe that his interpretation made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Marisa Tomei's who played as Margie Carlin, Bel Powley's who played as Kelsey and Bill Burr's who played as Ray Bishop. Finally, I have to say that ""The King of Staten Island"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that you won't just find it interesting but also simply beautiful.",The King of Staten Island
14,cruise01,Strong performances and a strong story about a young adult trying to redeem himself.,10,30 August 2020,The King of Staten Island (5 out of 5 stars).The King of Staten Island is a great comedy drama film. The latest Judd Apatow film which carries a strong dramatic script and some humor that is carried by Pete Davidson. To make the movie even better. The story is based on similiar events on Pete Davidsons life. After losing his father from firefighting. He was troubled growing up. Has difficulties learning cause of his ADD. Is trying to be a tattoo artists but after practicing on his friends and family with a tattoo design with terrible facial designs. He lives with his mother and sister. Until his sister grows up and off to college. His mother meets another guy Ray. Who is also a firefighter. Petes character has difficulties accepting his mothers happiness with Ray. While dealing with the life changing event of growing up and trying to find yourself as a person.Great story. Pete Davidsons performance was great. As a amateur and trying to be charming. The cast is great. Marisa Tomei was great playing his mother. The script delivered a powerful drama. About a young guy struggling from loss. And suffering an illness. Judd Apatow direction is great. Relatable drama. Some dark humor. It does have a feel good dramatic ending. Judd Apatow did not disappoint with this comedy drama film.,The King of Staten Island
15,Floated2,Possible star turning performance,8,5 July 2020,"Having seen Judd Apatow's previous directed films and knowing his type of comedic humor, and after seeing the trailer of this film, had somewhat an expectation as what to expect.The King of Staten Island is quite apparently a semi autobiographical film about the upcomings of Pete Davidson's life. With that in mind, it was expected as he would deliver a great performance as this film may have a deep meaning to him.With an original intended theatrical release, this film was unfortunately slated to straight to streaming. Perhaps they could have waited several months later to release this in theaters- as it would have don't more justice.As a film, very solid doses of comedy and drama which Apatow is always great at. There are many light hearted funny scenes, but also sad and touching scenes. There is a good balance. And as a story there are enough little subplots to keep engaged all the way though start to finish.This is the film which may be responsible for Pete Davidson becoming a star, although with its limited release the question still remains. Perhaps in 2-3 years from now we will have our answer.",The King of Staten Island
16,eddie_baggins,A unique dramedy from Judd Apatow and Pete Davidson,7,19 July 2020,"His first feature film since the extremely forgettable 2015 commercial hit Trainwreck, respected comedic mastermind Judd Apatow returns to his more serious comedic stylings of Funny People and This is 40 for his latest effort, The King of Staten Island.Released directly to streaming in the United States and facing a delayed cinematic release here in Australia, King marks the most high profile role yet of stand up comedian and Saturday Night Live regular Pete Davidson, who alongside Apatow explores a semi-autobiographical narrative of Davidson's lost soul Scott Carlin who has been left in limbo ever since his firefighter father was tragically killed when he was a young boy.Playing very much a version of his real life self, you sense Davidson isn't so much acting here as reliving his own memories and experiences and viewers enjoyment of King will be wholly dependent on how much they can tolerate Carlin's bleak and sometimes tiresome antics, that see this man-child battling his mental demons whilst failing to take charge of his stalled life.In many ways its a brave performance, Davidson willing to tackle his own traumas and issues head on in such a raw manner, with many likely to be surprised by just how few genuine laughs exist here with the comedian and Apatow more interested in the drama over cheap comedy moments, but Carlin is an often frustrating and unlikeable creation, even if its rare to see such a figure lead a big-scale Hollywood dramedy.Luckily for the over-long film (one that should never have been ticked off at over two hours), Davidson and his often hard to love creation are surrounded by some fantastic support turns with Marisa Tomei great as Scott's long-suffering mother Margie and Bill Burr as Margie's new partner and spanner in Scott's stay at home lifestyle Ray.Always a director that has managed to handle ensemble efforts as well as any one could, Apatow gets a lot from his films supports and when combined with the intriguing addition of regular Paul Thomas Anderson D.O.P Robert Elswit as the films mastermind behind the lens, King is always impeccably crafted and watchable (with a lovingly low-key final scene), without ever becoming a truly gripping or ground-breaking affair.Final Say -A solid addition to Apatow's growing collection of more deep-thinking drama's with touches of comedy, The King of Staten Island is good without being great, with the verdict still out on whether Davidson will be able to forge a successful career in narrative films.3 1/2 shoddy tattoos out of 5",The King of Staten Island

20,alindsay-al,A Great Heartfelt Comedy,8,18 June 2020,"This film hit demand last week and I have now had the chance to watch The King Of Staten Island and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees A 24 year old weed smoker Tatooist with no ambition have to face his grief and try and make a step forward in his future.
Main Character
I feel that Pete Davidson is one of those people that comes across as either a love or hate mentality and honestly I find him really funny and I thought he really worked for this film. Yes he basically plays himself, but I found him really interesting here and I felt plenty of sympathy for him as a character. I like his dark humour here and it is clearly seen as a defence mechanism which just adds to his performance and character.
Supporting Characters
Marisa Tomei plays his mother in the film and she is fantastic, the chemistry the two of them have together is really good and I actually felt a bond between these two as in they were believable as mother and son. She is such an important part of his life and so nice that you see Davidson's point of view and want to just see her go the film and be happy. Bill Burr plays her love interest and he is awesome here too, he has great chemistry with Tomei and they just have a really nice relationship here and you want to see everything work out. His dynamic with Davidson is also a real highlight and does a great job of pushing both of their story arcs. Steve Buscemi has a smaller role here and he does a really good job in the role adding quality to his character.
Story
The story of trying to see Davidson's character trying to get his life together is the driving force of this film. You do sympathise with him and you really want to see him get his life started and turned around and that is the real highlight here. However, this film's first act takes a bit to get going and tehre are some parts of the story that aren't concluded and feel open ended with a bit of an abrupt ending to boot.
Script
The script is really good, there is just fun dialogue. Not a lot of really funny moments but this film is consistently chuckle worthy and that is enough to get you through easily. Plus there is a suprisingly large amount of heart and drama here that rises this above a pretty generic comedy that they make plenty of.
Style
The film just looks really cool, it has a fun style mixed with some really tension filled moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat. However, this film is way too long, it could easily have had 20/30 mins chopped off and it would have been paced perfectly but it just ends up dragging at times.
Overall
Overall, this is a great suprise for me and is easily a great film to watch. If you are looking for a fun comedy with a bit of heart to it then The King Of Staten Island is worth a watch.",The King of Staten Island

Should have done better!",2,15 November 2020,"This film start with a young man ""Scott"" listening song in the car while driving, and he accidentally hitting a car scene!

23,dar0417,One of the best of the year,9,15 July 2020,One of the best of the year. Funny and dramatic as to a lot of Judd's other films. Like the rest this one works really well.,The King of Staten Island

""Who's there?""
""Not your dad!""The first act of the movie honestly was a real slog to get through. I doubted whether I should bother to finish the film especially considering the runtime looked intimidating for its tone. It didn't help that it wasn't particularly funny either. Worst still, it wasn't for lack of trying. Most of the jokes just didn't land, which became a worrying trend throughout the movie. However, once the first act was over, I realised there was something more to this movie. The characters started taking center stage. An important transition that allowed the film's more mature moments. It's then that the movie became gripping, soulful in a way and gave it heart. It's where you can really experience King of Staten Island's core, and where some of the comedy started to flow naturally too. Which really leads me to believe the film should've fully committed itself to its character driven narrative right from the get-go and allowed its comedy to come second.Extra Note: The music was pretty hit or miss with me too",The King of Staten Island
25,masonfisk,DAVIDSON & APATOW SHINE...!,8,19 January 2021,"Judd Apatow's latest focuses on current SNL'er Pete Davidson in a story inspired by his own life. Losing his father at an early age, Davidson has now grown up living his life aimlessly, hanging out w/his friends smoking dope, suffering from Crohn's disease & hoping to be a successful tattoo artist. His mother, played by Marisa Tomei, is a nurse who has become numb about his progress instead focusing on her college bound daughter, played Apatow's daughter Maude, but things change when love comes her way via a fireman, played by comedian Bill Burr & she starts to finally come around to the idea that Davidson has to go, sending him into a frenzy of abandonment, betrayal & angry outbursts. Davidson sees Burr as an unwanted replacement (doubly resonant since his father was a fireman who died on the job) so he sets his mind to sabotage the romance before it even starts but when a confluence of outside events start to make his position untenable (his loser friends involve him in a drugstore robbery, his friend w/benefits dumps him because he can't commit & even his dream berth is scuppered when he's essentially told he has no talent), Tomei kicks him to the curb where he eventually makes it to the doorstep of Burr's firehouse where upon hearing who his father was, his fellow fire eaters take him in as one of their own. Apatow mounts a nice showcase for Davidson (who co-wrote here) wisely letting him sprinkle his sarcastic yet pointed humor throughout this yarn but never forgetting the bedrock of inspiration which anchors the story (something which in something like Trainwreck, the Amy Schumer vehicle, got away from him making that film a series of raunchy jokes told through the sliver of a plot). Apatow again lets his penchant for generous ad-libbing balloon the story's run time to over 2 hours when a good 30 minutes could've been lost & elevated this material even higher but on the whole I rather have too much of a good thing than too much of a bad. Also starring Moises Arias as one Davidson's buds, Machine Gun Kelly, the overly tatted rap star cast ingeniously as a tattoo artist, Bel Powley as Davidson's on again/off again lover, Steve Buscemi (who used to be firefighter in real life before becoming an actor) & Dominic Lombardozzi (from The Wire) as fellow firemen, Kevin Corrigan as Davidson's boss & Pamela Adlon from FX's Better Things as Burr's ex-wife.",The King of Staten Island
26,aidanratesmovies,"I enjoyed it a lot, shame it didn't make it to theaters",10,14 November 2020,"Although it certainly is a longer film in terms of comedy projects, The King of Staten Island graces the screen with genuine emotion and genuine laughs, that truly make it hard to not enjoy. Since I first discovered him on SNL, I have always been a fan of Pete Davidson's work as well as his standup, and seeing him act in this film- along with his other great coming of age story this year Big Time Adolescence truly shows how talented of a performer he can be. Not only is he funny and sweet throughout, but he provides a very clear view of growing up, letting go, and the emotions that come with it. I also enjoyed Bill Burr's performance as Ray Bishop, as well as several other performances, although none quite stick out as much as Davidson. The film is long, but that isn't to say its boring in anyway, it has its slower moments about 2/3 of the way through, but for the most part I was rather entertained and delightfully amused at how funny this film was, as well as how grounded the story was in general. What I like about Apatow's direction in this, similarly to the likes of his other film Knocked Up, is that he takes somewhat absurd situations and provides a platform for them to be realistic and grounded, which I feel is very important in any film, especially a comedy today. The look of the film isn't anything special, but it's a sweet and fun surprise that I wouldn't mind catching again sometime.

27,questl-18592,The Average Citizen of Staten Island,6,26 August 2020,"This was confusing. Performances are solid all around, there's nice, subtle character growth and I actually found myself enjoying a Davidson performance, which I never thought would happen.By all accounts, this should be better than the pretty middling affair it is.It's reported at 137 minutes but I would've swore it was 6 hours. I think that's the biggest problem, the people behind the camera lacked discipline. This thing is a bloated, meandering and overindulgent snooze ride that doesn't really go anywhere. Everyone's solid in front of the camera, so I don't necessarily mind seeing them but around 2/3 of the way through I just wanted it to be done.There's no big revelations, no climactic moments, no grand finale. Stuff just keeps happening until it stops. It'sa nice exploration of a man's life and it shows his journey, it just doesn't make for overly compelling narrative as it's presented.I feel like I want to recommend it, but at the same time I can't blame anyone for not wanting to bother. You won't miss anything if you skip it, can't say you'll gain much if you watch it, which I suppose is the issue. It feels like something should be here and it's just not. No rousing applause, no impassioned jeers, just an indifferent shrug as the credits roll.",The King of Staten Island

Judd Apatow's direction is great and its well paced, even if it doesn't need to be as long as it is. The music by Michael Andrews and the soundtrack are both really good.",The King of Staten Island
29,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The King of Staten Island,6,15 June 2020,"2020's The King of Staten Island is my latest write-up. And no, I'm not talking about Staten Island residents like Gene Simmons, Vernon Reid, and Method Man. ""Staten"" is about a twentysomething who lives with his mom and doesn't really have a career or direction in his life. It also doesn't help that his firefighter father died when he was seven leaving him distraught with low self-esteem, a pot-smoking habit, and ADHD.Semi-autobiographical in its approach and blunt to the nth degree, The King of Staten Island is Judd Apatow at his most Apatow (yup, he's the director). Judd without the ability to yell ""cut"", gives us his usual trademarks. We're talking long-winded scenes, longer than normal running times for comedy/dramas, and improvisation to the max. ""Staten"" with a wandering and bloated eye, feels like the film Apatow was born to make. No one probably refused him final cut and I'm sure that made big Judd real happy.Starring the likes of Marisa Tomei, Steve Buscemi, and Pete Davidson (he plays the troubled lead in Scott Carlin), ""Staten"" follows the Apatow badge in which an unknown trouper gets a chance to break out as a main character in a big studio flick. Seth Rogen did it in Knocked Up while Amy Schumer did it in Trainwreck. Davidson does it raw here in ""Staten"" as a sort of life-imitating-art suitor. He's perfectly cast but you don't quite root for him because his life courses of action and paths aren't fully defined (the romanticized yet pat ending is proof of that).Much like the journey Davidson's Scott takes, The King of Staten Island as a film feels jumbled and a little haphazard as well. I liked the authenticity of Staten Island's culture depicted and most of the actors in peaking in, slice-of-life mode, are ones you gravitate to. Still, ""Staten"" proves that Apatow can push the envelope but only in a drifting manner. Funny at times, depressing, and kinda touching, The King of Staten Island is no ""court jester"" but it's no ""crowned head"" either. Rating: 2 and a half stars.",The King of Staten Island
30,elliotjeory,Decent film,7,18 June 2020,I liked this film it had a good script I liked the constant flow of the dialogue and the actors bouncing off each other. There is a lot of good characters and actors in this film and I liked the story too. Overall a enjoyable comedy drama.,The King of Staten Island
31,arungeorge13,"Barring a few insignificant hiccups, this is a fairly enjoyable Davidson-Apatow ride! [+68%]",7,14 August 2020,"I've always liked Judd Apatow's style of mixing humor with situations that feel super relatable and appreciated his talent in writing characters who can all have separate movies of their own. This one's about a 24-year-old weed-smoking, conventionally good-for-nothing manchild named Scott (played by SNL's Pete Davidson, who's also co-writer). All he does is chill with his mates, smoke pot, play games, and conduct tattooing experiments on his friends.That opening scene was a major curveball though - I was thinking this is Apatow trying to tackle the much-talked-about subject of depression. But, in a matter of minutes, we get to Apatow's familiar playground. The dialogues are almost always the best thing about his movies, and The King of Staten Island is yet another example in that regard. It's filled with authentic, self-deprecating, situational humor that keeps things engaging even with a runtime of 137 minutes.Scott, a semi-biographical version of Davidson himself, throws the harshest comebacks every single time he's cornered, like it's the only skill he's got, apart from creating art with his tattoos. He is surrounded by many equally well-written characters such as his widowed mom (a stupendous Marisa Tomei), her new boyfriend (Bill Burr, who gets a meaty role and makes good of it), his friend-with-benefits Kelsey (Bel Powley, who steals every scene that she's in), and a mentor-of-sorts in Papa (the ever-reliable Steve Buscemi). While it's Scott's issues that form the centerpiece of the film, it's also about how all these characters are affected by his presence around them, at various points.And needless to say, Apatow uses his films to offer fascinating social commentary. He takes a dig at nepotism, makes an old-timer exclaim that reputed colleges nurtured people like Bill Cosby, Donald Trump, and Ted Bundy but college is also where youngsters have the 'time of their lives'. Heck, there's even a Jay-Z joke that'll make you more than just chuckle. Along with that opening scene, there's also a bizarre, out-of-place robbery scene that clashes tonally with the rest of the film. Disregard these minor problems and you have one of the finest ""loser learns to live life"" films out there that I'd love to see a sequel to, sometime in the future. Call that the 'The Emperor of Staten Island' if you must, Judd.P.S - Enjoyed seeing Machine Gun Kelly in a cameo.",The King of Staten Island

33,saadgkhan,Heartwarming tale of self acceptance and growth,7,14 June 2020,"The King of Staten Island - B+ (Memorable)I'll be honest, I wasn't keen on watching Pete Davidson being King of anything maybe due to media's attention to his private life. I find the guy funny but more lost and feel lots of SNL and Standup stuff above average but not memorable. I am glad to see that I was proven wrong as it's not a piece glorifying drugs or recreational marijuana usage. The movie dealt with being a guy whose is lost, weird and has no direction per societal standards but still is a Human. He doesn't hurt people purposely and tries to be perfect but unfortunately not considered normal as the choices he makes is not being committed to social norms of perfection like education, house, girlfriend etc etc etc.Pete Davidson is pleasant to watch, he is not only playing himself but makes you understand that guys who don't want normal stuff may have issues but it doesn't make them Heartless they do deserve chance and understanding from family, friends and society. Talk about perfect casting is Marissa Tomei and Bill Burr as they bring the perfect humour and care to the story. The scene Pete goes back to Marissa his mom that he learned his lesson after cleaning and cooking for firies was hilarious, how moms do this day after day but rarely gets acknowledgement.The only thing I think movie would have benefited from making it under 2HRS, as it felt bit long maybe due to being on VOD directors can go with their cut instead of theatre. Still, the movie is an easy watch with heartwarming message into accepting yourself with time and overcoming it. You don't have to perfect to be part of society, you can be who you're and still can be valued.",The King of Staten Island
34,martimusross,Mostly Good!,6,11 October 2021,"The King Of Staten IslandOverall it was a good movie, I'm not sure is was necessary to have Pete Davidson in every scene, his frenetic and manic delivery was exhausting.The jury is still out with regard to his acting skills and range, I want to see more, and outside of his comfort zone, it was a surface method style and I want to see less physical and more internalised characterisation. We don't need another Jim Carey or Robin Williams as this would just not be possible.The story was tissue thin and mostly kitchen sink but I suppose this is the story of middle America, just getting on with their lives. However, following a family altercation and Scott was asked to leave the family home the movie moved up a couple of gears, it was just great, a talented ensemble of character actors contributed to the transformation of Scott.I didn't like the elevation of drugs culture, tattoos, petty crime etc to near approval within the storyline.Clearly this was all a very personal story and I just review the art product as it is! Overall this is a strong 6 outta 10 as only the last 45 minutes really hung together.",The King of Staten Island

36,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Very good, just a little too long",7,10 August 2020,"With a little editing I think this could have been great. The lack of structure does replicate the feeling of having a structureless life, but the length of certain scenes (sometimes thanks to the Apatow-ey improv) means you forget about certain subplots, only to be surprised when they re-enter the picture.Still, everything else is great or close to it. Davidson and Burr were particularly good in an overall strong cast, it balances comedy and drama well, and told a story I could relate to fairly well at this point in my life.In time I could see my score being raised, but for now it's a very strong 7/10.",The King of Staten Island

I almost gave a 7/10 but realistically I will probably not remember this movie a year from now so I brought it down to 6/10. I liked the idea and script, some characters and actors like Bill Burr are great and overall, I enjoyed watching the movie. But it feels too unpolished too many times, it's too long with questionable pacing and editing, and let's face it, Pete Davidson is really not that great an actor. I also had a few chuckles but expected actual laughs so that was disappointing as well.",The King of Staten Island
38,kevin c,9/11 legacy,6,22 November 2020,"Covid banished to streaming, The King of Staten Island is too long. The lead Scott is a thinly veiled version of Davidson, whose own firefighter father died in 9/11, and who has been open about his struggles with Crohn's and his mental health. The blurring between fact and fiction is the film's real hook. Marisa Tomei is characteristically empathetic and warm as Scott's mother, and Buscemi adds depath as a kindly firefighter.It's a mess of a film, that eventuially finds its way and has some funny moments. Scott is both adorable and unpleasant, and his trajectory ultra scattershot.",The King of Staten Island
39,Holt344,"The King of Staten Island is a Judd Apatow film but yet different in how real it feels, a must watch",9,16 August 2021,"The King of Staten Island is a comedy-drama directed by Judd Apatow who co-wrote the film with Pete Davidson and Dave Sirus. It's also a semi-biographical take on the life of Pete Davidson, whose father was a New York City firefighter and died in service during the September 11 attacks and who has had his own battles with mental illness. It also stars Marisa Tomei, Bill Burr, Bel Powley, Maude Apatow and Steve Buscemi, and follows Pete Davidson's character, Scott Carlin spends his days smoking weed and dreaming of being a tattoo artist until events force him to grapple with his grief and take his first steps forward in life.Judd Apatow is known for his great comedies and it isn't often he tried a mature subject like this, but I'll admit that he succeeded and handled it with upmost care, he created something brilliant and made sure that the mature subject matter didn't disappear through the comedy. I'll also want to add that this is the best performance I have seen Pete Davidson do, maybe because it came natural for him, but non the less a really strong performance. It's actually very well shot, cinematography is on point. I understand the criticism of the film being too long, but I loved the story and characters so I honestly would have liked to see the 2 hours 55 minutes version that Judd Apatow wanted to release, but I understand why Universal Pictures wanted him to cut it down to which became the theatrical cut as I think the pacing is perfect.The King of Staten Island still feels like a Judd Apatow comedy-drama, there is no reinventing, yet it's a great film thanks to Pete Davidson and his personal experiences. It feels real, more real than some other of Apatow's films and that's why I think this film is worth watching.",The King of Staten Island
40,kjproulx,"A Raw, Authentic, Character Study",10,13 June 2020,"Everyone knows director Judd Apatow for his movies The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up (rightfully so), but I've always appreciated some of his other outings as well, like Funny People, Trainwreck, and for creating the Netflix series Love. This may seem like a big statement and I've only just watched his newest film The King of Staten Island, but I believe it may be my favourite film of his. Full of sharp comedy, raw emotions, and packing a strong punch of reality, I was sucked in from start to finish. With such a touchy subject that may even offend some viewers, this movie chooses a slightly comedic take on loss and I thought that made the film even better. Here's why I highly, highly recommend The King of Staten Island.Beginning with the fact that Scott (Pete Davidson) has not gotten over the death of his father, he sits around all day, doing nothing except smoke weed and hang out with friends. With his sister off to college and his mom beginning to date someone he doesn't approve of, his hardships become even deeper. Slowly learning ways to cope and move on, he discovers things about himself that were hidden. This film hit me really hard. Not because I related to him in any way, but the fact that Pete Davidson also had a hand in the screenplay, spoke volumes.In real life, Pete Davidson lost his father in the fires of 9/11. While names, scenarios, and overall lifestyle of Scott in the film was changed to fit a feature film, every line of the dialogue felt like it came from the heart. I could feel the inner pain very present throughout the entire duration and his central performance brought me to tears by the end. The way he handles his grief and bottles it up, trying to make everything into a joke, felt very authentic. I've only ever seen his appearances on Saturday Night Live, but if he's able to channel emotions and comedic chops in other projects like this, I can't wait to see more of him.Now, this may be slightly biased, but I'm a huge fan of movies that are done well, with hardly any score. The characters are what make this movie what it is and the lengthy 136-minute run time flew by for me. From the terrific direction by Judd Apatow, to the supporting cast like Marisa Tomei and Bill Burr holding up the raw, central performance by Davidson, I just found myself engulfed in the emotion of it all. Yes, I laughed on multiple occasions as well, as this really is a comedy at its core, but it's so much more than that. While not a lot happens other than the arc that Scott goes through, The King of Staten Island had a lot to say.In the end, looking back on the film as a whole, I don't really have anything that I would say took me out of my experience. The care taken to the subtlety of the camerawork by Robert Elswit was also a nice addition. His work in the past has won many awards though, so that shouldn't come as a surprise. This may seem like a review of something gushing about all the best elements of a movie and not even choosing to touch on a negative, but that's because any minor issues I may have had aren't even worth it. I loved every second of this character study and not only do I believe it's Apatow's best and not authentic film to date, but it's also my favourite film of 2020 so far. I haven't been this positive about a film in 2020 yet, so I believe a round of applause for the entire cast and crew on this one is in order. I can't recommend this one enough.",The King of Staten Island
41,tm-sheehan,Very Enjoyable- a Comedy with a heart,7,30 October 2020,"My Review - The King of Staten Island
My Rating 7/10
Once I got the gist and heart of this Comedy Drama and realised it was much more than a coming of age teen rom -com I really enjoyed The King of Staten IslandThe main character Scott Carlin played so well by (Pete Davidson a well known stand up comedian ) lives with his family and friends live Staten Island just a ferry ride to Manhattan . Scott is a troubled adolescent man child who's only motivation is to become a tatoo artist.
He lives on the island with his Mother Margi played by the delightful Marisa Tomei in another excellent performance. Scott's Sister Claire leaves home to go to College and Margi gets romantically involved with a homeless Firefighter Ray Bishop(Bill Burr) . Scott who is still feeling and dealing with grief at the loss of his Firefighter Father killed in action while fighting a fire feels abandoned and this leads to more rebellious behaviour.
This film is semi autobiographical because Pete Davidson who plays our main character Scott also tragically lost his father Scott Davidson a firefighter who died in the line of duty.
The story is based in-part on Pete Davidson's life, depicting what it might have been like if he had not become a comedian.
Pete's father Scott Davidson's unit, Ladder Company 118 in Brooklyn Heights, responded to the call to the World Trade Center after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. They were rescuing people in the Marriott World Trade Center Hotel when the tower collapsed on the building. Pete was seven years old.
The role of Grandpa is played by Pete Davidson's grandfather, Stephen Davidson.
The other link to a FireFighter in this movie I was surprised to read is Actor Steve Buscemi in a supporting role as Papa . Steve Buscemi was a New York City firefighter before becoming an actor. In November 2000, Buscemi told Salon interviewer Stephen Lemons that he was with Engine 55 in Manhattan's Little Italy for four years in the early 1980s. He took acting classes after about a year on the job, and stayed with the FDNY while acting in plays and movies. Buscemi quit firefighting in 1984 to pursue acting full-time. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, he returned to his old fire station to help search for survivors in the rubble of the World Trade Center. Steve Buscemi has some good scenes in this film as he helps Scott gain more confidence and convinces the other Firefighters that he shows promise and helps him find a community and learn more about his Dad.
It's a good script written by Pete Davidson, Judd Apato ,who also directed the film and Dave Sirus and I really enjoyed it.",The King of Staten Island
42,msbreviews,The King of Staten Island is an overlong yet entertaining showcase for Pete Davidson's talent.,6,1 July 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Judd Apatow has directed/produced some hilarious pieces of cinema: Trainwreck, Bridesmaids, Superbad, Knocked Up, The 40 Year Old Virgin... He's got quite the filmography, there's no way of denying it. Therefore, his name alone is enough to grab my attention when a comedy co-written and directed by him comes along. Add Pete Davidson as a co-writer and the main star, plus a really fascinating cast with Marisa Tomei and Bill Burr, and I'm definitely interested. The King of Staten Island holds a formulaic premise (the whole ""dead parent entails a bad kid who needs to learn how to be a better person"" has been done to exhaustion), but is it able to elevate it in some way?First of all, the dark humor really works for me. For anyone who doesn't appreciate this type of comedy, Apatow's film might be too excessive. Tons of unrestrained jokes about the most sensitive subjects, and characters with no limits to where they can go with their wicked sense of humor. So, if you're not a fan of dark comedy, this movie might turn out to be a very unpleasant experience. However, if you have no issues with laughing at a ""bad joke"", this comedy might just work well enough for you to have a good time. I had really good laughs.Scott takes the ""bad kid who does bad stuff"" to a quite terrible (and sometimes illegal) level. He possesses all kinds of psychological issues that you can think of plus some more. He says the most depressing, sad, offensive things to anyone that crosses his path. Pete Davidson absolutely shines in this role, it really feels like he's having an outstanding amount of fun. However, his character goes through such an overlong and exaggerated route that I could neither relate to nor feel sorry for him. This will make or break the film for any viewer: your emotional connection with the protagonist.As I said in the beginning, the narrative follows a pretty cliche story that people have seen thousands of times. So, from the get-go, it's fairly easy to understand where the movie is going, what's going to change within the characters, and how it's going to end. Screenplay surprises don't come often in this genre, and even when they do, very rarely, they're able to impact the audience in a way that completely changes our perspective on the film or its characters. The King of Staten Island is a movie that tells its viewers everything they need to know in the first ten to fifteen minutes, and then there's nothing remotely new throughout.It's just way too long. A bit over two hours seeing someone trying to figure out what he's going to do with his life is not exactly the best entertainment ever. There's more than one way to try to relate to Pete Davidson's character, but I really needed to dig deep to find one. As people probably know, Davidson's father was also a firefighter who died in the 9/11 attacks, and this film clearly takes inspiration from Davidson's life. It's not his biography, but he definitely puts a lot of his own personal issues into Scott's personality. Some people even state that he's just portraying himself, and that's not that far from the truth.In my opinion, the best aspect of the movie is undoubtedly the incredibly realistic dialogues. It genuinely feels like the characters are having real conversations. The editing is so impeccable that I forgot I was watching a film for a couple of moments. The chemistry between every member of the cast is so vibrant that every single dialogue between any two characters always feels extremely lifelike. Marisa Tomei and Bill Burr are astonishing, they truly are. I wish more time was given to develop a bit more of Bel Powley's personal subplot, but I understand that she's far from being one of the most relevant characters.In the end, The King of Staten Island employs a very well-known (and a bit overused) formula that goes on for way too long, but Judd Apatow balances it with a hilariously dark sense of humor, with the help of his co-writers, Pete Davidson and Dave Sirus. Most of the comedy really works, which helped to get through the least entertaining (and predictable) portions of the narrative. Davidson shines in a role that many addressed as ""he's just playing himself"", but I find him incredibly engaging and captivating to watch, even though I can't quite relate to his character. The emotional attachment to the protagonist is the major component that's either going to make you love this flick or spend a couple of hours just watching someone trying to figure out what to do with his life. The realistic dialogues (elevated by perfect editing) and the cast's phenomenal chemistry just tip the scale to the positive side. I definitely recommend it, but with the small warning that if you're not a fan of dark comedy, then it's better to skip this one.Rating: B-",The King of Staten Island

But for what it is, I thought it was a nice watch. I do however, have a couple of issues.I thought it was a bit too long. I think the first hour in particular, dragged and contained scenes that just didn't really need to be there. The main character was incredibly unlikeable during this time which emphasised due to the slowness. He massively improves and his arc is really good and fits well with the story. You just have to get through it. For a film that doesn't have a proper ending, again I feel is a bit too long of a film for that.Beyond that though, I thought it was a good story that evolved nicely. It contained a few laughs in there. Nothing side splitting or anything, but it added a bit more to an in depth plot about Scott and his troubles. Special mention to Bill Burr who I thought was actually excellent in his role. But yeah, glad I watched overall.",The King of Staten Island

All great movies have an amazing ending. Not this one.
So, overall a wasted opportunity because of timing, script and ending.",The King of Staten Island
46,PyroSikTh,"Aimless, Unsatisfactory, but Just Fine",6,25 November 2020,"King of Staten Island follows Scott (named after Pete Davidson's real father), a deadbeat stoner in his early twenties who lives with his mum, has dreams of becoming a tattoo artist, and brings the grief and trauma of his father's untimely death around with him everywhere. An untimely death that mirrors his own fathers, making this a somewhat autobiographical story by Davidson himself. And that's roughly it. As far as plot goes, King of Staten Island just aimlessly meanders around as plot points snowball and develop into new plot points. As an example a kid wanders out of the woods on to the beach Scott and his friends are hanging out on, and Scott tattoos a line on the kids arm before the kid bails. Of course the kids father comes knocking on his door, one thing leads to another, and the father and Scott's mother start dating. The kids father being a firefighter, like Scott's father, dregs up some unwanted feelings for Scott and he endeavours to sabotage their relationship. This gets him kicked out the house, so he has to find somewhere to live, eventually falling into the local fire department where he learns about camaraderie, responsibility, and caring for others. It's just a series of plot points turning into new plot points like seeing a dull butterfly effect in action.But what about the story? Plot and story are different things entirely, so what story is King of Staten Island wanting to tell through these plot points? Honestly, I'm not really sure. Is this meant to be a movie about grief and trauma? About the arrested development of a grown man-child? And to what end? I stuck with it to see if the answers would come to me in the movie's final moments as everything gets tied together, but it just ends without much resolution at all. In fact it feels like it ends just as we're about to get that kind of resolution. He learns about responsibility, how to care for others, and how to express himself to those close to him, but there's no implication that this will have long-lasting effects. Him bonding with a bunch of firefighters who worked with his father doesn't mean he'll become a firefighter. Him helping a random guy on the street who was stabbed doesn't mean he's going to go into the emergency services. Him professing his love for his on-off girlfriend doesn't mean they'll have much of a relationship. Him finally being able to talk to his mother about his fathers death doesn't necessarily mean he's come to terms with it. He still suffers from the ADD and Bipolar the traumatic event has given him. He's still homeless and jobless. In fact not a whole lot has changed for him between the start and the end of the movie. He's still largely spinning in the exact same spots he was before the movie started. So as the credits rolled, I was left with the feeling of ""what was the point of all that?""As I mentioned before, the comparison to Funny People is a pretty decent one to make. I remember back when that movie came out, it was heavily criticised for being too long and not funny enough, but that was kind of the point. It was about the misery and difficulties faced by comedians; that they're not all intrinsically happy people. King of Staten Island similarly prefers to focus on characters and the drama between them than on jokes and laughs. What jokes and comedy there are here are used to add flavour to the drama, rather than the other way round. There's some good ones for sure, such as Scott antagonising a white supremacist getting a tattoo, Steve Buscemi regaling unheroic stories about Scott's father to him, the choices and executions of some of Scott's tattoo work, and the dark humour of the various dead dad jokes.
However for the large part I felt like I just wasn't American enough, or worse not New-Yorker enough, to understand half the jokes. Jokes about comparing Staten Island to Brooklyn and New Jersey meant nothing to me, jokes about American sporting teams meant nothing to me. Hell even the super important closing detail of the entire movie was lost on me simply because I'm not from New York City (Scott gazing up at the building his father (and Davidson's own father) died in). It would be like if I made jokes comparing Soho to Battersea or Lewisham and just expecting everyone who isn't a Brit (or worse a Londoner) to understand how funny I am. All right, yeah, we do make those kind of regional jokes over here too, so King of Staten Island just obviously wasn't aimed at me in the same way Mock the Week isn't exactly a show to recommend to Americans. But when such a large portion of your comedy is so specifically regional, in a movie with obviously international reach and interest to it, something's gone amiss.In truth, I was entertained through almost the entire movie's runtime. The relationship between Scott and Kelsey is a definite high point, in the way that true, humanistic relationships always are in Apatow movies. You just can't but root for every character in this movie, even those as unlikeable as Ray, Ricky, and especially Scott himself. He's narcissistic, self-absorbed, pathetic, lazy, and shirks any amount of responsibility, and yet you can't help but feel sympathy for his character and hope he finds a way to turn his life around. Marisa Tomei, Bill Burr, and Steve Buscemi all give great performances as well. It just felt like a deeply unsatisfactory movie that lacked direction and didn't really have a whole lot to say. It dangled so many potentials, but didn't capitalise on any of them. I give King of Staten Island a just fine 6/10.",The King of Staten Island

Judd Apatow's most famous include ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (which I loved) and ""Knocked Up"", and the last before last, whole 5 years ago, was ""Trainwreck"", which I happened to catch on the big screen, it was okay but not a fan... This time around Apatow directs a story co-written with its standout star Pete Davidson, dedicated to his dad Scott Davidson, and quite heavily inspired by Pete's own life. Though not without its flaws, I can tell You ""The King of Staten Island"" is easily my favorite Judd Apatow piece since 2005.To most probably known as a member of SNL, now rising comic, actor and cool dude Pete Davidson is portraying Scott, a 24 year old who has been a case of ADD ever since his firefighter dad died when he was seven.

When some new characters enter his life, he is forced to grapple grief, trauma and take his first steps towards redemption. In real life, Pete Davidson's father was a firefighter who died in the line of duty, rescuing victims of the 9/11 attack. Cast member Steve Buscemi used to be a firefighter in the wake of the 80's, and returned to help on the day of the same tragedy.""The King of Staten Island"" is mainly a story about growing up, finding the good things, learning to accept those good things, and taking responsibility over one's life. There's genuine sentiment in its heart, which rests in just the right place, and it can also be legitimately funny. It's not structurally perfect, and can feel a little too scenic, focusing on the quality of separate sequences that do not add a lot of story. The big turning point starts manifesting itself as late as 100 minutes into the movie, and in the end the 2 hour and 17 minute runtime is a little too tall. Having said that, it is a dramedy that's never boring, always pleasantly amusing. This kind of plot, I believe, is pretty predictable by default, so enjoy the substitute, the always-present-low-key-charm. As a 23 year currently stuck in my hometown and great friends with Mary Jane, I felt like an appropriate audience member for ""The King of Staten Island"", and that's what I meant with ""relatable and wholesome"". Some might say that a big part of this movie isn't about a whole lot of anything, but I beg to differ, perhaps the idyllic view on such simplicities tells a lot.I think it's apparent Pete Davidson is a pivotal part of why the movie works so well. In what might very likely be his best performance to date, he plays a likeable, decent guy with a good heart and some troubles in it, plays him so authentically one could guess some of it comes from a place of past pain. But that's not it, the supporting cast delivers well above average performances as well - do not miss the chance to see Bill Burr in a bigger role and rocking an impressive moustache, and the female counterparts for both - Bel Powley and Marisa Tomei, anchor the balance perfectly.Judd Apatow is arguably one of Hollywood Heavyweights, making a film with a cast that don't fall back all that much, so the level of these ingredients resemble themselves also in every technical and aesthetical department. It's visually very well orchestrated, subtle and perfect in its simplicity, never once anything distracting catches the eye. Soundtrack has a couple of real nice tunes in it, of which one dear-to-my-heart nostalgia song ended the film, but I won't spoil it.Even now I wonder why not more, because I really, really dug it, but I believe that it deserves a good, flavorful, perhaps even memorable 7/10. I recommend it, well, just about everyone who's not too young for it, even one point of intrigue is enough.",The King of Staten Island
50,Lebowskidoo,Based on a Mostly True Story But Not Really,9,2 July 2020,"""If you have money, why would you ever live in Staten Island?""Not gonna lie, I wasn't sure if a movie starring Pete Davidson would be any good. I like him enough on SNL but he never seemed like leading man material to me. But who else could they have got to play, what is basically, a version of Pete Davidson? He's really exceptional in a movie that squeezes you in the feels and is awkwardly relatable on several levels.Davidson helped put this together, it's based on his own life. He seems like a goofball, and he is, but he makes you really care as well. Bill Burr is so good as the fireman dating his widowed mother, his best role yet. You get a bit of his stand up mixed with F Is For Family in this character. Marisa Tomei as the mother is believable and genuine. Director and co-writer, Judd Apatow, has combined all this and more to make a memorable dramedy that deserves to be seen, let's hope it reaches an audience in this strange year for new movies.",The King of Staten Island
51,Pukeonthestreet,He doesn't know why he's famous either,3,28 June 2020,I've been a huge fan of Judd's work I even liked Trainwreck when not being a fan of Amy Schumer. But this movie just didn't hit on any levels for me. I don't even think I laughed once. After seeing Judd's stand up it seemed like things went to his head but this movie proves that he might be on a downward slope.,The King of Staten Island
52,SnobReviews,A true home run for the cast and crew.,9,16 June 2020,"""The King Of Staten Island"" is seriously funny, moving and compelling. A hat trick that only the great Judd Apatow can pull off, alongside the help of Pete Davidson.
.
In this comedy-drama based on Pete Davidson's life, a young man must get his life together after his mom starts dating a new man; a firefighter like his deceased father.
.
I without a doubt loved this film. Those of you who know me know that I'm a huge fan of Apatow's, and ""The King Of Staten Island"" is a great addition to his filmography. Apatow is one of the only comedic directors that can really capture the humanity in comedy. He's able to make you laugh when necessary and make you feel something deeper at other instances. The star of this film is of course Pete Davidson. He bares his soul in this semi-autobiographical role, and he is so great. As the viewer, there is no way you won't fall in love with his character. Marisa Tomei and Bill Burr are surprisingly a perfect match, and their chemistry plays well off each other. Overall it's another win for Judd Apatow and true home run for Pete Davidson. One of the best films you'll see this year.

53,jamiedarlow-37510,Judd Apatow's warmest film since Knocked Up!,8,28 February 2021,"Scott Carlin (Davidson) is in his mid 20s; since his father died when he was little, he's found it very hard to get motivated and spends his time smoking weed while dreaming of being a tattoo artist. A culmination of events that happen during the course of the story force him to get up and discover what makes him happy and is important in life. It's without a doubt Apatow's most dramatically powerful production with some really subtle moments being the most memorable. Scott's monologue at a baseball stadium is pretty well done and just the interactions between everyone throughout are completely believable and make the whole thing all the more enjoyable. All the performances are wonderful; Scott's girlfriend Kelsey played by Bel Powley, his sister Claire played by Maude Apatow, his mother Margie played by Marisa Tomei and Ray played by Bill Burr are all spectacular. Although it is anchored by Davidson's great central character who is equally frustrating as well as entertaining, it's very much an ensemble cast which is where the magic happens. The only personal dispute I have is that Moises Arias is sorely underused as Scott's friend Igorr; he is a fantastic actor and it feels like his character has great development in the first half and then doesn't feature much afterwards. Nevertheless, it's a really great watch, a must see watch at home right now and holds a really beautiful final shot 😊",The King of Staten Island
54,fciocca,"A good finding: a simple family drama, well structured and entertaining",6,30 August 2020,"""The King of Staten Island"" is for sure worth a watch. It is a simple family drama. It tells about a trauma that Scott, the main character, never solved, but with time and meeting right people slowly he will heal. There is a really nice character development and you can see the gradual transformation from an irresponsible person, into a man that acknowledged the fact that is an adult and need to grow up, by stopping living in the past. The movie in fact is slow paced to appreciate this evolution, but in my opinion it was slightly too long. It would be perfect if it lasted 2 hours, the ending is a little bit dragged out.Cast is solid and I was surprised to see Steve Buscemi in this kind of production. Happy that such talented actor takes part to projects like this. The movie manages to tell about a trauma in a light-hearted, a perfect watch with family and friends.",The King of Staten Island
55,bryangary65,Royal entertainment,7,22 January 2021,Good comedy/dramaPete Davidson was very good with a decent support cast especially Bel Powley.,The King of Staten Island
56,dommercaldi,"The High Reviews Are Confusing, This Film Is Largely A Failure",4,21 August 2020,"Pros:
1. The humour, when it lands, produces some genuinely funny moments.
2. Both Bill Burr (Ray Bishop) and Pete Davidson (Scott Carlin) have fantastic chemistry together.
3. The score and soundtrack, even though it's nothing spectacular, provides a fun and lively feel.
4. The last 30 minutes become really enjoyable as Scott Carlin finally sees some character progression for the better, as well as concluding with a suitably uplifting tone.Cons:
1. Pete Davidson's performance is inconsistent, as at times it feels like he's forcing the intimate emotions. He's better when acting jovially, or nonchalantly.
2. Some of the comedy feels pointlessly inserted for cheap laughs, which mostly fails anyway.
3. The cinematography is incredibly flat and stale.
4. The plot device which sets up the third act is conveniently and idiotically placed, wherein Ray Bishop and Margie Carlin (Marisa Tomei) openly disparage Scott Carlin in front of him.
5. The relationship between Scott Carlin and Kelsey (Bel Powley) is boring, poorly developed, and takes up far too much screen-time.
6. The cameo of Machine Gun Kelly (Tattoo Shop Owner) is massively distracting because the entire scene is pointless, and thus it only revolves around shoving him into the film.
7. The character of Scott Carlin is unlikable and uninteresting as he is irresponsible, lazy, and pig-headed for the majority of the movie (1 hour and 40 minutes), and only sees some character progression in the last 30 minutes.",The King of Staten Island

60,zac-04879,A Simply Refreshing and Brilliant Comedy!,9,27 September 2021,"The King of Staten Island doesn't really achieve anything other than existing as an absolutely hysterical and entirely entertaining comedy-drama. It's nowhere near the type of film to be classifed as heavy or truly serious, but it involves some of Pete Davidson's actual struggles. Davidson, alongside Bill Burr and Marisa Tomei are simply brilliant in this film. Each of their performances are very lifelike and spot-on.However, you'll have forgotten about the cast's excellent work by the end of the film. Mainly because their roles are very realistic, but the rationality of it blends perfectly with the entire storyline and the whole setting. The plot revolves around a drug addict dealing with the loss of his father, whilst handling his mother's new firefighting partner. This film CANNOT be missed by Davidson's or Burr's biggest fans; their characters will engage and entertain everyone!Judd Apatow is also tireless when it comes to using each of the 136 minutes wisely. Every moment has either super-jolly laughs or touching issues, but never becomes boring. That's why it's satisfyingly saddening once the credits begin rolling. All of the characters and each of their appealing personalities are completely purposeful, the laughs are always replayable and there's a dazzling coming-of-age theme to it.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",The King of Staten Island

Nope!The lead actor has been funny as a sidekick in other stuff, but wow...never a lead.The movie droned on. Never got anywhere. It's like jersey boys met those guys who did stupid gray stunts like 10 years ago and threw it on filmIt has almost every supporting actor of years gone past thrown together. Expecting magic to happen. Sorry this is a rant but the movie is still going and going nowhere and pissing me off at time wasted",The King of Staten Island
63,mattiasflgrtll6,Heartwarmingly vulgar - Apatow at his best,9,28 July 2020,"Ever since his dad died in a firefighter incident, Scott's life hasn't managed to go anywhere. He spends every day smoking pot and talks about opening a tattoo resturant (but never follows through on it), plus has a case of ADD and Crohns disease. He also has to take care of his mother by himself when his sister goes away for college. But one day a seemingly minor event changes everything...Besides Judd Apatow's brand of humor, I didn't know what to expect from this film. Not a lot of interesting movies were playing in theaters, so I thought I might as well give this one a chance.I had never seen Pete Davidson in anything before this, but after his performance in this film I won't forget him. While at first Scott doesnt seem like much more than a crazy manchild, I really started to feel affectionate for the guy after a while. You laugh at his inappropriately timed comments and shortsighted decisions, but Davidson also portrays how his impulsive behavior makes him doubt his own selfworth, that maybe he's too stupid to ever reach any higher.The conflict that stirs up after his mom (superbly played by Marisa Tomei) hooks up with a new boyfriend doesn't feel cliché in any way. You understand Scotts worry once he learns hes not only someone he got off with on the wrong foot, but is also a firefighter just like his dad. His stubborn inability to give him a chance to the fear of going through another loss or the idea that she goes for the same type just as a vain replacement for his father feels justified.
We're shown Ray doesn't think highly of him either, judging by the conversation with Margie where he dismisses the tattoo resturant concept and thinks he'll never amount to anything. The fact that she doesn't even defend her son is even sadder, like there might be some truth in what he says.Since I mentioned Ray, I should also talk about Bill Burr. Even though his face looked familiar, not once did I recognize that was him since he completely disappeared into the character. He walks the line between likable and kind of arrogant, which is hard to pull off, but he manages to do so perfectly.But while the movie does get heavy, it's also hilarious much of the time. Not just Davidson, but also Burr, Tomei, Pamela Adlon, Steve Buscemi and the actors playing Scott's friend circle get moments to shine in terms of comedy. At times silly, other times deadpan, the humor always feel natural to the characters and progression of the story. It feels very ""hangout"" in terms of tone, where you are just observing these people sharing laughs and poking fun at each other. Additionally, there are times where it can get uncomfortable and funny at the same time, most of those momens owed to Davidson.Apatow's daughter Maude does a very good job as Scott's sister Claire. She's kind of a regular in his films, but this is her most memorable part so far.Does the plot take expected turns? Sure. Every relationship gets a happy ending, everyone gets along in the end (except for Ray and his ex-wife Gina) and even Igor's potential catfish girlfriend is actually real. But none of that matters as long as you're having a good time, which I certainly did.The King Of Staten Island isn't Apatow's most serious film (that would be Funny People), but I do think it's his most sincere. Whether you know who Pete Davidson is or not, I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a good laugh along with engaging characters.",The King of Staten Island
64,helenahandbasket-93734,Much potential-too bad,2,3 August 2020,"What an hilarious waste of a solid script-Davidson, despite his confidence in his abilities-is not strong enough to carry a movie.This could have been great with Andy Samberg in the lead.

65,Dragonsouls,"Despite the technical imperfections, I still consider this a great movie",9,15 June 2020,"The King of Staten Island has some issues, mostly having to do with tonality. The film is classified as a comedy but it delves into some very serious human issues, and every so often the acting goes from serious to comedic. I think the humor was great in this film, I laughed numerous times but the humor should be introduced when it should and not moments after a street fight for example.Thank goodness it barely happens in the film but it does from time to time and it feels like the film has two separate tones to it. Minor gripes aside, the script was fantastic. It's heartfelt and very human. I loved this film more because I was raised on Staten Island and still live here and that many moments of the film reminded me of when I was in my 20s, living a similar life to this movie's protagonist. Despite my bias, it's a film that everyone seems to be enjoying and I'm glad! I hope Pete Davidson gets the career he deserves. He's a natural. His humor is dry, and sneaky, and he's likely to be consdered the next Adam Sandler.",The King of Staten Island

The movie is very human but at the same time it has fun things that work well. The things that do not work is that in the second part of the film the plot is lengthened a bit and the end is left to interpretation and does not reveal what follows for the main character.It works very well as a comedy and is very realistic in terms of the writing of the characters, they feel real as the situations that each of them go through.",The King of Staten Island

73,rmmil,Decent with a few flaws,6,15 June 2020,"Considering I am squarely in the camp of ""Pete Davidson cannot act"" (watch him try to say any lines on SNL, this guy definitely benefits from the multiple takes available to movie actors), me rating this film as highly as I have is saying something.The film itself is semi-biographical of Pete's own life, although it (surprisingly) excises the fact that Pete's real dad died on 9/11, although I'm guessing this was due to timing (this film was set in modern day, although the ""real"" Pete would've been living on Staten Island (as portrayed) in the 00's).What follows is a pretty by-the-numbers ""coming-of-age"" tale, despite the ""real"" connection, it's no different than many ""loser finds purpose"" stories that have been told a million times before.However, the story itself is told in a truly heartfelt way, and there are some minor laughs, so it's not a complete waste.2 points of contention:1) As much as I make fun of Pete's acting, in comparison to the woman playing his sister, Maude Apatow (the director's daughter), Pete is Tom Hanks, because she simply cannot act, her Staten Island ""accent"" is so thick and overdone it's painful to listen to. This trend of directors casting their no-talent kids in films (I'm looking at you, Kevin Smith), needs to stop. Yay for nepotism!2) The film could've used some heavy handed editing, it definitely didn't need to be nearly as long as it was. Judd Apatow is famous for making very long comedies, but I don't think some of the scenes really add anything to the film, in the end. They just drag.Is this film ""worth"" seeing? Yes. Paying the full price theater-to-home streaming option? Probably not. Wait until it's free on Netflix, would be my suggestion.",The King of Staten Island

Pete Davidson and Bill Burr are easily the best parts about this film. I've never been a huge fan of Davidson but he really fits here. Burr brings his usual funny attitude here but shows a more sympathetic and kindhearted side which is nice to see. The biggest issue with this film is the screenplay. It feels like the first draft which means some of the dialogue is pretty rough. Some of the characters dialogue feels awkward and unnatural. I definitely would have enjoyed this film more if they had spent more time on the screenplay. The film is also about 30 minutes too long and that's a complaint I've heard about a lot of Judd Apatow movies. A lot of moments could have either been cut out or just shortened.

The biggest question was if Pete Davidson can carry the lead and after a few minutes you know he definitely can. His performance is very natural. And don't downplay that by saying he is basically playing himself because I have seen a lot of people fail at that big time. For his first movie he gives a very strong performance.Even though they wisely chose to give him a very good supporting cast. Pamela Adlon is always great and Bel Powley was great ever since she did Carrie Pilby and Marisa Tomei is likable as always. But the real gravitas of course is given by Steve Buscemi.

To make matters interesting, his single mom starts an affair with a local firefighter Ray with plans of marriage and that makes Scott mad too.

This gives him peace and the impetus to make peace with his mom, future dad, sister and girlfriend.Director Judd Apatow has given a free flowing narrative to the film and all actors have acted well particularly Pete Davidson as the central character. The film's 2 hour 16 minutes duration could have been trimmed by around 30 minutes to give it a smarter look, though it doesn't bore you at any time now.",The King of Staten Island
89,jeromesgabilo,INSIGHTFUL AND FUNNY,7,16 August 2021,"Pete Davidson did a good job portraying a troubled young adult. It showed an in-depth look into a struggling person in a big town that seemed struggling as well. Although, the story was cut short in the end and the pacing was a bit slow, the scenes are interesting and decently funny.",The King of Staten Island
90,tyesonbebee,Watched it for free,1,7 April 2021,"And I feel like I paid to much. Pete is just not funny he isn't even on the level of getting a movie, he is barley on SNL. Adam Sandler now their is an Actor. I feel like Pete only gets sympathy roles if you notice he always gots to throw in there my dad died. Give me one iconic character he has even made for SNL. Anyways Bill Burr and the other cast members were hilarious but unfunny Pete ruined it. Ok thanks byeeeeee.",The King of Staten Island
91,cableaddict,"Starts juvenile, ends boring.",3,14 August 2020,"Judd Apatow strikes again. He's evidently very good at writing juvenile humor (I can't stand most of his work, but lots of people seem to think it's hilarious, for some reason, so I'll give him that.) In this movie, he seems to be trying to write something serious, and his apparent internal-struggle is painful to watch.
Unlikeable characters, A near-meaningless plot, and a lead actor character that you just want to punch in the face. Seriously, I wanted to punch this guy in the face even more than I want to punch Shia LaBouf in the face, every time he's on screen, and I REALL want to punch Shia in the face.
Avoid this movie, unless you just need background noise while you do your taxes, or the laundry. It's meaningless, depressing, and immediately forgettable.",The King of Staten Island
92,TheCasualReviewer,Pete Davidson is comedy gold,7,15 June 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Scott (Pete Davidson) is a 24-year old living at home having trouble figuring out what he wants to do in life other than sit comfortable and smoke weed. After his mom starts dating Ray (Bill Burr), Scott is forced to start figuring out his life.REVIEW:
I knew that I was going to like this movie due to it being Pete Davidson and honestly it felt like something he really needed to get out. A film for himself to vent. If you know Pete Davidson, you know he's had his fair share of mental struggles and it was clear he was lost for a while. This gives fans like myself a look into how his life was and what he struggled with. As far as aspects of the film, I'm not so sure why there was a choice to change the story of how his father died, maybe it wouldn't have meshed well with the rest of the film (which then I'd totally agree with the change) or maybe because 9/11 is a touchy subject. That could've been a decision on Universal's part, I'm not sure. I thought the acting was really good. Obviously, from Marisa Tomei, but I was really surprised with how well Bill Burr did. I thought he played the role as Ray, perfectly. Then you had some smaller roles like Bel Powley as Kelsey and Maude Apatow as Claire who had very wonderful performances. It's funny, however, that for some reason I feel like Pete Davidson... didn't act too well. Crazy to think since he was literally playing himself and so it's quite possible that it was a perfect performance, but some notions just didn't seem genuine. Maybe that's exactly how he is and if that's how he is in private than he was spectacular. He did give a good representation that he may not always know where he's going in life, but he truly has a kind heart and it's a very passionate person. This film was a good watch with a lot of funny moments and with maybe a slightly slow moving act two, but regardless it's a recommend from me. 7.4/10.",The King of Staten Island

94,lakishaferguson21,Could watch multiple times,7,27 August 2020,I'm more familiar with Pete's movies because I don't watch much SNL anymore. However I'm a fan of his brand of comedy as well as many of Apatow's. It was definitely worth the Redbox purchase. It wasn't uproariously funny because it matched the level of drama. My favorite scene was the pharmacy robbery because it was the perfect mix of seriousness and humor. Nice casting too (must be nice to be related to Apatow he always has his wife of kids in his movies). I would most certainly watch this again!,The King of Staten Island
95,waltermwilliams,Black Comedy,7,21 July 2020,"Director & Co-writer Judd Apatow may be The King of Staten Island, but he still needs to learn how to edit.
At 2 hours 16 min this movie tends to drag on for about 30 minutes too long.
We all need a good laugh in 2020 and this movie delivers in spades, if you like black comedy.
Luckily I do and can't enough of this smart, dry wit also co-written by the films star Pete Davidson.
He carries this semi auto biographical movie brilliantly.
Playing Scott the son of a fire fighter who died on the job, just like his real life dad did in 9/11.
He's an aspiring tattoo artist with big dreams of opening a themed Restaurant/Tattoo Parlour.
The guy knows what he's doing he's googled it and no ones done it before...for good reason.
It's comedy with heart, but not in a sickly sweet way.
Watch out for: Steve Buscemi, Bill Burr and Marisa Tomei

96,Pistol219,A New Generation SNL Star,10,16 June 2020,"To make this simple, I believe Pete Davidson is a great actor and seems to be able to transition his comedy with real life.

98,alanhowden-86367,What was that?,4,22 October 2021,For me this really missed the mark. As a coming of age comedy/drama it's way too cutsey and uncomplicated and as much as I think Pete Davidson is alright in SNL he seems way too old to be the main character in this (what might work for a teenager doesn't when you cast someone who is 26 and looks at least that).,The King of Staten Island

102,Opinate,more comedy less tragedy please,5,15 June 2020,"I was looking forward to this release knowing it was a Judd Apatow pic. We need some laughs and levity in this time. I sat through the first third or so waiting for the funny that never came. The movie had a few chuckles but soon descended into unremitting self pity as the lead character whined and moaned about how hard his life was even though he did absolutely nothing to stop the downfall. His problems were everyone else's to solve. This situation could have been good fodder for humor, but the jokes never came.When Bill Burr appeared I thought 'alright! here we go!' but his talents as a comedian were never utilized and anyone could have played his character.The acting is good, but story lines like the best friends that seemed to be so important to the main character in the beginning are just dropped. Did this a-hole just let his best pals rot and the one friend's cat die? Why put that into the movie if you don't ever mention it again?I found the main character to be a disgusting waste of time through most of the film but in the end was glad just to see him put some effort into something...anything! Of course he had to be practically forced into it.I guess the message is that everyone around you needs to pull you up so that you can have a fruitful life. Not a message I want to see rewarded. We all have troubles - life's hard - but the only way out is to work through it. I don't know why Judd Apatow thought it worth boring and annoying his audience with this guy. Even his family had had enough of him when we meet him.The acting is great from supporting characters, and especially the firehouse guys and Marisa Tormei, but in particular, Bel Powley who is a real bright spark in a fairly bleak movie. Although God knows why she loves this guy.Give this a miss if you think you are getting a comedy, or even a tragicomic film. If you want to see an entire community pull together to help a guy who can't be bothered to put in a modicum of effort into his own life while he pulls the energy out of everyone around him, this is a film for you!",The King of Staten Island

I saw a lot of good acting from Pete Davidson, Bel Powley, and Marisa Tomei. However, the story could have a single flow. Don't get me wrong. This movie worth watching. However, the story is changing direction and you become lost in which direction it goes next. The story is happening in different locations. I liked the background music. There are lessons to learn from the story. In summary, I recommend watching this movie to comedy and drama fans.",The King of Staten Island

105,PeachesIR,"Pleasantly surprised by Davidson, the story, tone",8,17 March 2021,"I have never been a Pete Davidson fan, and when I've seen him on SNL in recent years, I never thought he was funny--or I thought maybe I was too old to find his comedy style appealing. I did feel sympathy for him, as I know he has dealt with depression in recent years. I think ""The King of Staten Island"" taps into this, and Pete's lead character, Scott, seems closely based on his own experiences. Davidson co-wrote the screenplay; Judd Apatow directs. The film is polished and features a solid cast of veteran actors (Marisa Tomei, Steve Buscemi, Bill Burr) to support the young star.Like Davidson, Scott's father was a firefighter who died when he was a young boy. Scott seems lost and aimless; he smokes a lot of pot; has an awkward on-and-off relationship with a neighborhood girl; and he doesn't know what to do with his life, other than possibly becoming a tattoo artist. He has artistic talent. Scott resents that his widowed mother has begun seeing a divorced firefighter, and the two men clash.""The King of Staten Island"" felt very relatable and authentic, and it focuses on a subject that has been overlooked by Hollywood in recent years---the ""forgotten"" working- or lower-middle class white young men searching for some meaning in their lives, some direction and purpose. Many, like the main character here, turn to drugs because they really don't know what else to do.Scott's firefighter father died in the line of work--just as Davidson's firefighter father died on 9/11. He needs a father figure, a male role model -- and our society seems to scoff at this idea these days. Staten Island is a typical middle-class/working-class, mostly white/Italian/Irish sort of community where the residents are hard-working, family-oriented people, but nothing like the glitzy, snooty hipsters a ferry ride away in Manhattan or Brooklyn. There used to be so many great American movies about people just like Scott and his family--""Working Girl,"" ""Nobody's Fool"" and ""Beautiful Girls"" just off the top of my head. Recently, Hollywood seems uninterested in their stories. Yet Scott's story seems universal.The most inspiring scenes in ""The King of Staten Island"" take place in the firehouse where Scott's father once worked. The firefighters are white and black, male and female, and they all work and eat and laugh together as a sort of family. Here, we see the beating heart of community, and we see the value of hard work and service. Buscemi was a NYC firefighter in real life, another element that lends ""The King of Staten Island"" authenticity.Davidson does a fine job in a comic/dramatic starring role as a lost, goofy, horny young guy who doesn't really know how to take the next steps to becoming a man. He may be playing himself in many ways, but his performance hits the mark. Overall, a very touching, inspiring movie that you should watch.",The King of Staten Island

111,cartsghammond,Worth a watch,8,12 June 2020,"I have followed Judd and Pete's careers pretty closely so naturally I was exited to see this movie. I wanted to see it in theaters but renting it for 20 dollars in my living room was my only option for now.Pete has proved himself to be a funny guy and a competent actor, and even though he's playing a similar character to his role in Big Time Adolescence, this is a big step forward in his career.I think this movie will probably receive criticism for not being as funny as some of Judd Appatows other movies, but I don't think this movie was aiming for a the same thing as Superbad and The 40 year old virgin. Judd often talks about how the key to making a good comedy is to make a good drama and add humor to it, this is the perfect example.Pete's story is intriguing and feels completely worthy of a movie like this. Some people wanting a non stop laugh fest maybe not like it, and it does have flaws, but I really enjoyed it.This is probably Judds best movie in 10 years.

It's over two hours of disgusting, meaningless banter, none of which is remotely humorous or entertaining, performed by perhaps the ugliest bunch of wannabe actors (or over the hill, as with poor Steve Buscemi, who has never said ""No"" to being on screen) ever assembled.I made I through the extended scene involving the abuse of a nine-year-old child, lost in the forest looking for a friend, but lured by a bunch of lowlife stoners into submitting to having his arm tattooed. That action sets the plot in motion, and by calling it a ""plot"" I am giving it undue credit for its totally unnecessary existence.Once that was cleared up - after about 37 minutes - I began to fast-forward. I never found anything on which to linger, but I gave it its rightful chance until the credits started to roll.I have enjoyed some of Apatow's work, but then he had some excellent actors: Steve Carrell and Seth Rogen at the top of the list.

Every Judd Apatow movie I watch there's this sweet spot I hit where I'm in absolute love with it, but then I realize there's still 45 minutes left and I'm scratching my head on why he it insists for things to keep going. That's really the only negative thing I can say about this movie otherwise I honestly loved it. I feel how personal this story is to Pete Davidson and he gives such a real and genuine performance that doesn't feel sappy but doesn't feel fake either. When we deal with grief, we look to the things that help articulate our feelings and for me that's looking to art, this spoke to me on that level really profoundly. Davidson has a really dark sense of humor but you realize that's how he copes with tragedy and I really respect him for that. This movie was genuinely heartfelt, funny, and human. Even if the plot wasn't moving fast, I felt engaged strictly based on the character interactions and that's worth a praise in my book. Apatow knows how to write people and make them feel real so that's very present here, but man just edit the films down a tad, there's no reason for his movies to go above 2 hours, not for me at least. The King of Staten Island is a true reminder of what it means to cope with grief, pursue what you love, and find the good moments in the little things, it's absolutely one of my favorite movies of the year so far, even if it runs a little overlong in length. 8/10.",The King of Staten Island

The characters were excellent and well casted. Pete Davidson and his posse were great. The best part about Pete Davidson's character was his character arc. Bill Burr did an excellent job despite not being the comic relief and his character src is very well done. The story was good as well. It was funny at times yet dramatic and heartwarming at other times. And the film had a good message. But with any film there is the bad.
Luckily the list of things that are bad about this film aren't too long. You could tell the budget was slim considering the lack of depth when it came to the sets and a large number of B list actors. This didn't make the film suffer too much, but those better actors would've been better in those dramatic situations.

Stoner movies with a real plot. This is also a stoner movie but not at the same time. It's about a stoner, but it's really about a guy who's lost because he lost his dad at a young age. Its autobiographical in that sense as it is Davidson's life and his dad died as a firefighter on 9/11 something that drew him in real life to weed and suicidal thoughts. The movie is heartfelt and cast well, feeling like a family and people from staten island. I liked it, funny, intelligent, and subdued. A welcome film after crap movies like trainwreck and this is 40.",The King of Staten Island
137,krisnadexter,On The Pursuit Of Happiness,7,31 July 2021,"With name like Pete Davidson, Bill Burr, and directed by Jude Apatow I was hoping to watch movie with big laugh. But no, this isn't a full comedy movie. Yes there are jokes here, but this movie is way deeper. It deals with your feeling.Maybe you're not a person with condition like Scott (Pete Davidson). But you'll feel he's relatable. He's just a person who's trying to find his way. To figure out what to do in life. Regardless of his own obstacles.The movie is a bit slow, but it's worthed in the end. The actors and actresses is good at their work. And I love the music, the soundtrack On The Pursuit Of Happiness by Kid Cudi really fits the theme of the movie.",The King of Staten Island
138,ratpackaustin,More real than you expect,8,3 February 2021,"Pete Davidson's semi autobiographical movie is not the dirty, empty, humor packed event you think it's going to be. I was surprised to see just how real it was in the way it dealt with heavy subjects, and how people use humor to deflect those topics and cope. As someone who does this a lot it caught me off guard to see a movie that's basically made about it, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Davidson has great performance here a does Bill Burr and Steve Buscemi. This movie isn't a Hollywood production in how those feel mostly forced. This movie really just seems like a camera crew follows Davidson around in his real life. I dig it",The King of Staten Island
139,hosenoggin,Surprisingly Good,8,25 June 2020,"Pete Davidson, usually too stoned on SNL for us to take seriously, is surprisingly good in this film. Great cast and warm hearted story lends to a delightful movie that I thought was just going to be another teen stoner juvenile comedy.... which is how it starts.... but morphs into something better.",The King of Staten Island
140,rachbruno,It's worse than a really bad movie because it thinks it's good,2,16 June 2020,"It's as if every actor here is in a different movie. They are different levels and you can feel it. The writing and story are okay, but there is such a lack of cohesiveness. It's very strange and the effect is a very uneven, unwatchable movie.",The King of Staten Island
141,helghast-1337,"Better than expected, worth a watch and definitely relatable",7,13 June 2020,"Not really a fan of Pete Davidson prior to this film and frankly still not a fan of him after it, but I respect his transformation in this movie. If you don't know (which at this point, I'm not sure how you couldn't) Pete's real dad was FDNY and died on 9/11. Whether or not he was able to use this to catapult his comedic career is something I don't know, but I never found him particularly funny. When he first got to SNL I thought he was going to be the next Andy Samberg, but his appearances seemed to fizzle and he was often relegated to doing pre-recorded bits on the show. It made me a little sad because I think his potential was and is wasted at SNL but perhaps it's one of those situations where they can't really fire him due to FDNY connections. I know it sounds kinda conspiracy theory-ish but those are my personal thoughts.Now back to this film. I absolutely hated the first 30-45 minutes and was regretting my decision to watch the film, but I eventually finished it and I actually thought it was a decent story about personal transformation, something I definitely could relate to. Seeing the cherry picked reviews about how it was so funny and Apatow's best film are now confusing as it is neither hilarious or Apatow's best, but still very good. If you're like me and think the first half of the movie is awful, just hang in there and finish it. Everything comes together at the end so the beginning of the movie doesn't seem as awful as it is.",The King of Staten Island
142,unkommon,Charming Though not Particularly Compelling,7,7 April 2021,"Admittedly, right off the bat, I dislike Pete Davidson as a person and as an actor, and was expecting to have that bias persist throughout my viewing experience. That said, Davidson's acting was very enjoyable and well done.The film itself is perhaps Apatow at the peak of his craft, it has the maturity of Funny People, but somehow feels more refined and honest. It may be his best work as director yet (although his best work as writer is probably 40 Year Old Virgin.) Likewise, it boasts a solid script, that manages to feel human even when it becomes particularly cheesy.The acting is all-around great. No one would have taken Bill Burr for a solid dramatic actor who doesn't need constant comedic relief, but he does well. Tomei is stellar, as always, and Maude Apatow is truly showcased as a varied actress here.All-in-all, while it is a charming film that has a solid cast and script, it isn't the most compelling, there is no character that is particularly relatable or draws much sympathy. While it may be easy to feel bad for Scott and hope to see him succeed, it is not the driving force of the film it wishes it were. 6.5/10.",The King of Staten Island
143,AnonymousFilmLover26,"Seriously, one of the best I've seen in a long time!",9,18 June 2020,"What is there to say about ""King of Staten Island"", besides the fact that I found it excellent...? Weird as it may be, it made me want to explore Staten Island, honestly.Really. I'm only familiar with Pete Davidson through his stint on SNL. So, knowing what I know about his brand of comedy, I was expecting to be entertained; if also a little weirded out.
I'm pleased to say, I found this to be even better than I had expected. The trailer paints ""Staten Island"" as a quirky/sentimental dramedy, which I think is a totally refreshing light for Pete Davidson. He's kind of kooky, foul-mouthed and inappropriate, but he's got heart, and he brings his own personal history to this movie.
""King of Staten Island"" is R rated, and has that casual indie vibe, but I would've expected a lot more graphic content here, given the fact it's a Judd Apatow project. Instead, we are treated to a good helping of sincerity, and soul: a beautiful surprise.I fully expect Pete Davidson to book some more major roles now; after this truly affecting gem!",The King of Staten Island

148,Tony_Fresh_Reviews,Movie in Summary: Great,8,13 June 2020,"This movie was a great time, although it took a little while to get going. It was a very funny, very heartfelt coming-of-age story that showcases Pete Davidson's acting ability. With the added context of Davidson's past and how personal this is to him, you appreciate the movie so much more for how raw, honest and genuine it feels. Maybe it crosses the line a couple times and feels a little unfocused, but I had a really fun time with it.Recommended for: Fans of Pete Davidson, fans of coming-of-age dramedies, or fans of really bad tattoo ideas.",The King of Staten Island
149,zsietsma,Heartwarming Movie with Good Laughs,9,12 December 2020,"I have never been that big of a fan for Pete Davidson but watching this movie really got me to see how funny and competent an actor he really is. He seems to really feel like his characters he plays and that's probably because the characters he plays have been pretty identical to who he is as a person.Although this movie is not a typical Judd Apatow movie where it is full of hilarious scenes that make you bust out laughing the whole time, it still has it's good laughs from time to time. The story is very intriguing, keeps you engage, while also having feelings for the main characters.Overall I would say this is one of Judd Apatow's best works from a theatrical standpoint as it has a good blend between comedy and drama. Overall score would be a 87/100.",The King of Staten Island

It's light but deep; spontaneous and effortless- better than other Academy nominated films. This one definitely deserves one. Congrats,The King of Staten Island
153,royalewithcheese2020,"Not perfect, but doesn't pull any punches",8,13 June 2020,"Some people will describe this basically as a ""what could have been"" narrative about Pete Davidson's life if he ended up as an adult stoner with no purpose in life and still living at home. I felt it was also a bit more than that though. I think the semi-biographical approach to the movie was a good call. It definitely has some laugh out loud moments. It can also be dramatic and touching at times. There's also a bit of coming-of-age thrown in there as well.As for the acting, despite what people say about Pete Davidson and his comedy, I actually thought his acting was pretty spot on in this. The lovely Marisa Tomei is excellent as usual and Bill Burr brings quite a few laughs to the table, as well as Steve Buscemi in a small role with one in particular impactful scene that Steve nails.It's definitely far from a perfect movie. The editing could have been done better, some plot holes, and probably 30 minutes too long. On the other hand, it didn't seem to strike a false cord one single time. All of the characters seemed real to life and the actions they took weren't far-fetched or overly dramatic which is a relief to see.Overall, if you enjoy Pete's dark sense of humor combined with Bill Burr's comedy along with a solid supporting cast in addition to a movie that pays tribute to those who gave and still give their lives to save others everyday, then I'd say you'll have a positive and enjoyable experience with this one.",The King of Staten Island

I was surprised by Bill Burr's acting chops. He's not an accomplished actor, but played his role perfectly. The casting of Steve Buscemi was perfect since he's a firefighter IRL, having worked for a department during the 9/11 terror attack.I didn't get Scott's friend's, though. They seemed phony and poorly written, but they were non-factors for the second half of the movie.Overall, a pleasant movie.

Definitely could have done without Judd Apatow casting his daughter again. Which is just a bit better than casting his wife. Feel like his daughter should have to work for her roles instead of just being privileged and getting them handed to her by her father. Think of all the young actresses that lost out on a decent role because Judd wants his daughter to act. Went on bit of a rant but I'm tired of these director/producers shoe horning their kids in.,The King of Staten Island

Instead, we get a film about someone who had a tragedy in his life and in turn makes those around him miserable.Others have panned this movie for bad acting, but I thought the acting was fine. Pete Davidson did a really good job at portraying a selfish, washed-up stoner. But I kept waiting for him to turn things around and make something of his life through hard work and choices of his own. This never came around and it felt more like he was forced to make something of his life because of the efforts of others around him.",The King of Staten Island

I'm reluctant to use the word ""heartwarming"" because that sounds so corny and cliche - but it IS heartwarming without being corny.

169,Samual-M,10/10,10,17 June 2020,"Judd Apatow dramatizes the tragedy/comedy of Pete Davidson's past history - and ongoing - thoughtfully. It's an interesting exercise to explore a life that is well-known and I applaud Apatow's effort to squeeze as much from this story as he did. That's also a credit to the cast he assembled, that being Marasia Romei, Bill Burr and Maude Apatow. Davidson's vulnerability is on full display but his charm is prime reason you feel comfortable watching.A few scenes drag on a bit too long with awkward dialogue when it should've been paced better according to how interesting what they were talking about was. That's my only complaint: that it could've been a streamlined two-hour movie without characters explaining every moment three times over. That usually detracts the drama.I like Judds directing of the dramatic moment when Scott decides not to forgo his friends botched robbery but still maintaining the comedy aspect. The music and close-up on Davidson's face was an impressive turning point in his character arc.The best moment is the realization Scott has when other people with equally life-altering problems somehow have an equilibrium that he's missing. That was a positively unexpected lesson and one that showed him despite his serious problems, he can function like anyone else.",The King of Staten Island

I feel that the reason for this, unfortunately, is because Hollywood and casual viewers have been brainwashed by decades of how a movie ""must"" be formatted. I don't want another neatly packaged, happy, unrealistic swamp monster...This movie was damn good. I never felt i was losing the plot because, in the best way possible, there really isn't one. Its a story with many sub-plots and quite simply, a linear story with insight into FDNY (or all FD) culture, what it is to be a Man, strong Woman, black/white... and like most movies with top comedians, the idea that gender and race roles really have no impact on our daily lives.I am totally fine with The extra run time; it really added to the fun.

179,poohead45,Wanted to like it more,6,13 June 2020,"I have never seen anything with Pete Davidson....i have only seen headlines of him with hot actresses Instagram and people making fun of his looks. Tbh, I can see his charm under the facade.I thought that the movie would be ""more"" than what it was. It seemed like if it went a bit deeper it would have been more heartfelt.I loved the interactions with the children. It was pretty cute.There was absolutely no chemistry between Pete's character and the ""love interest.""
It didn't even seem like he was remotely interested in her, treated her like a friend that he had sex with only (didn't even seem like he enjoyed having sex with her either)... But by the end he said he loved her? (I think? By the end I was getting bored and playing on my phone) I didn't really buy that at all. Plus, the girl seemed pretty pathetic to put up with it and Then keep trying to get attention when he just didn't respond to it. But then he loved her and was scared?
Boyfriend material right there! LololAnyway, back to the real plot of Scott's issues with dealing with his father's death in 9/11. That really sounds like a good storyline but it just stays too shallow for me to really care. And I wanted to care more. I wanted to cry I felt at sad... But I didn't! I cry at everything I watch these days but not this.. I know it's a truly Heartfelt to me when I get all choked up and/or cry.I did laugh a few times but this movie either needed to be more funny or more sad or both.
Ie Ricky Gervais's Afterlife - I laughed, I cried... It was heartfelt. Or Schitt's Creek.. I laughed, I cried, it was heartfelt.
This movie I laughed a little.Also, why does Staten Island seem like it's in the wrong decade?
Marisa Tomei looked like she was in the early 80s with that hair and the glasses. I honestly didn't even recognize her at first. That hair cut was god awful!
She's hot... She just played Aunt Mae in Spiderman and was super hot...
And in this I could not get passed the haircut.Also, that guy Ray seemed weird and I agreed with Scott that his mother should not date him!
First, I knew he would be back to hit on her because she said her husband was dead. (predatory behavior in my opinion)
Then he makes Scott take his kids to school after Scott tattooed his son. Ray does not notify his ex wife or the school that a strange man would be doing this. That's bizarre to me.
Also, he lied to Marisa Tomei that he was living in the fire house. Also weird.
To me, he was manipulative and trying to worm his way into her house to have a place to stay and having Scott be kicked out.
Not cool, Ray!I guess there's a happy ending? I honestly don't remember today. (I saw it last night)
It was too long for not that much going on in the plot.But, I sorta like Pete Davidson now.This did not seem like a Judd Apatow movie aside from having his daughter in this playing Scott's sister. (she's not that great of an actress but she's beautiful at least)",The King of Staten Island

182,The-MacMahonian,Born to Lose,8,13 September 2020,"The King of Staten Island is the 5th feature film directed by Judd Apatow, singular and sparse sex comedy author whose previous Trainwreck (2015) was reviewed in these pages August 24th 2015.The King of Staten Island tells the story of Scott (Pete Davidson, who also co-wrote the reportedly semi-autobiographical script), 24 and still living with Mom in the eponymous borough, a loser of Lerean proportions hell-bent on living up to Bart Simpson's ""underachiever and proud of it"" motto, wasting time away with a group of outcast nerd friends - or what for Staten Island standards might actually be perfectly normal people - and half-noncommitting to nice girlfriend Kelsey (Maude Apatow, the director's daughter, remind me sometime to expand on nepotism in Hollywood). Scott does have ADHD and Crohn's desease, which he uses both as excuse and badge of honour to dodge even the remotest opportunities to ""straighten up"".The Staten Island connotation may not register fully outside the Big Apple. Think sub-suburban no man's land, a 15 minute ferry ride to Manhattan but for all you know you could be in North Dakota. Apatow, to his credit, brings it to life, or rather lets it live, as he does Scott, who carries on with aloof and amused indifference to all who don't realise there is nothing wrong with him being who he is.

His sister is going to college and his deceased dad was a hero-firefighter, this resulting in putting even more pressure onto him to do something important. His dream is to become a tattoo artist, but things just don't seem to work out for him (he's also lacking human canvas to practice on ;-) ). Because of him failing to find a human canvas, he decides to tattoo a random 8 year old boy in the woods; but he doesn't get further than a single line. This leads to the boys dad visiting their house and getting into a relationship with the wannabe-tattoo-artists mother. The problem here is; his mothers new 'boyfriend' is a firefighter too, he puts more pressure on the guy, and acts like he's trying to fill in the 'father-role-gap' which the family was missing. All this results in a hot mess filled with prejudices about each others current and past lifestyle.The King Of Staten Island has a very clear message; never judge a book by its cover. It's all about being open, supporting each other and giving people a chance to prove themselves. Where tattoos can seem to give off a 'dangerous' vibe, they can also be seen as the clearest and most functional way of communication there is. The movie tackles the differences between people in the way they express themselves; where our main character is very (negatively) outspoken and filled with tattoos - his mothers new boyfriend is the complete opposite (acting very positive and has 0 tattoos). The truth is they both kinda suck(ed) in life, but they communicate it to the outside world in a very different way, leading to frustration between the two.Openness and communication is key in life, it brings opportunity and chances. The way you choose to communicate (for example through tattoos) is up to you, as long as you don't judge people for not expressing themselves in the same way (our main character for example surrounds himself with people who are just like him, rather than spending time with his mom or sister who really care about him but express themselves in a different way).The King Of Staten Island talks about these subjects in a very exciting, funny and entertaining way. It knows what its going for and doesn't try to be more than it is. It basically succeeds in what it's trying to achieve. It has a few scenes which eventually go nowhere and have 0 purpose, but they didn't bother me that much. Don't expect top notch acting or an amazing story, just a decent enjoyable movie!",The King of Staten Island
185,silverturquoise,Being Pete,9,14 June 2020,"While it must be disappointing that The King of Staten Island didn't have its chance to debut on the film festival circuit and in movie theaters, this rollout on streaming at home gives a fitting quirky twist to this offbeat but lovable film. While the film is not an autobiography or documentary, it does weave many personal details of Pete's life into a very compelling story with some hilarious moments. Two of my favorites were the rundown why college is a ripoff and the ringtones during a botched burglary that help the victims fight back!

If the person in question was 10 years old I would've understood this movie better. I guess at the end there is hope but it was hard to make it to that point.

This film proved out that potential for me, and it was a really enjoyable, and relatable viewing. The film is intimate, engaging, honest, and I didn't feel that I was in one instance placed behind that dreaded voyeuristic curtain that too often is imposed on the viewer. Every performance, from every cast member is memorable, and despite the few cheeky comedic attempts in the writing, it's honest and brutal, yet entirely endearing. I loved this film, and I hope to see much more like this from Davidson in the future, outside of the confines of sketch comedy. Lastly, I loved seeing Buscemi and Davidson together. And, after enjoying Buscemi's many characters over the decades, I could help but wonder, ""Is Davidson the next 'great natural'?""",The King of Staten Island

Can't even explain why but the part when Ray went inside the house that were on fire, and Scott were just standing outside looking in, I cried.

Some bits a bit unrealistic but otherwise a perfectly crafted film that
will make you feel good. Maybe if you are from 20 to 40 years of age you will relate into that situation in life when nothing that you do feels meaningful enough.
And you still think life is good enough but might need some focus in finding out what you really want to do in life.

The chemistry between the cast is movie magic. Marisa Tomei and Bel Powley absolutely shine in their respective roles.

I wasn't a fan of Davidson's when it came out, so I didn't care to watch it at the time, but I recently decided to. After watching, I have to say, it was quite good! In fact, I'd even call it ""recommending to my friends"" good.This movie just feels authentic. I've heard mixed opinions on Davidson's acting, but I think he did great in this movie (it helps that it's based on his life, too). It felt as if I was watching this kid's life, nothing really felt forced or out of place.One of the only problems I have is that some sequences feel unnecessarily dragged out. The party scene is a big example of that. It didn't add a whole lot to the story, it could have been much shorter. The movie really didn't have to be over two hours long.Overall though, great movie!

Drawing on his own experiences, co-writer Davidson carries this soulful New York story into an arena that trades gags for hard truths and it's all the better for it.Yes, there is a certain spaced-out lethargy in the storytelling and an overlong running time, but Davidson is persuasively raw in a performance that becomes increasingly textured and interesting as his character finds a father figure in his mother's ex-boyfriend. It's his bruised charisma that compensates for the frustrations of pace.It has heart. Bucketfulls of it. When the story leaves you, you realise you kept on with it because it spoke to you from its heart, and you listened.Davidson had earned my laughter some time back, with this he now has my admiration and respect.",The King of Staten Island

240,chrsstout,I resisted the urge to turn it off,4,31 January 2021,"What I usually like about Judd Apatows 'films' is that his directing style has a real casual/awkward improv style to it. Which works sometimes, and sometimes it doesn't. It shines when interesting actors are able to let themselves shine through a role. When it works it's genius, but when it doesn't it really really doesn't. Especially if the characters are as boring as they are in King of Staten Island.I don't really understand Hollywood's push to kiss up to Pete Davidson, but it's pretty annoying. This movie covered everything surrounding Pete Davison in the media over the past 5 years. Here are the boxes the movie checked: Dad's a dead firefighter, has tattoos, from Staten Island, ""I'm crazy, my heads all messed up"" said in unwavering insincerity, and of course weed.If you knew those things about Pete Davidson from the media already, then congrats, you just saved yourself almost 2.5 hours because then there is no need to watch the movie.The most interesting aspect of this movie is when you get to entertain the idea that, instead of being a rich garbage-person, Pete Davidson is a poor garbage-person. That- and Bill Burr gets to revisit his role as an angry dude from Boston, which is always good for a laugh; almost like if an entire character were a catchphrase.So I basically turned it off about like 15-20 mins into the movie when Pete's mom is helping the sick kid- which is classic Apatow humor, but terribly executed. Then I came back to it thinking ""maybe I'll give it another shot"" and then found myself wanting to turn it off a couple more times later in the movie.After it finished, I found myself saying ""we get it Pete, your dad was a firefighter."" In the words of the puking kid 15-20 mins in ""everybody has problems"", I just don't know why they insist we watch Pete Davidson's ad nauseam.My more technical critiques: the first act sucked- and vaguely representative of the events in the movie: he barely missed an accident he caused and kept driving saying ""I'm sorry"" over and over. So yeah, I get it, he barely missed jail and got some people all riled-up in the process and spent the latter portion of the second act trying to redeem himself. Cool. But he was never really ""sorry"", he was just an A-hole until he had to cope. The climax sucked too; Action Bronson randomly shows up and Pete saves the day. Everything is magically better than it was before the movie started.Trash. Save yourself 2.5 hours. Apatow should have kept making 'Love'.Yes.",The King of Staten Island

Pete carried the film and he did a decent job at it, like just decent. The plot tropes were good and it made for an enjoyable film. What I miss however, are the typical Apatow jokes, there's no potshots or fun stuff happening here, it's Funny People 2.0 - a lot of heart, but no brains or brawl.

250,justinbrizendine,Pretty dang good,8,10 August 2020,"Too bad this movie had to come out right in the middle of Covid. A lot more people would've seen it, and it's worth watching. Definitely. Pete Davidson was my main concern about liking this movie. I love SNL and he's an also-ran in an also-ran era for them currently. He's funniest playing himself on SNL. Not a good thing for the show really. But Apatow harnessed that in this film. I guess this movie is based on Davidson's real life(surprising? Haha) growing up. It's got all the hallmarks of an Apatow film. Kinda deep at times, heartwarming and pretty funny at several points to not make you feel guilty about actually feeling real human emotions. The ensemble cast he always puts together so well, he has done so again. Marissa Tomei is always beautiful and awesome. Steve Buscemi is great in a small role. Bill Burr is both funny and touching. The British girl from The Morning Show is good(with a hilarious Staten Island accent).

Not the exact same circumstances or even similar circumstances, but I've struggled with depression and other mental health afflictions for some time now. Pete Davidson's portrayal of those afflictions was extremely relatable for me and I can assume many others.I know Pete is very outspoken about his mental health and his story and I commend him for that. That takes courage. He did incredible in this role I think because he lived it and continues to live aspects of it on a daily basis.The rest of the cast was outstanding and made for wonderful support. Big shoutouts to Bill Burr and Marisa Tomei and the cast that plays Scott's friends.My only complaint about this movie is that it wasn't longer. I loved these characters all so much that I wanted at least another 30-60 minutes with them.I know some will be hesitant to rent this with the $20 price tag for the VOD premiere, but I can assure you it is worth it.",The King of Staten Island

Others are saying to stick it out and that the ending is worth it. So, basically 2 hours of crap for a 5 minute ending is ""worth it"" in others' opinions. Pete Davidson is so freaking annoying, he is this generations' David Schwimmer... everything he says or does is just idiotic and you want to punch him every time you see him.

274,jasontaylorr,"7 out of 10, Worth the Rental Price But Not A Classic",7,10 July 2020,"Story - 8/10 pros: Apatow actually manages to derive quite a lot of heart out of this ""semi"" autobiographical story of Pete Davidson. It's a little more raw than most of Apatow's movie, which worked in grounding the goofball stylings of Davidson, who is actually quite competent in some of the more serious moments of this film. It's definitely interesting to learn a little backstory on Davidson, and understand him a bit more. cons: it's definitely not a laugh fest, in fact it is probably one of Apatow's least funny movies.Cast - 7/10 pros: Davidson is surprisingly good in this. I've always felt he was the type of comedian that tried just a little too hard, but Apatow definitely reigned him in and he provided some surprisingly touching moments in this film. Tomei continuing to embrace the second half of her career does well in the mom role, and Bill Burr turns from actor that ""you know his face"" into an actor that deserves you to know him by name as well.
cons: there's some nepotism with Maude Apatow playing Davidson's sister.Direction - 7.5/10 pros: This is probably Apatow's best work as a director. It almost appears as though he takes a step back as this film in a lot of ways feels more like a first time director lower budget indie movie type thing, but that more raw authentic feel to this movie goes a long way in grounding such a huge personality like Davidson. Apatow is unafraid to linger in a moment or extend a beat to make it feel real, maybe something in the past he has shied away from going for the quick entertainment instead.
cons: maybe I was expecting a little more comedy and was surprised by what the movie actually was, not sure that's a negative just more of a preconception that took me a second to get used to.Pace - 7/10 pros: the movie is rather long, but never felt like it was plodding along. Apatow extends moments and really grounds the movie into a very powerful truth that seemed real and authentic. For normally such a comedic duo (Apatow/Davidson) you might expect fast paced jokes stacked on top of each other, but instead Apatow takes his time and lets moments and environments live out and thereby creates a very believable and heartfelt world.
cons: it is a long movie coming in at 2 hours and 16 minutes, but for the most part earns that time or the story needed it.Atmosphere - 7/10 pros: everything felt incredibly authentic and genuine to this movie. You totally believed the small town feel and people that lived in it. The camera work was simple but appropriate and allowed performances to come to life. The sets, costumes, and decor all seemed perfectly authentic and in place and helped ground the world.
cons: the world felt a little small, but that is also what the story called for and needed.Overall 7 out of 10, worth the rental price but not an all time classic rewatch.",The King of Staten Island

Great writing for sure. The cinematography ist beautiful as well and coupled with the music it really lets you know this is not just a silly comedy, but a story about real (fictional) people. The casting is also very well done and the actors really disappear into their performance (despite some popular faces). Also out of all of Judd's movies this one is the most genuine. Who knew Pete was his muse all along. Talking about Pete, he is doing a fantastic job. He is very talented and by telling this story in this way not only has he shed light on the brave but he filled us with empathy and understanding for those who struggle.

I also didn't see much advertising for the movie so I expected a run of the mill comedy. I was so pleasantly surprised with what I got instead! I found this story so beautifuly told and heart warm without being sappy. The comedic parts were very funny especially with Scott's friends. Pete Davidson's acting was very good and I noticed really strong chemistry between and anyone he shared a scene with! My fav part of the movie was that the main character wasn't the main love story. The growth we got to see with this character while he accepted his mother's relationship and found himself & then the last scene was his love scene... idk I call that writing perfection. Also if you're familier with Pete's father being a fighter fire, it makes it all the more heart warming and Genuine.

As someone around the same age as ""Scott"" (Pete) it resonates with me deeply. It is such a great coming of age, and coming to terms with personal trauma story.

Clean it up, Judd, accept help from editors.

Like I get it, he's had a rough life but enough with that stuff. If I were an actor I would wanna pursue things that were creative as opposed to creating things that were based on my real life.

Most of these things either don't exist in this film or they are sparse. It reminds me more a small film such as Britany Runs a Marathon (recommend!) which is a sweet little film in a small NY setting with a simple but emotionally appealing character arc. Pete Davidson is definitely a competent actor and he looks good and healthy. (for Pete) Call me old fashioned, but his tats are so ugly, pure bodily chaos - and I like tattoos. They distracted me. There were so many throw away plot lines and it was too long, unnecessarily.

He doesn't have anything lined up in his life, even though his dream is to be a tattoo artist. He just hangs out with his friends and drinks and smoke weed. He has a hidden relationship with one of them, Kelsey (The Diary of a Teenage Girl's Bel Powley), that is his childhood friend.

Apatow is trying to capture something raw and poignant with comedy around it, but it doesn't quite get there, which it should with a runtime of 137 minutes. Pete Davidson's acting is fine, but the film starts out with him driving down a freeway with his eyes closed obviously having suicidal tendencies, but you never see him crying or having a breaking point about his father. That would have given the film grit and substance. It's probably exactly how he has been about the situation his whole life, but since he is playing a fictional character, maybe if it had something more moving, it would be the endearing film that I think Apatow truly wanted to capture. What's wrong with making a drama about depression with some comic relief here and there? But it's quite the opposite and they kept it light. It almost felt like it is an extension of Big Time Adolescence, which Davidson did last year which had more of an emotional tone. Bel Powley added to the humor and was one of the most interesting characters. And Tomei perfectly played opposite of Davidson. - Ken The Critic, CBS Austin",The King of Staten Island
315,simplysyl,Apatows least loveable movie so far,6,28 June 2020,Apatows movies always feature lovable heroes basically. The problem with king of staten insland is that Pete Davidson is a loser without ever getting lovable. Even in turning his live arround he doesn't succeed in letting you as a viewer care. The movie was waaay to long and in the end felt pointless. I'm generous with giving it a 6 really.,The King of Staten Island

317,christopherafabian,Davidson ruined it for me,3,11 January 2021,Interesting story and pretty funny. All the actors give a pretty good believable performance except pete Davidson. I could get his annoying voice and awkwardness being part of the character but he constantly looks like he's about to break character and screw up the lines much like he does on snl. He should take acting classes or just stick to stand up comedy.,The King of Staten Island

322,zetaflickan-1,Something as rare as a funny comedy,9,17 June 2020,"It's rare to come across a comedy that doesn't just recycle the same old tired 1950's jokes (sexism, body shaming, toxic masculinity, in other words- kicking downwards). The King of Staten Island has a lot of original, funny scenes and jokes that originate in reality and serious matters, taking them to an absurd level, but still keeping it believable enough that you actually know people that would almost act like this (except not being nearly as witty). Even the women (except the sister) are allowed to be funny. Excellent acting all around.
Examples of what I think is funny: Get Him To the Greek, Silicon Valley, The Heat, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Greener Grass, Nanette.
Examples of what I don't think is funny: The 40-Year-Old Virgin, everything with Adam Sandler (and the whole slew of movies/series like that).
It kind of reminds me of Oscar Wilde's plays, where all characters are witty in the same way. Very entertaining and lots of laughs and giggles throughout the film.",The King of Staten Island

325,baseball_pitcher7,A Great Return,9,12 June 2020,"It has been five years since Judd Apatow directed a film, with 2015's Trainwreck, and eight years since he had written and directed a film, with 2012's This is 40. Apatow has a great return to form here as the jokes hit for the most part in an overstretched 137 minute runtime. This is more or less customary in any Apatow film made in the past 15 years. This time, he collaborated with the up and coming talent of Pete Davidson who is most notably famous for his stint on SNL for the past five years. Pete Davidson is fresh off of the success of Big Time Adolescence, a Hulu film that showed he has tremendous talent, even if his performances feel very one-aided. There are excellent performances all throughout the film with Marisa Tomei, Bill Burr, Steve Buscemi, Maude Apatow, and Bel Powley. The semi-autobiographical story is a strong, genuine, and heartfelt film that shows the struggle and grief that a young adolescent can carry when they lose a parent. This is echoed brilliantly in Maude Apatow's performance who never met her father and was young enough to not be broken by the accident. This is a strong film and something that I would recommend as being worth the $20 to rent.",The King of Staten Island
326,shawshank22-567-629684,"Funny, with a Good Heart",7,11 January 2021,"The King of Staten Island was a nice surprise. For a movie about a young adult adrift and living at home, on the edge of burning out, making poor life choices and having a hard time connecting meaningfully with anyone around him, it's really upbeat. His druggy friends are likable doofuses, his family is loving and supportive. There's a comforting wholesomeness and unwavering sense of humor that buoys every scene and never allows the dour subject matter to drag down the positive energy. Davidson is of course at the center of this, as a co-writer and star. Kudos to him for striking the right balance in a project that I'm sure was very personal to him, and hopefully therapeutic. The film does walk a familiar path, story wise, there are times where things get a little too sentimental, bordering on schmaltzy, and the final cut is definitely too long. On the other hand, it made me audibly laugh (not just to myself!) more than once, and that doesn't happen too often with movies anymore. For a Sunday afternoon, it makes for a warm watch, and I'd recommend.",The King of Staten Island

No endearing qualities, I literally hate everyone by the end. Just meanders along, like why am I still here? It feels as though the film was finished by 5 zoom meetings, it's unfinished. Don't waste your time. Completely embarrassed I forked over $20 to rent this garbage pile. Wait to watch it for free on tv in 20 years. I'm serious, it's that bad.

I really enjoyed watching this, to the point that I found myself smiling throughout and I didn't mind hanging out with Pete for 2 hours and 15 minutes. He was so relatable and oddly likeable, that I now want to have a joint with him and laugh until my cheeks hurt (and I don't smoke pot).
It wasn't a role far from who he is, and I don't really think Pete could ever be a great character actor, that wasn't the intent. So if you're looking for a Forrest Gump kind of transformations from his persona don't bother. Nonetheless his portrayal of him-playing-himself with a different name was an excellent casting.",The King of Staten Island

I didn't think they could take two comedians (Pete Davidson and Bill Burr) and make them so unfunny, I love comedians moving into drama as they seem to have enough pain in their lives to evoke emotions.

I caught myself both laughing and crying while watching. Pete Davidson does a great job as an actor playing a role based on his early self.

The mix between comedy and drama is perfect it has a number of funny moments but a number or more serious and heartwarming moments. Judd Apatow and Pete Davidson are perfect.

342,ergowend,Well hello Pete Davidson,7,17 April 2021,"So my feelings about Pete Davison are complicated. Having really only viewed him on SNL, for the most part his bits on the show have been a bit sporadic and while I do like when a comedian interrupts the vibe and stands out...he often is so self aware and self effacing that it borders on uncomfortable and a little sad. He is funny, but it comes through that he has achieved his skill at using humor through pain for sure. The King of Staten Island, and maybe just a vehicle like a movie in general, made that work. This story is somewhat based on his life and so the plot I won't get into because a quick google search will do both more justice than I can here. The writing is good; the jokes plentiful and not slap stick, balancing between fun and deeper emotions throughout. Judd Apatow more often than not puts out a good movie and Bill Burr shines in this as well. The real standout here though is Davidson. Not all comedians can be more than funny, especially early in their careers. Davidson does a great job showing the fallout of tragedy, using his character's gift of humor as some do to shelter themselves and those around them from painful discussions that hurt too much sometimes to talk about, and at times to hide how deeply we have been cut. This movie is not Kramer vs Kramer drama level, but it did walk a tightrope well providing both laughs and cries. I think what Davidson showed in this is that he is meant more for the big screen than the small one.",The King of Staten Island

Is a whole lot more!This movie is a story about a 25 year old man Scott, who lost his firefighter father in a fire when he was only 7 years old, and he never moved past it.This turns Scott to becoming a loser who does nothing with his life and lives off of his mother Margie. All while his younger sister is going into college, and moving up in life.This turns Scott incoherent to anything going on in his life. And eventually he attempts to tattoo a child..For obvious reasons this makes the child's father angry. And he confronts Margie in an attempt to make her pay for his sons tattoo removal. In which he inadvertently crosses the line mentioning her deceased husband. And later on he comes back and apologizes to Margie, and introduces himself as Ray.Margie and Ray begin to fall in love. But Scott isn't having it. As he remembers Ray as being the man for yelling at him.. But Ray visibly tries to be a father figure to Scott, even though he doesn't see it.. When Ray sees there's nothing he can do for Scott he visibly gets upset and gives up. Causing Scott to do anything he can do to break Margie and Ray up. In which he does leading Margie to kick both men out.Leading Scott to eventually move into the Fire Station where Ray works as a last resort for somewhere to go. In which Ray declines, but the other firefighters give Scott a chance. As long as he does work around the station in exchange for shelter..Pros:This is a rare movie where I have absolutely no complaints.

Pete's acting was distracting. Bill Burr was incredible and it was great to see him in a bigger role. I felt bad for Marisa Tomei because she really tried but suffered from lack of investment in a compelling story arch. There were way too many sub stories that exist for one moment and gone forever the next and they didn't add any greater meaning or have impactful resolution. Pete's character really could have had a moment that would have pulled everything in but instead he is basically the same as he was from the beginning. It seems like at the end, the movie wanted you to cheer for him, but his character remains unlikable throughout. After two hours you're still wondering what the movie is really focusing on. Music choices were cheesy and outdated. Writing was not memorable or ever laugh out loud funny. Cinematography was apathetic and straightforward.

361,laurenlawlor,"Surprisingly sweet, easy to finish",8,16 June 2020,"Expecting more of a crass story, with an rough and unlikable character - happily I was wrong!The movie isn't a laugh a minute but instead has a very realistic flow that one could find if you had a temporary look into someone's life. Sometimes there are funny, light, silly moments but there are also sad, frustrating and regrettable ones too. Such is life. They balanced it beautifully.My biggest worry was that the main character (Scott played by Pete Davidson) would be wildly unlikable as that is often the case with these types of films. To sit through 2 hours of a movie you have to enjoy the character enough to root for them. Luckily that is the case. Scott is played as a thoughtful, sensitive, funny guy who truly wants to do the right thing. When he does screw up it's not to an extent where you dislike him. Few actors know how to show that balance in a movie like this. They often oversell their ugly moments so well that the redeeming or sweet ones don't make up for it. Pete does a perfect job at presenting a likable guy who is just a bit lost, in doing so is endearing and relatable. By the end of the movie he felt like a friend, someone you can't help but cheer on.The whole cast was perfectly placed, authentic and enjoyable.I thought the length would be complete overkill as is so often the case with movies today. However I can happily admit, I didn't notice the time. It flowed well, didn't linger on one thing too long and felt light.A surprisingly sweet movie that is more heart than 'har har'.

370,drewjohn-94895,Very enjoyable but quite long,8,18 June 2020,"This was a very enjoyable movie to watch. It has excellent pacing and none of the scenes feel out of place or out of beat. The movie is funny in the right places but can also be very emotional if it needs to be. I though all the performances were great except for Scott's friends, Oscar, Richie, Igor, and Tara. They seemed quite flat and in need of some more character development. Pete Davidson seemed very real, probably because this story is very personal to him. I was worried that Bill Burr may seem out of place but he was surprisingly tame throughout the movie. He never went over the top which helped the film a great deal. The only gripe that I had with the movie is it's runtime. It is 2 hours and 16 minutes and you can feel every second. If the movie was cut to around 1 hour and 45 minutes, it would be great.

Well directed and unlike any other film Judd Apatow has directed in the past, I think people will enjoy the sappy and meaningful moments throughout it. If your a fan of Pete Davidson or Judd Apatow this'll be a rewatch able movie by the time it's placed on a stream. Overall score 84/100",The King of Staten Island
372,ClayW318,Apatow never fails.,9,13 June 2020,"Really liked this movie. Apatow (🐐) strikes again with one of his more special movies. Wasn't his normal type of movie, and there was a lot of emotion and heart in it from a great cast. I love Pete Davidson and he did great in his first big time role. He's so good at providing comedy in tough situations that just makes you laugh out loud. Marisa Tomei, Bill Burr, and Maude Apatow were really good. Steve Buscemi was my favorite part of the movie in his small role. The music was really good throughout the movie. Just an all around great movie, and one that met my crazy high expectations for it. Best movie of 2020 so far, but it could stay that way for the whole year.",The King of Staten Island
373,figjamd-91787,Loved the movie so much!,9,2 September 2020,"Despite the length of over 2 hrs, the movie kept me intrigued and never felt boring! I liked the story arch very much - it is about subtle changes in life. so even although very subtle, it still has the main points of a classical story development. The soundtrack is very well chosen and the cast is amazing.
All in all, the movie is very personal, but also witty and heartwarming. I recommend it to all my friends.",The King of Staten Island
374,freshjivefl,Kudos for Pete Davidson,10,29 August 2020,"Thank you Pete Davidson for being real. Everything we watch makes you think you should be a certain way, love a certain way, act a certainway. This movie shows you real people have struggles and what we watch isn't real.

That combination of love and happiness and pain and frustration due to someone's mental illness is very real.This is the best movie I've seen in years and I am better now because of having seen it.

This is the coming of age story that millennials can resonate with. The movie takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions. The stomach hurting comedy never ends, but what surprises you is the the heartwarming drama. At one point I was trying to hold back a tear, in which I can only compare to Brian's song. The movie is an epic poem to the memory of Pete's father; it goes through all the stages of grief, while providing the hope for growth in any adolescent male. The director is able to being awareness to mental health in a new profound way that does not seem cliche like other recent movies. It portrays the honest real emotions and conversations that are associated with a mental disorder.

You can tell he pulls the emotion from his fathers death as a way to pull this character off.",The King of Staten Island
398,chicagorandi,This movie was perfect.,9,14 June 2020,"This movie gives a good insight as to what has made Pete Davidson into who he is today, sprinkled with bits of 'what would have been' without the comedy career. This movie made me laugh, cry, and also had me on the edge of my seat at moments. The entire cast was phenomenal, but Pete really stole the entire show with his performance! However, the on screen chemistry with Bel Powley made that storyline incredibly special, along with cameo's from Pete's family members and some of his best friends. You can tell throughout the entire film that this was a very personal and vulnerable project for Pete and was very important to him. The movie is a bit long, but I was so engaged the entire time that it didn't feel like it was 2 hours.

411,backlinkbraniac,British girl trying to do New York accent ends up sounding Russian,4,26 August 2020,"I'm not sure why it wasn't good. I have some theories though.1. Bell Powley - she should never be allowed to do any American accent ever again. This is so forced and distracting, and quite frankly sucks. If I had to pinpoint the single worst part of this movie, it would be her accent.2. Maude Apatow - They make a joke about Nepotism in the movie, about it being a disease. Well they clearly lack any sort of self awareness, because this girl is not a good actress. Honestly, someone needs to tell her that she's just not good.3. Other than that the writing and plot construction was abysmal. And they did not effectively utilize the acting skills of Marissa Tomei.4. Bill Burr and Buscemi were pretty good, I enjoy them a lot. I also think that Pete Davidson was like able in this role.In summary this movie could have been a 6 or 7 if its flaws were removed. Under different circumstances such as using the same director and writing staff as Big Time Adolescence, this movie had the potential to be great. I still like Pete Davidson but I have to be honest here.",The King of Staten Island
412,mp-36872,I had to make an account just to write this review. I felt it was that necessary.,2,28 August 2020,"This movie has some great actors and acting in it, but Pete Davidson is not one of them. You can tell he isn't trained as an actor. He has some parts that are believable, but mostly it's mediocre acting from him.The movie was about 1 hour longer than it needed to be. It's extremely slow and dry to the level where I almost turned it off about an hour into it.The writing was terrible through the majority of it besides where I could tell Bill Burr gave himself some good jokes.Judd throws some of his family and Pete Davidson's friends into it so they make some money; and while their acting wasn't bad, most of their parts and scenes with them were unnecessary like this entire movie.I thought it was going to be about a drug dealer's rise in Staten Island or something more interesting like that, but it turns out to be Pete Davidson's life story which I felt was boring and didn't need to be told.There might be some kids who have never heard some of these jokes before that find them funny or relate to a main character with so many problems (ADHD, depression, etc), but most of the character's problems are due to himself just like many of the kids who relate. Using a depressant when you're already depressed isn't going to make your life any better. It'll lead to you sitting around on your couch watching cartoons or movies like this. I suggest you watch the cartoons instead since they're funnier and more entertaining.Cue ""Pursuit of Happiness"" at the end and roll credits. This movie fits into the stereotype of a Judd Apatow movie, but not in a good way. More of a cheesy, drawn out, ""I could have guessed that ending"" type of way.",The King of Staten Island

Seems like a guy still trying to find his way in life, having had a turbulent upbringing. Comes across really well and this movie is semi-biopic. No massive story/drama but heartwarming all the same I.e. his younger sister (played by director Judd Apatow's real life daughter) looking out for him, his mother finally using 'tough love' and the way the Fire Precinct 'adopt' and steer him pulls at the heart strings not to mention his rollercoaster relationship with his mother's new partner. The final scene is simple but very poignant given events that effected Davison in real life. Great cast, lots of familiar faces, and the performance from his 'friend with benefit' British actress Bel Powley was excellent. Also enjoyed the comedic performance from Moises Arias.

430,bmcardle2121,A masterclass in mediocrity,4,16 June 2020,"Don't let the fake, 1-week old accounts rating this 9's and 10's fool you, this is a stinker. File this under ""movies that didn't need to be made"". The King of Staten Island is slow, uneventful, but even worse it is a waste of a solid core cast of veterans. Unfortunately, casting Davidson, in what appears to be some sort of ill-advised vanity project, as the lead doomed this movie from the start. How Davidson landed a role on SNL is baffling enough, but how Apatow then thought he was fit to star on the big screen can only be explained away as Apatow owing Lorne Michael a big favor for some past transaction.The rest of the cast didn't fair much better, with the fiery (no pun intended) firefighter played by Bill Burr being the exception. Tomei, who is usually a guaranteed casting choice if for nothing else than the stability her experience provides, also falls flat. Perhaps that's due to the weak writing of which Davidson also took part, or perhaps the film just sucked the life out of her like it sucked the life out of me while watching it.
Finally, the pacing of the movie was sluggish, if not at a crawl at times, and the 2+ hour runtime starts to feel more like 4 hours. It's quite clear that a lot of reviewers (the real ones, not the brand new ones created solely to boost the film's rating) are trying their best to justify the fact that they spent $20 to watch this on their couch... That justification will likely never come for them, but it doesn't have to come for you.Skip this stinker. 4.3/10",The King of Staten Island

445,tristanloser,"Worth the watch, but wasn't everything it was supposed to be.",6,14 June 2020,"The King of Staten Island has been the first movie in months that I've truly been excited to watch. The trailer was spectacular. So spectacular, I didn't blink an eye at the outrageously high $20 it cost to rent the movie.I'm a huge Pete Davidson fan, and before viewing the movie, I was inspired by the fact that this fictional movie closely resembled the actual story of Pete Davidson himself. The finished result did a great job taking what was almost an autobiography of Davidson himself, injecting strategic inclusion of metaphoric, encrypted details that put the viewer in the shoes Davidson wears in real life.I believe the intentions and vision of the movie was to take the comedic genre to a new level, being the first dramatic comedy that revolves around an actor that wasn't truly acting. This movie was Pete Davidson, and his performance was his true self.However, I was left disappointed with the end result. The comedy aspect was spot on; I rarely invest time in a comedy that makes me laugh out loud, and this movie left me laughing the whole way through.I felt as if the original vision was robbed of the end result. The movie felt very dry all the way throughout, and the emotional journey I had been convinced I would endeavor was truly disappointing. The complexity of the movies inspiration lacked appearance.I don't regret the time I invested of over 2 hours watching this movie, but I'm ultimately disappointed with the fact that I was prepared to watch a story that would truly move me, and was left feeling as if I just watched another average movie.I'd recommend the watch, but don't expect to be moved the way the trailer and the involvement of Pete Davidson's true story to provide the experience that it had the potential to provide.",The King of Staten Island
446,robert-l-hofmann,Surprisingly good,8,13 June 2020,"I started into this movie feeling ambivalent about Pete Davidson as an actor. I watched mostly out of curiosity; to see if it lived up to the expectations set by the trailers. I was pleasantly surprised by the combination of the storyline, scriptwork, and acting. A movie well worth watching.",The King of Staten Island
447,jurgenuk,More Enjoyable Than Expected!,9,24 September 2020,"Having kind of anticipated that I'll probably will be enjoying this movie from the moment it was announced, mostly due to the participants involved in the project, even I was still surprised by just how much. It is throughout well written, performed, directed and crafted. It's thought-provoking, witty, sad and hilariously funny in well proportioned measures. Even the soundtrack is very well chosen. Overall, the only thing for me left to do is to applaud and to highly recommend it!",The King of Staten Island

449,tcjayme303,"No more ""not talented"" jokes Pete - this movie was phenomenal",10,1 September 2020,"The open dialogue about mental health will help so many people.
The realness of the characters and the caliber of the acting was so unexpected and so believable. I was sucked into the storyline throughout the entire film.
I think the firefighter scenes were some of the best I've scene as far as the realism of a tight-knit firehouse.
The action scenes were very well done.
I know it's a Judd Apatow film, and I shouldn't be surprised - but as a big SNL and Pete fan, I was so pleasantly surprised by Pete's performance and the plot of this film. Well done movie, in a time when movies give us so much comfort.",The King of Staten Island
450,chris-hippo-cancel,Pete sucks,1,13 January 2021,"Good Lord Pete Davidson is such a talentless waste of space with massive teeth. How did he ever get to a spot in his ""career"" to make this awful, uneventful film? Horrible acting, can't stress that enough. A tattoo restaurant, WOW. Please do not watch unless you have a spare two hours in which you want to scratch your eyeballs out of your skull.",The King of Staten Island

But here it is. I've watched Pete from his first appearance on SNL... As an actress, my first thought was - Wow, finally there's some new fresh blood in the house. As the years passed by, I've watched all the stuff he kept pushing himself to and the responses afterwards. And I must say, that I am impressed by this gorgeous young man.
I was anorexic for many years, so I know how hard it is to live with the depression and anxiety, and all the stages of the healing process. Your strength of standing out, and bringing your story the most human way possible, made me really appreciate the movie.
And Pete, I am sorry of what happened to you, but you must know that you're doing a great job! Don't ever dare to stop!Hope this message would reach you somehow.All the hugs for you!

452,rachaeld1998,The Manbaby of Staten Island,2,22 January 2021,"Made the terrible mistake of giving in and watching ""The King of Staten Island"" despite having the unrelenting urge to punch Pete Davidson in his smug trouty mouth. I thought, ""well Bill Burr and Steve Buscemi are in this film, so I'll swallow my pride and see what it's all about!"" Not even two of my favorite celebrities could redeem this. For it was a 2 hour exposé about Pete Davidson's severe lack of psychological development. If you want to see somebody mope around and be a complete burden to everybody around them, this is the movie for you. Pete Davidson is unfunny and a really bad actor which was
distracting when the scenes were supposed to have substance. Not only was this movie lacking any sort of real plot, emotion, character development, or stakes, they also decided to give Billy Boy one of the most horrendous chomo mustaches in history. I don't know why I had expectations for this movie. Also Pete Davidson is supposed to be 24 in this movie which was funnier than any of the actual dialogue.",The King of Staten Island

454,eah-50246,"Very Good, Thought Provoking,",8,16 March 2021,"Davidson's acting was excellent. The subject of grief, loss, pain, and its effects on a child were addressed in a very sensitive manner. Still managed to have many funny situations. Worth watching.",The King of Staten Island

It's definitly a movie worth to watch, for a summerday with your friends or family.",The King of Staten Island
456,bigt-33146,Disappointing,5,14 June 2020,"Just going off of the previews, I thought this was going to have a gritty, indie vibe. Way wrong, just a neutered PG film not worth your time or money. A lot of good acting from the support characters, especially Bill Burr, but the lead tall goofy actor (don't know his name, was told he's from SNL), is not a good actor. Someone with more talent might have been able to save this movie from being so dull. Tim Dillon probably could have pulled it off.",The King of Staten Island
457,timmersnb,Pleasantly Surprised,8,13 June 2020,"This film is a true gem. I went into it not expecting much, but I was disappointed when the movie was over. Not many films I've seen recently left me feeling that way; especially Davidson's previous film ""Big Time Adolescence"". ""The King of Staten Island"" was funny, heartfelt, and raw at times. Personally, I've always felt like Pete Davidson was the least funny member of SNL, but this film opened my eyes to what he was about as a person and where his comedy stemmed from. I appreciate that the film doesn't pretend to be something different than what it is - Pete's semi-biographical story brought to life by a comedy directing/producing pro, Judd Apatow. The supporting cast of Marisa Tomei, Bill Burr, and Steve Buscemi bring some pretty great performances to the table as well. Great story about that weird part of life in your early twenties where you're still not really sure what you're doing or where you're going on life's journey. It deals with living through loss, growing up and finding out your purpose in the world. I will recommend this to friends!",The King of Staten Island

462,sdsuman-69332,Great inspirational flix,10,19 June 2020,"I found the movie to be both inspirational as well as a statement on youth. Taking the time to be there for someone and not giving up on them while still holding them accountable for their actions. Pete was surprisingly good in his role and supporting cast was top notch in their story telling. The underlying statement to this movie is to be positive and truthful, even if it hurts at times.",The King of Staten Island

470,dayfrancesca,Comedians acting badly plus Marisa Tomei,1,19 February 2021,"Honestly- if you want to watch Pete Davidson and Bill Burr argue non-stop without ever listening or reacting to each other, this film is for you. I think the movie was ok, too long, the acting is horrible aside from Marisa Tomei, whose presence isn't enough to save it. Pete Davidson is not an actor. He's just a guy doing an impression of an actor doing an impression of an actor. It's abominable",The King of Staten Island

474,jlegend2005,I love this film!,10,14 June 2020,"I absolutely love Pete Davidson and Judd Apatow's, "" The King Of Staten Island."" I honestly didn't know what to expect, but I did find myself laughing out loud throughout the movie. Yes, there's a few poignant moments, but the film never gets too maudlin. I'm sure they did their best not to get too syrupy. Although, this real life meets art presentation must have been great therapy for Pete Davidson. I've always enjoyed him on SNL, but you just can't help but love the guy here. Seriously, this is a wonderful, well-written dramedy. I wouldn't be surprised if Marisa Tomei gets another supporting actress Oscar nomination. She is adorable in this film.. she's perfect as Pete's mom. Pamela Adlon, popping up in a couple of scenes was a nice surprise too! Bill Burr's strong performance is deserving of a special mention too. The movie gives plenty of room for his character to grown on you. In fact, there's of great performances throughout the entire film. Moises Arias is instantly lovable...as is Steve Buscemi. By the way, I honestly thought the tattoo reveal was going to be Harold's enhanced superhero creation. If you're looking for something original to entertain yourself, I'm sure you'll love ""The King Of Staten Island"" too.",The King of Staten Island
475,kartersmoysh,Pete davidson... Freaking awesome,7,15 June 2020,"I saw the trailer and thought it looked fun..and it was. An extremely entertaining movie with heart. Pete davidson really did a good job, and he's definitely a rising comedy movie star. Love the dynamic between all the characters and the story was simple and the movie itself was just an easy watch. I would recommend to anyone who likes Judd Apatow.",The King of Staten Island
