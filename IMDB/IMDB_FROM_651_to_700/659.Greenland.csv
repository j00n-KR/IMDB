0,bkoganbing,Those End Times,6,28 February 2021,"A revival of those 70s disaster films is what we have in Greenland. Who would
have thought that large frozen island up north would be mankind's last hope for survival.There's a large planet destroying comet headed our way and as it hits the atmosphere it burns up and breaks up. The first fragment flattens the Tampa-St.Petersburg area with accompanying firestorms. Is tis how itended for the
dinosaurs?Apparently some plans were made for such an event because engineer Gerard Butler has been chosen in a lottery to be marked for survival. So are his
family which is wife Morena Beccarin and son Roger Dale Floyd. The best scenes
in Greenland are between these people acting and functioning as a real family not some television type family unit.You can make plans, but things often don't go to plan. Especially in a situation
where blind panic takes over. This is the drama of Greenland, one man's family
and their struggle.Nice computer generated special effects are here for those who lay their money
down to see such stuff. But a good story gets me and Greenland has a good story.Not the best of disasterfilms, still a good one.",Greenland
1,Leofwine_draca,Not the worst of its type,6,9 February 2021,"GREENLAND is the latest Hollywood disaster movie about a world-ending comet striking the Earth and mankind doing their best to avoid it. It goes for a more realistic approach than many; no silly attempts to ward off the disaster here, just people scurrying for safety in one of the few places on the planet that'll protect them. It's a lower budget movie than expected, with just a couple of CGI bits, but in many ways that makes it a tighter and more realistic thriller. The main thrust of the story is about efforts to keep the nuclear family together despite the odds. Gerard Butler is an actor I like and a good lead in this, but the rest of the cast is pretty poor. It's nothing new but it has a good pace to make it quite watchable.",Greenland
2,SnoopyStyle,good middle,6,17 November 2020,"John Garrity (Gerard Butler) is a structural engineer in Atlanta, Georgia. His marriage with Allison (Morena Baccarin) is troubled and their son Nathan is diabetic. A comet is coming. John gets a Presidential evacuation order as a part of a select group.There is a section in the middle where the movie finds its mojo and becomes quite compelling. The problem lies in the beginning and in the last section. In the beginning, the people are too sanguine about the comet. Even with the smallest of chances, the news would play up the doomsday scenario. Apparently, there is a government secret program if not a worldwide conspiracy to keep the impending devastation a secret. There is no way that such a big danger be kept secret for long. John could have told his friends to do certain things. I would have told them to gather all the food and essentials, then find the closest deep mine or cave system. It's not all bad but there are problems with the calibrations. These people are doing too many dumb stuff. The middle is the best when the family gets separate. I think they stumbled onto a compelling theme of the story. When things start going badly, they get more worried about being separated. That's the emotional heart which leads me to conclude that the climax should be them reuniting. The problem isn't the end of the world. The problem is losing each other. So the whole last section becomes anti-climatic despite having some pretty good thrilling meteor shower action. It's not like it makes any sense anyways. The last section is a lot of non-sense.",Greenland
3,Prismark10,Greenland,4,28 November 2020,"After the abysmal Geoforce. Gerard Butler stars in another disaster movie to make amends.In Greenland, he plays John Garrity a structural engineer in Atlanta who is going through a patchy marriage.With a comet hurtling overhead. Garrity gets a message on his phone from the US government. He and his family have been selected for emergency sheltering and they need to get to an air force base. Initially the public were not aware that the comet posed a danger.Soon fragments of the comet are hitting the planet causing chaos. The comet is deemed to be an extinction level event.However Garrity's journey is far from smooth. His son is diabetic which means they are refused admittance to the evacuation planes and then the family are separated.Well Greenland is better than Geoforce but that is damning it with faint praise. At its heart this is a race against the clock disaster movie. The Garritys evade peril first from other humans and then try to get to safety as debris falls from the sky.Butler plays Garrity as a good hearted everyman who steps up as a husband and father during the cataclysmic crisis.It just feels like a bigger budget movie than the one you find in the SyFy Channel with a bigger star and better special effects. It is entertaining but it gets increasingly mindless as is goes on.",Greenland

5,kosmasp,No vacation for you,7,15 May 2021,"What would happen if ... how would people react when ... in a sense this is a realistic view on how things would probably go down. Realistic to a degree though. Because it still remains ""Hollywood"" in many senses - if you are a cynic you will find so much to make fun of here, you may not be able to sit still for a second.That being said and all the cliches and convenient ""happenings"", the movie knows to entertain! Gerald Butler is never just an every day man - but while he does not have a direct line to the President (no pun intended), he seems valuable enough for the goverment to contact him, when apparent disaster hits ... the fan! And many other things (shockwaves included).Add to that a great cast of people and you have a different beast of a disaster movie than you may expect ... was true for me at least. And while certain choices may be morally questionable ... the movie leaves most of them up to the viewer - neatly avoiding the subjects to a degree. So whatever you think is right or wrong ... that is your view ... which may very well impact how much ""fun"" you can have with the movie overall.",Greenland
6,jboothmillard,Greenland,7,15 February 2021,"With cinemas closed for the foreseeable future, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the only new films I was going to be able to watch were the ones released on Netflix, Amazon Prime, and DVD. I watched BBC News The Film Review, and Mark Kermode gave a positive review for this movie, which was due to be released in cinemas, but premiered on Amazon, directed by Ric Roman Waugh (Angel Has Fallen). Basically, in Atlanta, Georgia, Scottish structural engineer John Garrity (Gerard Butler) lives with his estranged wife, Allison (Deadpool's Morena Baccarin), and their diabetic son, Nathan (Roger Dale Floyd). Returning home, he and the family are hosting a party with neighbours, but they all watch the passing of a recently discovered interstellar comet, named Clarke. Whilst in a grocery store, John receives a strange emergency automated phone call, informing him that he and his family have been pre-selected to be transported to a shelter. Confused and concerned, he returns home just as a comet fragment strikes on live television. It was anticipated to land near Bermuda, but the fragment instead strikes Tampa, Florida, wiping out the city and a large part of the state. John again receives the automated call with instructions to be at Warner Robins Air Force Base to board an evacuation flight. The Garrity family learn from their neighbour Ed Pruitt (Gary Weeks) that ""Clarke"" is actually a giant cluster of objects expected to hit Earth over the next two days, with the biggest fragment expected to cause an extinction level event. The family packs up and flees, reluctantly refusing to take Nathan's friend, Ellie Jones (Madison Johnson), despite the desperate pleas of her mother Debra (Claire Bronson), as Ellie would be denied boarding. At Robins Air Force Base, when forced to consolidate their belongings into one bag, it is discovered that Nathan accidentally left his insulin in the car. While John hurries back to the car to get it, Allison and Nathan are informed that they cannot be evacuated due to Nathan's ailment, and are subsequently escorted off the base. John frantically searches for his family until, boarding one plane, he realises what happened to them. Managing to get off the plane, he tries to leave the base and continue his search, just as a panicked mob breaks into the base. This chaos causes a gunfight that inadvertently ignites a jet fuel fire, destroying the evacuation planes. Returning to the car, John finds a note from Allison that she and Nathan are heading to her father's house in Lexington, Kentucky. Allison and Nathan enter a store that is being looted and get medical supplies. They escape a group of armed men who storm the store and are picked up by Ralph Vento (David Denman) and his wife Judy (Hope Davis), a couple heading towards Kentucky. During their conversation, Allison tells them that were selected for evacuation but denied entry. In desperation, Ralph pulls over to kick Allison out, as well as take her wristband and kidnap Nathan, much to Judy's protest. John manages to hitch a ride on a truck with other survivors from the base. A young man named Colin (Andrew Bachelor) tells him that they are headed for Osgoode, Ontario where private planes are flying to Greenland, which is where those selected are being evacuated to. Another survivor notices John's wristband and tries to fight him for it, causing the truck to crash and Colin to be killed. Fighting the hostile man, John accidentally kills him in self-defence, hitting with a hammer, and leaves the scene. Meanwhile, Ralph and a reluctant Judy take Nathan with them to a FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) camp. They unsuccessfully attempt to pass as Nathan's parents, Nathan tearfully exposes them, and they are arrested. Allison hitches a ride with a group of foreign refugees and eventually ends up at the same camp, and a man helps her reunite with Nathan. The following day, John watches the television, showing the worldwide destruction and a countdown to the final impact. He steals a car and finally reaches the home of his father-in-law, Dale (Scott Glenn). Nathan and Allison are brought in a transport coach shortly afterward and they are reunited. The family initially decide to accept their fate but seeing a television report about evacuees being taken to underground bunkers near Thule Air Force Base in Greenland, John realises that they might have just enough time to make it to Osgoode. The family then leaves, saying goodbye to Dale who decides to stay, before continuing in his truck. Hours later, they reach Upstate New York and get caught in a traffic jam when molten debris begins to rain down, destroying cars, people, and a helicopter. They hide beneath an underpass until the raining stops and continue to Canada. They learn from a radio report that Clarke's largest fragment will make impact somewhere in Western Europe. They arrive at the airport, seeing a plane take off. They manage to stop the last plane from taking off and persuade the pilot (Holt McCallany) to take them. The next morning, the plane approaches Greenland. However, another fragment strikes off the coast and the subsequent shockwave causes the plane to crash land into a valley. The two pilots are killed, but most of the survivors escape, with John and his family being picked up by a military truck that takes them to Thule. They are quickly ushered inside the bunker complex right as Clarke enters the atmosphere. Nine months later, following the extinction level strike, the military try to make radio contact with other potential survivors as various cities. Sydney, Mexico City, Paris, and Chicago are shown to be totally destroyed. The Garritys and other occupants of the shelter exit to see a radically changed landscape, while Greenland finally makes contact with other stations around the globe. Each are relieved to hear each other and report that the atmosphere is finally clearing, potentially giving humanity the chance to rebuild civilisation. Also starring Joshua Mikel as Lucas, James Logan as Micah, and Randall Archer as Brian. Butler has only made two good films in his career (Dear Frankie and 300), all the others are either average or rubbish, but he gives a surprisingly reliable performance as the everyman trying to save his family, and Baccarin is good as his other half. This is different to most movies of the genre (Armageddon is a good example), rather than having bangs and wallops throughout, it concentrates much more on the family perspective as they try to reach safety, surrounded by thousands of other frightened people in a disintegrating world. Obviously, there are the necessary high-octane moments, with bits of rock falling from the sky, aggressive people, and destruction, but this is a gripping intimate approach, staying close to the family, torn apart and brought back together fighting for survival, an impressive disaster thriller. Very good!",Greenland
7,paul_haakonsen,Every bit of opportunity thoroughly squandered and we're left with a very mediocre movie...,5,13 November 2020,"I must admit that I was certainly expecting more from this 2020 disaster movie than what writer Chris Sparling and director Ric Roman Waugh actually managed to deliver with ""Greenland"".Well now, don't get me wrong, because I am not saying that this is a bad movie, nor am I saying it is a movie that isn't entertaining or enjoyable. It certainly was. However, the movie was just way too generic, mundane and predictable. And for a disaster movie, then I am afraid to say that the movie was frightfully devoid of massive scale destruction.Visually then ""Greenland"" was good, however, I was hoping to get to see a lot more destruction as the meteor and the fragments made contact with Earth. There were a few destruction scenes, and they most definitely were good to look at, no doubt about it. But for a disaster movie, then there just wasn't nowhere near enough of destruction and pure CGI mayhem throughout the course of this movie. It should be said, though, that the CGI and special effects that were in the movie definitely were convincing and looked very real and good on the screen. So thumbs up to the CGI and special effects crew.""Greenland"" felt more like a family drama laced with some end-of-the-world disaster theme. At no point throughout the course of the movie did I really feel like the world was about to end. Sure, it was mentioned in the movie and the premise was staged for it, but director Ric Roman Waugh just didn't come through. I have to admit that I didn't really sit down to watch ""Greenland"" because of the family drama going on between John Garrity (played by Gerard Butler) and Allison Garrity (played by Morena Baccarin) amidst an end-of-the-world scenario. No, I was here for the end of the world and the spectacular effects showcasing the destruction. But sadly, ""Greenland"" wasn't really all that great in terms of being a disaster movie.The movie does have a good ensemble of actors and actresses, and I will say that both Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin carried the movie quite well, and the child actor, Roger Dale Floyd, definitely also added something good with his performance. It was nice to see Scott Glenn in the movie, just a shame that he wasn't given more screen time.While ""Greenland"" is watchable and entertaining for what it turned out to be, I just felt cheated out of a grand disaster movie experience; one that I thought would have put the 2009 disaster movie ""2012"" to shame and knocked it off of its seat in the throne of disaster movies.My rating of ""Greenland"", once the ash has settled, stands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars. The movie was just way too generic and following a very strict run-of-the-mill-how-to-make-a-disaster-movie blueprint.",Greenland
8,CinemaSerf,Ah! So that's why Donald wanted to buy it....,6,7 February 2021,"OK, so it's a truly derivative disaster movie that marries bits of both ""Deep Impact"" and ""Armageddon"" from 1998, and has a plot holier than the Vatican at a conclave - but as a piece of mindless escapism, it does what it needs to. When rocks the size of Shea stadium start bombarding the planet, Butler, his wife and son are (randomly?) selected by the government to take refuge. Armed with their QR code, off they travel to Georgia to board specially chartered flights to dedicated shelters in Greenland. Now, in case you have any doubts - there is nothing at all realistic about the series of flawed then serendipitous escapades that cause them to abandon their place in the queue - their son has left his medication in the car, Dad goes back to fetch it - rather than just ask someone in this colossally sized airforce base - they become separated, yada yada yada. Despite the looming disaster, America seems remarkably normal - all the utilities still work, people are queuing in an orderly fashion on just the one side of the freeway, and somehow or other our family - against all the odds at the best of times, let alone without the world facing an existential event - seem to manage. There's even time for pancakes and syrup, for heaven's sake! There is certainly one pretty unavoidable cataclysmic disaster - poor old Roger Dale Floyd (the son ""Nathan"")... No way in heaven or hell would a child of Gerard Butler have a curtain style haircut like that... No, not ever... For an action film, it is frequently devoid of much action and the ending, well all it needs is Noah. Still, as a diversion from other, actually existential, matters in 2020 and 2021, it certainly offers some light relief with some decent special effects and ought to be enjoyed on that basis.",Greenland
9,zardoz-13,A CREDIBLE DISASTER MOVIE,8,5 April 2021,"A nine-mile-wide comet threatens to destroy the Earth in director Ric Roman Waugh's ""Greenland,"" an explosive mainstream disaster epic, with Gerard Butler, Morena Baccarin, and Scott Glenn. Mind you, Hollywood has served up similar fare with ""Meteor"" (1979) starring Sean Connery and then with ""Armageddon"" (1998) and later in ""Deep Impact"" (1998). The major difference between ""Greenland"" and these films is mankind has no defense this time around against this cataclysm. Moreover, Waugh's film focuses on the tragic human toll rather than gee-whiz CGI visual effects. Named after the country where mankind stands its last chance for survival in a complex of underground bunkers, ""Greenland"" seems far more realistic for its duck and cover tactics. Indeed, the apocalyptic menace of this comet is its ability to wipe out half of Europe, virtually all of Florida, and bury anybody in its path. Perhaps even scarier is the premise that the U. S. Government plans to save only a chosen few who can help rebuild the country in the likelihood of such a catastrophe. Imagine the utter surprise of our protagonist, skyscraper construction engineer John Garrity (Gerard Butler of ""300"") when he gets an Amber-like Presidential Alert on his iPhone. The recorded message notifies him that his wife Allison (Morena Baccarin of ""Deadpool""), himself, and their son Nathan (newcomer Roger Dale Floy), have been scheduled for evacuation to a remote location. Waugh and scenarist Chris Sparling, who wrote the claustrophobic Ryan Reynolds thriller ""Buried"" (2010), have crafted a suspenseful, PG-13 rated, disaster saga which exposes the flaws in mankind's best laid plans to salvage civilization.John Garrity is shopping at the local supermarket when he receives his Presidential Alert. When the message is broadcast over their home television set, his estranged wife Allison is blow-drying her hair and doesn't hear it. John and Allison are mending a broken marriage. Later, when they host a neighborhood watch party with their closest friends, the Presidential Alert notice for them is rebroadcast. Predictably, the neighbors are baffled about why only the Garrity's got the message. The Garrity's are told to bring one bag and report to the nearest U. S. Air Force Base for immediate relocation. Of course, we the audience have been warned ahead of time via radio & television news broadcasts about the impending arrival of a colossal comet-nicknamed after ""2001"" sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke-with the chances it will decimate mankind. Visually, this ominous comet is shown from space entering Earth's atmosphere and then depicted primarily in televised news reports about devastated metropolitan areas, with cities and suburbs wiped out. Rioting and looting have broken out where law and order has broken down. Pandemonium surrounds Warner Robbins AFB in Georgia where the Garrity's are scheduled to embark on their flight. Crowds besiege the gates as families are cleared to enter the base for departure. No sooner have the Garrity's arrived and received their ID bracelets than Allison cannot find Nathan's insulin kit. As it turns out, Nathan lost it when he took a towel out of his travel bag during their road trip. Desperately, John rushes back to retrieve it from their abandoned vehicle, but their plans are doomed before they realize it.Allison learns the awful truth about Presidential Alert recipients. Homeland Security selected them based on their 'essential job' status and pristine health. Sadly, the government recognizes its own error in time to send Allison and Nathan back off the base. Tragically, the Garrity's find themselves hopelessly separated. Ignorant about this revelation, John returns with the insulin kit, but he cannot find Allison. As mounting numbers of people jostle the air base gates, the situation waxes even more chaotic. Since she cannot contact John on her iPhone, Allison decides to take Nathan and hitchhike to her father's ranch in Lexington, Tennessee. At the same time, John is ordered to board a cargo jet or be left behind. When he learns about the perfect health criterion for all Presidential Alert recipients, John demands to be let off the plane. Eventually, the enormous crowd at the gates overwhelms the MPs and stampede onto the base. Mass hysteria ensues. Military police exchange fire with some armed intruders. The gunfire sparks aviation fuel, and a fireball explosion obliterates one giant cargo jet. Separated from John as she is, Allison relies mistakenly on the charity of a husband and wife she met while looting a pharmacy for Nathan's insulin needs. The couple turn on Allison at the sight of her bracelet, and kidnap Nathan. Meanwhile John finds Allison's posted note on their SUV and sets out for his father-in-law's ranch. Ralph Vento (Scott Glenn of ""Training Day"") isn't happy to see John without Allison and Nathan in tow.Unlike ""Armageddon"" and ""Deep Impact,"" ""Greenland"" doesn't seem half as outlandish or melodramatic. Waugh and Sparling adopt a more populist approach with their disaster picture. The news media provide all the facts we need to know about Clarke. John Garrity is just as puzzled as his neighbors were when Homeland Security notified him out of the blue about his status. Later, when things go haywire, survival becomes a 'live and let die' scenario. Given bracelets to identify themselves, John and Allison learn these are double-edged swords. People are desperate enough to kill to get them, thinking they can impersonate their owners without arousing suspicion. At one point, John climbs aboard a private truck with other less fortunate souls bound for Canada. One homicidal ruffian spots John's bracelet and tries to separate it from him with a claw hammer. Eventually, Allison and Nathan catch up with John. The suspense mounts as erratic flaming fragments of Clarke's comet descend, like Mount Vesuvius belching incendiary fireballs on Pompeii in 79 AD. Nobody is safe. Since they cannot fly to Greenland aboard military transports, John must improvise and find a civilian plane that can transport his family. ""Greenland"" qualifies as an above-average, sometimes terrifying vision of an eventuality which nobody wants to imagine.",Greenland
10,bombersflyup,"Not great, didn't hate.",5,14 November 2020,"Greenland has a grand setting and engages enough, but lacks substance.The end of the world will bring anyone together, one minute it's awkward, the next together forever. Don't forget there's always crazies out there. It's like a small portion of ""War of the Worlds,"" really. At the start with the other families at their get together, everyone there knows they're the only ones selected. I don't believe them going to check for a second, leaving the Garrity's to pack, so they can then react, very convenient. Would have been much tougher had they not voluntarily left the house and had to pack with them there. I don't understand the anger though, seems like a civilized conversation. They know his profession and why's he's been selected, he didn't have a say, seems petty. The characterization's rather thin and performances not particularly memorable, but it's alright.",Greenland
11,deloudelouvain,My kind of movie. Human extinction is just entertaining to watch.,8,14 November 2020,"Like always with movies about an apocalyptic future you will have positive and negative reviews. The negative reviews from people that are going to cry about the inaccurate things in the plot and positive reviews from people that enjoy this genre without being too picky. Count me in the people that like that kind of stuff. I thought they showed perfectly in what humans would be capable of in case of a cataclysmic natural disaster, but then again there were also things that were unlikely to happen in case of that scenario. It doesn't really matter to me, I just want to be entertained and that's exactly what I got. Non-stop entertainment with good actors and decent CGI's (maybe not perfect but good enough to me). If you like this genre of movies Greenland is certainly worth watching. There are a lot of bad movies in this genre but this one is not one of them.",Greenland
12,siderite,Quite good for a disaster movie,8,13 November 2020,"Gerard Butler is getting the apocalypse as part of his brand. He did the ... Has Fallen series, he played in Geostorm and will play in Afterburn, one could argue that Tale of the Mummy and Reign of Fire were apocalyptic movies as well. And so is Greenland. And it is filled with some of the clichees one would expect from a disaster movie: the average Joe and his family, the dissolution of society, the special effects. Yet this is one of the better ones, as it is well done and has some moments of real tension that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat.Let me list the good things. The acting is good, even the child is not bad. The cause of the disaster is very plausible, if not the exact details of it. The threats are quite real and terrifying. Morena Baccarin is in this. And most of all, this film would have worked just as well without the special effects. It was a good story with well crafted moments. Quite unexpected for a movie in this genre.Bottom line: certainly worth a watch, especially if you watched all those other disaster movies which sucked en gros. This one is good.",Greenland
13,thesar-2,World War Z-Grade,1,11 February 2021,"Or World War S for SUCKS, STUPID DECISIONS and SYFY-ENVY.I'm not ready to call it, but I think Covld's killing cinema. I hated this movie. Like unbelievably hated it. And speaking of unbelievable, this movie's parents, 1998's Deep Impact and Armageddon, had enormously better special effects and those was decades ago.Mercifully, I only spent $3.99 on this rental, which coincidentally enough, was about half its budget. Still, I overpaid for this lazy, boring, unemotional mess of two actors sleepwalking through it and a kid who's more bipolar than Harvey Dent.This disaster film deals with every...single...cliché but done without depth. Regardless, I suppose you're supposed to feel for the, of course, divorced parents of a diabetic child and their boring journey to the Title because a comet is set to destroy Planet Earth!I can't even comprehend the plot holes, predictable actions, the annoying characters, the needless sacrifices and the most amateur filmmaking since Battlefield Earth. And it really hurts that it's 2 hours of blah with stars who just didn't give a damn and about 3 minutes of action that's so comically cartoonish and based in no reality, it should never be called an ""Action Movie"" despite having Gerard Butler's name attached.I hate to say this, but if you find one of those Bruce Willis sell-out movies where he appears for 2 minutes of screen time and gets a check for having that top billing, you're probably better off watching that.SKIP THIS DISASTER.",Greenland
14,FeastMode,pretty intense,6,25 April 2021,"This movie is so suspenseful. Had me at the edge of my seat in so many scenes. It was well-done in many ways. It took it's time and did a good job making you care. Good performances by the two leads. There were a couple of parts that really bothered me. But overall i had a good time with this movie. (1 viewing, 4/24/2021)SPOILERSthe part that really annoyed me was the dude's plan to steal the wife's bracelet and kidnap the son. I can't for the life of me figure out why he needed the kid to get in. Why wouldn't he just take his bracelet and leave the kid? How was he gonna get in without one? No idea. And it lasted so long that it was hard to let it slidethe other part is at the end where the let all the ppl into the bunker even without bracelets. The biggest obstacle the entire movie was being on the list. But in the end it didn't matter. I figured they could at least come up with an explanation. I even thought of a plausible one. They could say that less than half the chosen ppl made it, so there was so much extra room and supplies.And how did they get more insulin? They wouldn't let him on the first time, i assume because they had no way to keep diabetics alive. I don't know how insulin is made. Maybe they were able to figure it out. But it's another problem that magically disappeared.",Greenland
15,MLDinTN,finally a disaster movie that relies on story rather than special effects,7,15 May 2021,"I thought this was a good disaster movie and yes the wife does do stupid things. About the only special effects are when a asteroid hits Florida and the blast takes out everything. John is a building engineer whom gets an emergency message to bring his family to a military base for a flight out. Meanwhile, the news is filled with stories of asteroids hitting the earth, most are small. Soon, the government finally reveals that a life ending sized asteroid is expected to hit earth. So, of course, chaos ensues. They make it to the airport, but the wife stupidly lets the officers know the son has diabetes and chronic conditions are not allowed. Meanwhile, the husband has gone back to the car to get the insulin that was left, how could someone in that situation let that happen. Anyways, planes blow up and the 3 get separated and are going to meat at the wife's dad's. So the wife and son get help, but then those people turn on them and the wife miraculously meets up with her son again. And John gets a lift but people want to steal his bracelet, which leads him to do something he never would have imagined.So they meet at the dad's and decide to take a chance and drive to Canada to get on a plane to the underground safe houses. Well, they make it after several obstacles, then the world is destroyed and 9 months later the survivers emerge. Question, how do they think they are going to get more insulin for their son to live. Everything has been wiped out. Well, I guess there's no reason to ponder that. In movies like this, I always question why do all these people want to live? Everything is gone, there is no going back to life, probably only a few thousand people survived around the world with no way of ever meeting up with them.FINAL VERDICT: nice to have a end of world movie that isn't just about the special effects. Good for 2 hours to relax.",Greenland
16,Cineanalyst,Henny Penny,6,18 May 2021,"""Greenland"" focuses almost enough on the ineffectualness of humanity in the face of a global catastrophe and on the dynamics of a family trying to survive together that it doesn't seem to be standard apocalyptic fare. Almost. It's surely better than ""Armageddon"" or ""Deep Impact"" (both 1998), at least. Nuclear weapons aren't going to save mankind from the falling sky this time. Even its name, ""Greenland,"" points to our home planet instead of the interstellar picture painted by those 1998 titles. Still, it may not even be the best movie I've seen this month about space stuff hitting Earth, as I also caught up recently on the Werner Herzog-narrated documentary ""Fireball: Visitors From Darker Worlds"" (2020).Regardless, it's something of a road (or car commercial)-and-air-trip movie. Family bonding included, but without the ridiculous constant outrunning of threats seen in Roland Emmerich junk such as ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (2004) or ""2012"" (2009). I mean, there's still some of that, but it's not as egregious. It's also surprising how effective it is coming from the director-and-star team of the repetitive ""Has Fallen"" series. We still get the usual CGI shots of destroyed cities and news reports intruding once in a while for exposition dumps. The dramatic scoring is constant, too, but I think it works rather well this outing.Ultimately, it's still nothing especially thoughtful. One thing I'm left wondering is how many deaths Gerard Butler's character is responsible for in trying to save his family. At least two, depending on his effect on planes taking off or landing, and those two proved to not even be necessary to his mission.",Greenland
17,851222,"A very solid disaster film more in common with ""Deep Impact"" rather then ""Armageddon""",8,6 January 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Greenland"" (2020) was way more better then i excepted it to be given its premise i read before watching it. To be honest, its an excellent movie more in a theme with ""Deep Impact"" and rather ""Armageddon"" which at the end kind of forced a tear or two from me, because at the center was always a one family and its struggle to survive. And while this movie was at the brink of clichés it actually never went farther and it was always very well acted by three leads - the young boy was very good and not a usual movie child which creates problems in this type of flicks - rather he was i as rooting for as well as whole family).Overall, ""Greenland"" is a mid budget very well made disaster film told from a point of view of one family. Its not dumb, not clichéd and from beginning till end i was involved into story and its outcome. A really good movie.",Greenland

Acting - poor rote scripted. Lots of not real forced panics & riots. Not convincingly the comet fragments seemed to target highly populated areas - LA, NY, Europe. Smart comet!",Greenland

An important fact is I've seen lots of special features over the years it's quite difficult to make everything work at least most cases, I'm sure not many think about that.

20,paulclaassen,Simple and entertaining.,6,5 July 2021,"It's been a while since I've seen a good comet disaster movie, so I was looking forward to 'Greenland'.Fortunately, 'Greenland' did not disappoint. The film is not as action-packed as 'Armageddon', since it focused more on the drama surrounding the disaster. The film also illustrated people's behavior during disaster, and the dire consequences of their actions, and humanity's inability to work together when disaster strikes.Within the first few minutes the film hit us with an overdone cliche: a disaster movie featuring yet another couple with marital problems who will - no doubt - be reunited due to the disaster. Fortunately, the rest of the film was not as cliched and a great depiction of human greed and selfishness.The suspense is elevated by our hero, John's son Nathan, who is diabetic. John and his wife, Allison, and son has been selected to be taken to an underground shelter. However, just before boarding the plane, Nathan forgets his insulin in the car. This sets off a series of events that throws their lives - and chances of survival - into turmoil. Thanks to good performances, this film felt realistic, and there's some excellent scenes of comet debris crashing to earth. 'Greenland' is an easy watch with a simple premise and no surprise twists.And who is to say this can't - or won't - happen?Would I watch it again? Possibly.",Greenland

In their journey they face many difficulties and obstacles that they have to surpass while the disaster comes closer and closer.I liked this movie because despite its simple plot it was interesting, with many good scenes, good interpretations and it consisted of plenty of action and suspense. Regarding the interpretations, both Gerard Butler who played as John Garrity and Roger Dale Floyd who played as Nathan Garrity were very good but I have to admit that I expected more by Morena Baccarin who played as Allison Garrity and she did not reach her potential. Lastly, I have to say that ""Greenland"" is a nice action movie to spend your time with but it's not a masterpiece.",Greenland
22,cruise01,Intense thrill ride during a cataclysmic event.,8,20 December 2020,4 out of 5 stars.Greenland is an intense thrill ride that captures your attention about Gerard Butler will do whatever it takes to find safety for his family. The movie is realistic to how the event would be. With people going wild. And will do whatever it takes to save themselves.The films first hour will drive you anxious with an intense feeling. John (Gerard Butler) and his wife Allison (Morena Baccarin) are separated. While trying to be there for there son Nathan (Roger Dale Floyd). When they are about to have a get together party. An emergency broadcast alert has warned them that the comet that was supposedly passing by has changed course. With several pieces hitting around the globe. And a big one that will destroy all life on the planet. The government selecting few to go underground to a hidden bunker. John and his family are trying to reach the air force base while the world is going into chaos. With vandalism and people will do whatever it takes to survive.The first hour is intense. John receiving an emergency alert on his phone. While his neighbors and friends did not. Does make for an emotional moment when he and his family are selected and they did not. While only two days til the big end of the world event put these characters in stressful situation. Like there military evacuation turning awry. The family being separated which John can not get a hold of Allison. Allison coming across another family that may not be too innocent. While John comes across a couple of guys that are looking for trouble. All while they can face oncoming comet pieces that are destroying cities.The film does slow down a little in the middle. When they are driving in a long road trip to another airport. It all picks back up when more comet shards comes crashing down.The cast ensemble is good. Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin did a good job with there characters. The visual effects were pretty decent with the obvious cgi explosions. The director did a good job with the intense thrill ride with action and survival. And a story about a family trying to stay together.The film did a good job in capturing the realistic feel with characters facing stressful odds. Some thrilling action. And a great cast.,Greenland
23,eddie_baggins,A thrill-less disaster epic,4,21 February 2021,"Becoming a surprising hit through V.O.D platforms and a much better performer at the box office than predicted through markets where it could show in the midst of the ongoing Covid-19 Pandemic, Ric Roman Waugh's throwback disaster thriller is the exact type of film you are promised through its marketing as the ever the same Gerard Butler races the clock to save his family while the world around them crumbles in the wake of a significant global event that is heading their way.Feeling as though it could've easily existed in the 90's where these type of over the top disaster thrillers lived and breathed in a frequent manner, Greenland is a film that fails to surprise in any way, shape or form as Butler's everyday family man John, his wife Allison (played with mediocrity by Morena Baccarin) and his diabetic son Nathan try and navigate a world gone crazy whilst finding potential shelter and safety from the impending doom and gloom.Your enjoyment of film with depend entirely on ones expectations heading into it but even the most forgiving of viewers may find themselves growing tired of the antics of Waugh's film that could've done with more comet action rather than human v human run-in's and separation anxiety that were perhaps born out of necessity when Waugh and his crew realised that the films CGI was going to look akin to a PS2 level of graphical goodness.Making a name for himself as a director with his second feature, the underrated prison thriller Felon, Roman Waugh has since been a director of a string of run of the mill mid-tier Hollywood productions and all the grit and heart he bought to his career defining sophomore effort now appears to be lost in a director for hire funk that he appears unlikely to get out of anytime soon.Any hope Greenland had of overcoming its low-balling script and budget basics set pieces laid almost exclusively on the back of one time heavy-hitter Butler but the up and down performer doesn't get to do a lot here as John, with his performance virtually feeling like a mere carbon copy of any number of his previous years efforts (with particular similarity to other disaster thriller Geostorm) and a sense that Butler is merely ticking off his duties as a signed employee, stuck in a job that everyone knew was going no where and quickly accepted the project for what it was, a mostly lifeless and thrill free property.Final Say -Not attempting to have much fun as it remains po-faced throughout, Greenland is a dull wannabe disaster epic that might not be downright atrocious but certainly fails to create any real reason to seek it out unless you're stuck for anything else to watch on a given night.2 FBI agents turned pilots out of 5",Greenland
24,Tweetienator,Average by Every Means,4,21 December 2020,"Greenland is not a bad movie but the story is to an extent generic that the plot develops like supervised by an autopilot. Greenland provides less explosions and cgi mayhem like Mr. Emmerich would produce in his disaster movies, and focus more on elements of drama. Also the one real question is not raised: is it worth to survive (maybe for some months or years) in a world that is destroyed!? Whereas movies like 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow give us some eye-candy regarding destruction and mayhem, Greenland provides not much more than a family on the run to a bunker.",Greenland
25,damianphelps,"Gerard Butler, reliably entertaining",7,16 January 2021,"Greenland is an entertaining movie that covers ground we have seen before but avoids taking the same road (mostly) as other films.The first half of the film provide numerous moments of frustration for the characters (which make you frustrated for them). At one point I was getting concerned that this was going to remain a constant theme throughout the movie, thankfully they change course a little.The film strikes an interesting balance on tone. Not too crazy, not too violent, dark but not uber dark. It seems to fit the film. It could have been much much darker, with more violence between citizens, more desperation and less humanity. I guess a bit more realistic. I think though the film's creators made a good choice which keeps the film more appealing to a larger audience.The film also plays it quite straight avoiding scenes like in 2012 (great movie) with cars jumping across collapsed bridges etc.Nice job :)",Greenland

John's wife Allison is running on the treadmill and when John gets home, it's immediately clear that something isn't right between these two. Nathan, their 7 yr. Old son, is a diabetic who needs his meds regularly. John and Allison are hosting a party later that day at their house, when pieces of Clarke unexpectedly hit the ground not far away, with devastating effect... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this film reteams director Ric Roman Waugh and star Gerard Butler after 2019's ""Angel Has Fallen"". ""Greenland"" hence immediately feels like familiar territory. Obviously a different story line, but with the same overall feeling and approach. It literally takes only 10 min. Before Clarke starts blowing earth to pieces, and off we go. The CGI scenes are surprisingly effective, even more so when you keep in mind that this movie was shot on a very modest (for Hollywood anyway) budget of about $50 million. Butler does his Butler thing very well. Sadly the same cannot be said of his co-star Morena Baccarin (as his wife), who is just awful, I mean she cannot act! The movie at times is also surprisingly violent, as people get more desperate with the planet killer in full force and effect. Last but not least, the movie score is quite good, courtesy of David Buckley, who also score ""Angel Has Fallen"". Just earlier this month, a sequel (to be called ""Greenland: Migration"") was announced. And yet another sequel in the ""Has Fallen"" franchise was already announced. So basically, that's all Butler is doing these days: ""Has Fallen"" films and ""Greenland"" films.""Greenland"" was supposed to open in theaters in Summer, 2020 but COVID-19 had other plans. The movie eventually premiered on HBO and HBO Max, and is now available there on demand (where I caught it just the other night), on Amazon Instant Video, and on other streaming services.

On the one hand, they are remarkably consistent. They are almost never terrible and are always pretty entertaining for the most part. But on the other hand, they all feel very similar and very safe. They follow a template, a template that happens to work, but also a template that has very little risk about it. You know what you're going to get out of these films, that's for sure.'Greenland' proved to be no exception to that rule. I felt like I knew exactly how it was going to end from the moment it began. There are obviously some twists and character turns along the way, but even those never really take you that much off guard.And yet I couldn't hate this movie. In fact I even gave it a slightly above average rating. The movie looks so great and is so well put together that I'm basically happy to have nothing unexpected happen, and just accept it for what it is.

32,alindsay-al,A Good Fun Ridiculous Film,7,9 February 2021,"So this film came out in some cinemas in the US late last year but has only just come to The UK via Amazon and I have watched Greenland and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a family attempting to survive when a Comet threatens the Earth.Main Character
Gerard Butler plays the lead here and I thought for the film that is being shown to us he does a really good job. He just plays the leading man well and is a pretty convincing lead in the film, his character isn't the most revolutionary and unique but again for the film that Greenland is I think he does a good job.Supporting Characters
Morena Baccarin plays his wife and again she is perfectly adequate for this film, she provides some good emotion to the scenes that she is a part of and I thought her and Butler had pretty decent chemistry. Roger Dale Floyd plays their kid and usually films like this having a kid actor can be a death sentence but I thought he was good and he adds plenty to his role and is one of the better parts of the film. Everybody else is solid too, with a nice small role for Scott Glenn which is always good to see.Story
Look the story is overall ridiculous, it's a disaster movie what do you expect? But I actually think this film has a decent story that rises above that simple genre. The first act of the film is really good and I like how the film shows the different lengths that humans will go to survive as it actually felt pretty realistic. It's just the film can't keep the intrigue going and the entire last act is bland and feels like your generic disaster film and that is very disappointing.Script
Again the script is actually pretty good, giving some dramatic moments and really raises the stakes for the situation the characters are in. It is just this film doesn't really have many of those slower character moments and it could have done with those to give a little break from the huge end of the world drama. Also again maybe some creativity and intrigue could have been added to the thinking for the end of the film.Style
The style of the film feels really big in scale and pretty impressive and that definitely helps in the quality of the film. The issue is with the pacing of the film, after the first act it kind of falls flat and doesn't do a good job of keeping you interested throughout.Overall
Overall, I actually think Greenland is a decent film. I usually am not a huge fan of disaster films but there are plenty of worse things you can do for two hours then watch Greenland.",Greenland

Like where we can go to be safe.Nothing like a decent disaster movie every now and then. A film that can satisfy the disaster tourist in you. The number of such films that have already been made is countless. The causes of global destruction are varied. There were devastating earthquakes (""Earthquake"" and only recently ""San Andreas"") that lifted up plateaus and ripped apart entire metropolises. Boats that sank because of a huge wave (""The Poseidon Adventure"") or a stray lump of ice (""Titanic""). Erupting volcanoes (""Dante's Peak""), oncoming ice ages (""The Day after Tomorrow""), tsunamis (""Lo Imposible""), or (and more appropriately at the moment) a rapidly spreading, deadly virus (""Contagion""). The storyline of such disaster films is generally the same. In the first place, you already know what's going to happen and so you wait patiently for the catastrophic moment to kick in. Next, you're witnessing the effects of the announced disaster. And secretly you feel that blissful moment realizing you are only a silent witness and not physically present. And each time, it ends well for the protagonists (with some random victims though). They manage to escape death in a miraculous way. Such films usually end with apocalyptic images that show how devastating it all was.In my opinion, ""Greenland"" fell outside the category of films that follow such a storyline. It rather fits in the list of films in which you can also find ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"". You are aware of what drama is going to take place. But it won't be really spectacular. The action-packed scenes in which fragments of the approaching comet hit Earth are rather scarce. A bit like in ""Armageddon"", where topics such as almost impossible human missions and self-sacrifice were more central than the disaster part itself. In the latter, the spatial trip with a space shuttle was pushed to the foreground. In ""Greenland"" it's the Garrity family's trip to a certain place where John (Gerard Buttler) and his family are safe from the imminent destruction of all living things on Earth. In short, the approaching disaster shifts to the background and drama takes over. Admittedly, in many ways.As befits a clichéd disaster film, you first have the family aspect. Usually, it concerns a family with relational problems. This is also the case here in ""Greenland"". What John has actually done, isn't explicitly stated. But rest assured, the longer the arduous journey takes, the more the mistrustful spouses grow closer together. I think that's also a mandatory item that must be included in a disaster film. The film focuses more on the side effects of such a disaster that takes place all over the world. The hysteria and panic that arises. The looting and the massive exodus with the known monster traffic jams. The indignation felt by friends of John and Allison (Morena Baccarin), who attended a birthday party after John receives a personal message from the authorities to get himself and his family to safety in a secret place. One parent's plea to bring her child to safety had more of an impact on me than the rest of the movie.The rest of the film shows the arduous journey to this secret place full of obstacles and adversity. Naturally, the son Nathan (Roger Dale Floyd) suffers from diabetes and the vital medication shouldn't be forgotten. And yes, you can expect problems related to that medication. In such a way that it'll get on your nerves. Reaching the military airport to claim their reserved seats on a transport aircraft is also not without a struggle. And at some point, it all gets a bit too much. Just when you think this family has dealt with enough setbacks, the following presents itself. And although the makers have tried to give this film an extremely realistic character, it also contains some unrealistic situations, such as the chaos at the airport. I fear that if we are confronted with such a situation, in reality, a multitude of citizens would be in front of the control barriers. And the way things get resolved during these tumultuous times also sometimes seems a bit unbelievable and too good to be true.Maybe my expectations for this movie were a bit too high and it turned out to be a rather disappointing experience. They've made an emotional rollercoaster rather than a disaster film ""Avant la lettre"". But turn off your brain, and it'll be quite enjoyable. And although Gerard Butler is usually associated with mindless action films, he knows how to convince in this film. Just like he did in ""The Vanishing"". The very sympathetic family man who, thanks to heroism, manages to restore the broken trust. ""Greenland"" is certainly not a bad film, despite the shortage of action-packed and apocalyptic images. I found ""2012"" much worse, even though ""Greenland"" feels quite melodramatic at times. But this film isn't boring. Before you know it, the 2-hour movie is finished. Unfortunately, this disaster movie wasn't unpredictable compared to the oncoming comet.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",Greenland

A select group of people are told they will be permitted entry into a bunker and given the best chance at survival and the world starts eating itself. It's a fascinating idea and one that feels all too real given the last year and seeing how people turned on each other. Performances are solid here and the visuals are good but it fails to really separate itself from any other catastrophe film, a fact that isn't helped by how wildly predictable and formulaic it feels. People are either really adherent to rules or wildly stupid at times that are convenient to the plot. It's just not the kind of movie I see sticking with me or making any sort of real memorable impression.

46,jadepietro,A Disaster Movie that Isn't a Disaster,7,10 May 2021,"IN BRIEF: Flawed but entertaining disaster movie.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) It was just another typical day, except for the orange colored fireworks in the sky and the news announcing that a a massive comet was hurling itself to Earth. That was when John Garrity and his family received an emergency amber alert from the President to become one of the chosen few deemed essential to the Earth's survival. They are ordered to board a plane to Greenland to escape the on-coming Armageddon. Bunkers and perils await them on their road trip to hell in Ric Roman Waugh's surprisingly literate disaster movie, Greenland.John and Allison Garrity (Gerald Butler and Morena Baccarin) are already not in the best of shape as the couple is on the verge of a divorce and their son, Nathan (Roger Dale Floyd), is dealing with a severe case of diabetes. As they take to the road, the family is separated by unforeseen circumstances and bad decision-making. This splintering stretches the plausibility factor to its limits and weakens the story with its various sub-plots of danger and suspense.It also led this reviewer to question some LOL (Leaps of Logic) that seriously affected the movie: If they don't know the comet's actual point of impact, how do the leaders know Greenland will be a safe haven, complete with bunkers? Wouldn't the government already know that the Garrity's son has issues with diabetes through medical records and therefore unable to meet the requirements as human cargo due to his pre-existing condition prior to their approval? Could this family really reunite on an extensive trip from Atlanta, Georgia to Lexington, Kentucky without transportation, money, and no GPS at hand? With congested traffic conditions, could they get from Kentucky to upstate New York in six hours? Why would you name a comet Clarke?However, credit must go to Mr. Waugh's no-nonsense direction and screenwriter Chris Sparling's storytelling for avoid formulaic tropes and making a doomsday thriller that focuses on the family drama, avoiding overladen CGI and heroic he-man action fight scenes (minus one perfunctory encounter). They create convincing characters that are given mostly realistic perils to endure, and by doing so, make a rarity of a overblown genre: a satisfying disaster movie.It is refreshing to see Mr. Butler play a real-life person than his usual macho screen persona. He can act. Young Mr. Floyd continues to be a fine natural actor. Scott Glenn has a few scenes that add some touching moments to the film as Allison's father and David Denham and Hope Davis bring on the menace and plot complications. But it is the excellent Ms. Baccarin who has the biggest emotional range as a mother who contends with overwhelming odds and a wife who begins to question her sense of forgiveness. She makes Allison a complex and wounded character to root for.Greenland is an atypical apocalypse disaster movie and that's what makes it all the more entertaining.(GRADE: B-)",Greenland

I thought kids and m-r-ns had moved on to superhero movies as their preferred way to waste 2 hours in a dark theatre.Every character is obnoxious.I couldn't keep track of the timeline.And Gerard Butler, I have concluded, must be related to Francis Ford Coppola because why else would he keep getting cast as the lead in big-budget movies?It's shocking to me that some people donned a hijab and, in the middle of the hoaxademic, paid money to watch this in a googleplex. If I had made that mistake, I would have walked out halfway through, licked all the door handles in the theatre, and then stood in front of a coughing hobo until I was fairly certain I had caught the Chinese flu.",Greenland
48,moviexclusive,Eventful disaster film turns into a bumper car ride - full of intentional crashes but without any real purpose from the cast,6,8 August 2020,"There's nothing like timing a disaster film to coincide with a similar real-life event - minus the devastating consequences of course.Ric Roman Waugh's Greenland has been released just as the comet Neowise is coursing through our skies. The astronomical phenomena was at its brightest on 22 July, becoming as bright as the North Star and visible without visual aids, creating a stir around the world. The comet in Greenland however, had a very different idea.Dubbed 'Clark', the cosmic entity was announced to be a spectacular and harmless viewing event. Then it became that a rogue piece had entered the atmosphere, but would mostly burn itself out and land in the ocean. Everyone was thrilled, until the piece made landfall... in Central Florida.Greenland follows the Garrity family as they make their way to safety. Gerald Butler and Morena Baccarin are estranged couple John and Allison, who work together to bring their son Clayton (Scott Glenn) to their ordained government shelter.Replete with catastrophic events as the urgency builds up, the film's visuals are worth looking out for, both for its terrifying scale yet surreal beauty. It is one of the highlights, even as an extinction-level fragment is making its way within 48 hours of the first impact.Waugh's focus is on the family and their tribulations, so don't expect it to be all smooth sailing. But part of the film is also used to showcase a bitter side of humanity, as people disregard the greater good for the sake of self-preservation. Other than Neowise, the messaging also hits home with the pandemic, as the world struggles to cope with errant behaviour from the public. It's extremely disturbing in that expect.That said, the way it is executed comes across a little trite at times. From a scene of some strangers partying (the hedonists), to a couple that hijacks a situation (the false samaritan), writer Chris Sparling's vignettes are much too cliche for the seasoned audience. Waugh also directs these scenes with little depth, often over delivering on the messaging as characters stir up their motives. Trust me, it's very clear who's good or bad in this film.When the family gets separated, these episodes get even more pronounced. And worse still, the situations they run into veer dangerously into caricatures themselves. There's only that many stalled highways and hitchhikes you can take, and the way people drop in and out of the main thread discourages any emotional investment from the viewer.It's not that Waugh doesn't try, but the episodes are repetitive in formula and so after a while, you just know what to expect. And for a disaster movie, that's not very exciting.But while the side characters are bland, Greenland's biggest lack comes from its main cast - they're not very likeable at all.Throughout the film, the family ditches friends, emotionally-blackmails officers, and at parts even endangers everyone else for the sake of saving their family. While this ode to family loyalty is admirable to a point, the situations start to make the Garrity's seem entitled. And no one really wants to root for entitled folks.From non-stop badgering for information from officers trying to do their job, to allowing exceptional waivers for their case, they throw the greater good out into the wind without so much as a blink of an eye.Waugh tries to negate this with some scenes of the Garrity doing good to a random stranger, but they are so random that you'll be more puzzled than convinced that these are people you should be cheering on.So while Greenland still wins for its premise and effects (minus the incredibly flat orange color grading), the lack of endearment to the characters leaves the title without much impact.",Greenland

52,arungeorge13,"Not great, not terrible - somewhere in the middle! [+53%]",5,13 November 2020,"For nearly a decade, Gerard Butler has been involved in many underwhelming actioners. Now, I wouldn't put Greenland in the league of a Geostorm or a London Has Fallen. Because it's definitely not THAT bad. It features a neat performance from the oh-so-lovely Morena Baccarin and some level of suspense in its mid portions. The plot is once again about a family trying to beat the apocalyptic odds (this time due to a large comet named Clarke: what the hell, NASA!) and get to a ""safe place"". The characterization is quite generic; there's nothing that makes John Garrity (Butler) a memorable person other than the fact that he's a structural engineer (and so, the world needs him post-apocalypse).The bigger question in a film like Greenland should be how well the action and the disintegration of the Earth are crafted. Well, the CGI ranges from crappy to decent - Greenland's relatively low budget (for a disaster film) becomes evident at times. The better portions are when the family gets separated and as viewers, we start pondering over the probabilities of their eventual reunion. Ric Roman Waugh's filmography is mixed: a watchable actioner like Snitch, a couple of gems in Felon and Shotcaller, and a half-arsed Angel Has Fallen. What becomes obvious here is that the storytelling in his films is (a lot) better when he writes his own scripts.Chris Sparling's screenplay loses all of its suspense in the third and final act and ends up telling a story that we've heard a zillion times before. If you've got 2 hours to kill, Greenland could work but keep that bar of expectations pretty low.",Greenland
53,OJT,One of the best cathastophe/natural disaster movies ever?,8,16 August 2020,"Well, I think so, and here i'll explain why his might be one of the best of it's kind, and then I'm talking about realistic catastrophe movie with good acting a.s.o.Greenland is not only a two hours thrill-ride, it's also an intelligent and quite realistic catastrophe movie. My thoughts went to The Towering Inferno (1974) and Norwegian The Wave (2015), and the very best The Impossible (2012). And I rule out the alien-kind like Indendence day, which isn't that good either.The film has great story up-building, and doesn't tell to much on why things are like they are, questions will still be answered later on. No over-explaining, but tension-up-building in a good way. the film also make us care about the main persons, and they sweat, scream, are breathing heavy after a run. All actors are ding a great job. The film is well acted, and full of great actors, even in the smaller roles.When you then also ads a plausible story and mostly very good CGI then there can't be much going wrong. (OK not all CGI is perfect, but its good, especially the fires and comet-fractions.)
But the film even takes time to ask very good questions - I won't reveal them here, but the film can actually both make a debate, as well as change how we will react to a comet hitting the earth.The film also is careful not stereotyping, it's very generous and all in all not only a good script, but als very well made.
Kudos to Ric Roman Waugh which really is a film maker to look out for. I love his Felon, Shot Caller and Snitch, which all were impressive. But this is in fact his most impressive so far! Go see it in theaters if you can.
This film deserves a large screen - and I'll go watch again tomorrow!",Greenland

Only D-List celebrities and above get that honour. And just to cherry the cake, the acting is as bad as it gets (even for D-Listers), the editing childlike and the effects not particularly special - and yet it's another American movie where the leading role is fulfilled and satisfied by an individual from the soon to be considerably less United Kingdom of Self Destruction - do ye have nae actors of ye own?",Greenland

58,lambiepie-2,Another Disaster Film that's Slightly Better,6,19 May 2021,"What I liked about this end of the world film is that it only had a very little bit of ""you're gonna make it"" but much of how people would really react to something like this. I think if Rod Serling was around to brush up the script, it would have been somewhat better.What I liked about the film was the family was troubled but the actors (Gerald Butler and Morena Baccarin) were watchable in this trouble as the meteors hit. There is a formula to these films, but what made me give this one a higher rating was when the family went through the typical disaster film formula and got to get where they were going, I thought - ""Oh yeah, they'll get to Greenland and nothing will happen there"", I mean wasn't that the point? Well, when they did get there, the disaster of the meteor fragments followed. I appreciated that it did hit Greenland as the film did not think the audience wouldn't notice if it didn't.My issue with this, and many end of the world films, is that they really don't 'get' past the disaster and to the end of the world. They always end with hope. Hope for a better, new, everybody chip in and build a better civilization. Why? The civilization was crap before it hit and it took the same people, moved them someplace else and eventually it will be crap afterwards. This one ends like all of them, more like the ""B"" 'atom bomb' movies of the 1950's. All it was missing was a big question mark flying on the screen at the end.And maybe that's the point. Not a film to overthink it. Something not to take too seriously, a real throwback to those 50s end of the world movies. If there is a Greenland 2 (Aw come on, you know it may be!) we're gonna get that ""rebuild"" and a bunch of ""things"" that made it through the destruction - and people fighting against each other and the ""profiteers"". Eh, that's how these movies go in the 50s and now. A few hours to watch a good 'popcorn' film, and nothing more.",Greenland
59,Prashast_Singh,One of the best movies of the year. Simply entertaining.,10,2 December 2020,"These have been some really testing times. We found a lot of ways to entertain ourselves at home, but that charm of going to cinemas and watching such big action movies on big screen remains unparalleled. Nevertheless, a good film is a good film first. Greenland had me excited for months, and now that I've finally watched it, I can safely say it's one of the best movies of the year. This is just the type of film needed at this time: a family-friendly action thriller filled with explosive action sequences, realistic tension and touching emotional moments.Gerard Butler has been lately choosing some great and easily entertaining scripts; Greenland is simply a proof of that. Although it's PG-13, the film doesn't have any vulgarity, obscenity or heavy profanity: making it perfectly suitable to watch with family. The fact that the film deals with this type of blockbuster subject and yet manages to be so grounded is nothing short of great. The pain the family endures, the willingness to survive and the love they share in the toughest of times is what backs the core of Greenland. Visual effects are spot-on and the action sequences: super-realistic and white-knuckle in every sense! It mostly involves disaster action (destruction, explosions etc), but a few gritty fight sequences are also brilliantly executed, at times making you wonder if this is really a PG-13 film. Some of the action is bound to catch you off guard, though, adding to the intensity.Comparisons to other blockbusters of this genre, such as 2012, are inevitable, but Greenland manages to shine on its own, with a fairly thrilling story and an overall grounded, realistic depiction of a family's struggle to survive. Released in cinemas if the pandemic didn't exist, this could set the box office on fire also because of the added family appeal Gerard Butler's last few films didn't have due to the R rating. Nevertheless, it's a really fun film to watch, and you won't realize when time will fly by quickly. We didn't anyways have such blockbusters in abundance this year, did we?",Greenland

62,IonicBreezeMachine,"It doesn't reinvent the genre, but Greenland is probaly one of the better disaster movies of the past decade.",7,13 March 2021,"Set in Atlanta, Georgia during a time where a recently discovered comet named Clarke is passing by Earth, Structural engineer, John Garrity (Gerard Butler), is trying to mend things with his wife, Ali (Morena Baccarin), for the sake of their son, Nathan (Roger Dale Floyd). When John gets a presidential alert telling him his family has been selected for a shelter lottery due to details of Clarke not made public. The three of them set out try and reach the flight. However as the chaos becomes larger and more widespread with the impending extinction level event the three of them must face the dangers as deadly as meteor.Written by noted horror scribe, Chris Sparling, and re-teaming star Gerard Butler and Ric Roman Waugh of Angel Has Fallen, Greenland is another entry in the well trodden ground of disaster films. While Disaster movies were at various points a reliable staple of major stuidos during the 70s and revived during the 90s to equally big success, the genre has largely fallen out of favor thanks to overplay with entries in the genre like Geostorm, Pompeii, Into the Storm, and The Hurricane Heist posting diminishing margins with maybe the occasional San Andreas performing respectably. While the genre isn't as prolific as it used to be, Greenland tries to approach the genre from a smaller scale, playing on the more human side of disasters and for the most part I think it works.The movie is essentially the same overall plot as Roland Emmerich's 2012 with the viewers focusing on a family and watching as they go through various scenarios trying to survive. Unlike Greenland is a lot less glib about its subject matter and avoids the annoying melodrama and character quirks from 2012 such as the spoiled Russian twins, comic relief conspiracy theorist, or the bedwetting arc that gave that movie tonal whiplash that made its just under 3 hour running time feel even longer. Greenland feels more grounded and plays itself more like a horror film than an action movie and that definitely helps set the movie apart from others in the disaster film ilk that are tonally more similar to Adventure or Action films.The cast all do a good job with all three of the leads having decent acting and bringing believabiity to the events on screen. There's also some good supporting work from Scott Glenn in an extended cameo that was quite a nice surprise. With Greenland being a lower budgeted entry into the disaster genre the special effects are sparingly but effectively used (though one or two shots aren't great).Greenland is a standard disaster film that carries a bit more weight than your average modern one. While the script hits most of the predicted beats of modern disaster films, it does so with a sense of dread, desperation, and tension that brings out the horror of this kind of situation. Greenland doesn't reinvent the genre, but it puts its established tropes, tricks, and parts to good use.",Greenland

All the characters are flat and dull (especially the main ones) there is no sense of struggle or desperation.

Because of this ""realistic"" approach, the mood throughout the film is pretty somber while the characters stand around and talk about the implications/consequences of this event.There are 3 BIG issues with this film and it's approach1). The ""realism"" of what happens only occurs in service to the plot, when our heroes need to get from ""Point A"" to ""Point B"", the freeways and roadways are, magically, empty - and a vehicle (completely full of gas) is conveniently awaiting them.2). Gerard Butler is not even close enough of a good actor to carry the dialogue-heavy scenes.3). Butler and his estranged wife (is there any other type of couple in these types of films) played by the ""good enough"" Morena Baccarin (DEADPOOL) are saddled with one of the most annoying, whiny kids (badly acted by Roger Dale Floyd) in the history of movies. At one point the child disappears from the plot (it would be a spoiler to explain why), I was really hoping that this character would not come back.About the only thing that works in this film is a brief, extended cameo by Scott Glenn as Baccarin's father, it lifts the middle of this sagging film at a time that it desperately needed it, giving me hope for the last 1/2 of the movie - a hope that was not realized.I'm not sure I can lay all the blame of this failed film on Director Ric Roman Waugh (Angel Has Fallen), but he didn't help himself here, either. He lingers way to long on events, dialogue and scenes, with the standard ""light piano"" underscore that emphasizes the importance of what is going on.I blame the Producers of this film who, originally, had Neill Blomkamp (DISTRICT 9) lined up to Direct and Chris Evans to star in his first post-Avengers role. Both ended up dropping out and I can only imagine that the Producers cut the Director, Casting and Special Effects budgets, but kept the seriousness and realism of the tone.It didn't work.Skip GREENLAND.

Yet one of the first cities we see in ruin after the big hit is Sidney, Australia. Not to mention we see comet strikes during the night and the day. But I am not a scientist.Also shooting up a pharmacy after it has already been looted and killing a elderly woman in a wheelchair didn't make sense.

How stupid do you think we are? An unknown metior and not knowing where it will impact, with all of the resources at our disposal this is simply not true.In this film in some ways it is more realistic compared to other similar films where the metiors seen to aim themselves but in order ways it is actually very annoying.Annoying because 2 major parts of this film were included just to ramp up the suspence but for me both I felt.......Firstly if someone was chosen to go to a shelter you would think the government would know of a long term medical condition, secondly if a married couple wanted to steal the wrist bands why not simply steal them both and not do what they did with the son?Lazy writing once again!What promised to be an excellent film because of the above actually turned out to be quite a disappointment and honestly just skip the first 90 minutes of the film trying to build up the characters because you honesty don't care about them.Rating 5 out of 10",Greenland
70,tonypeacock-1,A B-movie return to the disaster genre that delivers,7,7 February 2021,"I was pleasantly surprised by the viewing. It kept me hooked throughout when in reality I wasn't expecting such a reaction. Extraterrestrial disaster film Greenland has several elements that are typical of a disaster movie.Earth is threatened, indeed effected by a passing comet called Clarke whose fragments can bring about nuclear like destruction of cities and continents.The film primarily follows one U.S. family, the Garrity's (father John (Gerard Butler), mother Allison (Morena Baccarin) and young son Nathan (Roger Dale Floyd)).John is a structural engineer and receives an automated message from the U.S. Homeland Security to attend an airforce base for evacuation to a classified place of safety along with Allison and Nathan.However there are caveats to the evacuation in terms of luggage they can bring, nobody else can be brought and they must have no health conditions.
Nathan however is Type-1 diabetic and requires regular insulin.As the destruction unfolds panic mode grips the population with highways jammed and only a few select members of the population with 'select' occupations getting the messages.There is one good acting scene where the Garrity's leave home, alone and have to turn away a neighbour pleading with them to take their child.It is when they get to the chaotic airbase that more action unfolds as the military learn that Nathan is diabetic and therefore cannot be evacuated. Meanwhile he has lost his life saving medication in the car behind the baying crowds.Hence scenes of seperation unfold as dad heroically attempts to recover the medication that will save his son whilst having to temporarily leave wife and child.The scenes of desperation or selfish survival behaviour hark back to several disaster films in the genre whilst subtle use of CGI is employed to convey the worldwide destruction of comet Clarke.Hence the title, Greenland what does it mean? Well I did mention classified location didn't I? Well it's not classified now.The fear of the central characters not only in survival mode from the disaster of the comet hitting earth but Nathans illness showcases Butler's acting ability be it with his accent slipping a few times!I wasn't expecting a film as intense as this. It is a perfect disaster film that does add to the genre albeit with a more modest budget than is accustomed to in ordinary times.Bravo to the cast and director Ric Roman Waugh.

But this is Hollywood.It is also around 30 minutes too long, and since the pacing slows down a lot at times, it gets really hard to watch at certain points.This is not a high budget blockbuster so don't expect anything similar to Emmerich's works.Almost everything can be seen from a mile away, some of the secondary characters randomly start delivering the plot. Some of the situations the family gets in are barely believable just because you'd think that grown adults would be smarter than that. Maybe it's a commentary on Western societies getting too soft, but I just can't get over this.They also borrow a couple of famous scenes directly, like the pharmacy scene from World War Z and the debris scene from 2012.I'd be perfectly fine with this film being a low budget serious drama about a world-ending event and not a disaster film, but they decided to spend the limited budget on the effects and not good interesting writing.What I mean is that you don't really need a big budget for a good EOTW film, as the Australians did with 'These Final Hours'.Overall, 'Greenland' is not a bad film, but there's absolutely nothing new or interesting about it, and since there are no massive destruction CGI scenes, it leaves almost nothing of interest to the viewer. Top it all up with lots of unnecessary shaky cam.The ending scenes made me want to see a sequel since it would've been much more interesting to see the survivors trying to live in a new ice age of the destroyed world.P.S. Butler slipping into a British accent was a pleasure though, and it was nice to see Holt McCallany.",Greenland
73,Neptune165,The ending was so unbelievable,4,8 February 2021,"The kid is as stupid as you can get, he goes: ""I'm going to leave my insulin (You know, the only thing that keeps me alive) because I want my blanket!"" And that's the seed for most of the trouble the family has to cope with during the rest of the film. All planes left on the surface, they are now stuck on Greenland My biggest problem with the end is, the kid's insulin was such a major issue but yet they managed to spend 9 months in a bunker where they were only going to allow people without medical issues so there shouldn't be a supply of insulin for him and I don't believe that little travel kit could have held that much. Birds would not have survived and the ash would not be gone and the skies would not be clear after only 9 months. Poor writing an poorly executed.",Greenland
74,msbreviews,"Greenland is just another generic, formulaic apocalyptic film where they even rob us of the ""planet-killer comet"" finale...",3,29 September 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This type of movie is always rather divisive between critics and audiences simply due to its nature. Story-wise, it's never groundbreaking or innovative in any shape or form. These apocalyptic films always follow a formulaic screenplay, packed with logical inconsistencies, but also with tons of thrilling action. Visuals vary in quality depending on the studio, as well as sound design and other technical aspects. I always try my best to accept *everything* these movies throw irrationally at the viewer. I prepare myself to be as open-minded as I can, and usually, I have no issues with that (actually, I find the ""that's not how science works"" argument a bit nitpicky in this subgenre).However, Greenland fails to deliver the only thing I did expect from it: a planet-killer comet of pure popcorn entertainment. The only positive aspects are the cast and two/three sequences genuinely exciting. Gerard Butler is already used to this sort of film (Has Fallen series, Geostorm), so he has no problems in portraying another thin character with no real motivations or depth. Same goes for Morena Baccarin, who simply plays the wife of Butler. Both deliver good performances, enough to keep me engaged until the end of the flick.The few good sequences are really good. Little scraps of the giant comet hit Earth before the extinction-level event, and these look great. Nevertheless, just this for a 119-minute runtime is far from being satisfying. As expected, Chris Sparling's screenplay is as generic as it could be, just like Ric Roman Waugh's direction, which doesn't really offer anything remotely new. Some narrative decisions (not related to science or technology because these I just accepted as part of the usual illogical stuff) are definitely to pass the time since they have no consequences whatsoever. Greenland is precisely like dozens of other movies in the subgenre, but without the technical aspects that end up elevating the overall picture.The VFX look dated in some sequences, almost like they didn't have enough time (or money) to finish them. I mean, a static image of a meteorite shower as the sky? Really? Sadly, this comes across as amateur and lazy. The absence of a powerful score (David Buckley) makes the action scenes feel ""empty"", like something is missing. A few fighting moments are pretty much impossible to see clearly due to the overly dark environment and choppy editing (Gabriel Fleming). Overall, the action walks the line between decent and terrible.However, the most significant ""slap in the face"" is the planet-killer comet that everyone is going to look forward to as soon as they enter the theater. There's no way of working around this: if an entire film builds up a third act's massive comet of the side of Europe, it must show it hit the ground in all of its splendor. The gigantic explosion of ridiculous proportions, the endless smoke that fills up the whole atmosphere, the distinctive sound of the impact... This is the moment that can make or break any apocalyptic movie. Unfortunately, and I'm only going to write this, it broke.In the end, Greenland is predictably underwhelming, packing only a couple of genuinely exciting sequences, and a decent cast. Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin try, but they're not enough to compensate for everything else. As expected, Chris Sparling's formulaic screenplay doesn't add a unique storyline or innovative aspect to the genre, as well as Ric Roman Waugh's basic direction. This would all be fine if the action delivered what most people want to see, but sadly, this component is also quite a letdown. Despite a few occasional, riveting scenes, the entertainment levels are pretty low due to the unimpressive visual effects, lack of a powerful score, and poor editing, culminating in a ""viewing-killer"" disappointment. If you absolutely love apocalyptic films, maybe you'll find something enjoyable about it that I didn't. However, if this type of movie doesn't suit your preferences, then this one surely isn't going to convert you.Rating: D+",Greenland

77,SoumikBanerjee25,An Undervalued Gem!,7,7 March 2021,"Striding away from a formulaic attempt, ""Greenland"" sets out to attain a unique perspective whilst perpetuating the usual tropes of an apocalyptic feature. Barring obvious impediments; it is undeniably an underestimated gem.Forming a robust storyline around the ensembled characters amidst pandemonium is no mean feat. Instead of focusing on the cataclysmic events themselves; this accommodates all its attentiveness towards the humane side of the story. And that's what makes it poles apart from the rest.Keeping a fairly pragmatic emphasis throughout, it goes to showcase the inherited survival instincts of humankind. Outlining an elaborated picture, in conjunction with both good and the bad. In the most severe state of emergency; while some may prefer looting, rioting, being conclusively selfish at their play; others may offer their inherent generosity for the people in critical need. I am stupefied at how persistently they put forth all this social commentary at the back of such mainstream proposition!Despite its technical competence, the visuals may not be highly regarded but the overall outcome is quite serviceable. Soundscore deserves hefty praises for an eloquent composition that only gets better with time. Performances are laudable and perhaps worked reasonably well because of sufficient efforts that are being made bearing in mind the character portrayals!
Nothing remarkable, but we do begin to care for this 'Garrity' family.
Gerard Butler, Morena Baccarin, and even the little kid Roger Dale Floyd; all contributing to the cause.Time to belaboring upon the demerits.It conveys the impression of being outstretched duration-wise. Inconsistencies come to light right after the second act where it loses quite a chunk of its preexisting momentum! Even if the narrative uses the extinction-level event as a backdrop for the humane story; I would have loved more methodical explanations!In a nutshell, I consider this as one of the most accurately depicted disaster movies out there. And even the thought of these hideous situations could possibly befall on our planet in the far future; shook me to the core!",Greenland

I was certainly never bored. The action scenes were gripping, the tension effectively built, and the overall feel was unique and different to many others in the genre. The emphasis on family bonds and life itself, as opposed to the disaster, was a welcome change.The special effects were often impressive. The performances were quite good for a film of this type. I definitely felt invested in the plight of the Garrity family. Some parts of the film felt breathtakingly realistic, while others required views to suspend all disbelief and roll with it.Aspects of the film reminded me slightly of Seeking A Friend For The End of the World and The Purge.This kept me entertained its entire running length and got me thinking about bigger picture life stuff.

It was kind of like the true story film 'the impossible'. The whole idea for the film is a home run but the execution just missed.

81,0w0,"You pay $35mil, you get $35mil...",5,13 November 2020,"This is a B-rate apocalypse movie. It can't come even close to standing side-by-side with a movie like 'The day after Tomorrow' or 'Deep Impact' or 'Twister' due to the incredibly low budget.... the problem is: When you're trying to make an apocalypse movie, you HAVE to have a big budget in order for it to be believable. Other movies like Comedy films or Romantic films don't need a big budget and they can still be excellent, but if you skimp on the budget with an apocalypse movie, then you're 100% of the time gonna end up with a B-rate or C-rate movie... it's just a fact.So... is this movie better (or even close) to 'The day after Tomorrow'? HELL NO! And apart from the fact that the movie has very poor CGI, the movie also suffers from being overly dramatic ie. they wasted over 10minutes of the movie on the 'where's my medicine' scene, and it resulted in 10 straight minutes of me rolling my eyes because I knew exactly what was going to happen next. There's 2 other scenes in the movie like this where they just waste screen-time in an effort to stretch the budget and fill up the movie so that it can reach that golden 90minute mark.I'm afraid that this movie is just too hamstrung by the budget... there's nothing really wrong with the actors, but the budget just destroys any change that this movie had of being good. 5/10 for trying to built false suspense too many times and for having a shoestring budget with bad CGI.",Greenland

84,apryla-58795,Hard to root for this family when they got so many people killed,6,20 June 2021,"I agree with one of the other reviewers who said that these people were self-entitled aholes. Everywhere they inserted themselves they got people killed. If they had figured out their situation before GB got on that plane there would have been no need for him to demand they let him off the plane. Once they opened the door for this one guy all hell broke loose and hundreds if not thousands of people died.Next GB inserts himself onto the truck carrying people to Canada and what happens? A bunch of people die and the others are out of luck for a way to get to Canada. Then he just leaves and goes on his merry way.Then they demand to be allowed on the small plane and that no doubt had an impact on how they landed and...who survives? Not the pilots who generously allowed them to get on in the first place. If they hadn't of been holding up the run way perhaps they could've landed the plane earlier and there would've been no casualties.And while Scott Glen is a great actor that scene had no merit other than to get the movie to stretch out a little longer. He had a pass to go but he was smart enough to stay where he was and not put people out. And then they just say ""Byeee"" and leave.GB and MB were just looking out for themselves. They had to throw that scene in where GB pulls that man out of a burning car just so audiences wouldn't think he was a total creep.One last thing that bothers me...kids are idiots and can't be trusted with medication. The parents should have had that stuff with them to ensure it didn't get left. They could've packed a few in his bag just in case they got separated but the majority of it should've been with them. They could've avoided that whole issue and just gotten on the plane and no one would've been the wiser. Instead they caused a huge issue and lots of people died.If this movie shows you anything it's that the government does consider some people better than others, people are not equipped for emergencies and when push comes to shove no one is really a true friend because when people's lives are on the line they will choose family over everything else. We saw that in the first scene when they practically run over their neighbor and her little girl who were begging them for help. They were just like ""Sorry about your luck.""Oh and another thing the takeaway from this movie is that it's never a good idea to be overweight and you should always be in great shape. Being overweight will keep you from getting on a plane and it will ensure you won't be able to outrun a comet. Stop using your exercise equipment as a hanger and start using it to get in shape.",Greenland
85,Beejerman,CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),9,19 March 2021,"The stage curtains open ...With COVID dominating our lives right now, I'm not too sure that an ""end of the world"" disaster movie was such a good idea, but I was wrong - ""Greenland"" delivers the goods on every level. When I saw the trailer for the movie, I was hoping I hadn't just seen everything good about it. So, last night, I decided to give it a chance, and I'm really glad that I did.John Garrity (Gerard Butler), a structural engineer living in Atlanta, joins his estranged wife, Allison (Morena Baccarin), and his 7-year-old son for a weekend to watch as a comet, dubbed as Clarke, passes by Earth - so close in fact, that they will be able to see it with the naked eye. However, when some of the debris in the comet's tail makes it through Earth's atmosphere and begins to impact the surface, shock waves are sent around the globe that would change everyone's lives. An extremely large piece of the comet on a direct course for Europe, labeled as a ""planet killer"", gives them precious little time. Despite the overwhelming odds, John sets out to save his family from becoming extinct in this exceptional story of survival and love.Some have been quick to dismiss this film as just another ""Geostorm"". They couldn't be more wrong. This movie is not a glamourized action feature. In fact, the special effects were not over-the-top, but they served their purpose. The real strength of this film was its human factor. As this family strives to stay together, it is a poignant reminder of the lengths some will go to just to survive. There is plenty of tension, acts of desperation, and an appreciation for the loved ones we surround ourselves with.I absolutely loved this movie. It is a bit of a slow start, but once the debris starts pelting the earth, it moves along at a very rapid pace and doesn't let you go. I give it a very favorable 9 stars out of 10, and deservedly so. In the movie, certain families were ""selected"", presumably based on their occupations/vocations, to ensure survival of the human race. It got me to thinking, and I had the sudden realization that if this were to happen in my lifetime, I wouldn't have been one of those chosen. Perhaps it's time to consider a job change.",Greenland

87,garethcrook,Good dumb fun.,6,23 June 2021,"Now let's get this straight, I don't like Gerard Butler. I'm not big on action films either, but they can be fun and I've heard this is. Butler is John, alpha male truck driving construction dude. Not the oily bloke with a spanner and lunch pale, he's the boss, living in well to do suburbia. Well he was until he and Alison (Morena Baccarin) separated. The opening act does all the set up of the new awkward family dynamic with their young son. Dad home for a day, helping with homework while the TV News announces some trivial matter of a comet, that's breaking up into small pieces. Dun dun duuuunnnn. To say it's a little clunky is an understatement and Butler is that improbable balance of both wooden and over the top, basically whatever the scene calls for, he's the opposite. You're gonna have to let it go to enjoy it though and it's worth trying. The same way Independence Day shamelessly dials everything up, so does this. Although it's a bit more Dante's Peak than Independence Day. The music sets to dark and doomy, John and family get secret messages from the government that they've been selected for shelter. Those small pieces of comet aren't gonna be small after all. This is where this film wins. It nails the disaster film tone perfectly. It's an ""extinction level event"", the lucky few are being flown to safety, but the family gets separated and the race is on in the midst of societal breakdown and the end of the world. There's very little extra fluff. It's focus is the action and John's chance to play hero. Despite the yahoo stuff, I like stories like this. There are a lot of explosions. Every other actor seems to military and the soundtrack will give you a headache, but it's exciting and gripping. The pace is spot on and regardless of the fantastical nature, it feels unusually authentic, this is how Americans react in an emergency. John's in a race to find his family and get to Greenland... that being deemed as the only safe place on earth. It hits every branch on the trope tree. Well meaning people turning into utter child snatching scumbags, racist hicks with hammers, countdowns to the planet killing comet's impact, it's a real emotional rollercoaster and half way through I'm itching to see how it plays out. I mean I already know, it's generic stuff, but it certainly pushes all the right buttons. I well up on more than one occasion and feel the blood pump faster as the action kicks in. I'm torn though. It's shit really. Totally unoriginal, terrible dialogue, generally below par acting right across the board. Over the top intrusive score... but I enjoyed it. Go in expecting very little and I guarantee it'll make you smile. I still don't get why Butler has an acting career though.",Greenland

For real, even though I'm super late for ""Greenland"", it turned to be quite the pleasant surprise. What I expected to be another ""2012"", ""Geostorm"" or a straight-up blockbuster with B movie jolts, actually is a decent thriller/survival/family drama set against the backdrop of apocalyptic events. Explosions and collapsing buildings are there, but they ain't the main focus.The Garrity family is just having a little sit down with some friends, most of whom are excited to watch the live broadcast of the allegedly harmless interstellar comet Clarke passing earth, and then the amber alert comes... Garrity family has been chosen for emergency shelter, for John Garrity (Gerard Butler) is a structural engineer, a skilled worker. Clarke turns out to be a potential 'planet killer', and Garrity family's harsh, unprecedented journey to safety starts here. ""Greenland"" has a no-nonsense attitude and energy, the stakes are high, the family must get together, through many awful trials. Even though a definite dramatization, with all, I mean, all the dangers on characters way, through those means ""Greenland"" shows the bad and the good of the humanity in such apocalyptic circumstances, and is a film that exhibits a good amount of sentimentalism, emotion. Human factor is mostly consistently at play in ""Greenland"", as director Ric Roman Vaughn (""Felon"", ""Shot Caller"") and writer Chris Sparling (""Buried"", ""The Atticus Institute"") have chosen to focus on the family, rather than explosive action sets and loads of cgi.Emotion of ""Greenland"" is superbly conveyed by the cast, with the highlight, in my opinion, belonging to Morena Baccarin (""Gotham"", ""Deadpool"") as the mother and a part of the heart of Garrity family. Gerard seems to be just where he needs to be, and another two good additions are little Roger Dale Floyd as the youngest Garrity, and his grandpa Dale, or the grizzled veteran Scott Glenn.What actually makes the movie even more impressive, is the fact that ""Greenland"" ain't exactly a big bucks picture, with a 35 million budget. For example, ""San Andreas"" (2015) was budgeted at 110 million. Cgi's slightly iffy here and there, but overall ""Greenland"" is a job well done also regarding technical aspects, and it doesn't feel like a 'small' film.Some may find it duller than others because of bad character decisions and dramatized plot turns, some may see plenty of excitement and shed a tear, but the fact of the matter is, ""Greenland"" is no laughing flick, but a tight, enjoyable popcorn adventure for the entire family.

Sure, it's slightly different from an asteroid threatening extinction ('Ammageddon') or a Mayan doomsday prophecy ('2012') or climate change ('The Day After Tomorrow'), but 'Greenland' borrows similar elements that leave it feeling like more of a retread than an original work.Most of these apocalyptic films rely on having special effects, and 'Greenland' doesn't disappoint in this department, thankfully. There are plenty of scenes that are visually powerful and don't come off as being too manufactured. As for the acting, it's not nearly as special. Butler does his best Liam Neeson impression and Morena Baccarin is alright as a frightened wife/mother, but they could have easily been swapped out for many other actors and it wouldn't have made a difference.'Greenland' does win points for choosing unique locations to focus on, but that only counts for so much. If disaster films are your thing, this is a fine watch, but don't expect a cataclysmic masterpiece.",Greenland
102,SnobReviews,A tense and satisfying ride.,7,19 November 2020,"Engrossing and nail-bitting; ""Greenland"" is surprisingly entertaining and makes a huge impact (pun intended).In this disaster film, a family fights for survival as a planet-killing comet races to Earth.If you think this is just another disaster flick, think again. ""Greenland"" keeps the tension rising scene after scene and features a really good performance from Gerard Butler. Some of the scenes even feel like you're watching a zombie film and makes you want to yell at your screen. Of course the film has some blockbuster clichés but all around it's a great time and I promise you won't be disappointed.Follow @snobmedia for more reviews!",Greenland
103,ferdmalenfant,Big Let Down,2,26 August 2020,"This movie is lacking any kind of action. You would think that with this kind of budget and an amazing cast, something good and interesting would definitely have a lot of WOW moments, no such luck. It's just under 2 hours of extreme boredom. The plot falls flat, the editing is a joke and the characters have no depth to them at all. Do yourself a favor and just fast forward to the one scene worth watching...the end credits.",Greenland
104,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,1,21 May 2021,"Good Morrow.My favorite! A cliché-ridden disaster flick. Granted, clichés are a given for the genre, but man - it never gets old. If you're inclined to write a screenplay...here's the basic outline they used. Feel free to make minor changes. Note: a lot of these can be applied to Zombie movies too! Just have fun with it. Follow the dots and Jerry Bruckheimer will probably produce it.ACT ONE:
I recommend a small family as the protagonists. Make sure the Husband and Wife have issues; marriage is on the rocks, but not too far gone. This is a classic conflict that will be resolved later on. Pile on character flaws as needed. Drinking, smoking is fine, but I recommend making him too devoted to his work. He's driven to the point of neglecting other parts of his life.Husband is world's greatest architect or whatever job. He's important, renowned, respected in his chosen field. He's perfect on the job, not so much at home. Might as well give him a cool accent and perhaps add some extended family problems too. Those come in handy late in the Second Act. For example: his father in-law never approved of him marrying his only daughter.Add a kid with medical issues (this is key). Add a cute dog too (missed opportunity here). The wife spends her days peddling away on a Peloton and chatting with her fancy girlfriends.Introduce the threat: Comet, flood, volcano, zombies, creatures from another dimension, nuclear holocaust, alien invasion...choice is yours; it's all going to play out the same.The Government is always the villain and they never divulge crucial information. A show military strength. Dozens of military jets in the sky. Clog the streets with military ground hardware...and always activate the National Guard. Your protagonists don't know what's up...but Dad has an inkling. ""Sumthin' big is going with this comet,"" he ominously says looking skyward. Or, ""that volcano sure is smoking.""Have someone mention dinosaurs in case we don't recall that a comet wiped them out (a nice contextual reminder). For other types of disasters, I suggest the catch-all ""Global Climate Change,"" it's really popular because it's so flexible. You can use it for just about any disaster. Alien invasion? Sure, the aliens destroyed their home and are looking for a new place to live...the reason for the disaster shouldn't be too technical. Blaming man's transgressions is a great go-to.Show animals are on the move (flocks of birds know what's up and so does the dog.)The set-up is complete. You've introduced your protagonists, gave a bit of background, created some conflicts and shown your audience what the threat is, and alluded to the implications. Don't give too much away yet...dole it out slowly.ACT TWO:
A small disaster strikes. Nothing too epic, but make it exciting. Get your family on the move. Remember, they're frantic, confused and scared. Have the kid hug the dog and have mom tell the kid that it's gonna be alright...but then, have husband and wife share a private look of concern indicating that they're not so sure it's gonna be okay.Reiterate that the Gov has lied magnitude of the threat. Remember, the Gov is always evil and can never be trusted...nobody can be trusted.Make sure the phone lines are jammed. Groceries are out. Traffic jams. Hysteria all around!Add Radio and TV broadcasting illustrating just how bad it is nation and world-wide. Remind the audience that the threat isn't just local. It's global. Life as we know it is at stake.First Responders are spread thin. Nobody is coming to help you. It's them against impossible odds. They are isolated.Be sure to have an angry crowd, loudspeakers, honking horns, and continually keep your family confused and panicked. Have a shot of a lone child holding a toy and crying. If you're feeling ambitious, make sure to get a close-up of the toy and make sure it's a threadbare stuffed teddy bear. Don't forget to have some adult sweep the kid up to safety before you return focus on your primary family. Note: never ever kill a pet. If a pet seems in peril, make sure you show said animal is safe before the end. The quickest way to lose the audience is to kill a cat or dog or any animal. Don't do it.Remember: you can't fill the entire movie with the disaster, you need other plot lines. So, add numerous ancillary issues that can be neatly resolved before the climax.Such as, separate your family. This is key. All Act Two and most of Three will involve race against time to reunite them amidst those unbelievable odds. The easiest way to achieve this is to have the sick kid lose his meds. So, you have the pending disaster and now you have a kid that will die without his medication. Now, that's entertainment!Introduce a random character to drop expositional material to fill in plot gaps you might have. If you notice a plot hole or you think the audience needs to context, use this character to just blurt it all out. It doesn't have to make sense. In this, it's a female Army person who explains that not everyone was selected to be saved and etc. Once they've said their piece, they're gone.Add more scenes of pandemonium. Explosions, bullets flying at civilians...your basic breakdown of law and order. Don't forget looting and criminals...the bad element is roaming the streets.Remember, without meds the kid is dying! Don't let the audience forget.Introduce seeming helpful character that turns out to be a bad. Here we have the couple that picked the mon and sick kid up. This is a good opportunity to reiterate the ""Us vs. Them,"" theme. Some will be saved, but most will die.You can also add a bunch of nonsense characters that your family encounters. They will engage in time-killing conversation that will revolve around the protagonist's background. This will give your character more development.Then, have some fun, go insane...have the kid get kidnapped...separate everyone for a few agonizing minutes. Create shocking situations that can be wrapped up quickly.For your sound design, be sure to keep the sound of choppers thumping and sirens wailing in the background.Mothers are universally panicky. Make sure yours is too. Keep them crying and running around...she's off-balanced...this is a good time to add the shaky camera. Do this for a bit and then resolve some of those ancillary issues. You don't want them hanging around in the third act (i.e. Locate meds, favorite binky, etc.) Add a live TV broadcast of the threat killing a bunch of people.ACT THREE:
Bring them all together. For this. Follow the example in Greenland exactly. The wife loves her widower dad and husband knows that's where she'll go. Have them meet at his rustic country house. Make sure you insist that this scene is filmed in warm, soothing sunlight. Sounds of birds, a gentle breeze, a friendly horse and an antique tractor type of stuff...this will be a sharp contrast in tone from the chaos. It's time for a touching family moment.There is only room for three in the final stretch. Don't take the grandfather with; have him make a last stand at his house...he can say ""I was born here and I'll die here! My wife loved this place."" Have him offer encouragement to his daughter and son-in-law. Also, have them patch up past disagreements. If he's available, this role should always be played by Lance Henriksen or a look-a-like.Don't linger on the melancholy - it's chaos time. Set the sky on fire...it's time to rock to the finish line!Perspective on what's important has magically fixed the marriage issues. They can now work together as confident husband and wife team. Even the dog has a look of determination on his fuzzy face.Unleash an unrelenting barrage of noise, chaos, go berserk. No matter the disaster, your family is going to have to drive through it. Pick a protagonist and have them suffer some small injurie, but nothing fatal or anything that will stop forward progress (like a broken leg or hysterical blindness).More Radio broadcasts giving exposition. Tell viewers the extent of the anticipated damage. Remind them of the dinosaurs again. Have your broadcaster mention ""extinction event"" in an emotional voice.Add one final scene where your family might not make it to safety. Have the dad offer to sacrifice his life for this wife and child...obviously, the whole gang is going to make it. Reminder...don't kill the family dog. Can't stress that enough.Include a few scenes of your family having private moments of reflection. Everyone is hopeful that the worst is behind them. Love saved the day...but there's still some running time left. So... Like the masked killer that you were sure was dead...the threat is back! Briefly....but quickly resolved. Note: if you're going to use an airplane to ferry your survivors to safety...make sure your pilot is unbelievably skilled. Also, feel free to kill him. He gave his life doing what he loved.The finale! Time to drop some outstanding SFX. Blow stuff up!The family huddles and enjoy flashbacks to simpler times. Cut to the aftermath.Scenes of world-wide destruction...add global military broadcast to let the viewer know there are survivors. Oh yeah, always include a shot of the Sydney Opera House.Humanity will continue... With a much-needed architect.Roll credits and cash check.I was going to award this a 10 for faithfully following the Hollywood disaster film roadmap to perfection. However, upon further consideration, this film isn't even average. It gets a 1 for selling us the same thing over and over.Cheers.",Greenland

107,fciocca,"A disaster movie trying to get a different approach, but fails to deliver",3,15 October 2020,"Do not expect the usual disaster movie full of explosions and VFX. It focuses more on the Garrity family, and their quest to reach the safety in the government bunker, before the world ends. The family during their survival journey will encounter many difficulties. Greenland tries to be a different movie on the genre, and I appreciate when a director take a different approach, considering also that most of these apocalypse movie are very similar.Characters are very flat, there is no development. The wife, Allison is really annoying and I think that she cries 80% of the time, Gerard Butler tried to do his best, but unfortunately he could not deliver a convincing performance. Maybe the most convincing actor was Roger Dave Floyd playing the kid. There are a lot of boring and uninspired dialogues, that serves to increase the runtime. If they wanted to do a really different thing, they should have focus more on the human side of the family, showing more complex emotions, adding maybe a few tension moments here and there. The problem with Greenland is that it wants to take a different approach from the rest of these disaster movies, but at the same time wants to be one of those Hollywood blockbuster, so at the end I did not really understand the who this movie was made for. For sure not for people that loves apocalypse movies, there is not enough action, but is not either for people that would like to watch something deeper, because there isn't one single interesting dialogue or character.I personally don't recommend this movie, it seems that screenwriters and the director did not even try to do a good product.",Greenland
108,DeBBss,All very average,5,21 February 2021,"Films like Greenland have come and gone, and unfortunately, Greenland is as average as it gets. It's not the worst film in the disaster genre, it certainly has its qualities. Greenland is fairly entertaining as I've found the near 2 hours fly by. What's most impressive was the acting; I wasn't expecting anything special to come out of Greenland, but the acting greatly improved viewing experience considering its lackluster plot. Other than that, it's fair game. In conclusion, Greenland does its job as a piece of entertainment, so I'd give it a recommendation even though the rating that I gave is low.",Greenland

Director: Ric Waugh
Starring: Gerard Butler, Morena Baccarin, Roger Dale Floyd, Scott Glenn etcOverall rating 89/100Greenland is about a family who fights for survival as a planet killing comet comes racing to earth. They must make a journey to get a plane to sanctuary where they will be protected; but getting there will be more difficult than what they thought. I actually really enjoyed Greenland and was constantly entertained from beginning to end. So, let's get started.First of all, I thought that the set up was interesting, the cinematography was great, the film had a different family dynamic which I loved as well as great chemistry between all the actors. The movie did a great job at suspending the audiences disbelief at what was going to happen, having it seem to be a perfectly safe event where the comet would pass by earth really added to the impact for the audience and the characters involved when it suddenly changed. I also thought the cinematography was excellent, considering how low the movies budget was the movies special effects and CGI were extremely realistic and looked great, the movie had some beautiful shots and use of red in the sky really set the mood and tone for the film whilst also temporarily being beautiful to look at. I also loved that the movie had a different family dynamic, having both parents marriage on the rocks and the kid having an illness was just a really fun and interesting dynamic to the film, and goes against what other generic disaster movie usually go for, this created more tension and conflict as well as more room for the characters to grow, everyone also had excellent chemistry with each other. I actually believed they were a family so it made the movie more authentic and believable, The whole cast worked really well together as their relationships developed and through them working together for a more important cause of saving their sons life the chemistry between Gerard and Morena got slowly better and better, Gerard Butler and Roger Floyd also had excellent chemistry and their relationship within the film was very heart-warming.My next few positives would be the building of tension, Jumpscares, my connection to the characters making the film have a good emotional weight as well as the logical conflict. The movie did an excellent job at building the tension, the stakes were raised higher and higher and the characters lives were more at risk as the movie went on, I was extremely tense and on edge throughout, the sound design and the use of extras helped create this very well too. The movie also had very well executed Jumpscares, these genuinely took me surprise, not knowing when something was going to hit the characters was very good, due to the excellent building of tension the Jumpscares were even more effective. I also had a really great connection to the characters, because the movie actually spent time developing the characters and us following them I actually wanted them to survive and due to the actual realism of the movie in terms of this being possible to happen in real life made it even better, in most disaster movie there is too many characters that you just didn't care about, but due to them having a slightly more smaller cast It worked better, because of this the movie also had a great amount of emotional weight, the movie had so many personal and heartfelt moments between the family, it was just so nice to have the opportunity for the parents too grow and develop and to see them fall back in love with each other. I also liked that the movie had very logical conflict, despite this not being the case the whole time which we will get into, for the most part the movie actually had very realistic uses of conflict for the characters that actually made sense and developed the plot nicely, once again this usually isn't the case with a lot of disaster movies but Greenland was different.My only couple of negatives for the movie would be that their was more room for added depth to the main characters and there was still some generic and predictable uses of conflict or disruptions to the plot. I felt like the movie played it slightly safe in terms of the depth to the parents relationship. It was great that they went for a different family dynamic with their relationship clearly on the rocks, and the movie did attempt to add depth to the relationship with details on their past, but for me it wasn't enough, and I needed more for a better overall character arc between the both of them. I also thought that the movie did fall into some generic genre tropes for the conflict. Certain things like dropping a bag that you have to run back to get etc they were just slightly corny and predictable, and the movie did this slightly too often taking away some of it's freshness for the genre.My final few positives would be the performances, explanation to the plot, great action sequences and a satisfying ending. The performances from the whole cast was fantastic, they showed great emotional depth to their characters, and their reactions and performances were believable and felt authentic so well done to Gerard, Morena and Roger here. I also liked that the movie explained it's plot points well, a lot of disaster movies miss out on key plot holes within the script and never explain them, but Greenland luckily didn't do this, any plot point that wasn't explained or built a mystery was eventually either found out or explained to keep the audience engaged with the movie. I also thought the movies action sequences were excellent, Gerard Butler is going to be amazing in any movie like this, the movie blended the action elements perfectly with the genre and they made sense due to the life or death situations so this added to the movies entertainment value. Finally the movie had a very satisfying ending, the characters arc were ended well, and it was very uplifting to see them survive and get to restart their lives.Overall, Greenland does fall into the genre stereotypes slightly too often, but is a tense, entertaining and more realistic disaster movie that I was always entertained by and I actually was connected to the characters, so this was one of the strongest disaster movies that I have seen in a while.",Greenland

It's not about the Sci fi end of the world so much as it is a suspense thriller/drama. The back setting is an end of the world scenario, but that's not what the main story is. If you can't see that then you really need to stop posting movie reviews. The incompetence of the reviewers on here is mind boggling. But of course our country also elected a psychopath 4 yrs ago too, so I shouldn't be surprised at the lame reviews I read on here. Do you think it makes you sound smart to trash a movie lol? No, it only shows your true intelligence.Don't believe what these truly cynical, angry and unhappy reviewers say. Some folks are just mad at the world and see nothing as 'fun' so to speak.

It is about a man who is called to take refuge with her family in an army bunker because a comet will fall to the ground destroying everything like dinosaurs.
A good and interesting argument that is put aside just to maintain the sequence of the plot.
As always shows the heroic character who has to save his family.
Most of the effects are well achieved only two or three moments are not.
With very few action sequences, most are more trying to develop the story and wanting to put tension on it.

114,ginocox-206-336968,An incoherent pastiche of familiar tropes and scenes derived from other films,3,23 November 2020,"Greenland (2020) feels as if the filmmakers wanted to make a profound social/political statement, but lacked the foggiest notion of what to say. Or perhaps they earnestly believed the incoherent babbling that comes across is somehow deeply profound.The earth is about to be struck by a comet which will trigger an extinction-level event, only this is no ordinary comet, but a Hollywood comet. It's existence comes as a complete surprise. NASA tracks the precise paths of 20,000 near-Earth asteroids, 500,000 pieces of space junk, and several thousand satellites, but somehow missed a humongous comet headed directly for us that could wipe out all life on the planet. This comet will wreak havoc and destruction over a course of several days, first with some chunks large enough to wipe out entire cities, then with a meteor shower of molten metal, and finally with a chunk the size of Manhattan, which will wipe out nearly all living creatures.The filmmakers don't explain how NASA could miss noticing so many objects hurtling toward the planet or how all these fragments manage to remain on the roughly the same trajectory and hit a moving target travelling at 107,000 km/hour or 2.5 million kilometers a day.Fortunately (for a lucky few), the president will implement Dr Strangelove's plan, except without the polygamy, and fly ""the chosen"" to Greenland to wait out the coming Ice Age in huge underground bunkers. Apparently Trump managed to buy the island in secret, as Denmark doesn't seem to need these bunkers for their own citizens. One wonders how such a plan would have evolved in real life. Trump would have insisted on a merit-based selection process, while Pelosi and Schumer would have withheld funding unless the chosen represent the ethnic and cultural diversity of the populace, with spots reserved for undocumented aliens and geriatric politicians. The filmmakers never try to explain how the chosen are chosen. The president is never seen, reduced to a disembodied robocall voice.Garrity (Gerard Butler) and his family must contend with the forces of nature, an uncaring bureaucracy, a society that has devolved into anarchy, various criminals, and existential dilemmas - the grist of several distinct (and not necessarily compatible) movie genres. The result is an incoherent pastiche of familiar tropes and scenes derived from other films.",Greenland

However, our family of protagonists are basically only driven to move forward by a ""we deserve to survive, and other people don't deserve to survive as much as we do,"" which I found distasteful. Given that the entire plot revolves around this ""we're better than other people, because we say so,"" it was very hard for me to enjoy the movie.

""The Towering Inferno"", ""Poseidon Adventure, all the ""Airport"" films, etc. While each had its human drama they also had plenty of disaster! Even moving a few decades up with ""Deep Impact"" and ""Armageddon"" we got a pay off of great special effects, cities being destroyed, etc.This film gave us none of that but the human drama on steroids. Sure some explosions, but they were quick, on TV, or less than spectacular.The very end was absurd. High School students know that after such a cataclysmic event the earth would take hundreds of years for earth to recover. Be it a comet, asteroid, or our own nuclear stupidity, the atmosphere for ages afterward would be poison, the sun blocked out, and well... just a whole lot of dead stuff. Showing the people in the shelter emerging to sunshine and clean air NINE MONTHS after impact was just plain old movie stupidity.When the shelter doors opened, if they still functioned, only the descendants of the people saved would emerge.About the shelter... pretty much it is known that new better designed and better equipped shelters exist these days. Some I have read about are like mini-cities! They have recycle water\air\waste facilities, botanic gardens to grow food, etc. They are designed to outlast the effects of nuclear or celestial disaster after effects.

He takes his wife Allison (Morena Baccarin) and son Nathan (Roger Dale Floyd) for the trip to Robbins AFB, GA where a plane will take them to Greenland.The CGI used to have the comets hit Earth are impressive. Not explained is where these comets come from and no mention of the military diverting them so they miss the Earth. Word is there are many smaller comets attached to one big one called Clark and they are breaking off and they rain destruction on the Earth.Here's the thing: They are at the gate about to go to the plane when John has to go back to the car to get Nathan's meds as Nathan is Type 1 Diabetic. The military won't let Nathan go because he is diabetic. John comes back and cannot find Allison and Nathan. Now separations begin. Later Allison is separated from Nathan, and John needs to fight someone who wants his watch. But the good news is that Allison and John are on their separate ways to Allison's father in Lexington, KY. Cell phones don't seem to work in this movie.

126,Hallelujah289,"Striking, maddening reflection of 2019/2020",7,31 August 2021,"This apocalypse movie very much reflects the climate of 2019/2020 and even 2021 where a catastrophic event (the pandemic = comet apocalypse) was downplayed, then the infrastructure was overloaded and failed (healthcare instead of military) and then the actions of some pretty much ruined it for everyone else at least for a time (the non-mask wearers or the vaccinators however you want to play it).However in this case it's also the protagonists who potentially cause many kinds of chain reactions that could've ended badly. The film prevents them from being blamed and other no-gooders instead, but they also could easily have been the villains in any other film. I felt a certain amount of fury towards them, or could have, given a different turnout.Sure the film lacks a bit of self-reflection and gives the characters an easy way out. But it still leaves a lasting impression about what transpired during the pandemic (and also the riots and protests) in the United States at least even if there was no direct reference to it.I credit Gerard Butler for making the film believable and it's a credit to him I mostly forgot what his character's actions could've caused.May I say that Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin are the most patient parents ever because that kid really was clueless. Or may I say that from watching this film it strikes me that even 7 year olds shouldn't be babied to the point of losing track of their own life saving medicine. Does this kid care whether he dies or not omg.Yes, the film was a mix of thin spots, gritty realism, but also some sentimentalism it's true. However for the most part I was prepared to overlook the rough spots and acknowledge that it was all there for the plot (if kid wasn't diabetic or spaced out there wouldn't be a film) and enjoy the ride.I recommend this film on the basis it has you thinking and wanting to feel, and also it reminds us from the way the pandemic happened in the USA that really we're not that far from dooming ourselves by our own shortsightedness. It's a meaningful wake up call.",Greenland
127,danybur,The family is first,6,4 February 2021,"The Earth begins to be hit by a series of fragments of a strange comet on a collision course with it. The marriage of John and Allison Garrity (Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin), who was in the process of separation and their young son Nathan must suddenly undertake an eventful journey to a safe haven.Director Ric Roman Waugh is said to have made a film that privileges the human scale over spectacularity. There is some truth to this, as the film is not lavish in special effects, but they are elegant and effective and the crowd scenes are accomplished. In addition, it has the ability to ""fragment"" the threat and its effects.The ""human"" plot focuses on a family, unlike other catastrophe films that address a finally convergent choral structure. But he incurs in a few common places, betting on unbreakable family ties, his misunderstandings and reunions, an anticlimactic sentimentality, desperate, violent and / or miserable behaviors of the save oneself who can, enhanced by government secrecy. Many scenes (and perhaps the entire movie) could apply to any global threat. But this time one that also occurs in the heart of the Empire.In this case, the US Government seems to have its secret anti-catastrophe plan much better planned than its policy against Covid, with an elitist and utilitarian approach that constitutes one of the few original (and unintentionally ironic) elements of the film.",Greenland

But if you are looking for Armageddon, then this is the wrong movie for you.Suspenseful and shocking at times. Emotionally powerful as well. Just enough drama my wife liked it. And not too much to make me want to stop watching.Now the comedy aspect comes from the movies use of type 1 diabetes. And how it's used in the plot. While I love that a movie brought awareness to it. Unfortunately, it only piled onto ignorant myths.Nearly every diabetes moment was the EXACT opposite to what should be done. If there was any reason the kid died. It would be directly due to treatment negligence and ignorance. It was so bad that we could not help but laugh.",Greenland

130,dakjets,How to survive in a crisis,8,26 January 2021,"Disaster film? Well ... In the reviews I have read about the film, it is mentioned in this category. But the content is much more about how to survive in a collapsing society. Disaster is the backdrop, but not the main ingredient. Still, the film works excellently, and I'm surprised by the low score. This is the movie is incredibly exciting. Gerhard Butler is especially good as the father of the family who constantly has to improvise to survive. Dangers lurk everywhere. However, the fact that it is categorized as a disaster film may have disappointed many. It is the tough tasks that are needed to survive, which is the main message here. Not the disaster.",Greenland

136,isantistao,Anti-Climactic And Disappointing.,5,27 February 2021,"This movie was very disappointing at the end. The entire ""Extinction Level Event"" that the whole movie is based around happening and leading up to is not shown. Instead it is just skipped right over. It shows them entering the bunkers and huddling up, and then shows them opening the doors to leave the bunkers after what is supposed to be 9 months inside. I can't believe that after all that build up that they wouldn't even show it. And whats more is that they didn't even show many other comet strikes in the movie either. It was mostly about the families journey to safety and getting separated and re-united and dealing with crazy people and such.

138,grygotis,"For what it's worth, it's a lot better than Armageddon!",5,15 October 2021,"As time marches on, any time I see that Gerard Butler is in the cast I suspect it's going to be a poor movie as he clearly has given up on being an actor other than getting paid for going through the minimum required. However, this is a bit better than I expected. It's really just another typical disaster movie only more violent than the norm. A comet is falling and destroying earth and Butler will go through heaven and hell to save his family even though they were having marital problems when this event started. It has many of the usual clichés, though not as many as these things usually do and there is no silliness involving the saving of pets that these things usually include. Playing his wife, Morena Baccarin, of Firefly fame, is not bad and still looks mighty good. All in all, it has some mindless entertainment value if you like this sort of thing and it's better than more recent things like Armageddon, Deep Impact, etc. The special effects are decent, but they should be in this day and age. This brought in some some money in the Covid ridden 2020 and I hear there is going to be a sequel. I don't think that is good news.",Greenland

141,jdring2007,solid end-of-the-world drama with some unique moments but big holes in logic,7,15 May 2021,"Unlike Armageddon, 2012, The Day After Tomorrow, etc, Greenland isn't a vicarious CGI bonanza of awe and terror, but an emotional journey that rides on the coattails of cliches and cheesiness without being overbearing (in my opinion; very powerful in some scenes and exceptionally acted by Morena Baccarin). However the gaps in common sense logic left me frustrated for several scenes, and the ending seemed kind of contradictory to previous statements in the film (won't go into detail, to avoid spoilers). Worth the rental, but don't expect an action flick, though it does have some great ""disaster CGI,"" this is a drama.",Greenland

143,Mivas_Greece,"Where 2012 movie suffered, Greenland thrives! Plot, actors, emotion! The best movie of the year, highly recommended to all fans of the genre!",8,21 November 2020,"Disaster film. The highly-anticipated movie of the year and one of the best disaster movies! It is strongly influenced by 2012 (2009), but also slightly inspired by Armageddon in terms of source of physical threat. Gerald Butler, after Geostorm, returns in an even better disaster movie. Experienced actor, excellent as always, like his co-stars. Suspense and interest prevail from the beginning of the movie! A long way to survival. Where movie 2012 suffered, Greenland thrives, in convincing interpretations, plot, emotion and suspense, and although it is inferior in effects and scenography compared to 2012, I consider it superior as a film as a whole, without the extreme exaggerations of 2012. The best movie of the year, highly recommended to all fans of the genre!",Greenland
144,Slarkshark,Top Tier Disaster Movie,8,4 May 2021,"'Greenland' is actually better than most world disaster movies. Its closest comparison would probably be '2012' as they both follow a family that are trying to reach a safe haven on the other side of the world. Bruce Willis may have come in handy on this one if you know what I mean.As stated, the movie doesn't focus on the actual disaster too much. It's more so about the many problems the protagonists face on their journey brought on by the disaster. This way it's more relatable to the viewer. Because of this, the movie doesn't have to rely too heavily on CGI for its action sequences either.In conclusion, it's tense, exciting, and even touching. It engaged my thoughts on survival and made me wonder what would I do in an end of the world scenario. Better start prepping.",Greenland
145,tvcarsd,"Over-rated, over-simplified and very plain",1,21 November 2020,"I thought the script it's self was too plain, there was nothing at all intelligent in it. The acting was most just some pained looks of some peoples faces while running about without a clue what to do. I couldn't blame them for the decisions that they were making but it would have been nice to have seen them make one interesting choice.It fell well below expectation for me main due to the fact that even though I knew there probably wouldn't be much in the way of neat special fx, it was more that what fx there were were not that good. And the fact there wasn't enough dialog. If you are not going to have one you should at least have some of the other. Instead we spend too much time looking at people sitting in their car with the occasional jump out of the car, get into the car, jump out of the car, get into the car.

146,kjjames81,Cliched and predictable.,5,6 February 2021,"Everything that the film is about has been said in many of the reviews before mine, so I won't bore you with details on the film, but what I ant to point out, even though the film was good and the two hours went by fast, why do disaster movie makers make a film, yes we know it's fiction but why do they make them so far fetched.
Such as they wouldn't turn down a child with diabetes, it's not as if it would spread itself among the survivors.
Then when the family get separated, they end up finding each other, this time all three get separated. There is no way you would find each other that fast in between thousands of people.
Then there is the cliched ending, your typical disaster movie ending.
Was the film a total let down, no it wasn't I enjoyed it but don't expect anything special. It's a shame the film didn't concentrate on the disaster more in the movie.
Overall a good film, Butler is a good watch, I have enjoyed some of his movies. Bring on Den Of Thieves 2.",Greenland

I think the most surprising thing for me was when it showed the decency of humans in the midst of disaster. I have become so disheartened by my fellow Americans over the last four years and particularly this year as thousands die daily, maybe I needed a reminder that we are good overall. You go into a film like this expecting to see a lot of crazy end of the world behavior, and it certainly has that, but less than one would expect. The problem is, the crazy stuff is what makes this kind of film exciting.I really like Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin and they do a very good job with a so-so script.",Greenland
152,FKDZ,Infinitely better than Geostorm. A enjoyable but messy disaster movie,6,19 June 2021,"Overall I enjoyed this movie more than I expected. The acting is pretty good overall with a few actors I did not expect to see like Holt from mindhunter and David from the office/13 hours.The main feeling I felt whilst watching this was that it moves very quick and doesn't bother showing any travel nor give you a good layout of the world through dialog or anything. People just kinda go places and we're supposed to make up the rest.Now with pretty much every disaster movie the moments of disaster are far and in between. The moments that are there are fairly good, but most of the movie focuses on human conflict.That said I did manage to get dragged in. Aside from the section with the dad which felt entirely useless and drawn out.The directing was okay, to my taste the fighting scenes were very messy. And overall there was too much shaky cam.Realism wise there are some real oddities that make no sense, but are not annoying enough to not ignore.VFX were decent. Sometimes convincing (like the trailer meteors scene) and other times a bit cheap looking but overall just fineOverall a 6/10. Fairly predictable disaster movie with all around decent story.Asl.",Greenland

155,WatchAndSmile,Shaky camera ruins the movie!!,3,14 November 2020,"I am absolutely appalled by the shaky camera that is nauseating( especially at 24p!!!). That's just stupid and means the director is a noob who doesn't know anything about filming and uses it to ""give an effect of journalism"". NOBODY, yes, NOBODY likes shaky cameras. It's not artsy, it's not good. Good directors use the story for that and the action itself. This shaky camera adds nothing but takes everything as it's not enjoyable, fast switches of scenes + shaky camera and you got yourself a scenario where you want to vomit. You got a scene that moves fast, at 24p, you get a trail because of it, add a video casette style no steady cam and you got yourself a condition where it just don't look good at all
It's not a bad movie, with some good acting. I am just so sad I couldn't enjoy it. VERY VERY SAD!Tip to the director Ric: Do yourself a favor, spend $5K on a steady cam( Google what that is if you've never heard of it) for your team. All viewers will appreciate it.",Greenland

I guess I'll watch this one again some time, when the taste of the stuff that's going on in the U.S. has left my mouth.
I didn't find the main characters to be sympathetic, despite great acting. Mostly, it was the secondary characters who were allowed to bring the glimmer of humanity to the story.
It's like the film can't quite decide what it wants to be. The trappings of a disaster film are there. Mostly, though, it's a drama, within the framework of action/adventure. There's plenty of drama - it just doesn't feel to me like it accomplishes either 'goal'.

And it's a fresh take on the asteroid survival genre in as much as it focuses only on the little people and not the governing elites.But as the credits roll, a couple of things are going to occur to you, sooner or later.The first is the inescapable conclusion that the protagonists here are passive parasites. They simply follow orders, or are fed information and go where they are told. It's all reaction, except where they are demanding that other, more worthwhile people, help them. And they do that by wielding their doomed child as a weapon.Where's the heroism? Why are they worthwhile human being? Why should we cheer for them, other than that Morena Baccarin is still fairly hot? There are no answers given.I say ""doomed child"" because that's the other big problem. As they emerge to rebuild, you're going to realise that they just spent 9 months in a bunker that we established in the first act was explicitly not equipped to accept anyone with type-1 diabetes.So where did the insulin come from?

The planet and all life is being threatened with imminent destruction, we don't need a kid with diabetes sub-plot to move things forward.But that's exactly what happens, apparently diabetes in an insurmountable chronic disease for the US Army (even though insulin is so common you can buy it OTC for your pet), leading to a very contrived situation that carries along the rest of the story, and eats up the 1st 1/2 of the film.There's also an absolute bonkers dumb scene where an emergency radio broadcast starts calling out meteor fire like it's an incoming artillery strike, which is just an excuse to watch individual people being pelted by fiery rocks. It's shockingly stupid to watch.As a side note to the writers: A 9-mile wide comet fragment that impacts the planet so forcefully that it leaves surface scaring akin to the moon would not clear up in 9 months. More like a decade+. All human life would be gone.The overall acting in this film was decent, but again the writing got in the way of character development, too. Even the lead family, by the end, we really don't know anything about them, other than surface details.I will say the special effects were decent, but everything else about this film was pretty terrible, and boring at the same time.

The only thing that was unrealistic is the Presidential alert and how the government is hiding something from the people.Another unrealistic situation is the planet killer comet.

186,pal05052003,I never knew a Gerard Butler-helmed movie could be so gripping and emotionally powerful.,8,14 January 2021,"Greenland has a simple plot; that of a family running away from a calamity. With Gerard Butler as the lead, you would expect him to play hero leading his hero through various obstacles until he reaches his destination. It is a pleasant surprise that he does not get to play much of a hero in this movie. In fact, Butler and his character's family all have to deal with difficult situations, making it refreshing that our lead character cannot save the day for everyone. In fact, this is shown very early in the film, where our protagonists are selected by the government to be relocated while all his neighbors realize they had not been selected. Coming from a war-torn country myself, the scenes of Butler's character and his family abandoning his neighbors hit close to my heart. Fortunately, this is not a depressingly dark apocalyptic movie and there are supporting characters displaying quiet stoicism: the soldiers whose families have not been selected, the nurse who gave supplies, etc. There are also scenes of chaos, and selfishness too. The movie is able to balance humanity, and animosity without going too deep in any of them. The plot seems like a bunch of scenarios for our characters to overcome, but because Gerard Butler is more an average Joe than a roaring Spartan King, you worry about the characters till the very end of the movie. In fact, I am surprised that a Gerard Butler-helmed movie could actually be so gripping, and emotionally powerful. I really recommend this movie and no one has to get through the events portrayed in Greenland.",Greenland
187,jmvscotland,Spare me the cute and vulnerable kid. Improbability Fact 10 out of 10,5,2 January 2021,"Oh Dear. Oh Dear. Oh Dear!!This movie started out well and I enjoyed perhaps the first half hour. But I knew even from the beginning where this one was going.There is ALWAYS a vulnerable kid with some kind of disability or particular vulnerability. There is always a hero character and there's almost always an estranged wife or partner. And all of these characters find themselves forced back together by an impending disaster. It's SUCH a cliche!!Honestly, who in his or her right mind would want to survive the kind of event portrayed here. The Earth would NOT be in trouble for the nine months that these people are said to have been forced to live underground in Greenland. The Earth would in fact be uninhabitable perhaps permanently following an event like this. Certainly all life would be wiped out for thousands or millions of years. It wouldn't be a case of just biding your time underground for nine months and then starting to rebuild.This kind of scenario is possible. An event where a previously undetected comet or many fragments of comet entered the Earth's atmosphere and impacted the ground and/or the seas is of course possible. But here's the question.Who would want to survive such an event. NOT ME. That's for sure. Give me a box of French Bordeaux and a generator to run my TV and my Blu-ray player and I'll just sit happily getting pissed and waiting for the inevitable.This is NOT a movie I'll be watching again any time soon.

190,matrixdukenukem,Not a disaster movie but survival thriller,8,12 December 2020,"I saw the trailer and was excited for this new disaster movie as they're my favorite genre. What I got instead was a thrill ride into a survival story of a family who go through many leaps and hurdles to reach Greenland.Race against time movies are nothing new. 2012 did it and many other films have fiddled with it. What this movie does differently is puts you in perspective with a regular suburban family that crosses paths with many challenges within realm of believable things. And yes, there are many cliches and conveniences you'll have to look past. If you can do that, we got a nice edge of the seat thriller that takes you on a ride for 2 hours.Gerald Butler is fine here, his performance is mostly believable but Morena Baccarin stands out the most. Visual fx is strictly okay. Plot borrows some themes and formulae from other movies. Direction is fine. Cinematography is good too.

The story is shown entirely from the point of view of the main family, no cut aways to scientists, command centres or world leaders, so it felt like you were right in the middle of the chaos. There is plenty of tension as the main leads meet peripheral characters who vary between extreme compassion and diabolical self interest. With these side characters you were left in no doubt who the bad guys are. The problem I had with this film is how the main characters were framed. They were clearly the heros to root for yet they were completely awful. They were selfish and entitled to a psychopathic level yet constantly rewarded for it. In the world of Greenland the individual is king and the collective is doomed. If you want to survive take whatever you need, endanger who ever you need and remember YOU are exceptional.

Despite being a successful structural engineer; he has recently moved back home with his wife Allison (Morena Baccarin), and their son Nathan (Roger Dale Floyd).
John and Allison are attempting to rebuild their marriage and despite some awkwardness at first they are moving ahead. In the new film ""Greenland"" life is about to become far more complicated for the Garrity family in the form of a comet that is set to pass very close to earth.The authorities have told the public there is no cause for concern but John notices a large group of military aircraft in the skies shortly before he receives an automated call from Homeland Security telling him to come to an evacuation location with his wife and son.Not sure what to make of the message; things become abundantly clear when a ""harmless fragment"" strikes and destroys a city on live television.
With panic setting in the Garrity family head to the evacuation site only to face complications which leave them separated and facing many dangers and obstacles as they attempt to reunite and get to safety before the big chunk hits in two days.The film is very engaging and what really stood out for me was how the film relied on the cast versus an array of special effects and action sequences which are so common for films in the disaster genre.Despite the circumstances the characters were very relatable and the tension of the pending impact helped shape their actions instead of being a countdown to an elaborate array of FX sequences showing cities being devastated. While there is footage of this sort; it is generally confined to news reports versus being the focal points.Butler was very strong in a departure from his usual action oriented parts as a father trying to make things right in a world that is falling apart around him. It was also nice to hear him using his natural accent for a change as well.
While some may wonder about the timing of releasing a disaster film at the end of 2020 and during the Holiday Season the film is so engaging that it did not matter to me in the slightest.""Greenland"" is a film that came in under the radar in terms of hype and expectation but has delivered an enjoyable and memorable viewing experience that is not to be missed.4 stars out of 5The film will arrive on Video On Demand on 12/18/20",Greenland

But this is a good ass disaster movie. And what makes it work is it doesn't bask in the destruction (well, not too much), but uses it as a backdrop to focus more on the characters and how they respond as the world burns around them. It feels more intimate and small scale than other films of this ilk and as a result it largely works.It's not without flaws - it gets too schmaltzy and Hollywood in the third act. I say this often but so many movies feel like they don't have the strength of their conviction, to follow through and tell a story that fells true rather than a story that fells nice, or comfortable.

222,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,"A Solid Thriller, Gerard Butler's Best Film in Years",7,18 October 2020,"Gerard Butler, let's admit, is an actor everybody who everyone seems to take frivolously because he has never made anything iconic post-300. I admittedly walked into Greenland expecting it will be like Geostorm again, which was a sci-fi film with a great concept but was ultimately forgettable.I snickered at the fact that how Greenland, the country your geography teacher says looks mistakenly larger on a flat world map than in actuality, has become a safe haven for the apocalypse. I can't help but wonder if Gerard Butler fought all his way to Greenland to find out the shelter have limited space and is left outside to burn due to disproportioned cartography.Well, I stand corrected. I was pleasantly surprised by Greenland. Director Ric Roman Waugh and writer Chris Sparling understand the spectacle of the disaster itself isn't nearly as terrifying as the ugly awful things people would do to each other to survive knowing the world will end. Amidst the impending disaster, the film presents the fabric of society tearing apart and humans turning on each other. As for those Roland Emmerich style panoramic disaster shots, Greenland saves them sparingly for the opportune moments.Another aspect in which Greenland differs from the disaster film conventions is that Gerard Butler's character is not trying to save the world. That is out of his depth. He's just trying to save his family. The story stays with the family and everything else that's happening in the world is delivered sparsely through media outlets.What results is a tense gripping thriller that plays towards one's basic survival instincts that forces the audience to wonder what they would do in these given scenarios. What would you do if you get separated from your family? Could you refuse someone who you knew you couldn't help?Greenland's attempt to break its genre wheel with a character-centric approach reminded me of J.A. Bayona's The Impossible, a disaster film that shares that approach, but with arthouse sensibility. With one foot grounded in the commercial blockbuster sensibility, Greenland doesn't quite land as emotionally impactful as The Impossible, but it is solid experience nonetheless.This is Gerard Butler's best film in a long time and it's unfortunate that it's being released at a time where people can't see it in the cinemas.

227,JRmf,Much preferred Deep Impact,6,5 February 2021,"Comparisons of Greenland with the 1998 end-of-the-world thriller Deep Impact are inevitable. In Deep Impact, a comet with a small and large component threatens an ELE Extinction Level Event on planet Earth. The discovery and investigation of the comet are done in great detail (a spaceship called Messiah is sent to destroy it with nukes) and that story is well integrated into happenings on Earth, personal, government & military.In Greenland, the multi-component comet (from another solar system) and the partial disasters it reigns on various parts of the Earth before its ELE, is done as a back story in fragmentary asides. The main story is clearly the battle of the Garrity family to get to WWII fallout shelters in Greenland and survive, a grim and dark affair.In both movies, the human race (apparently) survives.Science doesn't seem to go down so well these days, so that maybe why Greenland was as well or better accepted than Deep Impact in current user and critic scores, even though Greenland is done in a rather sketchy way consistent more with a lower-budget, with numerous inconsistencies (see IMDb writeup).However it's worth noting Deep Impact grossed $334M in 1998, worth about twice that in today's dollars, Greenland so far under $50M.",Greenland

Maybe it is not the most realistic movie, but do all movies have to be? I don't think so.The movie is well done and believable (not sure if scientifically accurate, probably not but it is not a documentary). Yes, people make wrong choices at the heat of a moment (heck, people make wrong choices all the time). So for me, though as watching from the outside some of the characters choices and actions got under my nerves, the truth is that it is perfectly plausible for them to happen in real life.It took me sometime to give this movie a chance because of the low ratings. I am glad I gave it a go. It is entertaining, touching, exciting.",Greenland
229,MovieWarfare,It's not Geostorm that's for sure,6,23 November 2020,"Gerald Butler has been a man that has been in a lot of really bad movies yet despite that I still watch his movies because of his great Scottish accent. Greenland is another disaster movie that stars Gerald Butler. The premise is that ""John Garrity (Gerald Butler), his estranged wife (Morena Baccarin) and their young son (Roger Dale Floyd) embark on a perilous journey to find sanctuary as a planet-killing comet hurtles toward Earth"". Since Gerald Butler movies are mostly a miss, I didn't go into this one with high expectations. Is Greenland terrible like his other disaster movie Geostorm or is this an actual good one?Firstly, I appreciate that this movie takes a serious and more grounded tone and does it well. A fair amount of disaster movies feel really over the top or a bit too cartooney and slapstick like ""2012"". The characters all act like humans and all the interactions feel human which is a breath of fresh air in these type of movies. Another element of this movie that is quite distinct is the heart and kindness within the movie. Apocalyptic movies or TV shows tend to focus on the worst of people but Greenland focuses on the opposite. Albeit there are scenes with the worst of people for sure. A recurring theme in the movie is the act of kindness and while watching this movie in a pandemic (Coronavirus), it's easy to appreciate the good deeds that are shown in the movie. The director (Ric Roman Waugh) and writer (Chris Sparling) show the different ways that people handle this cataclysm including individuals who would just party, riot or remain kind that feels believable. The action scenes with the Earth's destruction do occur in the movie but the human drama is the main focus.Speaking of the action scenes, while rare, are visually spectacular and lead to some stunning and tense moments. For the most part, the CGI is pretty good but it does get really bad and jarring in the third act. Likewise, the cast does a pretty good job. Morena Baccarin gives a good performance as a fiercely loving mother that is desperate to protect her son. Gerald Butler is a lot better in this movie than a lot of his previous movies even though he is still mostly just the gruff-looking dad. Roger Dale Floyd who is the child actor is not unbearable like a fair amount of child actors. All three of them are mostly giving okay performances but every one of them has one moment where their performance shines.When it comes to flaws it is mostly concerning the way the story is progressing. For the movie to last 2 hours, there are a lot of moments where our main characters tend to make jarring decisions. Most of this is concerning the wife who I just feel makes a lot of dumb decisions in this movie. You do have to kind of shut your brain to watch this movie or else you will constantly go question a lot of things. The movie also has some pacing issues in my opinion as at some points it feels like it dragging a bit and slowing the movie. The movie does start to feel a bit long and could have cut 10-15 minutes off the total run time.On that point of characters, they are quite bland. The movie never really delves into the characters that much and instead are more focusing on their situation. This can work such as in ""Dunkirk (2017)"" but for this movie, I feel they should have explored a bit more about our characters. Apart from the dad John who is a structural engineer, I don't know much about the wife Allison and I don't know much about the kid apart from he is diabetic which is the main thing that keeps this movie going for 2 hours. It's slightly difficult to be fully invested in caring about the characters. We also get a revelation near the beginning of the third act that feels irrelevant and if anything makes it more difficult for me to care about the characters.Overall, this is a surprisingly all-right movie from Gerald Butler. It's not the garbage that was Geostorm which is great. With all the gloom that is happening in the real world, this movie provides some mild entertainment with a hopeful message that is maybe something we kind of need at this time. You definitely won't feel like it was the worst 2 hours you spent after watching this movie.",Greenland

236,Beachbum2018,"Seen better, seen worse disaster movies",5,8 February 2021,"When it started I thought great this might actually be a decent disaster movie, but after about 15 minutes the plot deviated into the usual human melodrama.... why do US made movies have to do that, don't the script writers know how to write anything other than human melodrama.
Look if it's supposed to be an end of the world sci-fi, so #1 get the science right for crying out loud. Why in the name of hell were they going to Greenland, aren't there other underground bunkers / caves on mainland US that would work just as well.
Then there was the unnecessary sick kid factor, only required plot wise to separate the family, after which it's all about then being reunited.
If this was a real no-way-out-of-it cataclysm why would anyone waste their time robbing a supermarket for TV's, etc, food and medicine yes, but most people knowing what's coming would stock up and head for the nearest underground cave system, etc!
Ok so it wasn't all terrible, acting wasn't bad, even though the female lead came across as a bit of spoiled suburban housewife character wise, but the character development could have been better. And yes finally we get a movie without an annoying screaming kid, good one!
CGI, was OK, not brilliant but the science was all over the place!
Max 5 stars, though it was watchable, just not brilliant!Somebody in the movie industry has got to get to grips with sci-fi and get 'Rendezvous With Rama' made, PLEASE, if that's done properly, and no melodrama PLEASE.... you will have one of the best movies ever made on your hands!",Greenland

The movie itself created a few intense moments but it wasn't that impactful. Acting wise it wasn't anything that caught our eyes specifically.
Throughout the whole movie there are a lot of scenes which will make you remember about a movie that you have watched before. Editing, transition and cinematography could be better and more polished.

239,PerryAtTheMovies,"Not spectacular, but definitely worth watching....",6,7 February 2021,"A not so terrible end of the world thriller that is emotional and actually worth the watch if you're looking for something new and recent to watch.Initial Thoughts:
""Greenland"" basically has the hallmarks of a b-list movie, but for what it's worth, a not so terrible end of the world thriller that has us following a family selected for safety. Although the effects and animations of the film isn't something you'd expect for a film made for 2020, it doesn't takeaway from the story. Ultimately, this story for survival was fun to watch as not everything from start to finish goes smoothly. There are a lot of bumps along the way before the end.So the story is about the mother of all comets about to hit Earth and once it does. It will leave the world in an apocalyptic aftermath. You think, ""ok so just another end of the world film?"" Yes and no. How we get to the end offers some head scratching wonders, but the true basis of the film is the emotional aspect. I found that this film wasn't just a surface scratcher, but rather a film that went a bit subsurface and talks not only about humanity clinging to one another in a dark time, but how one family, amidst their own tribulations, can come closer together. The story does offer some tugs at emotional heartstrings and that's one reason why this is a good film.Perhaps the downside to this film, however, is the animation/effects of the film. Here you are trying to destroy the world, and no offence, but the graphics look similar to that of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (2004). Not the worst, but certainly not the best, especially for 2020.Overall:
The condensed version of above is that although the effects of the film aren't the best. They definitely don't takeaway from how enjoyable this film ended up being for me. I was more invested in whether the family would reunite as one and survive until the end, rather than focusing on the inconvenient and ""perfectly timed"" placement of falling comets.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'If you are looking for something new, yes, this should satisfy your action/thriller needs.'Enjoy the show!",Greenland

245,Ansango,One of the most entertaining disaster film in recent years,7,3 February 2021,"Greenland is like zillions of disaster films made over years where our world is going to end and a handful of survivors try to get through the calamity but unlike most of those it focuses less on spectacle on more on the humane aspects of the story. It is the story of a family trying to pull out through the ultimate catastrophe which is going to end almost all of the human race.The film begins with a news broadcast about comet named Clarke is going to pass really close to Earth. Our protagonist John Garrity, a structural engineer, who is having some problems in his marriage, is preparing for his seven-year-old son Nathan's birthday when he receives an automated message from the US government stating that he along with his family has been selected for emergency sheltering. He soon learns that a large chunk of Clarke has hit Florida and has extirpated the entire city has also ravaged nearby areas. An even larger chunk is soon going to hit Earth which will cause an extinction level event. They soon head out to the airport but are soon rejected due to their son's diabetic condition. Meanwhile the society has erupted in chaos and amidst it they get separated. After facing several challenges along their way, they finally meet at their parent's house and head out for a final shot at catching a flight which will take them to Greenland, where emergency sheltering is available.The story is nothing new but has been told in an exciting way and once it picks the pace it starts getting more intense with each passing moment. It's the story of a journey of the family, and the journey never feels humdrum due to its relentless pace and a sterling screenplay. The best thing which works in the favour of the film is it's focus on human emotions instead of CGI extravaganza. Ultimately, it's a tale of family, forgiveness and survival with a disaster looming in the background. But apart from the emotional core, it also contains some really thrilling set pieces which are spectacular in their own right.Acting is top-notch especially the scene where the family bids goodbye to the old grandpa, played incredibly by Scott Glenn, who refuses to come on the journey with them as he wants to spend his last moments in the house in which all his memories reside. This particular scene is the beating heart of the film and consolidates the theme of family and forgiveness even further. Glenn is astonishing in his short cameo and leaves a really lasting impression, truly he is the such an underrated character actor and among the best artists of his generation. If this particular scene doesn't bring you to tears, maybe there is something wrong with you. His dialogue with his grandson where he tells him that they are soon going to meet even though he isn't going to, conveys a range of emotions from sadness to contentment to the acceptance of inevitability. The proud feeling on his face along with a genuinely warm smile when her daughter congratulates her on finishing the house, and the poignancy in his eyes when he finally says his last goodbye to his family are all exceptionally written and filmed. This one scene alone is worth the ticket-price. The track about contention between John and Allison due to some past misunderstanding could have been developed better and honestly sticks like a sore-thumb.Visuals are great and even though it has a low budget, there are plenty of impressive shots like the debris rain on highway, the destruction of Florida, the last montage of the devastated Earth, are really well done. The film loses some points in the ending where there was a perfect moment to end the film but it continues for extra 2 minutes to show the now battered earth and the conversation between various nation's over radio. While there is nothing inherently wrong with this scene, but it would have been more thematically satisfying, had the film ended on the shot where the family hugs each other and reminiscence their happy memories while the screen fades to black.Although it isn't going to win any awards for its ingenuity, it's not as bad as people expected it to be after the literal disaster that was Geostorm. I wasn't expecting it to be a great film and it isn't but the sheer entertainment value it provides is enough to give it a go. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it surpassed all my expectations and frankly that's all I wanted, to have a good time. It's a rare disaster flick which has heart and spectacle in right amount.",Greenland

Another primal sin is to call this movie Greenland where nothing (or very little) actually happens in greenland, so if you expect some greenlandic stories, you will not find it here.
I liked the fact that the movie doesn't end with just the disaster itself so there are some saving graces for this movie (there is even one good shot of the wife (Morena Baccarin) on the first five minutes of the movie, but nothing much of her to see after that. You are left with Gerard Butler to carry this movie, but his performance is not strong enough to do that.

252,IndridC0ld,"An ""impact"" movie with impact. Carl Sagan would have approved its accuracy.",8,6 April 2021,"Just because a story has been told before, does not mean it cannot be told better. What this cosmic collision film has going for it is its very realistic grounding in actual science and, just as interestingly, the accurate depictions of the politics and emotions of large scale disasters. I felt very much like I was viewing a docu-drama based upon an actual event. Yes, some viewers will complain about the overused plot conventions employed in this kind of film. The estranged husband and wife, their sickly only child, and the old man who is looking forward to joining his wife in the hereafter. However, it is the small details that make this film so believable. The total unpreparedness of the government (this takes place in 2020 after all), as well as the extremely rapid breakdown of law and order, all seemed ripped from the headlines of today. We also have a believable helping of xenophobia and implied racial tension, but all are well within the bounds of life today.In short, this film tells its story in a way that will have you thinking ""what would I do under those circumstances?"" I was also VERY IMPRESSED with the depiction of the disaster itself. The appearance of the comet named ""Clark"" is the stuff of nightmares. The nightmarish depiction of the incoming cometary fragments lighting up the night sky prior to impact might very well have been copied from nightmares I have had about this topic.

Greenland shows the fear and mass hysteria of the people better than any other impact movie. I had the feeling, of being right there. And I assume, in the real world such a catastrophy would exactly happen like this. the military tries to coordinate and control the civils, but soon it runs out of control. the message of the movie is: when we realize it will be over soon, suddenly we see what really matters in life. we are focussed on money and our position in society, but all that ego, hate and greed is worthless. beside of that, all material things decay and become worthless. in the end, what really matters is love and friendhsip, compassion and forgiveness. after the 2 lead actors went through that survival experience, especially she realized, how much we need each other, and she forgives him.",Greenland

The sense of ""how stupid/gullible do they think we are"" is the only theme that is followed through to perfection.Overstating the obvious and trusting the audience to swallow any amount of improbable script, hook, line and sinker, is the premise upon which Greenland is created.It, arguably, provides escapism - but that would require that you don't spend most of the time being ""real life irritated"" over how poorly made this is - and that's a big ask.Move along people - nothing to see here...",Greenland

264,Hillius,Decent Popcorn muncher,7,1 October 2021,"Greenland is a mostly enjoyable, not too graphic disaster film that I would say is almost suitable for the entire family to watch. It is exciting, flashy, and tense, but has plenty of emotional scenes and other feel good moments to make it more of a positive rarity these days as far as films go.This reviewer can say that the plot lost out to the special effects department and that the science just got lost in the mix, but the writing certainly wasn't the most atrocious thing heard recently.Parts that felt a bit more contrived were the family issues, the cliche husband infidelity and the ailing helpless child. Most of the characters in this film were pretty much one dimensional and largely consisted of very helpful strangers including a classified survival shelter that just waves in all comers. Gangs, nationalists, and crazy people were the biggest threat beneath this falling sky.Overall, Greenland did feel like something of a preview for the next upcoming film. This reviewer did enjoy the refreshing take on disaster that there was no need as in other disaster films to show massive pointless deaths, but instead these were implied.Greenland was a satisfying watch and this reviewer was happy to see the legendary Scott Glen on screen again. Gerard Butler, Morena Bacccarin and. RD Floyd made for a nice family in crisis. 7/10.",Greenland

There isn't much of a story, the characters are super clumsy, and the special effects are sparse and mediocre. I had to fast forward through parts of the movie because a lot of scenes were slow and boring, plus didn't add to the story.At least The movie didn't insult the viewers by having Gerald Butler play a scientist. 😅",Greenland

It have good script, proper storyline, best acting performances from great cast, great action stuff, just like when I'm watching all those action films back in the day.. (p/s I'm a teenagers, not that old)
Gerald Butler always giving his best, he's one of my favorite actor.

270,thales-63045,A disaster movie. Sorry I meant a disastrous movie,2,5 February 2021,"Let's start with the positives. It has an ending. I read some of the reviews by others and wondered if I was watching the same film. It's a love story. It must be because my wife hates scifi/disaster movies and loves love stories. It makes Deep Impact and Armageddon look good. It's totally unbelievable in the science department. I know they need some artistic licence but this was a travesty. Had the writers forgot about things like angular momentum, inertia, Newton's First Law of Motion, the fact the Earth orbits the sun at a speed of 30km/S from school? Mind you these guys can drive to Osgoode from Lexington in a few hours and go from there to Greenland in a small twin engined aircraft again in a few hours. Sheesh. Unbelievable as all this is is the fact that the film portrays governments as able to organise an evacuation of epic proportions whereas in the real world the various government actions on trying to subdue a virus shows the opposite. There is so much wrong with this film it defies logic. The acting is okay but Butlers accent is all over the place with his Paisley twang evident at times. All in all very poor.",Greenland

272,leonshikto,Great Drama,6,10 March 2021,"Well, I just had to watch this movie because I knew it will be intense when Gerard Butler is on the cast and it is a movie about an extinction level event. I also have to say it was because of Morena and she performed really well.Why is this different?
Well for me it was more focused on people especially the family of the protagonist and how they make all attempts to stick together and survive. It also shows a somewhat true nature of humans doing whatever they can to survive rather than creating a cool looking Earth desruction scene. Hence, I will give this movie 1/2 on story, 1/1 on plot setting and 1/2 on cinematography and directing.I liked the performance of the leading casts and I would say they deserve 1.5/2. From my personal experience this movie always created a tensed atmosphere so I would give it 1.5/2.",Greenland
273,maitreg,Intense apocalyptic movie with good science but Very Dumb main characters,7,30 June 2021,"First thing: apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, and dystopian movies are my favorites. Greenland ranks right up there among the best in these genres. It's very well done, intense, terrifying, and easy to relate to .That being said, Greenland is a mixed bag of good, bad, and weird. Most of the science is pretty good, special effects are terrific, fight scenes are intense and realistic, and it's very easy to get emotionally engaged with the plight of the main and side characters.Some of the science and physics were a little suspect, to make it more dramatic and entertaining. For instance, the comet's tail in one scene was facing the wrong direction (it should be facing away from the sun, not away from its trajectory), and all of the sounds were unrealistic. In every scene with an impact or explosion, it did not account for the speed of sound, and sounds were heard instantly. Literally every scene got it wrong.The WORST was the absolute stupidity, self-serving, and oftentimes outright homicidal decision-making by the main characters. I'd have to say these were perhaps the dumbest main characters I've ever seen in an apocalyptic movie. They never seemed to take the individual situations as seriously as they should, and they kept failing to prioritize correctly (seriously, who remembers to bring sandwiches and t-shirts on a life-and-death one-way plane trip but forgets their child's insulin in the car).In multiple scenes, the Garrities--carrying around extremely sought-after wristbands that is the only ticket to survival--just wear them out in the open and openly discuss that they were ""selected"" with complete strangers. In one particular scene, the male lead John Garrity, after finding out his wife and child had been kicked off of a plane, just before a security perimeter was breached and 1000s of people rushed the airport, stood perfectly still on a cargo bay door, watching nonchalantly as a bloodthirsty crowd of hundreds of people rushed toward the plane that was trying to take off, single-handedly (and inexplicably) holding up the the plane from taxying and taking off, triggering a series of events that resulted in the gruesome deaths of dozens of people. This was just an example. Throughout the movie, each of the male and female lead made repeated, idiotic decisions that endangered themselves, their child, and innocent people around them.That is really my biggest complaint about the movie. The lead characters (who are supposed to be the protagonists that we related to and cheer for) were so dumb and got so many people killed, I began wishing for their demise so that people around them would no longer be put in so much danger. Their mindsets and decision-making simply made no sense, and it's apparent from the way the plot played out the writers intentionally made them very ignorant and short-sighted to enhance the drama and limit their chances of survival.This movie could have been a 10/10 if the main characters were more relatable and not so stupid, but as it was, they almost ruined the movie. 7/10.",Greenland

I love end of the world/disaster movies and in a way there is some kind of predictability in them. However, this movie took me on a ride to a reality if ever this happens now and it is scary. The faith in humanity is in question because these are the things we would have to deal with in a crisis like this. I totally recommend this movie. It is intense! It makes you feel and think about what is really important. I would have given it a 10 but I wanted a little build up with the 3 main characters, get to know them a little bit before the impact. Also, I would have liked to see more aftermath of the comet effect like tsunami etc. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed it. Great watch!",Greenland
278,cristinalinderman,A great solid disaster film.,8,18 December 2020,"* There is no end credit scene *The director Ric Roman Waugh and crew brought a great solid disaster film. The story is about a family that struggles to survive in a catastrophic natural disaster. When I saw the trailer I knew it was going to be a good one and it erased in my mind completely of another disaster film which also the same main male actor was in. The movie was called Geostorm (2017) and it was terrible but it wasn't a shock since the trailer looked bad, thankfully Greenland was over the top and even better than most that are considered the greatest ones in that genre.The way the film sets the pace was terrific especially the depth of the suspense. This is the kind of film which was predictable in what was bound to happen to them but still, the unfolding of the events was thrilling and intense. I was on the edge of my seat most of the time and what I thought about most was ""what's going to happen next"". I liked how real it all felt because this kind of event like in many films, has shown how the government always protects first what they considered the important people even if it's unfair because every life is precious. I also liked that they shot the perspective of the people, not the government, there are many movies already with the viewpoint of the government and this film shot the struggle of a family. The meaning of being human is tested it showed the heartfelt compassion of some people given the situation but it mostly showed the cruelty and the length some go just to survive and not caring the damage left behind. The film is mainly about how some people stop being human beings and all through the instinct of survival. I didn't expect to have tears but I did when the main actor said ""you are my life"" that scene was so perfectly emotional, I could feel every second of it and the music helped immensely.The composer David Buckley sets the thriller atmosphere fantastically and he also sets an emotional music theme the one which starts the film anchoring the pace of the events about to unfold.The main cast was fantastic as ever and all the praise goes to Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin, both of them gave magnificent performances. Morena Baccarin deserves to be in more films, the way she touches his face in the most emotional scene, so much feeling what a natural talent.",Greenland

It's intimate and psychological, much more than you would expect from this movie genre.The separation of the characters create different points of view that come together to tell the story and this structure is well thought.I really felt connected to the characters and the whole thing felt truly intense.

The acting is SOLID, what a great cast! Gerard Butler is seriously wayyy better than the B movies they continuously throw his way. (super successful B movies that make him lots of money, so I'm not surprised really) Definitely worth a few hours indoors, since you have nothing to do anyways because of Covid.If you have a low IQ and like movies where terrible cgi is the star, like San Andreas, then you might want to skip this.

The people who got it most right are the partygoers on the roof, as I don't think the post apocalyptic world is that appetising.Most hilarious woke event was the total destruction of Europe, so the problematic whitey finally gets it & the world can start again, I wish I didn't think that, but that's totally the intention. Also an F.U. movie moment was when an angry mob raids a pharmacy, & Baccarin begs for her life from a black rioter brandishing a shotgun, not only does he let her go, but helps her up like an angel - movie - Pulease!!!! The only 2 'bad guys' in the film are both white guys, OK fine, but don't expect me not to notice it. I just want everyone to be equally good & bad, 2 wrongs don't make a right & pissing off the majority of the audience IS NOT the answer.The ending shows them emerging from bunkers after 9 months, I'm not sure this would be possible after the ELE portrayed.Engaging & perfectly watchable.",Greenland

I didn't find much of the critical reviews to be true at all, as I (an analytical-minded person) find it hard to overlook glaring holes in the plot or stretching reality a little too far. And while this movie stretched things a little here and there to make it more dramatic, it didn't pull me out of the movie. I thought the acting was really good from the stars and I liked how this movie was more focused on the characters dealing with the disaster than focusing on the disaster itself. Also, the CGI was the best I've seen for these types of movies - extremely realistic. The only major criticism I have is: what the heck was going on with Gerard Butler's accent?

What makes this movie different from other survival movies is that it's a lot more realistic plot wise and action wise.

Those Meteors would have been noticed months and months or even years before that. Then Greenland became the chosen place. Why? If you assumed 75% of the earth would be wiped out how did you know Greenland would be the safest place even though you havent got the technology to spot meteors?Literally as soon as they got picked his name appears on the main TV...wth? Ok so yeh that WOULDNT cause you to get you ass kicked long before you got on board. Then as the kid was trying to get his insulin it dawned on me; why they taking a sick kid...as soon as I thought that up comes a new sub plot of trying to get the kid somewhere safe. Zzzz.So after being modern day superheros of our time (I mean look at all the things they avoided/survived from) Butler's character stops a plane and has a joke about his friggin weight? Then the plane crashed and the kid said in a joke way ""I'm not flying again"" lol I'm.being serious.Lastly to sum up...Greenland is small. Far too small to have countless planes landing there. But guess what there was plenty of room. You got all the 'elite' of the world just being overrun by the under achievers of the world and erm, this isn't going to cause mass riots when they want to get to there new homes?Im still shocked 900 degree winds going speed of light didn't manage to flatten the Eiffel tower.

The movie is absolutely fantastic, and probably the tenth best movie I've seen on my 12 years on earth! I think the reason Greenland got rated 6.4 is that it's not really an action movie more of a drama, but I wouldn't change anything about it.The reason this movie is so good is that it's very intense, ominous, exciting and edge of seat thriller, and has some very emotional parts.

No way Gerard Butler uses flowery cursive. Plot is also unfocused. Had medium hopes for this movie. Did not deliver on even modest expectations.,Greenland
311,TheLegendOfThe42,"You won't find much logic here, but...",6,15 March 2021,"Yes, but. But what?Let's be honest here. Have you ever seen a distaster movie that made sense? Probably not. Well, this is no exception. The whole comet thing was completely implausible, some situations felt forced and clichéd, some were downright stupid, BUT:GREENLAND still manages to capture, especially in the first half. The scope of events is terrifying and is presented in a way that made me forget about the implausibilities. at least most of the time. I also found the reactions of many characters to be more human than in most films of that sort, further adding a bit of credibility.That being said, I could have done without the stereotypical and boring familiy thing going on, even though the performances were quite good in general. It's just that I'm quite fed up with this dysfunctional family with a sick kid trope, and in my view, this is the film's biggest flaw.Oh, and when will filmmakers learn how smartphones work? When you put that thing close to your face to take a call, the screen TURNS OFF. If it doesn't, and you're going for that sweet close-up, my immersion is gone, and my brain will immediately scream ""FAKE, FAKE, SEE THAT?"". But maybe I should be more forgiving - we only had these things for about 15 years, right?Don't expect a 2012 style movie, this doesn't have an awful lot of action. But if you're willing to be a bit forgiving, GREENLAND can make you see how things could be a lot worse than they are right now. And that's something, I guess.",Greenland
312,TruView,Death by Meteorite...,6,18 May 2021,"... isn't exactly a novel concept, but it is amusing. What made it so engrossing above and beyond other contenders in the same category were the much improved special effects.Secondly, were the gruesome circumstances pitting friends and loved against each other. While entertaining, it also gave us clear examples of how desperation can drive decent men (and women) to commit unspeakable acts.The single recurring question you'll be asking yourselves is this: What would I do in that situation?",Greenland
313,pinkled5,Better than a lot of disaster movies,7,20 December 2020,"Entertaining. I thought Gerard and Morena's performances were fantastic. Some really emotional moments. Wasn't perfect, I didn't agree with all the story decisions, but I thought they did a good job overall.",Greenland

Cosmic apocalypse something, huh?My concern is not much for me to enjoy the whole scenes. Actors did well. A big appreciation for director. Some would see it is 2012 repackaged, kind of, but the acts cover it all up. The drama of devastating chaotic world for not knowing what to do to survive, kind people blends with evil people are surrounding them, I feel the tension is so real.Way much better than 2012.",Greenland

316,in-imdb-1,Spectacular,10,15 November 2020,"Well, I am not frequently giving high scores, you can check by clicking my user name, confirming this is a real review as well. The movie is definitely underrated (barely above 6 at the time of this review on November the 15th). I am giving a 10 for several reasons. Most of all, as I said, it is underrated and I hope to raise the final score a bit. This movie is not perfect, but it is very good. It is a disaster movie but it is not a mere copy of existing ones, it has its own flavor. I found that certain periods, although not all of them, are very detailed and highly realistic, especially when it comes to military management. Social psychology has an important place in the movie, not only intra family relations, but general human interactions when confronted to threats to life. Butler has a more developed role than usual, less muscular, more next door guy and this is better. Maybe he can become a more subtle actor ans gain bigger roles à la Bruce Willis, yet I find it hard to relate to, and he is barely likable, same goes for the rest of the cadt actually. I found the kid annoying, to be honest, way too fragile and whiny even for his age. I suppose this is plausible if he was overprotected, etc. Even though I did not bond with the characters, it was worth following them, quite a thrill. There are spectacular pictures that do not always entail explosions and destructions. I will not spoil, and I will simply say that it builds a frightening atmosphere. Situations can be disturbing to very young viewers. In conclusion, this is a hollywood grade movie, and its two hours are never boring. Try it and make your own opinion. I think the movie deserves at least 7 or even 8.",Greenland
317,shawthingproductions,They ran out of money or patience.,5,14 November 2020,"Gerrard Butler is usually pretty good value. You know what you're getting and this certainly started like any other Butler film. Like able characters (if a bit paper thin) and interesting dynamics and settings.The plot (spoiler free) is about a giant asteroid (and little ones) which are about to hit the world. One of which is a Planet killer. Luckily for Butler his family has been selected to be rescued and taken to a secure location. Of course things go tits up.The film started well. The effects were great and everything was going well. There were some good scenes (showing how nasty humans can be in times of peril) and, again, I was excited for it but...About midway in they seemed to lose interest / money / patience.The plot got stupid. Phones are down until one very lucky first try call to a character... The effects (airplane is all I need to say) are atrocious, even the ""set"" after the effects take place. It's clearly a studio with a lot of scenery painting going on. Frankly, for 2020, it is embarrassing. It's like the effects aren't finished. By now everything has gone off the rails and I actually found myself bored rigid and glad for the ending.A shame because it started so well.",Greenland
318,bbv-69237,Total Plot Hole - why are movies this silly nowadays,3,25 December 2020,This review must include a spoiler because it is what happens that my review is based upon. Family selected for saving from impending catastrophe - the child has a serious medical problem - the parents leave his life saving medication in the car - the father goes back to get it - authorities find out the boy is sick - they explain there are no medications or medical support available in the shelter - the mother and child are rejected and forced to leave - the father returns with medications - the mother somehow finds medications (2 weeks worth) just before he dies - the father somehow finds them - they somehow get to Iceland and enter the shelter - they all emerge a year or so later and all is good - where did they get the medications to last for a year?!! Totally unbelievable and ridiculous. Other than that it was OK.,Greenland
319,brockfal,Old fashioned disaster flick,6,13 March 2021,"A comet crashes into our planet and one family tries to survive the ensuing apocalyptic events, this reminded me of those disaster movies from the 70s (Towering Inferno, Earthquake etc). It's cliched, the script is a bit variable, as is some of the acting, but it was an enjoyable romp, aided by some excellent CGI effects and action scenes that just keep on coming. Nothing original, and a worthwhile diversion.",Greenland

This is a movie about an impact from space, so of course the elements used are going to be similar then those in previous space rock movies.It s like making another Jaws movie and complaining about sharks being in it. This one was done however with few but very efficient and convincing effects. I seldomly consider a film good enough to merit a 10, but this one is outstanding. Two hours of solid entertainment done on the fraction of the budget of many other disaster movies. Absolutely brilliant.",Greenland

There was some good special effects, acting was ok, camera work was ok, drama level was ok - it was intense 2 hours.It makes you think about life, about your family, about the things we have for granted and how easy are our lifes with all the modern tools and technologies.Many people easily ignore the fact that the events in this movie could really happen to us. It's nothing unnatural, it happened before - it can happen again.How will you act if something like this is upon you??My rating: 6/10",Greenland

Bad decisions, ridiculous sentimentality including overblown music; I truly laughed out loud more than a few times. Good effects, though.Well, I gave it a three because I saw it to the end. But, frankly, only because I wanted to see these characters get wiped out by a burning chunk. I was hoping it might take out the writers, director, and music composer, too! Yikes. Truly a disaster (of a) film.I do note this is a minority opinion and many people seem to like it....",Greenland
325,SeriousMayhem,Not a typical disaster movie,7,10 March 2021,"For a disaster movie, this one has less focus on the actual disaster, and more on some of the people that have to deal with that disaster. I personally found it refreshing to not see a motley crew of heroes trying to save the planet once again against all odds. This is just a story about some people trying to survive.While you have to turn off your brain at some points during the movie, because either what happens is pretty silly or the characters involved do silly stuff to advance the plot, overall the ride was entertaining; some parts are quite good and realistic, complimented by great acting. The ending however, was terrible.So, a mixed bag. Know what to expect and don't expect a masterpiece, because it's not, not by a longshot. If you can do that, you might enjoy this movie just as I did. There's a decent movie hidden beneath there somewhere, if you care to look for it.7/10.",Greenland

This film in one word is spectacular. It scores on so many levels. In no particular order, it is about family, it is about real love, and having to go through hell only to realise that.It shows people at their best and their worst in terrible situations. The special effects are without doubt some of the best ive ever seen.This is a well written, well acted disaster movie...Gerard Butler is worth 10 of any other actor in macho roles, His wife played by Morena Baccarin is equally terrific.

Pretty interesting premise, but the script was way too campy to be engaging in the slightest. A frustrating watch, took multiple trips away from the TV and had non-related conversation throughout without really missing anything aside from the cliche conflicts you could find in any disaster movie. 2012 does nearly everything better.",Greenland

Perhaps if Roland Emmerich had directed it, who knows. And he probably should because this film unashamedly merged key plots from both Deep Impact and 2012. There is a lottery system for the selected few and when Gérards family can't get on their plane to Greenland, they follow another journey to get to the saviourland before the big event unfolds - and of course, just in the nick of time. I can only say that this film shallowly attempts to depict the breakdown of humanity in what runtime is available. The main characters are plain annoying and their characters decisions just plain dumb. This film is neither a crowd pleaser, nor is it particularly thought provoking. Definitely not re-watchable. Immediately follow this up with a coffee and watch Deep Impact and feel the effect of adding a quality cast to a tragic storyline.",Greenland

Much time was wasted in story development and background of characters was entirely lacking. A much better job had already been done in a previous movie. If you want a good movie in this genre, watch Deep Impact; far better story and more logical events. I gave this movie a low rating because the fine actors were wasted on this mundane film. 🙄",Greenland
334,derbo73,A distaster not a disaster movie,3,17 February 2021,"The movie is characterized by horrible overacting, endless tumbliness of the main character and a script that constantly confuses suspense with senseless hectic. One would think that a civil engineer, who has already mastered various crises in his working life, would react a bit more alert and understanding to the threat that is announced to him several times. And then perhaps not behave completely naively and stumble into every problem situation that presents itself, no matter how obvious. But no, one can trust all fellow men and must help them even in the face of total annihilation, the good citizen in persona.In addition there are various stupidities on the part of the military and the evacuation forces, so that in no time the rescue planes must explode. ""What a pity,"" is rightly said in one of the many ridiculous dialogues. And despite all the adversities, everyone reunites on Grandpa's farm in no time, where the old lunkhead is waiting for the end, while our hero once again musters all his strength to bravely curve through the bombenhagel and finally reaches the saving bunkers on Greenland. The schmaltzy ending 12 months later, with a view of a devastated world, already has biblical qualities.The movie really works off all the clichés, from marauding gangs (who murderingly raid a plundered pharmacy) to seemingly nice helpers who then cruelly try to steal the club wristband and also kidnap the sick boy in the process. Which of course is exposed and they get their just punishment. Even absurdities are used to be transformed into a perfect world message.There is a lot of helplessness and painful inertia on the part of the main character, a lot of whining and running around on the part of the wife and child, and, now and then, unconvincing special effects of impacts and eerie glowing skies (shouldn't pieces of comets hit at very high speeds and flat angle, not rain down vertically at max falling velocity?). A typical U.S. disaster movie that generates neither fear nor suspense, but frequent head-shaking to the point of aggression toward the protagonist. Not a bit of drama, not a bit of horror or suspense, unconvincing action and a storyline that someone thought up in five minutes on the loo. Absolutely not worth seeing, then rather stare at the wall.",Greenland

336,pgeary6001,Solid Disaster Flick,8,24 August 2021,"Greenland largely fulfills the expectations for the genre, with a series of seemingly insurmountable perils facing the family of Gerard Butler. Added fun comes from listening to his accent wobble, which begins with his very first lines and is later explained by a shoehorned in reference to a kilt and his homeland.The CGI is respectable, although one doesn't get the impression the budget was generous for this type of film.

Add a few cups of ""race against the clock, yet against astronomical odds the main characters end up together by the end"". Then mix in a little bit of ""the kid, of course, has a medical condition/diabetes"" and you've got the trifecta baby!Its not a bad movie, per se, its just very cliche from top to bottom, with 'noble sacrifices' and 'good people turned bad because of the situation' and 'oh no, we lost our macguffin!' and 'PLEASE... MY CHILD!' you're probably already seeing the movie in your head while reading this, huh?All of the actors do a fine job, but often the mood didnt fit the reality of the scene or how people should be acting/reacting.
A few of the special effects were janky, but overall they were fine and non-distracting.
The plot is thread thin, but they always are in these kinda movies.
Score was forgettable. The sound effects of the movie were both underwhelming and overwhelming at different times (with my 5.1 surround sound setup).
The DP did well enough, with a lot of opportunity for ""SHAKE THE CAMERA AS HARD AS WE CAN AHHHHH!!!!!"" moments that the bait was rarely taken for.It wasnt good. It wasnt bad. It was adequate. Especially in these dry days of media entertainment.

340,politicidal,Surprisingly very good despite its B-movie premise.,8,14 March 2021,"Greenland could had been just a simple popcorn flick. Instead it winds up being something more thoughtful, suspenseful, and at several times, frightening.Gerard Butler plays a family man who races to get his family to sanctuary before a comet strikes the Earth, killing off 75% of all life on the planet. This immediately sounds like another schlocky SyFy Channel movie.But the mood is far darker and the gravity of the situation is never played for laughs. It feels like an older more serious minded disaster movie from the golden age of science fiction cinema. The spectacle is appropriately played more like a horrific catastrophe instead of brainless eye candy. In fact, there's many scenes that demonstrate how scary people can be if they're driven to the end of their wits facing an extinction-level-event.Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin are both good. Although it's hard to tell if Butler is supposed to American, because his accent is thicker than usual in many scenes. The kid isn't annoying as far as his acting goes, but he does make some dumb decisions. Scott Glenn has a minor role but he's very good in it.The cynical argument would be that the movie resonates better because it was released during the pandemic. No, I can safely say that this is one of the best disaster films in years. It's certainly Gerard Butler's best movie in ages.",Greenland

""Deep Impact"" ""Armageddon"", or ""Meteor"" in 1979 told the comet/asteroid story better. And the ""estranged couple reuniting in a crisis"" has been done to death...all the way back to Barbara Stanwyck and Clifton Webb in ""Titanic"" (1953) or Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner in ""Earthquake"" (1975). See also ""War of the Worlds"", or ""San Andreas"" or ""2012"" for the same tired old plot device.

Also surprising fact that I didn't know it would be possible to make it nowadays but they somehow included a clumsy female lead into a movie. It's been a long time to see one since diversity is the center piece of Hollywood movies now (I admit, even this nonsense is preferable than forced empowerment act).Thank god these issues don't keep up for long and it's becoming somehow better. In short it's an oldschool apocalypse movie with similar characters you've seen before, nothing special. Yet no matter what, it's above the average if you consider it's a 2020 movie.

349,sherylchilders82,"More than clichéd, deeply flawed",4,16 May 2021,"Why are simple empty action flicks like this still being made? The formula works - there's nothing wrong with the familiar, but it's which familiar clichés that the writers picked that are troubling.There's nothing more primitive than fighting to survive and protect loved ones, but this film in 2021 still puts the father at the heart of the story, with Mom barely managing to keep the child in her care. And, to top that off, he's almost taken by another man, with that man's wife, as well as the mother, being helpless to do anything about it.But, with all their running, they still manage to visit her father, with the main guy winning his love before he dies with his horse. Really? This is so deeply rooted in misogyny that I doubt the writer was even aware of it. This is when we learn, too, that they'd been fighting because he cheated, which all ends when the wife concedes that it was also her fault. Then, gramps says bye for the last time, passing ownership of his daughter to her husband. Oh the sexist irony.And, how selfish and illogical is Butler's character? I guess he never thought about the neighbor, again, who he promised to call. But, leaving a note when he took a car then saving a guy from a burning car, who wasn't going to survive anyway, was definitely important to the plot, to remind us what a good guy he was. Let's not forget that he only knew where to go because a black guy told him, and then promptly died. And killing the guy with the hammer is totally pointless. He didn't even need his wrist band in the end.Ok, let's remind ourselves why the large moral is flawed. Privileged white guy, who is highly successful, faces hardship because of circumstances and systemic failure and injustice (no chronic diseases allowed). Of course he doesn't have a chronic disease, but his child does. And, the government can build a bunker in weeks but forgot to screen for chronic illness in family members? Makes sense. This story is a fairy tale for privileged white guys, not based in reality.And, I'm cool to enjoy the ride in light of all the unwokeness, but the story is just not that impressive overall. Nothing really surprises or feels original. Familiar is good, too, but there needs to be something new. And, heart pumping action is great, but it doesn't have to be rooted in 1950s values. I actually like these actors, so it's disappointing to see them do something so bad, even if it is a blockbuster. Just once, I'd like to see a family disaster flick with more brains.",Greenland

I feel like I died a little inside watching this. I felt myself getting angry and frustrated at a lot of scenes in the film that were, how should I put it, just ""stupid"". If you've seen the film you'll hopefully understand what I mean.
A lot of scenes added clearly Just to pad the film out. If they were cut out the film altogether it wouldn't affect the story arc whatsoever.
I had zero sympathy for the wife or the kid by the end of the film. To be honest I didn't even care if the family all found eachother becasue they came across as completely selfish and egotistical.

Yes, there are other movies that are similar, but this was a well scripted movie with believable events from humans ranging from selfishness & murder to absolute care, understanding, and generosity.
Not all movies have to be bang bang shoot them up. Overall this is a very good movie that's enjoyable and each person will take something different out of this movie about how humans react when A cataclysmic event happens. I

It's formulaic and nothing you haven't seen before but still entertaining enough. The usual lots of people screaming and running and a family separated trying to find each other. Nothing original but still held my interest.,Greenland

I was so bored and it just came up in my recommended and well I watched it. When it comes to Greenland tbh there is only one main plot hole that really does not sit well with me... How in the hell did this ""planet killer comet"" go unnoticed and how did no astronomer out there identify it? When it comes to the lottery picking of the families how were the kids medical records never checked? Also, the way the US government was portrayed in this movie is 100% the way I see a situation like this one playing out in real life. The acting was okay.",Greenland
358,Sumpmonster,"Offers Nothing, Delivers Less",3,10 January 2021,"Apart from having the emotionally bereft Butler as the protagonost what could go wrong? Lots apparently. This is a movie that has zero going for it apart from Bacarrin as one of the most under-rated actress doing the rounds and a short cameo by the evergreen Scot Glen. This is like one of those daytime disaster movies except it is longer, less happens and has a lead that no one can relate to. Baccarin is delightful, such a charming actress it's so disappointing that she's involved in such drivel.
I doubt that I've seen a movie that is so unoroginal and where very little happens other than the cast running about in ever decreasing circles. Throw in a couple of heroic moments of self sacrifice and it's going to be alright? Fraid not.
Producers, director and scriptwriter really need to hang their collective heads in shame. A real Christmas turkey.",Greenland

Hard to say how many of those congested highways scenes were real, but if Amazon was involved maybe the producers simply rented miles of freeway and stocked it with hundreds of extras and vehicles.That said, the story itself is a letdown. Too much heartwarming dialogue, zipping around plot holes the size of impact craters, and Garrity doing heroic stuff that makes little sense given the circumstances.But even extinction-level events have their upsides.

The disaster events are stretched out with pointless characters creating problems for each other for no good reason but to stretch the run time.The shockwaves make no sense. They way they are depicted they should be ripping roofs off and windows turned to shutgun blasts. But they hit like a breeze.The final bunker design was dumb. Stopping the trucks of people in front of the hanger blast door so everyone enter it on foot as the door closed was just pointless drama. Just drive in, THEN unlaod.

369,zenjunkie,Good movie - Hard to watch.,7,22 January 2021,"Whether you enjoy this movie or not depends on your own perception of how the human race would react to a disaster of such magnitude. It also depends on whether or not you wish to see stark reality, or an entertaining drama.
The stark reality would be very brief:-
Scene 1: A meteor strike is leaked in the press followed by a short period of media and government spin to pacify us all.
Scene 2: Meteor Falls, total destruction, end of everything.
Scene 3: Fade to black.
Personally I prefer a drama with the usual mix of human bravado and human stupidity, with a few set action scenes thrown in.
This is after all a movie NOT a science documentary.
Having said that, the movie is rather bleak and it did not leave you with the usual happy Hollywood ending where life just picks itself up and dusts itself off with enthusiastic survivors walking off into a beautiful sunset.
It's a somewhat disturbing ending.
On the way though, there are many cinematic moments that should please any disaster movie enthusiast. The special effects were very believable and well crafted.
Many reviewers have remarked on how selfish and stupid people were.
Excuse me but, have they actually paid attention to the insanely selfish and aggressive world we live in?
When it comes to survival, sadly there are all too many out there who will think only of themselves.
But I digress.
Overall, this movie was better than 2012, which was very much over-the-top CGI and impossible drama.
Better also, than Deep Impact, which had rather too much human drama going on.
This is not a feel good movie but it is a well made end-of-the-world action movie.
The decision to watch, is yours.",Greenland

373,Spencer-Staggs,A Great Disaster Film (Ran out of space at the end of the review),8,1 March 2021,"Well, I write this review while sitting on my bed three whole days after watching 2020's ""Greenland"". I must say that it all still sticks in my head, the way a society can crumble so fast after everyone knows they are spending their final days on planet Earth. After a comet from another solar system (that's what scientists are calling it apparently) is presumed to strike the Atlantic Ocean, and the world is watching the countdown because they think it won't cause any damage and all it will do is cause a nice big beautiful splash (what I mean by this is that they thought it wouldn't be big enough to cause tsunamis and stuff). Well, let's just say that their calculations are off a bit... the first signs we get about something odd going on is when Gerard Butler's character John Garrity is at the grocery store with his son and he gets a presidential alert on his phone. Now, this alert is telling him that he must bring his wife (Allison Garrity) and his son (Nathan Garrity) to a secret airbase and then get on one of these planes (or something along those lines). John quickly finishes up his shopping for a party that him and his wife will be throwing later that day. When John gets out to the car he notices everyone is looking up at the sky and his son points out to him that there are military planes flying across the sky. When John gets home he tells his wife about the presidential alert and all the military cars and planes outside. Allison just tells John that it's just because of the comet and that there's nothing to worry about (while John was at the store we get a little scene that shows Allison was in the shower while her presidential alert was going off. They have one of those phones that connects to the tv and stuff.). So, while they're having the party they watch the countdown for this comet to strike the Atlantic Ocean, but it turns out that fragments of the comet are coming down and one of those fragments instead of hitting the Atlantic hit one of the cities in Florida (I can't remember which one). After this happens John gets another presidential alert on his phone and this time it presents on his tv in front of everybody. Of course everyone is worried now since they didn't get one of the presidential alerts on their phones. Once everyone begins to quickly filter out and go see what is going on. When John runs out to the backyard where his son is he looks at the sky which seems to be a bright orangish color. After packing their bags the Garrity family begins to leave the house in order to find the airbase. While on their way out of the driveway their friends come around the car, and one of them begs John to take her child, but John says that he can't since the presidential alert said no one else could come (NO EXCEPTIONS). So John has to leave and then his other friend up ahead gets him to stop and he asks John to call him if he finds anything out. John tells him that he will call and then drives off. When the family finally gets to the airbase there are a bunch of cars (empty) and the family must run up there (also, their son Nathan is a diabetic and when Nathan took his blanket out of his backpack his insulin medicine fell out). When the family finally gets up to the front of the crowd they are accepted in after getting their code scanned ( a QR code was sent to the people who were chosen). John realizes that Nathan's insulin is not in the backpack and has to run back to the car, but while Allison and Nathan are left by the planes Allison ends up asking one of the guards for some help, but mentions that Nathan is a diabetic and gets her and her son in trouble. Too bad people with health conditions aren't allowed to board the plane because now Allison & Nathan are pulled into a tent and get rejected from the planes. John ends up getting onto one of the planes, but realizes his family won't be on the plane after someone questions how he got onto the plane with insulin. John asks him what he's talking about and the guy says that his sister had a diabetic son and that they rejected him. So John runs to the back of the plane and gets the guy to open the back of the plane up, but just as the plane opens halfway a huge mob of people storm the base and start shooting. One person ends up hitting the guy holding the gasoline tube and gasoline goes all over the place. John yells out that the plane's gonna blow and everyone starts sprinting away from the plane and then the plane blows up and geez, isn't that enough adrenaline for now? But anyhow when John gets back to the car he finds that the windows are smashed and that there's a note on the windshield from Allison saying that she's going back to her dad's house. So when we cut back to Allison and Nathan we find that they are going into a drugstore (it's obviously been looted before) to find some medicine for Nathan. (Some of the people in the drugstore include an elderly man pushing an older woman n a wheelchair and a blondish lady) When Allison is in the back of the drugstore gunshots go off from the front and a group of people rush in and start shooting up the place, when Allison starts to quickly and cautiously move towards the front of the building we see the woman in the wheelchair has been shot in the chest and her husband is leaning over her crying. Once Allison finally gets to the front she runs into one of the guys with the gun and pleads for mercy from the armed man. The teen decides to help her up and says ""Go"" gesturing to the outside. When Allison & Nathan are running out into the parking lot they get a ride from a woman (it's that blondish lady) and her husband. These people are the Ventos, a couple working their way North I believe. Now, back to John who is trying to get cell service to call his wife. He gets to the top of a building where people are partying and gets a little bit of cell service, but is breaking up on both ends of the line. When the connection ends John runs back down stairs and finds a truck where a man is carrying about six passengers. In the truck he meets Colin a man in his 20's-30's on his way to Greenland where he says his friend (who is the guy that's driving them) got tipped as to where the bunkers are. Colin asks John what he does for a living and John asks him why. Colin replies by saying that it's what people are being chosen for, their jobs, his mom got chosen because she was a doctor. (Colin saw John's wristband which was given to him at the airbase for identification) John replies by saying that he was an engineer. Meanwhile, Ralph Vento pulls over the car and pulls Allison out of it (there is much struggle there), cuts off her wristband and swears to get Nathan to safety. Allison tries chasing the car, but obviously can't do it, so she tries flagging down a car, but no one will pull over for her. Back to John in the truck, and one of the men in the back decide to tell John to give him the bracelet because he doesn't think John deserves it. So he takes out a hammer from the ground, goes up to John and tells John to give it to him. Unfortunately, this breaks into a fight and the tarp blows off the back of the truck, and when the truck turns the men break through the wood on the side of the truck and land into the grass or asphalt. Back to Allison who finally got a ride from someone (a van full of passengers seeking to get away from where the next fragments may hit) while the Ventos are at the airbase with Nathan pushing through a crowd. When the three people approach the guard at the front they claim to be Nathan's parents and that Ralph's wristband was stolen, but Nathan cries out that Ralph & Judy are not his parents. The couple are pulled away from the child by MP's and Nathan is taken to the tents to get the care he needs. John awakens to see the hammer in the middle of the ground and we get a little race between John and the man who caused the fight in the first place (his name is Lucas) eventually John comes out victorious after swinging the hammer into Lucas' head, killing him. When John is walking back up to the truck he spots Colin's lifeless body on the asphalt. The man won't let John back into the truck so John is left on foot. Meanwhile Allison is dropped off at the airbase and after finding someone who will help her find Nathan she eventually finds him in one of the tents where a nurse is there and says that they can give Nathan & Allison a ride wherever they need to go. John eventually finds a neighborhood and decides to get some water and get a car at one of the homes, afterwards John gets to Allison's father Dale's home where they eventually get a call saying that Allison and Nathan are at a gas station, which Dale says is right down the road. They go pick up the two and are finally reunited as a family. After having a talk with Dale (where Dale says he doesn't want to go and that he'd die in the same house his wife died in) John sees a fragment hit not to far away and a shockwave flies over and causes a lot of damage in the barn and house. Dale let's the family take his car and wishes John luck, telling him to protect himself. On the way to a Canadian airport in a traffic jam smaller fragments of the comet begin falling from the sky and the family takes shelter under a bridge, but John runs out to save an unconscious driver from his burning car. In the process John burns his hand, but once the fragments stop falling the three continue their journey. Once they finally get to the airport John must flag down the final plane and the pilot grudgingly accepts his request. Once they finally get to Greenland a fragment hits not too far away and the shockwave knocks out one of the engines. So the pilots must now safely crash land the falling plane which ends up with the plane landing on ice where the front smashes into the ice. When everyone runs out of the plane John runs in to see the pilots, but one of them is dead while the other is slipping away. And they finally get to the bunker where they are safe.",Greenland

The comet melodrama laughable Inane and is a perfect backdrop to this MST3000 installment.I do believe we got punked by the producers.Gerard Butler is a grimacing structural engineer (the chosen) that somehow won the life lotto to survive doomsday by being randomly picked in the most bureaucratically inept, embarrassing ,awkward and riotous way possible...by TV text in front of a group of neighbors watching the same TV that are doomed to die in the next 24 hours, while Gerard hits the pedal to the metal to escape the doomed with flippant words of...I'll text you"" (but never does)Cell towers survive the rain of meteorites and work right until the last moment of the mass extinction, also the electricity grid is up and running to the end, all things considered everyone is reasonably behaved, luckily there's no toilet paper shortage in the last 24 hours.""see ya don't want to be ya"" lolMy favorite laugh out loud moment is when Gerard Butler is playing...Gerard Butler.His dopey selfishness takes out a half dozen C-130 transport planes loaded with hundreds of the chosen ,getting up from his seat he begs and whines to be left behind to find his lost clueless wife and boy that couldn't board because of some diabetic melodrama .He demands the crew chief drop the loading ramp into a mob of the crazed non chosen, while saying to the petrified passengersI'm sorry""He's constantly saying I'm ""sorry"" to the soon to be dead...it's so annoying.The airmen drop the ramp and Gerard runs off into the rampaging rioting mob of thousands looking for his wifie.Bullets fly and hit the fuel truck and soon a chain reaction explosion takes out all the Greenland bound planes waiting on the tarmac in a giant fireball!As the planes are burning behind him, he has the moxie to ask the dazed sergeant in the hanger.""Have you seen my wife and son?""Really?Unbelievable the airman says....""Yes""So many MST3000 juicy moments just like that.Here's another, he forces a twin prop plane to abort by playing chicken with his truck, the plane is forced to stop and he's demands to board the overloaded plane (It's a doomsday gun free zone)
The annoyed pilots debate Gerard for minutes and finally give in and say...""Sure, what's another few hundred pounds""(The plane latter crashes by being overloaded killing both pilots a mile from the bunker complex)""sorry""From the post millennial cell phone usage as the world burns (he goes to the top of a parking garage looking for reception and holds his phone up to the heavens as the meteorites are blazing past while the doomed twentysomethings on the roofs are having cool rave parties, to the comical wokeness that beats you on the head every fifteen minutes)Many Americans are profiled nonstop as pale skinned diabolically selfish characters, while others of a different shade are angelic, steadfast and compassionate even when they know they will be unfairly dead in the next 24 hours.Gladly helping Gerard on his way with self sacrifice and nobility .Helping him on planes, buses and at the last moment into the bunker by holding open the closing bunker doors.""Sorry.

I had to stop midway through just to take a breather, because you know this is exactly how a lot of people are going to react in such a situation. The harrowing parts are when the family gets separated for reasons beyond their control - and for not knowing exactly how some people are going to act and react.

Not in attempting to stop the comet or to survive the impact or it's aftermath. Come on, that's been done. No, you are instead a witness to their attempts to find shelter, for 2 hours!Why Greenland?
Could it be because the largest impact crater was recently discovered there, under an icesheet. The biggie that is now believed to have triggered the last ice age? Nope. Something to do with the previous location of the magnetic North pole perhaps? Not even close although both would have been worthwhile.Greenland is the man's destination for safety when an extinction level event occurs. That's it.
If the safe haven was in Wisconsin or Jumanji, that's what the movie would have been titled.So what goes on for 2 hours?
World leaders uniting to save the species perhaps? Nyet! Missiles? Railguns? Armageddon-style suicide missions and secret projects for evacuation to Mars? NOPE!
How about the impact itself, do we get to see that? Sorry.
Well, everything except all the above.You get drama, with dad getting off the evacuation flight for his son's insulin that was left in the car. Who knew?
There's action, like rioting and looting.
It has traffic snarls as people try to drive somewhere, anywhere to presumably get off the film.And it has clichés, notably, one at the start that is destined to be the new must-have disaster movie clichè. Being informed that you must evacuate immediately and to only bring your wife and diabetic son, while your phone is set on speaker at a neighbourhood get-together.
Talk about a new record for losing friends. Anyhow, new clichè and you saw it first in Greenland!It goes downhill from there.
This disaster movie sets the bar so low that Deep Impact would be Oscar-winning material.
To be fair, Gerard is an actor in demand and he is prolific, so one can forgive him for this stinker.

The pacing was also good which can be tricky, not too frenetic, but also not with long dull parts of people looking off meaningfully into the distance.The worst part to me was the blistering stupidity of the two groups of people trying to steal the families wrist bands to get on a flight to safety. Equal stupidity goes to the family for not just handing them over. I would have thought that such high levels of idiocy didn't exist, or at least were astonishingly uncommon, however some of the things I see people believe these days has led me to reconsider.I gave this a six out of 10 because it is easy to watch but doesn't really bear much thinking about and teaches very little.",Greenland

I can't drop it lower than a 6, but unfortunately this script leaned heavily on some familiar writer's crutches. It was downright annoying in many places. A script-by-numbers kind of plot where a few familiar ideas are ""explored"", or rather regurgitated. And it was a little light on the actual disaster moments.We've got the troubled marraige thing that my SO and I immediately groaned about once we realized it was going to be a major theme in the movie. At this point that stuff is just modern low-hanging fruit - fake depth - and in 2012 John Cusack already patched it up in a similar crisis (that delivered more in the visual candy department btw). This movie doesn't say anything new on that file either. Busy husband neglects wife, wife doesn't appreciate all he's doing, he cheats (might as well ratchet it up), now there's tension. Fortunately, the extemes of a cataclysmic event help them rediscover their bonds, aided by an excessive amount of happy-time flashbacks just in case the audience is too dense to discern the obvious.After establishing the troubled-marraige crutch the writers move to the next crutch, the diabetic kid crutch. My SO had wondered aloud before that moment if we were going to get someone with asthma or a pregnant woman, so it was a good laugh when diabetic kid was introduced. Yep, sure enough we get those insulin panic scenes yadiyadiyada.I should wrap this up but I want to mention one more thing.The writers seem to think that people in Canada are so nice they'd give up their seats/endanger their own families for some entitled American family charging their plane on the tarmac. It's as though there wasn't a lottery/selection process Here as well and it's tough luck for those left out, but if an affluent American family shows up we'll all be deferential to them. Canada exists merely as a prop to the writers, they do their little ""hello from X,Y, Z locations"" at the end but of course not from Canada, even though the big impact happens around the Mediterranean. What idiocy. It may come as some surprise but we have a highly capable and professional military here, too, except we don't devote nearly as much per-capita to chimpanzee-level nonsense like 'full spectrum domination"" then wonder why there's nothing left for a social safety net.Anyway, that was the icing on the cake for a script written for solipsistic affluent Americans I suppose.

434,felix-wyderka,Finally a disaster movie that moves away from the cliches,7,30 August 2020,"In the last few years Gerard Butler, sadly, has become a synonym for a movie flop. There has rarely been a movie in the last five years with Butler in it, that was not either bad or completely awful.
The last of which, to name few were, the last part of the Fallen Trilogy, ""Angel has Fallen"", the less than exciting WWII thriller ""Hunter Killer"" and one of the worst movies to be made in the last few years, ""Geostorm"".
Knowing all this I went into ""Greenland"" with a certain level of skepticism. Luckily, Butler seems to have gotten a lot smarter in his choices because ""Greenland"" is a quite entertaining motion picture.
While I am not a fan of disaster movies, mostly because they always follow the same boring concept namely, a family or gets separated for some stupid reason and tries to find each other again over the next two hours while their journey is complicated by various obstacles of human or nature kind.
""Greenland"" is no doubt a disaster movie but fortunately it is a little more exciting and creative than most of its kind over the last few years have been.
The movie begins with John Garrity (Butler) visiting his wife Allison (Morena Baccarin) and their son Nathan. John and Allison are separated but they seem to get along fine. Nathan is fascinated by the stars and the asteroid that is shooting towards earth. Soon the Garritys invite some friends over, when a presidential alert appears on their TV and phone telling them to pack some bags and drive to a close by airfield.
When they get there they are ushered in and just before they are about to board the plane the separation plot kicks in. Admittedly it's not as stupid as usual.
Now this might sound like your typical disaster movie but trust me it's not quite.
""Greenland"" is smart in how it handles it's characters and the plot is not always straight forward.
The movie tries less to create tension with the looming disaster but rather does so through the human element and the different characters the family members meet on their way.
We only get to experience what the family members do. There are no five or six main characters that each have their own agenda.
Even when they're separated, the Garritys stay the focus of the movie. They meet good and bad people along their journey and what I liked in particular was the honesty with which the director handles these characters. Many people are selfish and greedy and even in situations like this one, where working together is most important, people still only think of themselves.
The movie works also because Butler and Baccarin have a very good chemistry. They are the couple that has had hard times but still loves each other and would do anything to stay a family.
Butler is really good here. As good as he hasn't been in years. It's not a very difficult role or something that would be beyond his skillset but it is more serious and dramatic than his usual tough guy parts. Quite a few times I was happy to see that he can do more than growl and butcher an American accent. Granted, he still butchers it but at least his character is so charming and likable that we can overlook it.
The love and tenderness he shows in his face a few times is one I have never seen of him and, in a particularly important scene, we see the self loathing and disgust in his face.
I believe he always had it in him and I am glad he finally chose a movie that allowed him to bring out his full talent.
Baccarin is good too, especially on her own. She hasn't had too many major roles yet in movies but I hope she will soon. She really is a capable actress.
""Greenland"" is certainly worth watching and if you have the chance and the current situation allows it, go see it next month when it's released. It makes for a welcome change of pace.",Greenland

Shame they didn't make more of the disaster elements because they were fairly good when they did include them. Still worth the watch if you've got a couple of lockdown hours to spare!,Greenland
447,kowas_2,Very funny!,2,24 October 2021,Any cliché you can think of is well executed here. Make sure you reserve a special spot for the kid! OMG ! I feel bad taking down a kid and it's not his fault that he was given the most annoying kid in a movie role. It's nice that everything's just falls in place all at the same time.I had a few LOL moments though I feel like that was not the aim of the writers or director of this movie. They should really work in a comedy!,Greenland
448,treborquest,Entertaining yes.... if you shut down your brain,4,18 November 2020,"This movie had quite some potential. Yes the focus is on family drama and it has some exciting moments, but the further the story progressed, the more they let go of logic and common sense. A 7 year old kid who gets fractions at school and half of the time acts like an adult needs a carseat and doesn't know how to unbuckle a seatbelt? small airplane vs shockwave? driving away from a road and into the woods without knowing where you are or where to go? most of the plotlines were thought up for extra drama but didn't feel necessary or were too forced to feel natural. some of the actions were cringe worthy. The acting wasn't all that great....
so why 4 stars still? Because if you stop thinking about it, it's actually an ok movie and entertaining, but other than that.... it's just bad and a shame of potential.",Greenland

I normally can digest one or two but the list was so long that became quickly indigestible and apparent sign of lazy writing. Just to mention:
They forget/lose something in an improbable super-clichéd way and they need to splitMobile network not working (of course they don't!) and they can't reach each otherA vehicle losing fuel leading to an inevitable explosionReluctant bad guy during an assault in a shopVoluntary but totally unnecessary sacrifice from a character that had no more purpose in the movie (for instance there's a major example of this cliché in Star Wars - Rogue One)Catastrophic event happening in the same area the main characters are passing by and is telegraphed by the mediaTicking clock in the form of a world extinction event... totally not necessary, especially because of how it played outAlso inconsistencies of all kinds (pay attention at when monuments are shown after the main comet hit and then check the world map that is presented...).It could have been so much better if there was some more work done on script to avoid/twist at least a couple of these elements.",Greenland

I would say almost too much intensity and too many conflicts for most movies, but it worked!

So far removed from any appropriate intelligence or preparation in the very least, let alone to withstand a global crisis like covid or an astroid impacting earth or food security or more attacks from china. You guys and my country too to a lesser degree, too high and detached on all the creature comforts without appreciating how abnormal all of it is are more primed to turn on themselves, their country and each other in times of crisis.As for the movie, well let it be another example of what not to do please.

462,TanQ,Witless family endures boring cataclysm,2,8 February 2021,"Who are these people? Does anyone care? I couldn't even remember their names during the film, let alone after. Going for stereotypical, the writer has them sort of estranged, or not, who cares? Their personal drift is never explained or explored it's just sort of important the theirs is a 'troubled marriage' as is the requisite for every disaster film.
There's also a child with diabetes because you need a child with some kind of illness to try and add some sort of emotional drive. At least he doesn't spend the movie shrieking like Dakota Fawning in the dreadful War of the Worlds.
Meteors hit, mostly offscreen to keep the costs down and always on cue to drag the plot, what little of it there is, in a roughly forward direction. The special effects, which typically drive a disaster film forward are sparse and fairly generic. Events happen, people are endangered and they experience minor traffic jams.
There's really not much more to say about the film. The meteor part should drive some part of the story to a plausible conclusion but it doesn't end up anywhere near one. Instead, you're presented with a sub-par road movie with little or no character development. It's like the makers of the film were just trying to wrap it up and move on to better projects.",Greenland

Only Butler pull through - although, to be fair, it's not his best effort either.Sadly, part of the writing is pretty lackluster too. Hints are much to obvious and characters make stupid choices for no other reason than to set up supposedly tense scenes.Still, worth a watch if found in the three for ten department.",Greenland

Both Armageddon and Deep Impact come out around the same time (I believe Deep Impact was first) and whilst Armageddon was a big budget action movie Deep Impact was more drama with some great CGI thrown in. Greenland was more like the latter but minus the CGI. I liked the storyline and how it built to the climax, the only problem was there was no climax. I sat for over 2 hours waiting for the impact and the devastation that followed but all we saw was a space view after the fact and then we shifted to the bunker where Butler and family waited for the shockwave etc. that was it. No flaming fireball, no tsunami, no earthquake, explosions, toppling buildings, nada. I felt the ending was very anticlimactic and left me disappointed.",Greenland

Great start, although a long period of the film appeared to be a man struggling to find his family.The plot used in separating John from his family was quite lame I most say, it wasn't natural and didn't make sense...
I love movie where the action is more concentrated at the start, middle and end but in this movie, they saved the best part for the end only.It's deeply a disaster movie though just a man and his family issues caught up in a comet attack....If I had seen more magnificent CGI effects with the characters struggling to break free from the aggressive comet then I would be satisfied.

In short, they run away and get to safety and that's it. There is no dramatic flow at all, no themes, and the ordinariness of the characters makes them just uninteresting.

480,submitme,Pleasantly surprised overall,7,14 November 2020,"""Greenland"" surprised me positively.
The story and events unfolding isn't surprising though, fairly cliché.
However, I feel the acting and dialogue is overall good from all involved, Gerard and Morena both decent and not any stubborn, hysterical kids as is otherwise the norm.Isn't as ridiculous as the 2009 movie ""2012"" where whole continental plates flip upside down. ""Greenland"" is much more believeable and all in all, seemed alot more realistic and plausible.There are a few points during the movie that scientifically don't seem right, and a big part is the ending, which doesn't really hold up to science either. However still quite nice. Not so much focus on CGI effects, more on the people and that worked well.
As mentioned the story is a bit of the same with all these disaster-type movies. The main cast constantly runs into obstacles along the way, and some would be expected and also a few times they make poor dicisions, but not nearly as many of one could have feared.Despite the very ending, that I considered the lowpoint of the movie, I will still give it a 7.",Greenland

I know it sounds funny that a crazy fictional movie becomes unbelievable but it kind of does, it just does not make any sense.

The Greenland scenes are shot in Iceland and the landscapes in iceland look nothing like the icesheet of Greenland. In the end it felt like a disaster movie turned comedy in the end.",Greenland

While we are not faced with Near Earth Objects and comet chunks striking the earth (yet), we ARE up against a much smaller invading body, on a global scale, with a similar potential to generate fatalities. The movie does an excellent job of demonstrating how quickly a serious situation can degrade into deadly chaos when people don't do what they're told to do! Moreover, the movie illustrates the unnecessary devastation that can result when a couple of Americans decide they have the rights to stall or impede, for their own gain, an in-progress relocation effort, involving thousands of other pre-selected Americans! It may not have been intentional on the part of the writers, but the point is made that, in times of a common national threat, America and Americans need to adjust their approach and attitudes in rectifying the situation.

It just has that type of production to it. Not low budget, not exactly blockbuster budget either, but just right.If you read the synopsis, you know what it's about. It's run of the mill. Been there and done that, but this actually focused on psychology behind all the panic from what a man would do to protect his family to how Government could allow stuff to happen should this occur, so forth...Only thing I didn't like was the obvious political correctness in the film. It's so blatant considering the times, there are better ways to provide this through different angles, suffice to say, it shows Director's lack of depth.CGI wasn't bad, but some of it was little cringe. I could probably finish off layers in the explosions, comets, etc to make them convincing on my home computer.Overall, it's not bad. Definitely worth a watch.

Butler is good in this. He doesn't over play it, he keeps it simple and this really helped me enjoy it.
Morena Baccarin, again, is very good. The problem with these films is that the female is usually there to just be saved, scream and cry a lot. Thankfully this wasn't the case, well she did cry a lot, she had a fair reason to be honest. The writers gave her a strong roll to actually get her teeth into which definitely gave this project a good balance.

It's not PREFECT, but what disaster movie is?I'd like to point out that the main critics from reviews on here must be completely bonkers!
Main put downs roughly are:
'All a a sob story of a family'
'Unrealistic scenarios'
'Main character was selected (how predidictable)'Well I'll tell you this now! What the F is the point in a film if it hasn't got a bit of structure?? Something to make you feel for a family, a family of which goes through arguably worse because they ARE selected?! And things go wrong!?
What is the point in a film if within a two hour slot, they based it on EXACT boring lives of people who sit online slagging off decent films??
FACT is all the reviews I've read seem to point to negatives generally at 'unrealistic' circumstances and to me that's absolutely ridiculous! The film is FAKE!! Get a grip.I happen to think the way the story is portrayed is brilliant!! There's times when things happen that you genuinely could see it happening! For better or worse!

Gerard tried to pull an american accent but i think i gave up 25 into the film.VFX were pretty hit or miss.

The couple times they were supposedly traveling north of Lexington but on 2 different occasions we saw road signs for Georgia highways?

Not that they are bad, they're just ""Ok"". And maybe that was the point.This movie is about the complete-lack of ""Honesty"" we would likely hear from Gov't should a major space-based object be on a collision-course with Earth.There is pandemonium, and the ""selected few"" didn't know they were even on the ""list""; which is the basis for the madness that ensues.It was also nice to see a non-pandemic and non-ClimateChange related disaster movie.Sure there are decisions that seem odd, in the moment, but in their ""reality"" I suspect EVERYTHING would move quickly, quirky and unexpectedly.",Greenland

WTH..that would raise his sugar more?! He needed an insulin shot, not more sugar in his system.When they hitch a ride with the strangers, she fills his pump cartridge. No time is given for the insulin to get in his system and lower his sugar. Time to eat a sandwich! And also, you can't just change the cartridge without changing the infusion set (the tubing part). That would cause a horrible infection. You can't use infusion sets more than 2-3 days because of the site potentially getting an infection after 2-3 days on the stomach site.

533,travis_hates_martin,Arrgghh Plot holes a'plenty,6,9 February 2021,"Straight out of the gates there is one huge plot hole that just renders the entire movie useless, they say that the comet has come from another solar system and it is moving so fast that it ""came out of nowhere"".Now I'm no Stephen Hawking but after reading a book of his or two, it'd take millions of years if not in the billions (probably billions of billions) for the comet to get from the edge of our solar system to scoring a 40 yard touchdown on Central Europe. Say it was close anyway (although more statically likely for me to win the lottery 1000 times in a row), we've had the Hubble telescope since 1990, what have they been doing to miss a comet the size of a football field hurtling toward earth?.If you can get past that movie mutator, secondly is the fact that they decided to put the bunker system in Greenland, pretty much closer than the 1.5m social distancing regulation in place on a continent/country scale. I don't care if you have 100 foot deep titanium alloy, a comet the size of a stadium is going to turn that into a crushed can.Another good point to take away from this film, is don't be diabetic. If you are and manage to get into a bunker, you may be alright because 7 months of medical supplies gets pulled out of thin air and placed into your insulin pump.Not a bad movie, enjoyed it despite the critical thinking from producers being over sighted.

564,topdog-64841,meh,6,3 April 2021,"I gave it a passing grade because it's a disaster movie, which I really like, but otherwise it leaves much to be desired...The first 1/4 is actually quite good and really brought me into the growing panic and chaos as an initially unthreatening asteroid rapidly progresses into a planet-threatening monster.My biggest gripe with the movie is that it ran out of steam after that initial flurry of action and then you were just following around the different family members for an hour as they bumbled about trying to find each other. I wonder if the producers realized that the project was heading towards being overbudget and decided to scale it down and coast towards the ending? All I know is that the asteroid stopped being menacing and I started to get bored, hoping that they would just get a move on to something interesting! I kept waiting for another shockwave from an asteroid strike but apparently they were all busy in Asia. Finally there was one at the dads place!And what was the deal with that super chill checkpoint? They were like oh yeah you've got the QR code, ok sir, no need to scan the childs or your wifes bracelets, just go on through, and oh, you just want to grab something from the car, no problem! It seemed easier to go in and out than at the movie theatre haha!! And then that couple was about to be let in even though the man didn't have a bracelet.. SMH...And finally, I think the ending would have been way better if the last scene in the movie was their lives flashing before their eyes because it would have left some mystery and intrigue in the viewers mind - did they survive? Was that actually them seeing their lives flash before their eyes right before they died? Unfortunately, most hollywood movies hold the hand of audience members and spoon feed us everything, leaving little to the imagination, often wanting to make sure we have a happy ending, the protagonists lived, no need to lie to your kids, no need to debate what happened after.Anyways, 6/10 because their hasn't been a good disaster movie recently and I was itching for it haha!Cheers.",Greenland

Yes, its got echos of Seeking a Friend For The End Of The World. No, it's not as overblown as Armageddon. Yes, the ending is pure Day After Tomorrow, and a bit of a cop out. But it does have enough ""What would I do?"" moments to make it fresh and entertaining.. My main disappointment was the lack of snow in Greenland. Good cast, good special effects, (mostly) good crowd scenes. Rushed ending. Ticks all the standard disaster film boxes, except there is no dog to be rescued .

571,cpgrisdale,More of a horror for a mother,8,12 February 2021,At first I thought this was going to be really cliche and it started a bit like that but really develops into a brutal struggle for a family to survive. The little boy is an amazing actor and Gerard butler doesn't overdo it on the hero level. He's just a desperate father trying to get back to his family. Much more realistic than other disaster movies. Overall this is a film more about whàt two people will do for their child than the inevitable disaster coming.

It was far too long, the acting was questionable, and as it was about the end of the world, you would think there would be a great scene where the earth is decimated, but no it shows nothing even close to that.

Also I can suspend belief but the science in this movie also made zero sense. I would like to end on a positive note, but I honestly can't think of one. It's just a really bad movie that stressed me out for no reason. It built tension but only because they made one bad decision after another and then got super entitled and somehow had a happy ending?

578,hillwalker3000,Typical formulaic end-of-the-world hokum,2,8 February 2021,"A promising idea is swiftly exposed as yet another hopelessly simplistic recycled storyline - a family races to reach a place of safety before the world is blown to bits (the CGI thrown in to make it appear fresh and exciting simply doesn't work).The movie features all the usual tropes we have come to hate:Family in the throes of divorce - self-confident mother, workaholic father who loves his son, and puppy-eyed kid (this one has diabetes just to ramp up the fake drama some more)
Race against time to escape extinction-level comet is actually a feeble tale of how the family becomes separated then miraculously reunited at the 24th hour
Our hero is forced to kill a member of one of the several rent-a-crowd hysterical mobs in order to survive and suffers the agonies of guilt for about 5 minutes
The oldest member of the extended family (good old grandpa who finally makes it up to his son-in-law) sacrifices himself for the good of the rest
The military are mostly the good guys in all but most of the time all they do is obey orders (no matter how inhumane), race around and shout instructions every few minutes to keep us on the edge of our seats
Hero, wife and child reconcile right at the end when they are finally safe - having just escaped unscathed from an impossible air crash so they can be buried underground in a bunker
The problem, apart from the above, was the lack of any sense of realism at every step of the way -
Hero's family get an urgent voicemail from Homeland Security informing them they have been chosen to report to a military airfield where they will be flown to safety (same personalised message appears on their TV screen during a news update lol)
Hero manages to immediately find his vehicle in the pitch dark after abandoning it with hundreds of others - similarly his wife is able to find her son within a minute of reaching an encampment of thousands of displaced refugees (having been able to hitch a ride in the middle of the night during a mass exodus)
The roads were either grid locked or completely devoid of traffic (useful whenever our hero needed to get somewhere quickly)
The sickeningly slushy music was presumably intended to tear apart the heartstrings whenever we failed to spot a tender moment on-screen
. . . and the worst ending ever - after 9 months in an underground bunker in the Arctic, the family emerge into a suddenly temperate world that has also miraculously been able to preserve its atmosphere, several iconic landmarks (the Eiffel Tower and Sydney Opera House for example) despite a blast violent enough to strip off the outer layer of the planet - and some songbirds have already reappeared in the Greenland sky.
Simple question, why would anyone go through all this ridiculous trouble in order to spend the rest of their miserable lives in a barren wilderness with no realistic chance of survival? And why would anyone pay good money to watch this tosh?",Greenland
579,LumosX,"What you'd expect, but with a twist here and there and certainly entertaining",6,21 February 2021,"After Gerard Butler saved the world in ""Geostorm"", he's back into the apocalyptic genre for a trip to Greenland. ""Greenland"" certainly runs with the tropes of its genre, eschewing some of the grandeur inherent to Roland Emmerich's seminal works (and those that usually emulate them) in favour of a more grounded approach.This film does some things differently: Our hero is not a military man, a scientist or an astronaut, but just a construction engineer. He's Scottish (and I like Scottish Gerard Butler only second to Scottish Ewan McGregor)! He's not divorcing his wife, he's getting back with her. His son isn't asthmatic, he's diabetic. The president of the United States doesn't even make an appearance or give a speech. Truly incredible and groundbreaking.Jokes aside, the film does a good job of portraying the general chaos of an apocalyptic situation ""at the ground level"", and harrowingly depicts what can happen to a lone woman when separated from her husband. Though the looting isn't portrayed as accurately as one might expect (with one man even driving his wheelchair-bound old wife or nan to loot a pharmacy!), and the minor side plot involving the... Southern metalhead, let's call him that, verges on the ridiculously dumb (and so is another one, ""telegraphed"" from afar), ""Greenland"" remains a tense and sometimes amusing experience that sees you rooting for the characters, even though it doesn't necessarily break new ground in any significant way.The story is well-paced an executed, though you certainly feel the two-hour length as you approach the final act. Conveniences are also prominent, and not everything makes logical sense, but on a positive note, it could have been much, much worse. Whilst the cinematography is quite good, the CGI is serviceable and some effects, in particular, look like they belong in a film with a much smaller budget. This, however, is a minor flaw and certainly not a significant issue.Both Butler and Baccarin do a brilliant job; the latter in particular, known to yours truly from her limited appearances in ""Stargate SG-1"" and ""The Mentalist"", certainly gave a wonderful performance of a mother under strain.In short, ""Greenland"" is an amusing film that fans of the ""katastrophenfilm"" genre are sure to enjoy. I'd certainly suggest giving it a watch, even to those who aren't big fans of the genre itself. I liked it more than ""Geostorm"", that much is sure.",Greenland
580,tgemberl,Premise is a bit far-fetched,3,27 February 2021,"I can believe that if we were at risk of being hit by a comet, the government might create a list of ""essential people"" to be survivors. However, the idea that they would not respect the affections those people felt for their loved ones seems far-fetched. It is not believable to me that they would not allow the family to bring their diabetic boy. If they would not, they would be sowing the seeds of hostility to the ""survivors' government."" People making up such lists would have to be smart enough to know that. it would be better to bring him and have him become sick and die with his parents than to exclude him. The parents would be forgiving if it turned out the medical facilities were inadequate to keep him healthy. I only give it 3 stars because I think the film is a bit overrated.",Greenland

So much so that I feel a real person did not write it. Gerard Butler carries the weight as the alpha caring father. Lucky for him he had just one child. No telling what the script would have done with three kids but, I know it would have just simply worked out and they would make that plane to Greenland in 5 minutes even though they are in Georgia. It will work out. The keys will be in the drawer. The medicine will be there. Dad will have a 50 acre ranch. The truck will have a full tank of gas. Only dad will figure out to drive backwards. Phew, a turkey sandwich shows up. Oh, a truck just happens to be going to Lexington. Then, the cell phone issue. WTF! It's a real bad movie with much potential to be so meaningful. Yet, it's another fine example of our degrading film industry. If I was 10 years old, I would love this movie.

Until the end, where we really experience the real fear, with really accurate situations, the meteorite factor hits hard, stepping up all the other emotions... it feels like if ever had to happen this is how it would like, how people would react.

594,visionaforethought,"For adults only, superb",9,12 February 2021,"Grrr, I get so angry when movies I love get bad reviews from some. But then again, we're all drawn to a specific type, and Greeland was my type. Interstellar was THE best movie ever made. Period. So good, I have seen it over 20 times, and will continue to. Likewise, Greenland was enjoyable (if that is the correct term) for the same reason. Heart wrenching realistic emotional situations backed up with superb acting (from the mother and child in this case), and accurate science. I only discovered Greenland after a notification popped up on my phone today. So I gave it a whirl on our 50"" 4K Sony TV. As someone scientific who has read a lot about Earth impact situations, I found it very realistic with superb VFX and music. (Armageddon was awful - for the non thinking classes. Deep Impact, like this, was intelligent and clever.) Anyway, the core message of Greenland is that people will turn savage very very quickly when the wheels fall off society and desperation sets in, hence the kidnapping of the child and other examples. I remember in the first few weeks of lockdown in March 2020 small scale fights breaking out in a Tesco. And that was over toilet paper. Things will get a tad more interesting when it's over food.I'm thinking Greenland has room for follow up in the form of a TV series as the survivors rebuild society, without any nonsense like zombies. A realistic pure science based storyline.9 stars because of the annoying habit of American made movies always thrusting the lead characters to the front of any line or group of people, as if they are somehow special.Oh, and like when watching Interstellar, I cried a lot in this, but am an adult, so I guess I found the family detachment situations difficult to stomach.As I said in my subject line, Greenland is for adults.

The film develops very well, having exciting action scenes and keeping the viewer's attention from start to the end, and balancing between action scenes and normal scenes.The soundtrack is just beautiful, and the performances are incredible, the twists too, everything that happens catches your attention, and the end of the film is just incredible. The happy moments passing like flashes seconds before the impact wave hits, and then shows the destruction, desolation, a destroyed world, but in the scene where radio stations from different countries begin to respond, the door of the shelter is opened and birds they begin to fly shows hope, that as many times in the past, our species has survived a devastating event, that there will be a future, a reconstruction of the world.This is one of the best films I've ever seen in my life, it's realistic and engaging, I'm just disappointed with such dishonest and negative reviews about such a good movie, I think this is one of the most underrated films by the imb community.If you haven't watched the movie yet and are unsure whether or not to watch the negative reviews, give the movie a try, you won't regret it.",Greenland

613,fantard,America: 400 Million Guns; Greenland: <20,6,8 February 2021,"This is ""2012"" (2009), both in premise and quality. The kid's separation from his parents McGuffin, and the see-Jesus moment that the swarthy gangster on a manic shooting spree has, notwithstanding, this is a half-decent Armageddon popcorn flick.Butler's Butler (good). Aside from, perhaps, the ""abductor"", all the supports were serviceable. Special effects did the job adequately enough (albeit, utterly unscientifically so... * cough AIR BURSTS cough *). The pace and run-time were just about right (never felt boring).So, yeah... If you can look past the conspicuous absence of firearms in the U. S. -- during an extinction event, no less -- you should get some entertainment out of this film... Especially in light of all the straight-to-torrent schlock that the Internet movie-makers have been barfing up of late. It's still advisable to leave one's brain at the door, though.

My main issue with this movie is that it feels like it has been done before (which it has) but it is not done any differently and that's where my issue is. You can get away with doing something the same if it's a great movie but it really is not. It is also slow paced for a movie that is supposed to keep you on the edge of your seat. Also with disaster movies they are supposed to make you feel anxious over what is going to happen but those scenes are just underwhelming and also predictable.Overall it feels like they made this movie just to make a movie rather than putting some heart and soul into it. Eventually you don't really care for the characters (maybe you don't even care from the start) and that is a problem as well. I'm not mad that I spent a couple of hours watching it but I also wouldn't care if I would have passed this one up. Very average, middle of the road movie that you've seen 100 times already.

Gerald Butler can play the father role really well. And all the other actos are performing very good here. It is plausible what happens there and I think yes it could happen like this. Thats why i give it a 9 ! Entertaining Movie. Watch it and you will forget everything for 2hrs. That is no action movie like Armageddon or 2012 but works on the same level but everything a little smaller but with some good actors here. I really dig Gerald Butler now.

I thought I'd take a look at Greenland after a seeing it arrive on Prime Video. bribing the partner with a tub of Ben and Jerry's we settled down for 2hrs of Gerard Butler.
Let's get straight to the point, Greenland is quite the thriller, the Ben and Jerry's tub was only half eaten by the end of film but also quite deformed. Squeezed ever tighter during the films numerous tension filmed scenes. There were some outstanding scenes throughout the film, many of which I felt could result in one of the main characters demise, a rare thing in modern film. It's not without its flaws ofc. Naturally the film looses a star immediately for the unnecessary use of CGI planes and helicopters. But there are other elements of the CGi that you can tell were put together rather poorly. But that didn't bother me half as much as the overly ""graphic"" news reporting. Which kind of broke the reality for me. I just can't imagine the deaths of millions would be streamed via news networks, I can't tell you why it bothered me but it did.

The story is not based on the disaster about to happen, is basically just drama, bad decisions and bad everything. I don't think I can write all bad about it otherwise I would write a testimony here.
How a mom let her soon be kidnapped like she did? She couldn't untie the boy from the sit belt, grabbed his hand and didn't let those people take him? And if he depends of insulin to live how come she don't have it on her personal purse, her jacket, pockets???
The whole drama started because of the God damn insulin!!!
Many scenes I felt like was a cheap copy of 2012 and the rest is all about drama not evolving the catastrophe about to happen, don't waste your time!

Acting wasn't bad either, considering how horrible some predecessors have been. However, it did have the annoying cliche of the separated couple you know are going to be all happy ever after by the time it ends. At least there wasn't a control room scene where everybody cheers and throws papers into the air. Of course it had the best part, billions dead and wholesale destruction but I wished they'd focused more on that than the 'save my family' deal but that's what they were going for in this movie, focus on the plight of those trying to survive.

683,jonny-pears,Not awful but the usual issues,6,7 March 2021,"Greenland isn't a new disaster movie nor is it a great one. It's not a terrible one either and has suspense but that's mostly due to the family rather than the planet ending effect at hand.
It starts off quickly enough. Man gets text from government telling him he and his family must travel to an airbase to be flown to a bunker. They all try yet due to their child being sick, he's not allowed to travel. So the family are split and need to meet up(that turns into all sorts of issues which I liked) then they need to try and get to Greenland to get to those bunkers.
Look, it's entertaining and doesn't overuse the explosions and cities being destroyed. But it has the same casual racism that american movies love. Europe gets destroyed regardless(just like Armageddon, France had NO chance) yet it shows European cities still standing yet burned. Those European cities wouldn't be there anymore if the planet killer hit that close to them. There are many errors but I've never seen a disaster movie get those geographical errors right if I'm honest and I can live with that. The worst errors though? Diabetes. This movie has no idea how to deal with diabetes. The kid who has it would had died very early on in real life. Ridiculous lack of knowledge.",Greenland

Having been refused safety due to childs illness when they independently get to the safety zone are allowed in ( they would have been shot in the US). Lots of WWZ and W of Ws scenes stolen. Lots of the decisions the lead characters do make no sense. But its a action packed film so i gave it 6/10.",Greenland

It's focuses more on character development than over the top CGI like most other disaster flicks. It makes you feel something. The characters are believable, well acted, and the plot is free from any head scratching holes. There are a few questions I had while watching that got answered throughout the movie. It's just a fun exciting movie that won't disappoint your ""Average Joe"" viewer, like me. Totally worth the rental fee.",Greenland
686,Gurochan,Boring,3,13 February 2021,"I wanted to watch a disaster movie about a giant asteroid, not a slow family drama. If you wanna make that, market it as that. I think there were probably more flashback scenes of the kid as a toddler than there were scenes of the asteroid and the main family were super boring to watch. Having to sit through all their predictable drama was almost enough to make me switch it off - I had to go have a cup of tea in the middle and come back to it. Also, the 'kid with medical issues - oh no we forgot his meds' plotline is getting really old, Hollywood.People who watch disaster movies don't watch them for the touching family moments, we watch them because we want to see stuff get destroyed in new and exciting ways. Fair enough, include some drama in there but don't spend 95 percent of the film on it.This film is pretty much the disappointing child of 2012 and WWZ. It got all of the bad genes and none of the good ones. It's just about bearable if you're playing solitaire or something while you watch it, otherwise don't waste your time.",Greenland

The events in this film are not only possible, but probable.Personally, I enjoyed this more than 2012, in part because it's far more realistic, but also because it faces the reality of human nature: not only jealousy, greed, and violence in desperation, but our will to survive, care for each other, and be kind even as we face our trials and tribulations.Some side notes:The pilot's adamance about the weight, and handling of the emergency was very realistic... except for him (and the foley artists) treating other PT6 turboprops like piston engines.(Also, fun fact, jet fuel isn't nearly as flammable as films suggest, and jet fuel hoses don't leak like that)The behavior of the troops and FEMA workers is a standard that everyone should adhere to: holding to their duty with cold steadfastness when needed, but warm and accommodating when possible.",Greenland
688,p-sainsbury,The Worst of everything,2,10 February 2021,"First off, I gave it 2 stars, because of occasional good fx. That only. What a terrible piece of dirge. If Heat magazine did sci-fi, they would make this.
Wooden lead, annoying support, sick child, bad sci-fi. Characters doing really stupid things, repeatedly, but still somehow making it to the end. Cliche after cliche after cliche. I thought this sort of toss disappeared with the 90s hup hup blockbusters. Amazingly, despite an imminent apocalypse extinction event, the phones, electricity and water still works. Good on those workers for manning their stations!!!
Anyone who says they like this sort of film, doesn't, unless they mean insipid melodrama, with plastic characters, dressed up as sci-fi. Anyone who genuinely likes thought provoking sci-fi will see through this garbage within short shrift. I made it most of the way through, and then fast forwarded to check the obvious ending happened. It did.

We went with quite low expectations, but as there is nothing else left to watch in cinemas, we decided to give it a try. And we actually liked it!It starts with all typical cliches of this genre: family issues, ill kid, forgotten medical kit and etc. But the way it executed, is very subtle with many emotional moments. The ploy actually makes sense, people don't behave stupid, kid is not annoying and there is no over the top CGI with constant last second rescue with zero scratch and no feeling of a real danger. The catastrophe feels real, people feel real and it actually always interesting to follow. The kid did a great performance. The only wish, that the movie would have ended 5 minutes earlier, without the cheesy Hollywood feel good finale, but oh well, this is Hollywood, so it is expected.So in general I would recommend seeing it in cinema.",Greenland

The longer the movie went on the more I hoped the three main characters would fail. I knew they wouldn't, but ffs. They were so pathetically entitled, so privileged that they wouldn't know common sense if it smacked them in the face.

And it works ! It does create a lot tension, but it's all aimed towards the scenarists, for blatantly taking you for an imbecile.

From jealous neighbors, to horrible people looting, stealing, kidnapping and brutally fighting; all for self preservation. It was too real.The science was accurate which made the disaster part of the movie enjoyable. No crazy leaps of faith like shooting at the comet of sending Bruce Willis into space.The cast was likable and it was easy to get invested in their well being. There were many bad decisions that you can see coming but it made sense. In the face of peril people aren't rational, and it's easy for the audience to second guess such decisions, which adds to the drama.The movie overall is intense and heartbreaking - which is life.",Greenland

But the human responses in this movie are in fact realistic.This movie is pure, terrific entertainment. The scenario is presented quite realistically, with the characters reacting in a suitable way; you feel their desperation and instincts for survival.

Nice production values. When things start going haywire the tension just keeps building and never lets go, until the final scene. Very gripping and entertaining.I usually don't like disaster movies as the 'hero' usually does over the top things to save everyone.

703,Drogan-Hex,Very Tense,7,1 April 2021,"Directing: Ric Roman Waugh's dedication in this movie to deliver the storyline as intended without deviation was accomplished. I was, as was many others were expecting to watch an action filled disaster movie packed with action, but I was not disappointed with what I saw.Production: My problem here was with the trailer, which I'd say was done deliberately as it is to draw in disaster movie enthusiasts and at the same time showing off the amazing CGI and camera work. But this was a huge mistake that backlashed and practically destroyed the movie's potential to be the great movie it is.Script: The story is about a couple and their kid surviving a disaster event. Chris Sparling did much better than I expected writing this movie, and I must stress that even though we've been through many disaster movies, this one quite excelled because of the fact that its main focus was the story of the couple surviving the disaster than it is about the disaster itself and what comes with it. In addition, I admit that there are a lot of cliché scenes that could have been better written.Acting: I expected nothing less from Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin, two of my absolute favorite actors. Their performance was not award worthy but definitely worth the praise.Cinema and sound: Amazing work done that deserved more than just one nomination for not only the sound and effects but the cinematography and CGI as well. Another thing that I liked while watching is that there was no excess use of shaky camera work which is the one thing I absolutely dislike in these types of movies.Conclusion: I must say that I enjoyed watching it, the story might not be as some had expected with much less action scenes, but it was enjoyable to watch.I give Greenland a rating of 7/10.",Greenland

If you like Armageddon or deep impact. You'll probably really enjoy this. The whole story revolves around one family trying to get to a safe bunker. Along the way they face many challenges. Simple story line nothing complicated. At times tho it gets a little out there in the whole help scenario and the ending reminds me a lot of 2012 just without the arks. But it's satisfying.

This movie has none of what made those movies such fun, mindless entertainment. Basic premise is a comet is going to collide with Earth. Before the Big Bang itself, we're given a bunch of debris from the oncoming comet hitting the planet wrecking havoc. There are no epic scenes of global monuments being decimated. It's just asteroids hitting houses, cars & such. Even after Clarke, the comet, hits the planet we see nothing. We're in the bunkers with the survivors. A black screen. Seriously, the Earth is getting pummeled while we see a BLACK SCREEN!!!! Quick flashes of London, Rome, Paris, are flashed, blink & u will miss them. Just a very quick picture to show us, no film. Monuments wrecked but in tact enough we can still recognize them.The film is about a family of three, b-grade Russell Crowe stand in Gerard Butler, as fat and haggard as ever. Seriously, he has partied hard. For comparison see him in this vs Timeline 20 yrs ago when he was as handsome and charismatic as Paul Walker. Booze, drugs and a Johnny Depp lifestyle have ruined him. Of course his wife (Deadpool's gf/wife) is stunning & gorgeous. Thin, not a line on her face, even with the planet being space bombed she could walk a NY fashion show runway, and her son. The 3 are mysteriously chosen by the government to be saved, we're never told why the people chosen are deemed worthy to live. The movie is then a road flick as they get separated and fight to get back to one another in the hope of catching a civilian flight from Canada to Greenland & the bunkers.Hey, I love a mindless movie of fun images to massive tsunami's, aliens blowing up the Empire State Bldg & White House, cruise ships overturned, etc....this has nothing close to that.",Greenland

A more human and character focused story than either Armageddon or Deep Impact. Perhaps less visually spectacular, but also more realistic and gritty then any other meteor disaster movie.It's a shame that the creators didn't put a bit more budget and time into the final impact scenes, that could've pushed this film up to a 9 or 10 for me. It was somewhat anti climatic, after such a well written build up, you couldn't help but want more scenes to hammer home the effect of this miles wide monster impacting the world.

I can tell they wanted to make it kinda realistic as what would happen in a scenario like this but failing at it as in order to make the movie not a snooze fest, the family is either extremely lucky or unlucky and they either meet with the worst possible human beings or literal saints; there is no in-between.I still gave it a 5 because it may not be great it's still fine for one viewing and to pass 2 hours.",Greenland

753,ToThePointReviews,Pretty Good Disaster Flick,6,7 March 2021,"""Greenland"" is a better-than-average disaster flick that at times focuses as much on the drama and mayhem surrounding the disaster as it does on the film's central terrifying event.Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin play a couple who, along with their young son, desperately try to stay together and escape the fallout from a planet-destroying comet that is unalterably careening towards earth. Amidst the chaos and panic around them, the little family must fight through a succession of harrowing predicaments as they pursue a plan they hope will deliver them from the impending destruction.The central characters are sympathetic, and the action and terror are well executed. There are a few annoying nods to political correctness, but they are not paramount to the storyline. Glaring plot flaws are deftly avoided, though a few contrivances serve to keep things moving along. ""Greenland"" is therefore a solid disaster movie, and as such it rates as six out of ten.",Greenland

755,KhellendrosTheDragon,Great visuals and very intense storyline,9,1 January 2021,"This movie is driven more by the character's story and what they go through than by the cool visuals, which it also has lots of. The story of the comet pieces hitting Earth almost takes a backseat to the look at what depravities humans will stoop to when they feel hopeless and threatened, but also shows how sometimes tragedy brings out the best in some people. Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin are both wonderful and show, rather than tell, their struggles. I was literally gripped on the edge of my seat and leaning towards the tv for half the movie, and my only gripe is that I wish they'd shown a bit more of the fireballs and explosions on impact at the end, as I do love me a good destruction disaster movie, but that's minor compared to how great this movie was.",Greenland

If you're looking for a stripped back scientifically accurate depiction of a comet falling to Earth then this is not for you.

770,happytobesam,"Good movie, ending not well prepared",8,14 August 2020,"I liked this movie. Yes like most disaster movies it has the standard recipe of a divorced/nearly divorced family, I still don't get why. The movie shows some special effects of impacts but this is no 2012, this movie is mostly about the breakdown of society when all of the sudden everyday people are confronted with despair. I find it amusing how some comments here are about characters in the movie are portrayed negative and selfish only caring about their own family. Newsflash for you ... that's what people tend to do in a situation of life and death. You ever look at reports in the news of people clawing each others eyes out at food distribution in war zones? They know very well more food is coming. Now imagine the whole world being faced with imminent death ... it will not be pretty. Frankly I would be like that group partying till the music stops.Spoilers:
Now as regarding the ending. They arrived at the base in Greenland with the diabetic kid. How did this kid survive 9 months when it was clear in the beginning they were avoiding people requiring longterm medicines? After all when they ran in the Cold War shelter it clearly looked unused since decades. Everyone only knew about the comet since a few days so it's not like they could prepare the place.Since when did places like New Delphi and Sao Paulo have nuclear blast grade old Cold War shelters?Also 9 months!?! I know they need some positive fluff at the end of American movies or they won't do well in the box office over there. But anyone paying attention in science class would remember that after the Yucatan impact it was suspected the skies did not properly clear for several years.So I am still giving it an 8 because the acting was good and so was the overall story. Science and disaster movies have never been the best of friends, it remains a fiction story after all.",Greenland
771,lnyron,There's better - there's worse.,5,24 December 2020,"Let my title say it all. What do we watch movie's for? To be entertained. This high-budget thriller about an aging couple of parents who race against the clock to get their son (and themselves) to shelter from apocalypse. I think the movie starts out a lot stronger; I would like to at least get my hand's on the first draft's or concept's of the script.Feels too sterile for me. I like more grit and it feels fairly whitewashed; quite literally. There are some black-people in token part's, with fairly pivotal role's but I don't think this movie's for the brotha's and sista's. Still like I said, it's entertainment, sort of B-movie super serious stuff at it's best. I could have done without the whole marriage on the rock's thing in there though, which, along with some other theme's feels artificial and tacked on.5/10 : Good Enough.",Greenland
772,evi_markopoulou,All the whys that were left unanswered. *SPOILERS*,2,27 December 2020,"So many plot holes and poor decisions I can't even handle it !
Why did they forget the insulin in the car in the first place? That's the first thing a parent would take. No wait! That's the first thing a SICK kid would take cause at this age the kid perfectly knows it's a matter of survival for him.
Next ... how were they chosen to enter the shelter in the first place if sick people weren't supposed to survive? Did the government not check the medical history of the chosen subjects?!! What was the criterion? Looks? Plus ... Greg dad gets chosen for being an engineer. But why was the rest of his family chosen? Sensitivity?? The government didn't want him to lose his family? And why does the survival of the family depend on the father's/male's profession? A bit too convenient for the patriarchal Hollywood model right?
Let's ignore this and move on, shall we? Mother and kid hitchhike and end up with a crazy fellow who kidnaps the kid. Wait, what?? Why keep a kid that you know has gotten rejected? Why not grab the bracelets of both and kick them out? Anyway.. mom gets kicked out and screams to the kid to get out of the car without helping him AT ALL! And seems pretty normal after it happened too!! Just sobbing in the street as if she was just robbed or sth.
Of course she finds the kid extremely fast!!! Not only the kid though... She also finds an angelic nurse who is calm and sweet and smiley as if it was just another day at Greg's anatomy hospital. And of course she has got meds and finds them a means of transport too! Are you kiddin me??
Next she meets her husband, they reunite and she just announces that she hasn't got a bracelet! He doesn't EVEN ask her why! I mean ... you'd think she would tell him their kid got kidnapped!! Or that he would ask where her ticket of survival is! But no... after all the kid doesn't look traumatised at all!
And let's talk about the Grandpa scene, please!! They've got 48 hours to escape and they have showers and pancakes! Not to mention that when grandpa chooses to stay behind and die, his daughter just casually accepts it and leaves. Come on!!! Don't you think she should be devastated? Cry? beg him? Shout at him? Force him into the car? No! This woman just gives us a punchline joke and pulls out of the driveway!!
Cutting through the end ... he blocks the way of a plane with his truck and ambushes the pilot to take them all as a family unit! As IF! And not only that but he lies about his weight?! LOL!
And can we please stop saving everyone in every single disaster film?
Dear Hollywood, why do we need a family safe and sound at the end? Why are you so scared Hollywood of a broken family? Of divorced parents who stay divorced? Why are you afraid of the reality of a family losing a kid in a pandemic? We assure you that even if the whole family was wiped out we, the audience, would survive! We're tough! We won't lose out faith in humanity or patriarchy! After all, isn't that what you're so scared of?
Just give us a break and a more realistic plotline next time please! Thank you.",Greenland

Power outages, no cell phones yet they always manage to find each other. This movie is a nice distraction but gosh the kid is written as a complete moron. Diabetic and knows how important his meds are but forgets them in the car. While his mom is being dragged out of a car, he just sits there and cries instead of getting out the other door. And while the world blows apart, he wants his pancakes.

The movie clumsily bumbles ahead through the most mundane, overused and cliched (and at points irritatingly stupid) plot ""developments"". If you've seen a hundred movies in your life (which you surely have), you've seen everything that's in this movie, and likely done better. It's one of those movies where you try to suspend the reality-checking, but it just gets worse as the movie goes on.What irritates me is that they also couldn't help themselves and chose to show all the highlights in the trailer!! True that that is likely someone else's decision... But in the end, it's yet again 2 hours of your life you'll wish you could get back.
I watched this on a streaming service, it doesn't belong even there. Can't imagine I'd pay for this in a theatre.

Yes there are cliches, The script no better than average. Certainly no attempt at humour - Bruce Willis is not on set, but otherwise the storyline keeps the viewers interest right until the end.Mainly, this movie is about how humans can act towards each other when the chips are down.

783,bishopmart,I've seen worse.,7,7 February 2021,What better to watch during lockdown than a film about the end of the world?!It's basically about a ordinary family with ordinary problems that have been picked to survive Armageddon.Good news you'd think but of course that would be so boring their child is diabetic so when they do get to the airbase that will take them away and of course get separated the mother is told they are being refused entry because of his condition.Then it's a par for the course movie as they move separately to her fathers. Coming across the usual end of the world problems like looters and people that will do anything to get on that plane themselves.In the end they manage to get on a private plane that will take them to the secret base on Greenland. But of course they have more problems to face before that happens.But they get inside just in time as these things happen and in the end the bunker doors open for the survivors to face a brave new but crispy world.One thing that bugged me though if the kid was refused in the first place because I assume their wasn't that much medication in the bunker why do we see them walk out 9 months later with no problems?It was ok and strangely enough not too depressing considering the subject matter.But if you are expecting an action adventure then you will be disappointed the dynamics of the film really just revolve the family with a few action sequences thrown in but few and far between.,Greenland

But things really kick into high gear when we are introduced to Morena Baccarin running on a treadmill, because you know women - they get fat and they need to exercise like all the time. Then of course she opens her mouth and its the usual women stuff, so you can go get a snack and come back in 5 minutes. They'll include some kid scene that is annoying and cringe for everyone involved, but you are still in the kitchen getting a snack, so its tolerable.I'm only 10 minutes in but you can tell this movie will end the way it started - predictably, boring, probably large sound effects, a few million in pyrotechnics and more cringe worthy lines.

793,mohammad-z,Absolutely not what you expect,10,31 October 2020,"There a lot of movies dealing with the world (possibly) coming to an end. Most of this movies focus on the type of destructions, or on heroes, who do the impossible and save humanity from whatever is coming. Of course all of them will have some kind of human interaction included in their storyline. Love is a key aspect to an ordinary screenplay. So what is then so special about this movie?It is an emotional rollercoaster drive. It digs deep into human nature. Not only scratches it on the surface of what human beings could be capable of, when the world would face such an disaster, but it drills inside, you can actually feel it. You can actually understand, what such a scenario would really mean. It was the first time I was watching an world-ending scenario movie, where I actually believed everything I was given on screen. For me that is absolutely unique, and as I learned from TENET's reviews on this and other platforms; you cannot rely on the publics opinion, when it comes to your own taste.Whrever you live, if theatres are open, do yourself a favor and go watch this incredible piece in a cinema. Far away from distractions, that video on demand comes along with.

Film was more about ridiculous situations the protagonists got themselves into, so they could be re-united, than an actual disaster movie, so don't watch this expecting Dante's Peak or something similar. Maybe I just came to this movie wanting a bit more 'disaster'.
2. Every time GB broke into a run, I got tired for him
3. I got to the very end and still didn't know what I had watched
4. How could GB move in and out of the safe area at will, when others struggled to get in?
5. The backstory could have just as easily been a zombie apocalypse.
6. If you want a road trip story about a family who just can't seem to help getting split up on their way to an objective, then you'll be ok with this.",Greenland

Like gas and supplies like food, water etc. Also the military was shooting people trying to get on the planes to go to Greenland. Sending special text to those selected and giving them special id's, but anybody who just shows up at the bunker at the last minute is just waved on in. It made no since.

820,lat297,Moving to Greenland now...,9,6 February 2021,"I went into this movie with high hopes, having waited months to see it during the pandemic - thank goodness for Amazon Prime!A lot of this is your standard disaster flick: running from almost certain doom, panic buying, society breaking down, etc etc. But what I really enjoyed were the many small moments of goodness that helped restore faith in humanity. Almost as if the aim was to make the viewer feel that in amongst all the madness, we deserve to survive after all. Whether it was a driver stopping to help, or aid workers putting themselves at risk, or simple the number of people who carried on to keep things running despite the overwhelming odds against them surviving another 24 hours. This movie really went out of its way to highlight that we don't just forget everything and become monsters as soon as we're in danger.It was also a tremendous relief that the subject of religion was avoided almost entirely (apart from a few subtle nods along the way).Unlike many predecessors (I'm looking at you, Armageddon and Deep Impact), the ominous comet Clarke wasn't the centre of the movie. There were no deep space shots of it thundering towards Earth or glimmers of hope in the form of deus ex machina or hastily assembled missiles. Clarke is basically gonna wipe us out, and we see everything from the protagonist's perspective, whether it's on the radio or overhead or on the TV. It draws you closer to the danger.Emotionally, this film is quite tough. Younger children may find some of the scenes quite distressing, right from the start. The themes of separation and helplessness are pretty much always there right until the end, and more than once we had watery eyes.So yeah, I felt this was worth the wait, and probably a movie we'll watch again.",Greenland

Why do these films always have the child with the medical issue that always always always becomes an enormous issue! These forced moments of tension don't ever work well and always alienates the viewer for a portion of time!
The main 2 actors are great in the movie and have a great CV. For me opportunity missed as these movies always start explosively and really fun and enjoyable then dwindle away as time goes on, I mean, the peak needs to be at the end people!!

That's the best acting I've seen from both main characters. High anxiety movie in several ways, but that's what made it feel so real. Being separated from family in a crisis, kidnapping, medical conditions to deal with, the sheer despair was conveyed brilliantly, and not being able to trust the majority of people who are trying to save their own families or themselves and what that might all look like, was terrifyingly realistic. Rarely does an end of days action movie get the time it needs to quickly build some character development and get the audience to relate well with those characters and the storyline, but the team behind this managed to pull it off well. They had a boy the age of my son, so that of course made it all the more dramatic for me, but the kid was great, great acting, and I felt like my son would have behaved and said all the same things this one did.Definitely on my favorites list.",Greenland

In that case, just stay home and save other people the trouble of navigating you and accept your fate that you are 100% going to die.Pro tip: If you have 15 hours until the E.L.E. hits but the safe bunker is 14 hours and 45 min drive, it is ok to not drive like a grandma with coke bottles for glasses.Oh yeah, and don't make the 163946582946 stupid decisions the characters make in this movie.Other than that, it was alright",Greenland

There were some great little twists and turns in there.
Greenland captures the horrors and lows of humans, what they will do to survive and also the sacrifices, people will make for others. I see moments like this in my life, why not in a film?
The acting is good and the little boy did a fine job. He has done some of the best work in the whole picture, he really came across a scared witless!
I enjoyed the film.
See it for yourselves.",Greenland
865,sfxprops,"Very well done, action-packed, end of the world film.",7,22 November 2020,"First, let me confess and get this out of the way, I do like Gerard Butler.
However, that is not why I think this movie is so good.
This was a very well done, action-packed, end of the world film.
Was this film totally perfect? No.
Were there any mistakes made in the film? There may have been, but you would have to look very hard to find them.
The production values were very high. The acting was very well done. Everything had an expensive, polished look to it.
The cinematography, acting, editing, sound and SFX were all up there.
The budget I believe, was $35 million; and every single penny of that is up on the screen for you to enjoy.
DO NOT allow the negative reviewers to scare you away from watching this film!
If you do, you will be robbed of experiencing a very good action movie.
It seems like some people watch a movie with the sole intention of trying to pick it apart!
Some people say that all of this is been done before. Well maybe in a way, it has.
Think about it. Just how many different ways can you make an end of the world film?
Look where we are. It's 2020. Do you know how many end of the world movies have been made?!
Hundreds, if not thousands! So to be honest, it's kind of hard to come up with an idea that is completely original. They say the devil is in the details. The truth of the matter is that in all of these end of the world movies that have been made so far, the differences between them is in the details!
For instance, we already know (from the trailers) that a planet killing comet is going to hit.
And yes, we know that there are going to be people panicking, and experiencing hardships, and all kinds of destruction, etc., etc., etc.
So when you consider all the movies that are made with that general plot outline, the only way they can vary from each other is in all of the many details.
For instance, take a movie script, copy it 100 times, and give a copy to 100 different directors and film crews. When everything is said and done, you will end up with 100 movies all about the same thing.
But all of these movies will be completely different from each other. They will have a different look, feel, atmosphere, technical expertise, flavor, etc.
And the reason that they are all completely different from each other, is because there are so many 1000s and 1000s of small details that make up a movie that cause these movies to be completely different from each other.
So like I said, the devil is in the details. And the details are what make a movie either good or bad.
All in all, I think that Greenland is a very well done movie.
So yes, when you sit down to watch the movie, you already know that supposedly, a comet is going to destroy the world. But you don't really know exactly how it's going to happen. And you don't know exactly all of the infinitely small details that join together and ultimately bring you to that event.
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
Is it the 'comet ends the world film' to end all, 'comet ends the world films'? Probably not.
But this film is definitely worth watching. You will be thoroughly entertained.
All of the main actors are people that you actually end up caring about.
Were some aspects of the movie glossed over at the expense of other parts? Perhaps.
So all in all, let me just say this:
This was a very well done, action-packed, end of the world film.
And I believe that you will really enjoy it!
Because ultimately, the goal of a film such as this, is to entertain you.
And Greenland really succeeds.",Greenland

867,londondeville,Privileged family yells their way to safety while constantly being rewarded.,4,8 February 2021,"This whole movie has more plot holes than can be listed but essentially falls apart over time as an entitled family forces you to hate them as they strangely get exceptional treatment from everyone who is in the same horrible situation. All attempts to humanize them seem contrived as you realize how selfish they are.They bully, yell and whine their way into everyone's hearts and transportation in an amazing display of privilege while leaving bodies in their wake. You'll have fun cheering for their demise but spoiler: they unfortunately survive.Five stars for some fun but repetitive visuals.",Greenland
868,anakincc,The other characters feel like bots.,8,16 June 2021,"Ofcource this movie has 3 main characters and is focussed on them, and thats fine, but they meet and interact with many other characters and although they have some pesonality (especially the grandfather) all the ""fellow passengers"" have not.Often there is a shot during total chaos were only the main characters are aware of their surroundings while the other characters near them act like...Zombies...soulless.. just stare blankly forward with no emotion, fear or worry at all. That bugged me a huge deal since the world is in a state of total chaos and despair and the people arround them seem not to mind at all.Example 1 is in the house party were a comet lands and only the dad runs outside, everyone else just sticks inside.Example 2 is at the blockade were the main characters are able to easily push through without a struggle or fight.Example 3 is When the dad enters the plane, pretty much all the other passengers are static.Example 4 is in the car with the tent that the dad takes, The people in that car seem pretty....idle.Example 5 is in the final plane to greenland. I mean just look at them. The comet lands and some of them dont even have the slightest desire to look out of the window.And thats just 5 examples from my head.Asside from that its a great movie if you like Deep impact and Armageddon then you will like this too.The main characters have plot armor.CGI is nice.The boy looks like a girl, especially in the earlier flashbacks and that can be confusing.This negative seems pretty negative now, but its 2 hours of great intensity non the less. I was very much into this movie and certainly recommended. The music really adds pressure on the chaotic athmosphere.",Greenland

If you are being struck during the day, at night your location has rotated away from the comet.The movie was not believable. It fell way short of any kind of reality.I like the way they traveled from Kentucky to Canada by congested and damaged roads in just a couple of hours.Then they took a small overloaded plane that could never have made the trip to Greenland to Greenland.After the ""extinction"" impact, the air was remarkably clear. There should have been debris in the air for years and the planet should be suffering from something similar to nuclear winter.Just another big action film without any substance at all.",Greenland

What the audience got to see was a a simplified radar screen from the monitor of a military personnel while the protagonists huddled in the bunker and the camera shacked a little.... I'm beyond words that the director decided to not include that.The only reasonable explanation I can come up with for such a boned headed is lack of budget and/or time.I was quite enjoying myself up until that point, admiring the entre of destruction until the main course was served.

886,spacechick-54620,"Clichéd, boring and predictable",1,23 August 2020,"Whenever I see a disaster movie, I want to know the science and the cause behind it and how the world will or will not change. What I don't want to see is a guy trying to save his wife and child for 2 hours, the egoistic pursuit of a microorganism (family) to save their own little asses, ignoring friends, other relatives, neighbors, other children, stepping on everyone and everything to get themselves saved. It irritates me endlessly whenever I see a movie, where the actor is repeatedly screaming ""MY WIFE AND KID, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE"" I don't want to see a disaster movie being romanticized, and idealized into the happily ever ending relationship between man and woman, and the idealized version of a sweet little happy family. Why does Hollywood need to center all their movies around these biases? This movie is way too cliched. Man and woman divorced, husband cheated, woman is angry, man is trying to do his best, has major regrets. A child being ill, needs constant medication. What exactly was this movie about? According to the short description: A family struggles for survival in the face of a cataclysmic natural disaster. No they are not struggling for survival, they are trying to get to a save place, and once they finally get there bumm, it's all over.Dear Hollywood,Why not write an original script for once without these clichés?

I thought it was very thought-provoking, it held a lot of realism two events of this nature, that would be very fast, and people wouldn't have time to really comprehend or planned for something this big.
I related to so many aspects, and it gave me a little hope that not everyone would want you did that some people, would want to try and help even if it meant to the detriment of themselves because it's something I would do. I think this has to be the best disaster movie I have ever come across it took a long time to come out to Australia and it was highly worth the wait I bought the movie twice just to show my support and very glad that it finally decide to come out we need to see something like this this year.

Usually ""end of the world"" movies are horrible with bad acting, but Greenland was well made with fantastic acting. And the fact that during Covid people were able to make this, is mind blowing.

EVERY SINGLE helpful good guy is black with one exception of a migrant family with a good guy cameo. I initially treated as a joke thinking I'm reading too much into it until it happened again & again & again.It was so ridiculous that you could call who'll be a good & bad guy based on the colour of the actors skin.

Putting the catastrophe depiction aside, the overall story just wasn't particularly exciting... I'm also a big space nerd so that aspect also let me down. Not for me, but if you're looking for a no-brainer popcorn movie - give 'er.For me, the entire film fell apart when the family was split trying to get their son's medication. It felt like a really cheap way to raise tension and just came across as silly. From here, it was just a series of dull events with minimal consequence.

Those of which choose survival, those of which choose reparations, those who choose to party and accept death, those who choose faith and harmony, those who seek to break grudges in favor of absolution, and those that long to depart to meet their significant other.This film questions a man who could be a husband to beautiful woman and father to child(ren) and forcefully separated from them, questions a woman that could be wife and a mother to child(ren) and forcefully separated, questions a child(ren) on bravery on testifying true parents amongst the deceptive enemies who calm them there own for survival.

You need to evacuate your house and you waste time...making PB&J sandwiches? She also somehow thinks the world is about to become altruistic and everyone is going to help them. I haven't seen a dumber box since goes knows when. And this actress, oh god, whining whining crying crying...pull yourself together. It's like the only face she has is just crying. It's really unattractive. She drags her kind into a pharmacy that is being looted. Good move mom of the year.The father is also really stupid. I honestly can't get over how dumb they both are, it was such a pain to watch. Oh, the kid needs insulin?!? Yeah let's just let that kids lifeline our of our sight.Once rejected from the flights because the mom is dumb and runs around telling everyone her kid has diabetes....hi why would we want chronically ill people to be taken to save the human race? Anyway, they get separated and run around telling EVERYONE they had been selected but missed the flights (not they they has also been rejected)...thinking what, everyone would be cool with it?!? OF COURSE people are gonna be pissed off which gets bother parents attacked and the kid stolen and blah blah blah...And then in some unlikely series of events, the BUSES ARE STILL RUNNING and they're all reunited at her dad's house.Horrible acting, awful story line, the characters are just absolutely unlikeable.

It's definitely not a theatre movie.The actions taken by characters are too cliche and that's what make it too frustrating to watch. No storyline . They are just road travelling throughout the movie and I supposed some thrill along the way.But visuals are great.

This also means that there's not a lot of disaster action so if that's what you're looking for you will be disappointed.They story is pretty standard for a disaster flick but the performances are decent from big to small parts with a good cast. Script is a bit creaky and some good actors have to deliver some garbage dialogue at times.But overall, for a smaller budget disaster flick it presents a diverting enough story for a couple of hours entertainment.

987,prettierwhenyoucry,Dull and poorly conceived disaster movie.,4,13 February 2021,"This film for many reasons, is underwhelming. I was irked by how dis-likeable the main protagonists are, and ultimately how selfish they are.When they stop the plane in the third act, with their car, this was just totally unbelievable and pointless plot point. As was the exchange with Gerard Butler's character where he lied about his weight, where there are no consequences for his lying. They all get to board anyway. I understand that humans are desperate, but their sense of entitlement makes me route for them less at the end. For example, if Gerard's character had been left behind and the film ended with the plane taking off it would have been more impactful. The distater would have actually been felt more by the viewer, as an actual distaster.Throughout, I was waiting for something to happen. The sense of urgency, the panic and the fear just doesn't translate in a gritty, meaningful way. It all feels too easy to digest, too convenient and even generic. The brutality of being attacked for your wrist band vs. the nice, helpful nursing staff always popping up was particularly idiotic to me.Another point to consider is Gerard Butler's burn on his arm was another non-starter, as was the son's diabetes which wasn't mentioned as a risk in the second half due to human convenience. The plot leaves behind notions and thus lacks suspense. The burn actually really annoyed me. This guy is a class A dick, and he randomly saves one person out of many he could have before. The burn is meant to show his compassion? Am I meant to care about his welfare? I just didn't buy his actions or see him as a worthy character.The film is paint by numbers, in terms of what it offers the viewer. I really thought it was mediocre at best in terms of what it could offer the disaster movie genre. The film didn't commit to itself and was really delivered half-baked. Also, there were too many tacked on scenes where it seemed impossible the main characters would ever reunite.If they'd shaved off some of the journey and spent longer with the father of the wife, it would have added emotional weight to care about the reunion. Or if they had skipped this, shown the father as deceased to add to the desolation and brutality, then it would have been better. It just felt this scene was lost in the third act and unnecessary.Another missed opportunity was when the son was kidnapped, and mother overpowered. The whole scenario is very unsettling yet I saw the character interaction not translate the intensity of emotions. The way it was conceived didn't convey any tension, it just seemed really fantastical when they were reunited so quickly. I would have removed this scene or made this scenario of the son going missing, a more impactful turn of events in terms of story and world building. Yes, I understand these people who took him are meant to be desperate, but I don't even care enough about this struggle. Because there's no struggle here.The main characters just overcome too many events in a very bland way. I remember the comet was called Clarke but none of the actual character's names which speaks volumes. They had zero chemistry as a family unit.",Greenland

If it had been more realistic, especially where the characters choices are involved, it would've been a better flick.",Greenland
1000,robertowall2,Surprisingly good,8,11 February 2021,I went into this really expecting a flop of a movie but overall it was actually really enjoyable. Acting was solid and the special effects were not as jarring as I expected them to be. Usual plot contrivances that can be expected with any apocalypse film but didn't really impact my enjoyment. I believe the overall standard of acting really made up for the story treading on some very cliché ground. Not groundbreaking cinema by any stretch but definitely worth a watch if you have an evening spare!,Greenland

The whole thing was nail biting stuff, felt helpless for the family, the whole friend and family dynamics between their neighbours and father was real. I loved it, going to watch it again.",Greenland
1003,black-eyed-angel,Disaster porn,5,19 February 2021,"'Greenland' is Hollywood's latest offering in a long line of 'end of the world' disaster movies. An asteroid heading towards Earth is expected to pass without incident, only for it to break apart, raining death and destruction. Director Ric Roman Waugh ramps up the apocalyptic dread with an immediacy that hits like a hammer to the head.John Garity (Gerard Butler) is a structural engineer. An everyman, he lives in suburbia and has a strained relationship with his wife and son. Garity realises during a routine supermarket run that the asteroid is no benign cosmic event. The government prioritises Garity and his family for shelter because of his particular set of skills. He is given no details, only instructions to pack one bag and to go to an airfield where presumably they'll be evacuated.The family's journey to sanctuary is fraught with hazard, their grim and joyless quest taking them from one improbable predicament to the next, as whatever can go wrong does go wrong. Many people die, and horribly. Human beings are depicted as mere rats scurrying from a burning building. The scene of a supermarket being looted is a disaster flick staple. 'Greenland' ticks all the boxes on what a disaster movie should contain, but it is sadly short on complex characters who think and behave like actual people.Dispensing with the scaled-down emotion of similarly themed films such as Deep Impact (1998) and Don McKellar's excellent Last Night (1998), Waugh falls back on recognisable tropes and clichés while keeping the foot firmly on the accelerator. Despite glimpses of kindness, people are painted in not such a good light. When a man is killed, albeit in self-defence, there's no time to mourn him. He's just another meaningless cipher whose death occurs only to advance the plot. The film rushes along in a state of constant breathlessness to get to the next white-knuckled action set piece. 'Greenland' is in full survival mode. All that matters are those closest to us.When Garity stumbles upon a rooftop party where people are drinking and celebrating as the asteroids rain down, it is a scene reminiscent of McKellar's Last Night (1998). In it, humankind has embraced its extinction event, offering a more abstract view on the meaning and value of life: a better film than this one it has to be said. When the credits roll (and you know how this movie ends) it's clear the survivors feel no exaltation, just despondency from being utterly drained.",Greenland
1004,sethp2343,"A few cliches, but some great human moments too.",7,22 April 2021,"I'm not gonna disagree with other reviews of this films use of cliches. The troubled marriage, sick kid, headstrong and irrational grandfather...it's all there 🙄. And they definitely don't fill the movie with overly CGI'd city destruction (Michael A-Bay-minations) like any Marvel movie, Day After Tomorrow, 2012, or other films of the genre.Where Greenland fails to break the mold in some ways, it definitely makes up for it with believable human moments. Other disaster films and video games love to dive into terrifying moments of human barbarism and evil. Greenland has a little bit of that, but instead intersects some real, touching showcases of empathy and positive human spirit. Dont get me wrong, I like watching Europe get obliterated occasionally and human evil in the face of desperation on display, but I was actually touched by some of Greenland moments. I recommend it if you want a slight change of pace in genre!",Greenland

1008,tarekabdelkader,"It is fun, But you feel that you have seen it before, especially if you see many films of this kind, it is worth watching, but with half your brain",5,30 November 2020,"As clear from the story, the movie is considered a movie about disasters and the end of a the world, a classification which many people love, and over the last 20 years we have shown very excellent films of this category, such as Snowpriecer, Mad Max Fury Road and World War Z, but on the other hand we have seen very weak ones too, like 2012 for exampleThe main problem in this movies is no matter how different details differ, but their screenplays remain very predictable, and often the viewer remains aware of what happens in the end of the movie, few films broke the routine and these films are stuck with the viewer
The movie Greenland is unfortunately not an exception, the structure is very traditional and expected from the first scene to the last scene, but despite this it is not a bad movie, of course it is traditional and does not have new ideas in itself, something that may puts you off and makes you decide not to watch it, but at least it implements these old ideas well and achieve the most important goal, which is to thrill and suspense the viewer to the end
To be completely fair about this point, I must say that there is one new idea in the meddle of the movie that I liked very much, But I cannot talk about it in details because I don't want to spoil itI liked that the relationship between the husband and his wife has its complications, which creates a faint dramatic line in the background of the events and has a noticeable presence, which made the relationship more realistic and added a lot to the filmBut of course, the film cannot go beyond the usual flaws in commercial films, which are the defects in directing many senses, there is no noticeable ideas or shots, for example a scene in the movie that is shot in extreme darkness and takes 3 or 4 cuts per second. As a result, I actually saw almost nothing of it

The plot holes are the scariest part about this movie, and there are lots of them. It's so bad the SFX don't even come close to even throwing it a life preserver.
Basically it's the unbelievable story of an incredibly entitled yank family who gets to be saved from the evil meteorite (because... reasons), misses out on getting saved, endures unbelievably ridiculous and arrogant scenarios, then gets miraculously saved in the end. This really was a waste of video, and 2 hours of my life I will never get back (although admittedly I just couldn't watch all of it as it was sooooo bad so went and made a cake half way thru).

No way would you be able to go outside hours, days, weeks or even months after this happened and see the sun shining and a few birds flying around.

Plus the absolute stupidity of the decisions Gerald Butler's character and his family make are so outlandish they really do all deserve to die. I'll leave it there.",Greenland

What set Greenland apart was how they were pieced together to create a believable and heartfelt movie with decent character development, believable antagonists, all told along a classic hero's journey story arc. Greenland is no fantastical disaster movie, but a genuine family drama with great visual effects and commendable performances by Baccarin and Butler.",Greenland
1088,DaveMattia,Only the characters experience the disaster,3,13 February 2021,"Remember when CNN - or maybe it was another network - said, ""We will bring you the news about the end of the word.""? Yeah, well here is a perfect example of how that could be true -- but only in movies where a a thousand extras in CGI cities are being bombarded by small asteroids as another life-extermination sized asteroid impact looms only hours away. Everyone else in this apocalyptical world still goes to work - dressed and prepped - to report the news. I know there are situations that are ""movie believable"" but Greenland takes this suspension of disbelief to the limit. Who writes this stuff? If it was a kid in 4th grade, I would say it was nice and stick the script on his grandmother's refrigerator. I mean, imagine seeing TV anchors doing their job like it's just another day except for the fact that they will be vaporized in 10 hours. Please, if there is anyone who would show up for their job while this is happening, he or she is a weirdo who should only live in a world of disaster movies. Apart from the fact that 8 billion people are going to die in a few hours, and they all know it, the characters involved - the main ones anyway - always seem to find one soldier or doctor or person in authority who can help them with trivial things. Imagine the world is ending in a fiery meltdown, but you can't get your kid his medicine, and you ask to speak to the manager when a military officer says no. Add to that, a lot of laziness from the writer and director, or probably both. How do you drive from Georgia to Louisville to Canada to an airstrip somewhere in Canada in such a short time without even having to stop for gas. Of course one can say that the gas stops are implied, but who ran the gas pumps? Who supplied the electricity for a filling station. Did gas stations people show up for work like TV news anchors? Wow, such dedication to their jobs is to be applauded. How did a seriously overloaded twin prop commuter plane get from this imaginary airstrip in Canada all the way to Greenland without a stop in Gander or wherever? Then there is the problem with science. They treat an extermination event asteroid blast that wipes out all of Europe as though it was a hurricane that blows out to sea. After nine months - which is a convenient background voice line thrown in to tell you how long its been - how is the world now a beautiful and sunny place when in fact it should be a dark and lifeless and barren tundra of virtual nothingness for decades to come? You don't simply open the door to your mega-bunker and see the sun shining, the flowers blooming and the blue birds chirping as they flutter by. Why do you look exactly like you did 9 months earlier in the midst of the cataclysm ? Your hair has not grown, and you're wearing the same clothes? You don't even need a shave and your kid with diabetes has had enough insulin and healthcare to get him through the whole thing despite the fact that he is not allowed in the bunker because the military banned him owing to his illness. It's as though someone said, ""No one is allowed in the survival bunker if they have an illness that requires treatment, but let's throw in a sympathetic military nurse with every diabetic supply she will need for a year just in case some cute little diabetic kid sneaks in."" I could go on for pages with things like, uh, finding keys in a random house and simply assuming there is a fully functional vehicle there....and there is! No, this is a lazy movie, written and directed by lazy people for lazy viewers. The videography is cheap and just gimmicky enough to look lazy-hip. Basically, this movie stinks.",Greenland

I mean really, never has a disaster movie come close to being a Oscar worthy masterpiece. They have to move the plot along somehow and either you leave the ending up to debate and interpretation or you finish it up with a closed conclusion.

You can see this in the scenes of the military, looters, riders/ passengers, everywhere. Not sure what point they were trying to make but definitely unnecessary. And this is coming from a Venezuelan by the way.Other than that the movie is nicely done and the acting is very believable. It's not a life changing movie by any means but in my opinion gets a solid 6.

1146,arrensch,Actually pretty decent,6,16 February 2021,"Greenland is slightly higher quality than what you would find from a straight to DVD film, but it works so well. I actually found myself mildly invested in the characters throughout the movie, and the constant stress felt over the circumstances the family is put under works very well. I especially like how we view the events from the perspective of the family. It gives the audience insight on how people are reacting to what is going on and helps us relate to something as we think about how we would react in the same situation. The performances are also pretty good, the kid gave a good performance, which is always proof of a Director who knows roughly what they are doing. The problems I had, the film can be quite cliche. The family goes through different events but of course it works out for them while everyone else around them doesn't have the same luck. The movie also takes a lot of tropes from previous disaster movies. Some setpeices are even similar to past disaster films. And finally, the movie can feel a bit to somber and gray, without having much life and joy to it. In some of the best disaster films there is always a balance of fun and excitement mixed with the thrills and at times, horror of what is happening. Given the lack of movies in 2020, this is somehow one of the better films of the year.",Greenland

1167,jakepage-16146,An absolute thrill ride.,8,13 February 2021,"If you're not overly skeptical and instead you're looking to get cozy in front of the tv and be gripped for 2 hours, then I strongly recommed giving Greenland a chance. I am surprised by the negative reaction his has received and personally it nearly turned me away from watching, but my girlfriend insisted and so I sat back and prepared myself to be underwhelmed and resort to browsing my phone when the boredom struck in.I haven't been so pleasantly wrong about a movie in a long time. Greenland is a 2 hour thrill ride and will absolutely suck you in. Okay, so it isn't the most original disaster flick formula. It centres around one family's experience of the end of the world and their pursuit of safety after being selected for shelter as a planet killer asteroid approaches Earth. It also contains a host of roll your eyes ""Oh C'mon"" moments, which is to be expected by any Hollywood disaster flick. I believe this is part of the reason for the negative reviews.However, this is at least far more realistic than movies such as 2012 and Armageddon. From the very first moment, you feel thrust into the plot and a sense of dread and tension is persistent. There is no presidential storyline arc, no wider view of whats really going on... All the information we have about the impending doom is drip fed to us as the family learn about it through news broadcasts and word of mouth, as well as certain events preceding the arrival of 'The big one'. It's what made 'Signs' such a fantastic end of the world movie in 2002, that sense of experiencing the situation through the perspective of a single, or small collection of witnesses as the disaster unfolds.There are some really strong scenes, moments in which I had my hand over my mouth in shock, a lot of moments in which I was on the edge of my seat, and moments in which I could have shed a tear. It really is a rollercoaster and I haven't been so gripped to a movie in a long while. Especially toward the end, I was wide eyed and with a knot in my stomach as the climax built.I really don't have much bad to say about this movie. It's perceived weakness come from the aforementioned fact that it throws typical Hollywood coincidental moments and near misses at you, and doesn't offer a particularly novel approach to the disaster movie genre. But these are negligeble and if like me, you're seeking to be entertained and not to sample the movie the way a food critic gets through a restaurant meal, then I strongly urge you to watch this.

1182,Ackshon,Bad remake of 2012,3,30 January 2021,"This movie follows the usual B grade script of MEGA disaster lets focus on just one small family. At least they don't rabbit on for half the movie before the disaster starts, we're up the creek without a paddle after about 10 mins where Florida gets wiped out by a comet fragment. Then unfortunately the movie starts to fall apart too. The only 3 important people in this whole movie get an email to go to the aiport as they are one of the 'chosen' ones. We waste a lot of time navigating the airport enterance and check in, because its heavily regulated by the army only allowing the special people to enter. They have to be vetted by numerous stringent checks to get onto airforce places that will ferry to chosen few to Greenland (hence the name of the movie) where an underground bunker system will house them, but because they're complete dropkicks they don't get ont the plane. And of course they get split up and we have to endure a thrid of the movie watching them aimlessly wander about whatever Northern American state they're in until they miraculously find each other again, oh bliss. But now that the movie is running into overtime, they must hot foot it to some remote place in Canada where surpirse, surpirse every day garden variety pilots are taking people to Greenland, who upon arriving just get hurried into the bunker without being checked to see if they are the special chosen ones.
We're supposed to like this family who delay the whole movie because of their stupidity. The kid has to have his comforter or 'blanky' and of course whilst grabbing it from the bag dislodges his medication bag which falls onto the car floor and they leave it behind whilst trying to get onto the plane. This event causes them to miss the plane, they all get split up, its the one event the defines the whole movie really. I mean, if your 7 year old kid is a diabetic with a diabetic insulin pump attached to his guts then why would you pack his medication in the KIDS bag that he carrys with him??? Its obviously his life saving drugs so wouldn't you as a good parent take it upon yourself to ensure YOU have the medication??
The movie is full of minute brushes with death that the rest of us would have perished, but no, not one of this miraculous family, they navigate through every disaster and drama pretty much unscathed. (Maybe thats why the US govt chose them as the special ones) cause nothing kills them... I mean a fragment of the comet with an explosion greater than Hiroshima hits fairly close to their plane, but their lit aluminium plane miraculously survives, just get blown to the left slightly, then it develps engine failure and as the plane navigates the moutntainess terrain we see no other effects of the massive explosion only seconds earlier... Oh & how they got onto this plane was they drove their vehicle onto the runway as the plane was taxiing for takeoff then threatened that if all 3 of them weren't allowed onto the plane they wouldn't move their vehicle... Thus the 20 odd people already on the plane would die, so you dont really feel like this is a nice man (& wife) as if they're gunna die, then they'll gladly take 20 innocents with them as well..So over all, its a typical Hollywood crap disaster movie where they as usual focus on a suppodedly 'nice' family who are really stupid but miraculously lucky. For such a major life extinsion event, it would be nice if the movie focused on more than just 3 people in a family... Why not make it about, um. gee, arrrr THE DISASTER.",Greenland

After eighteen horrible months of COVID, a Capitol riot, almost weekly mass shootings and people generally behaving at their absolute worst, I personally just have no more stomach for watching even more s****y behavior from the version of selfish America depicted
here (again). Too bad, because this was quite well done apart from the disturbing themes. Looks great visually, the cast is first rate and the direction keeps things moving nicely. But I nearly left it behind when her kid got abducted because I could tell more of the same awful stuff was coming (I could already write the ending myself anyway). Yes, I know it's just a movie. It just feels like the wrong time. I think we could all use something uplifting, not another serving of relentless victimizing of innocents by the dregs of society. Aren't we seeing enough of that in the real world right now? Besides, we've seen this movie many times already. Other than a great cast that elevates this a bit, there's really nothing new here. Ultimately, just another hero-drags-family-to-safety-against-all-odds outing, told slightly differently. I'm not sure why the people that make these kinds of movies are so intent on portraying the worst aspects of human behavior on a scale that distorts reality. It could have been a very different movie had it resisted going down the tired old path of everybody's-gone-nuts-except-us clichés of similar movies that came before. Seems like a wasted opportunity.

The parallels between this movie and the world we live in now was spot on.Humanity can be good and caring. It can be courageous and empathetic.
On the other hand, humanity can be selfish and cruel. It can also be brutal and violent.The way this movie showed the good and bad of mankind speaks volumes to the way we all really are. I like to think that the director made a point of showing us this.It was very well acted (the son especially) and the special effects, while not perfect, were enough to make you hold your breath all throughout the film.

Water still works, the drug store still had insulin, and the main characters are still taking major roads deep into into the movie. The dumb kid wouldn't get out of the car with his mom when people were trying to kidnap him. Of course we won't talk about their random luck in finding each other again.

Yes, there's a number of clichés that are the staple of all disaster films but, it's a disaster film!!!Effects are great (most of the time), there's enough tension to keep the viewer interested & the kid's not too annoying. Acting is good & lots of extras die in painful ways. Plus, after the recent locks downs for Covid, it's actually more believable that the human race will make some really stupid decisions when faced with a little bit of stress.However, if you're interested in the science behind this scenario I'd give the film a miss....

I love disaster movies and no one does them like Gerard ""Leonidas"" Butler, but this movie was just too stressful. I got flashbacks of when I had to walk to Whole Foods in March after NY was shutdown, and came home with nothing but apples I never ate and they stayed in the back of my fridge until I moved out. Wait, hold up, this movie might've just got good. BRB.Alright, we're back and I was only on Instagram half of the time. Ima throw this a 6.5/10 because it sort of displays the human spirit when we need each other most. Gerard is still the goat but the kid seriously whines way too much. Like bruh, you're 7 years old already and it's only the end of the world. Suck it up and stop crying. Man, I ate so much food last night. I'm not eating carbs until 2021. Also, you ever realize how hard it is to pair a chambray shirt with jeans? Not me. The secret is to make sure they're slightly off tone and wear it with a cashmere hoodie. You can go from the office to the rodeo to the bar. Thank me later. This movie was whatever but there has literally not been any good movies this year except Tenet. I'm gonna drop this down to a 5/10 because I was typing before the movie ended and it just finished. Anyone get a chance to grab a McRib when it was back? I missed out.

The military in the movie were very human like with real emotion and desire to help, it wasn't as ""Over the top"" as most other disaster movies.

I loved the screenwriting, how the writer keeps the viewer on the edge with lots of surprises and unexpected turns. It's much better than the usual disaster movies I've seen before this one because the film director used almost documentary visual techniques to get gritty realism in many of the scenes, he was helped too by really good actors all around. Morena Baccarin shines particularly in this movie, she should get an award for her performance in this movie, there is this particular car scene on the highway at night where she let it all rip and she's just amazing. She deserves to get really good parts in movies, she's that good. Gerard Butler carries this film too and has great scenes in it, it's much better than some of his past choices of movies. There is also a great cameo by Scott Glen, always an amazing actor. On the whole everything was good about this movie, cinematography, music, editing, special effects, etc... The only downer for me was the last bit just before the end credits roll, the idea of the screenwriter at the end was good, I just believe that the director could have done a little bit more visually with the actors (costume, hair, etc) to sell it to us. It felt a bit rushed. And that's why I give this movie 9 instead of 10!",Greenland

Greenland was a lot better than I was expecting it to be, and it ends better than it began. Although it shares much in common with many of its like; (Deep Impact, 2012, etc.), it doesn't feel as ridiculous. I felt as if it could actually happen. Really showing the affect that it has on humanity makes Greenland stand alone. There are a few contrived, unbelievable, & predictable moments that make you roll your eyes, but I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time.

The actors played their roles very well, so lets giver them a big big thumbs up for that.
Now as the movie starts we see the main character looking at Architectural plans for a building and holding himself in the position of someone who know what they are doing. So why is this important? An Architect or builder of any large building is aware of emergency exits, action plans etc. hence ""The Presidential"" message. He is familiar with politics as he has to work with local businesses and politicians to get his building built. He has the intellect to mange difficult and dangerous situations. So why does his brain become Paleolithic for the rest of the movie? We now move to the airfield where one line of soldiers is expected to hold back over 1000 people, and the boundaries of the airport are not guarded by the Military effectively. Does this really make any sense. Surely the Government aware of the situation uses all possible resources to secure the airport at DEFCON 4 level, after all they are putting the greatest minds in the world on these planes.
The scene where the wife takes her son into the drug store that is being looted, yes she's is desperate for medication but surely not suicidal and I thought she was trying to save her son's life not get him killed. The biggest flaw I saw was the lack of Urgency. Place yourself in their position, would you be walking that slow, packing that slow, looking at the stars or would you be ""packing death"" and moving as fast as you can to try and save yourself, whether you were the main characters or not.

After 30 minutes I dipped in and out of the film to find that the 3 Stooges (the family) had got themselves into yet another disaster through simple stupidity. The movie really should have been billed as a comedy, with some Benny Hill theme music to it.I forgot to mention, during my first 30 minutes, I stopped at some point to google 'Greenland gerald butler accent' - I was confused - was it Irish or southern American. Apparently it's Scottish. I am Scottish - no-one talks like that.The end scenes - showing all the broken modern wonders of the world in various states of disrepair - I did have a little chuckle at the flaccid image of the Eiffel Tower with it's top missing.

The complex dynamic of the family as they try to deal with extraordinary events is well thought out and executed.

1268,angeliclildevilsl,Only read if you've already watched it want an honest review from a disaster movie fan.,3,5 June 2021,"Some of you self proclaimed ""critics"" are full of lies. This movie wasn't half as good as other disaster films. The characters even start out being utterly selfish. After the father (Gerard Butler) gets the call saying that he has garnered a seat with his family in the planes, they refuse to take the little girl. They don't even know anything yet, but refuse to break that rule then continuously break rules throughout the rest of the movie for their son. They also act as though they matter more than other people: ""We have no room. Maybe we can fit the little boy *pause* maybe the mother also"" says the pilot. Mother replies in a whiney voice ""No! It will be all of us or none""... All bs maybe the plane wouldn't have crashed if it hadn't been over capacity AND also given the choice why wouldn't you save your son first? Js. NEXT! The military woman stated that there were 2,000 people in multiple planes and could not possibly find the father. Yet, only 2,000 people and they didn't pre screen anyone's records (medical) before allowing them to be in line for the planes AND had no screening onsite? Really? Does that even sound like the military? 😂 I have SO many of these things to point out about this movie. Case and point? They just so happened to find the EXACT airport easily (in another country) that was sending out planes for cilvilians. The mother just went ahead and told strangers that she had a bracelet AND the strangers threw her out and took the rejected child..um. Ok, these were regular people here short hours before, but to get even a shot of being allowed in a flight, they assaulted the mom and kidnapped a real reason that they would get turned away. EVEN had their plan worked HE COULDN'T GET ON and so then what?. UGH. Awful criminals. Anyhow, rant over I was just infuriated by this movie so much I had to review it. I gave it 3 stars because it exists. Someone put work into it. I just couldn't see much logic, good will, or intelligence in it.",Greenland
1269,manyginger,Oh god they put everything worth watching in the trailer,3,20 February 2021,"You can actually skip watching the movie because most of the time it's just dry dialogues written by 13 year olds and weird plots that make you roll your eyes.
Upon receiving endoftheworld messages, the characters choose not think or act with logic, instead they don't check the belongings, totally not prepared for violence scenarios, saving dying people from car and get burnt for no reason at all, wasting precious time comforting each other, and choose to watch and admire the destructive views rather than running away and seeking shelter.",Greenland

But this should not be the only demand on a movie.
After thinking about it several times, I found the film more boring and almost a bit cheeky from second to second. It seemed to me as if the screenwriters had looked at the film '2012' and thought, ""Man, we could actually shoot it again - just a little bit different"".
*** SPOILERS OF THE MOVIE '2012' AND 'GREENLAND' ***
2012: A man (divorced) learns about the imminent end of the world. He wants to save his family. They just make it away from home. From there an odyssey begins. Through his job and the info of a guy he meets by chance, he learns that there is an ark in China. There he wants to go. Shortly before the end they manage to get in illegally. The ark on which he now lives is one of a few. The film ends with the dramatic opening of the gates of the ark and that they can finally look out into the world. The end.Greenland (aka. 2020): A man (separated from his wife) learns about the imminent end of the world. Of course he wants to save his family. They make it away from home. From there their odyssey begins. Because of his important job and information from a guy he meets by chance, he learns that there is a bunker. There he wants to go with his family. Shortly before the end they manage to get in illegally. The bunker he now lives in is one of a few. The film ends with the dramatic opening of the gates of the bunker and that they can look out into the world (which is still standing). The end.
I know that the disaster movie genre cannot be reinvented in its basic features, but I am surprised how little new a film can show.Positive aspects:
one of the more 'realistic' disaster moviesSpecial effects - ok.unfortunately I can't think of any moreTotal: 3/10 stars. If you just want to watch a movie that will take your mind off Covid-19 for 2 hours and spoil it a bit with action and special effects, this is the right place.

1284,nikkipratt-97530,"Mildly entertaining, brings nothing new to the 'disaster genre's.",5,8 November 2020,"Well, this movie essentially does what it says on the packaging. It's a disaster movie.The good points are that the acting was quite believable, effects weren't overdone & the movie did build up tension very well at times.The bad points. Theres a whole storyline about the main characters troubled marriage and the man having an affair (so cliche) which adds nothing to the overall story, nor progresses the narrative & serves only as a redemption arc for the main hero. Ditto for a scene where our hero pulls a person from a burning vehicle while fire rains from the sky and sustains a nasty burn. Then we just.... don't see... the rescued person again. WHAT. WAS. THE. POINT? Again, just comes across as as a redemption act for our adulterous hero and adds nothing.Some of the choices the wider characters make seem unrealistic to me (I couldn't imagine people volunteering to mann army checkpoints while admitting that they are away from their families and humanity will be wiped out in 3 days. I'm not military so maybe I dont know what I'm talking about, but I'd imagine even the most dedicated of soldiers would want to be with their family at this time)Many of the elements of this film ie: extinction level event comet, underground shelters, mention of huge tsunamis (we dont actually see these materialize in the film) harks back to earlier disaster film deep impact, except they did it much better & with far more originalityOverall the film was mildly entertaining & worth a watch if you like the disaster genre - but save yourself some money & wait for the home release.",Greenland

We were looking for an action movie and got it, no doubt!
Why we won't rate this movie top score is because of the unlikely and romantic ending with birds in the sky, the undoubtedly survival of the human race and never ending resources of insulin.

As a person who always wants to see the next EOTW movie, I have seen all of the cliches and this one had them all. Let´s start with the yet again white, rich family (all though the woman is Brazilian) with the broken marriage and a kid with an illness, diabetes (it´s always diabetes). The diabetes fact is given to us straight away, so we both knew immediately what was going to happen with that, and it did. The kid is also smart and well behaved, which is nice but getting kinda boring. Why can´t they represent the morons? The whole cast is tall and skinny, so how about a 150 cm (4""9) person for a change?
The guy is obviously an accidental hero throughout the movie while the woman hangs around with the child and can´t seem to do anything on her own. She will also ask the man idiotic questions to which she should know the answer to, since she´s in the situations herself.
The main character guy (Butler) does stupid heroic acts multiple times during the movie, no doubt playing out the macho man fantasy of the director or screenwriter.
This is a good piece for when you want to waste a couple hours or when you need a movie for a drinking game. Either way wouldn´t pay to see it, but the damage is already done. I will give credit for the fact that the kid was a great actor and for once the world included other continents too. They even mention countries that I guess many Americans don´t have any idea about.

This is more down to earth (pardon the pun) and personal. As a result it is more gripping. Despite the nods to other films to get it on track and in other parts, it starts with an everyday but relatable tension and maintains it throughout.

Now I majored in astronomy... this one was definitely gonna end everything! When I saw it on the screen I was like.. ""ok... they are gonna die, bunker or not""... but that wasn't the point. They did everything to be together and give their son a chance! They choose to try because that's what parents do! Absolutely anything! when they were in the bunker and the clock was counting down they held eachother and had all the flashback of all their happy memories together!
I thought that was a good ending personally. Very touching and moving and also cause they made a pretty big point on the size of the comet being bigger than the one that killed the Dinos.
Then it went black... sad but touching! The movie showed everything. The ones who stayed behind and were prepared to die where they wanted to. The ones who tried and tried and even if it was no use they could know they gave their son a chance!Then they started showing cities in ruins... now if my teacher taught me right, that comet they showed up with all amazing effects, would have flattened the bloody place. And 9 months for dust to settle? It took years for the one that killed the Dinos like come on...

1333,jtallis-39315,Verizon should use this as promotional videos,5,13 June 2021,"The funniest part of the whole movie is when he makes A joke about technology not working during an emergency. The amount of plot drama that generates around a cell phone and a land line that have zero business working in the first place. Also would it be possible to see one of these movies where they don't survive?This movie actually has a really cool premise and then takes that really awesome premise and does nothing with if. Like they really wanted to write a dramatic family piece and then decided to put a meteor shower in the trailer to lure people in. The five minutes of actual destruction was really great.Also I have to mention the part where the pilot hang glides a massively over capacity plane through a canyon and then lands in such a way where only he dies. 😂. My disbelief was so suspended. Cool idea, okay acting, poor execution and definitely needed more destruction scenes and less disaster movie tropes and cliches because it has them all.Protagonist dragged in because of some ridiculous reason?

Oh no, something goes wrong when they have their chance for safety? Check
Safe haven turns out to be unsafe as something blows up? Check

First off, they supposedly didn't know the kid was a diabetic? Really? Next, the kid is kidnapped because the guy thinks with different parents the kid would have a shot at getting on a plane, including them? When he was the reason his parents couldn't get on in the first place? Sure they will let a screaming kid on the plane with the wrong parents. Then, 3 other dudes start fighting gerald for 1 bracelet. When its obvious they have no shot of getting on even with his bracelet.
The movie starts with an apocalypse but from then on all that happens is stupid little drama created by ridiculous stuff. Dumb to create all these sidetrack stories in such a manner, no sense of how a good story is told/ movie is made.

I have probably seen 90 percent or more of the disaster movies out there and this is a great addition to the genre. It is a gritty and frenetic ride from beginning to end and doesn't really allow you to breathe easy once things go south. One of my favorite things about this movie is the spontaneous moments of comet fragments crashing down around the characters thru out the movie. It sets for a real ominous tone and constant reminder of how fragile we are as a species when SHTF!",Greenland

He have done some good movies and if the role is right he Always deliver. Also liked Morena Baccarin and Scott Glenn. It was good acting for sure.Its a end of the world movie but its very credible and scary. The effects are also very good. For me its a favourite. Dont know any other movie in the same category that can beat this one. Armageddon is up there also together with this one. The soundtrack is decent but maybe the weak spot here. Cant compare it with the soundtrack in armageddon for example.If something simular would happen in reality i can se it unfold like this.,Greenland

But, I lost track 20 minutes into the movie. And once things got into action, I thanked the lord for opting to not continue my count as I am not sure I could have kept track or managed to count beyond, probably, 1000.This imitation of '2012' in every corner of the movie, be it except for the root cause of the disaster, is alarming.Tiz waz the same '2012', with the same kiddo, and that airplane flown by Sacha (actually, there was no Sacha in 'Greenland'). And that same airplane mountain belly scratch before crash landing. Darn them, mountinz. Darn, them mountinz.I could go on and on counting and detailing errors.

Soldiers and police are still protecting. Firefighters are still putting out fires -the day before the end of the world. Reporters are still reporting even right up to the end. Water and electricity are still on. In a weird way, it's an optimistic view of the end of the world. As Mr. Rogers said, in a disaster there will always be good people doing good things.

As we all can guess when most of the population is wiped from the earth we dont need farmers, fishermen etc to feed what remains of the population, we need skyscrapers. Go Gerard!
The film emphasizes the intolerance to the non-perfect of the world. The minute by minute sequences of action is highlighted elsewhere, but why? is a fair summary. I'm not sure who's worse: the screen writer or the producer who accepted it. Come on Holywood - think about what you do",Greenland

Not wanting to 'spoil' 🙄 this for others, I'll restrain from mentioning storyline specifics ...After a long long hours viewing, I was thrilled to remember I hadn't finished my grocery shopping order! And the excitement grew when I found there were several bogof specials in the veggie department. Yay! 🤗Back to the film zzzz ... my biggest issue with this movie (and so many others) - the continuous choir of angels singing so loud we couldn't hear what limited script there was. What the hell is happening to modern films with their deafening scores and general background assault to our eardrums. We gave up eventually, turned the sound way down and waited for the ending. We could still follow the story ... speaks volumes (😏) So pleased this was free on Prime.

1385,jasonbignell,Makes you think,8,9 February 2021,"This kind of movie is not for people to start picking on all the little details that may be inaccurate. Every film has some kind of weird thing that makes it inaccurate or disliked by someone. However, what it does do is bring you to the emotion and anxiety that people feel in these situations. Yes people make mistakes, and yes some where along the line the science might not match up. It's a movie, of course it's not going to be real. What I like about it is it represents the common struggles and challenges that people would face in these scenarios. I was feeling for the family, I wanted them to make it, I wanted to see what would become of the different families. It takes you to the very real nature of how some ordinary family in some ordinary town would have to face - the not knowing what the next day would bring. I also really liked the way we discover aspects of the events just as the family does. They don't have to clarify anything, they don't have unnecessary conversations. I was connected with the story from beginning to end. I can't say that many movies do that.
Of course there are areas I would prefer to be different, or an aspect I would want to see more of. But ultimately, I saw everything I needed to see. I loved the music - always an important aspect of any movie for me. I thought the acting got better as the movie went on. The mundane life at the beginning wasn't the very best I have seen from these actors, but they soon got into it and I was very impressed from the beginning of the main events. Overall, they should be happy with this film no matter what the negative critics say. Considering everything going on right now, it took me out of self pity and into ""it could be a lot worse!"" Which, let's face it, we need to do every now and again. A great movie and well worth my time. A huge thank you!",Greenland

The film creates tension through the events that happen to the characters along their journey but everything is fairly predictable. Would have been nice to see some creativity in the writing, as nothing here feels clever or inventive.If you like The Walking Dead (which is basically EastEnders with zombies imo) then you'll probably think this is pretty good.If you don't, then maybe give this film a miss.",Greenland

The answer is yes, it is the worst writing. The dialogue is so heavy-handed, so contrived, so unbelievable, so unrealistic. Seriously, it seemed like a middle-schooler in a creative writing class wrote this script. I get that disaster movies aren't known for their nuanced scripts, and that ok usually. They made the movie 30 minutes too long, which just gave way too much time for these contrived 'trying to pull at your heartstrings' moments. I gave it 2 stars.

They shouldn't of been selected if that were that dumb.Real movie - dam comet coming, hmm presidential alert, omg I bet the comet is really going to hit us, hmm other people not selected, this could cause problems, call wife cancel party, make up a lie like oh your dad's in the hospital etc, go home get stuff packed straight away.

It had the potential to be so much better.

Major one for me being why they selected people to live to then refuse them if sick (surely they would check that first)?!As for the ending..... Disappointed",Greenland

When ever a movie based on Apocalyptic or an End times philosophy appears; I'm always drawn into it similar to ants which are drawn towards sugary sweets. I know it's a terrible analogy but you can see where I'm getting at. I saw this movie by mere coincidence. I was with my wife at my home at night trying to watch something after a rough day....so I was scrolling through some movies in my movie app and found this. And boy was it a shocker!!! Amazing......splendid.....superb!!! This movie is better than I expected in every way. Better even than some of the EndTime blockbusters out there. I would even go as far to say that this movie(in my opinion) is the epitome of how End times genre should be like; simple; yet both captivating and dramatic. A truly exceptional movie. 10/10.👍👍👍,Greenland

Normally a disaster movie is just a weak storyline with a premis to showing a giant tidalwave wiping out skyscrapers. This one forgoes most of the special effects. (which is what I think the negative reviewers are upset about) the focus is instead more about the drama of a family, dealing with this impending doom and the confusion and tragedy of it.

1422,trckusbiz,Nothing happens in this movie,3,25 April 2021,"So Greenland was kinda dissapointing. Looking at the trailers I thought there would be some actual action and substance to the film but what I got instead was 2 hours of people running around doing dumb things. This film tries to make itself different from other disaster movies by focusing on the characters more than the disasters but that doesn't work when your characters themselves are dumb and unlikeable.A lot of the movie contains things that are just completely pointless for example the opening scene which gives us little to zero character exposition and just feels pointless (his job is never brought up again). Speaking of exposition, a lot of the characters and scenes in this movie feel unnatural and that they are only there to move the story along. A good example of this is the scene John (Gerald Butler) meets Colin (King Bach) in a truck. All the character Colin does is; instantly befriend John, tell him where all the people are going to escape and then he dies. A lot of the movie is like this, just small moments with characters that do nothing but service the plot and then disappear. All these things just make it seem like the plot of the movie has no real tension.Overall I would say it's watchable but not very enjoyable unless you are laughing at it with friends. There are definitely more enjoyable disaster movies to watch (which I'm not saying are masterpieces but are more fun) such as any disaster movie ever. Basically save yourself 2 hours and don't watch this btec 2012 clone.",Greenland

1426,petersaree,Bleak view of human nature in the face of certain death.,5,9 May 2021,"The problem with this movie is that it predicts people will sell their souls and become machines in order to preserve the human species, minus the compassion that makes us all human. Living zombies before a cataclysmic event. Eventually, our real life sun will become an exploding star taking us with it. Even if you ignore the idea of religion, a belief in God and the afterlife, why would anyone want to stay alive in the shadows of a dead planet? We should all die so quickly as the dinosaurs once did. This would be a lucky and merciful way to depart the earth.This movie is cruel. Most of us act quite differently in the midst of a deadly COVID pandemic. Screw existence within an underground shelter. Not a fulfilling and healthy lifestyle at all. The point of living is to live among and interact with the amazing diversity of life on earth.If I were in this situation, I would ignore having been one of the chosen few and want to die with the rest of my people. This movie shows people becoming animals and the survival of the fittest. A blaze of glory ending is much preferred. Living joyfully in my last hours would be the focus. Maybe a better species in some other place would improve upon existence.Terrible. Shame on all involved with this movie. Finally, some humanity toward the end of the movie. Too little, too late.

Blazing saddles took off the western genre, Airplane! Did for air disaster movies, Top Secret and Hot Shots for war films, Naked gun for Cop movies etc etc. Well, imagine someone tried it for a disaster movie only a hungover intern shredded their gag sheet and none of the jokes, except for genre clichés, were left in? This is what Greenland is like. That said, this may not be an entirely bad thing as much of the 70s/80s humour didn't age well at all.So this is a Toyota Corolla of a movie. If you want something to watch for a couple of hours to while away a rainy afternoon, then this is ""absolutely fine"". A lot of it has been done so many times before you'll be watching it thinking ""is this a remake.. or have I seen it before, maybe?"" because there's nothing new or interesting here.You'll enjoy it more if you're a fan of the disaster movie genre and like to watch them often, but if not there's no particular reason to watch it or to not do so. Because it's ""absolutely fine"".I feel a bit churlish giving it only 4 our of 10 as it IS well executed. But the point of a movie is to entertain watching this is like driving a hire car from the airport to the office. It gets the job done fine and a Toyota Corolla is a fine thing to be.

The plot is extremely simple and linear: brief intro into the characters, a comet will impact earth, let's run for our life to Greenland.. sort of a promise land. This would not be a problem if the action part would be good, but it is not. Action scenes are predictable, you kind of don't understand why the characters would make some decisions other that to get themselves into problems. The characters are not developed at all, partly because of the script, and partly because of Gerard Butler trying to be a normal person and not an ex Navy Seal saving the world. Last, this is supposed to be an catastrophe movie that should build momentum as the comet approaches. This never happens (as opposed to 1998 Deep Impact), it kind of takes of but shortly falls into the flat line of boredom.

Most of these movies focus on the rollercoaster of action (also present in this movie offcourse), but this one has a slightly different approach:What will you do (as a family), when catastrophic disaster will struck and how far will you go?
Of course many movies before use this aspect but:One of the reviews posted before described it, I quote: ""Felt like the way they handled this was more realistic, so in a way 'scarier'.
We (wife and I) can totally agree with this.Ok, the storyline was sometimes not so realistic: : Greenland is 1/4 of the landsize of Australia, so the plane landed within a mile of the bunker?
Come on be real.
Being save within 10 seconds before total destruction: is not necessary, but ok we will except it.Being a parent for some years, the moment the familty (due to poor discions) is ripped apart and especiallty the moment your child is ripped away from your side, was truely pictured perfectly and a incredibly scary part of the movie.In some strange way, this movie grips you by the heart, it is the atmosphere created, not the action or the fact earth is being destroyed again (for so many times before).Keep in mind: how far will you go, when you know death is not so far away, will you surrender, freeze or fight?We found this movie totally not pleasant to watch, but it was good.

1493,themolemenprophecies,One of the dullest end of the world flicks ever!,2,22 January 2021,"Greenland is a movie which manages to make the act of constantly pelting the surface of the planet with space debris extremely boring. The plot is that Gerard Butler is racing to get his family to a safe space in a bunker in Greenland before the big one hits and scours life from the planet. In the meantime, they have to dodge smaller falling bits that 'only' wipe out cities here and there.First, let me get this out of the way: the destruction scenes are craaaaaap. There's one shot of Miami (or was it Tampa? Some city in Florida, anyway) getting obliterated, and after that we just get cursory shots of impacts creating mushroom clouds off in the distance, with two exceptions. The first is a sequence along a highway, where a bunch of miniature comet chunks begin pelting down and seemingly magically targeting every car except for Gerard Butler's. The second is the main comet impact...which we see for about two seconds from the perspective of some military satellite. The people who made this movie apparently decided that viewers would be content hearing about the destruction occurring second-hand, through TV and radio clips sprinkled throughout the film. I felt distinctly like Ian Malcolm in Jurassic Park, wondering aloud if there were ever going to be dinosaurs in the dinosaur theme park. We did get an ending montage of cities that were destroyed by the planet-wide firestorm at the end...long after the firestorm had burned out. Why not show the cities being engulfed by flames? And only two of the cities were recognizable -- Sydney, Australia, and Paris, France. Pro tip: If you're going to show a city's devastated ruins, put in some recognizable landmarks. Although, if you're going to plunk a 9 mile wide comet down in northern Europe and then subsequently show the Eiffel Tower still half-standing (instead of, you know, having the entire city of Paris be a flat plane of molten rock), then asking for a little attention to detail is probably a bridge too far.The inter-family drama is also a real trainwreck. Prior to the events of the movie, Gerard Butler was estranged from his wife when, during a period of marital turmoil, he decided to have an affair. Good job, moron! During the typical ""The world is going to end in about five seconds, so let's reconcile our differences"" scene, the wife then says SHE'S PARTLY TO BLAME. Uh, WHAT? Lady, unless you held a gun to your husband's head and told him to sleep with another woman, you hold zero responsibility for that! Bad filmmakers! BAD!At one point, the wife and son get separated from Gerard Butler, and they borrow a ride from someone who'll take them to her father's house. The man driving the car realizes that she and her son have the Magic Wristbands that will grant you entry into the bunkers, so he steals the wife's, but keeps the son in a very creepy, misguided gesture of goodwill. The second they reach a military base, though, the son (making the only smart decision of any character in this picture) immediately rats them out, causing the military to drag away the two creeps and eventually reunite the son with his mother.The family reunites at the wife's father's farm, where the old guy naturally says that he intends to stay and die, blah blah blah this scene is in every other disaster movie already.There's also a scene early on where the parents lose track of their son's insulin supplies, which is a serious, serious no-no. Don't leave the insulin in your kid's bag! Keep it on you at all times!That leads into another point I want to bring up: the U.S. government's actions in the film. At the beginning, the government sends out targeted alerts to pre-selected US citizens (either for special skills they possess or purely via lottery -- I think it's speculated upon by the characters, but never actually stated). They do this just a short amount of time before debris begins pounding new holes into the Earth, which is a painfully stupid move. If you know that there's a comet incoming that will pound the planet's surface into dust, wouldn't you carry out your evacuation plans well before a measly two days before impact? Instead, they conduct the evacuations of the chosen right as most of Florida gets obliterated, causing the public to rightfully panic and flood the military's evacuation points.Oh, going back to the alerts: I found it a little weird and creepy that the government in the movie was able to send a specific message directly to Gerard Butler's TV naming him and his family as evacuees. But it was the good kind of weird and creepy, since this is just a movie. Too bad it didn't get put into a better movie.When the family reaches the military base and realizes they left their son's insulin behind, Gerard Butler goes back for it, while his wife brings the matter up with one of the military dudes. She gets taken to the person in charge, and -- surprise, surprise -- the government has apparently gone Full Nazi and decided anyone with a disability gets to just sit on the tarmac and wave at the planes as they leave for safety. (Depressingly, I could easily see this happening in a real-life situation). The unwashed masses that Uncle Sam passed over eventually breach the base, and the military naturally starts gunning them down, culminating in a firefight that wastes two or three planeloads of people as a fuel truck takes a bullet. Hilarious!The family soon discovers the location of the bunkers, in Greenland, and that they were originally built to house people after a nuclear war. Which, to be frank, is dumb, and wildly impractical. Greenland is already home to one real-life military installation, the purpose of which is to track incoming ICBMs during a nuclear exchange. That base would probably be converted to glass within half an hour of the commencing of hostilities, so if there were another US military installation in Greenland, one that was not camouflaged from the air (as the bunker complex in the movie wasn't), then that base would also be flattened in the opening salvo. During the Cold War, civil defense shelters were prevalent throughout many American cities, and even today the best policy would be to shelter in place at your home, rather than go out (and get exposed to radioactive fallout), get on an airplane, and head to freakin' Greenland of all places. So yeah, in real life there is zero reason whatsoever to build a large-scale fallout shelter that's not even within the continental United States.The last thing I'd like to bring up is something that others have already touched on: a nine mile wide comet slamming into the Earth doesn't mean you can just throw open the doors eight months later and see freakin' BIRDS. All life on the surface is going to be D-E-A-D DEAD. And it'll be a good few years before you can even think of opening those blast doors. Hope they brought a lot of seeds to regrow all plant life.I gave this film a 2/10 because it did have slight entertainment value -- but said value came solely from my girlfriend and I constantly roasting it. If you're really hard up for a 'comet hits Earth' movie, just go back and watch Deep Impact. It did everything this movie does, but they did it over 20 years ago, and they did it a lot better.",Greenland

The sub plot of the couple's marriage issues is half baked at best.
There is zero character development.
The sudden development that basically anyone with a plane can get into the bunker was baffling.
The biggest oops for me is that at the beginning the kid is rejected because of his condition, meaning that the authorities have no plans to accomodate diabetics etc, however the kid somehow manages to survive nine months just fine presumably because the authorities had a change of heart down there and whipped up some insulin?It was very entertaining though.",Greenland

And when they are driving to Canada to catch the last plane and run into molten lava storm, all the vehicles around them are bombarded and catch on fire but when the storm is over, the film shows them riding away in a clean, pristine truck.

Having watched it in home cinema it was closest experience I could get to watching it in regular cinema.
Enjoyed Greenland greatly. Kept me on my toes. The theme is one of my favorites - extinction level event and it truely shows extinction of our planet.
While watching it I thought ""oh man... I hope that in couple of years we wont be looking at this movie like we look at Contagion today"" - meaning that movie script foresaw how certain kind of event would play out in real life.That being said, there were some situations in the movie that have shown main characters taking some seriously bad decisions.
It did hurt to see it but all the action quickly healed the wounds.Visuals and audio are very good.For me overall its 9/10 - I will watch it again for sure.Please support this production by watching it on demand to show that studios can release movies during pandemic and earn money.",Greenland

I found myself genuinely caring for these characters throughout the film, which I'll be honest, rarely happens in this genre.I had to pause for a snack break 20 minutes in and I already found myself invested (I rushed back to continue the suspense). The film is extremely fast paced (which I liked) and I found myself thinking of various scenarios of what I would do in their position. Some of the characters' decisions were more realistic than others but on the whole I could picture myself in their shoes - however I was extremely glad to be sat on the sofa spectating!Don't get me wrong, this is not going to go down as a classic but what it did do very well, was to keep me hooked for the whole two hours.

Oh yes, and at the end of the movie, they showing apocalypse and after world, once meteors hit the earth for like another 10 seconds. Cheap soap opera drama that follow family going from one scene to another, kid getting stolen from mum, losing hes insulin medicine, leaving airplane just before take off, phone not working, couple losing each other in crowd, etc, you get idea. Its one big happy ending at the end when they magically meets somehow, and survive. I gave it 4 stars cause of nice shooting, its obvious they put some money into this so not everything is terrible.

It's not exactly a ""good movie"" but sometimes you just want to see a movie like this. It has a pretty interesting plot, but the movie feels very long. The acting is pretty good, many aspects seem believable and realistic while other smaller parts are nonsensical just done just for the sake of extending the movie or adding an action to the scene. This movie has so many weird twists and turns but it's alright. I can understand why some people might not enjoy it so much since it is a drama, a lot of talking and slow scenes and predictable plot but some people enjoy that.

Very poor. Perhaps if they had flipped the script so that it actually focused on the comet, its traectory, how and why it split up, speed, size with good CGI and less focus on the drama of the characters it might have been a film to remember.

1590,gravityfalls-28195,Cliché City,1,21 May 2021,"Let me tell you. I got back on my IMDb account for the first time in a while to write this review. I was on here last about three years ago. This movie is so laughably bad that I got back on my account for the first time in three years to write a review for it. Prepare for an extremely long rant.This movie is quite literally cliché after cliché after cliché. Oh gosh! We've been chosen to taken shelter and only us for some reason! Our family gets so mad at us and there's screaming and wailing and so much stuff and... Why does this all get announced on their TV in their house? How does that work? Not only that, but it just so happens that mom doesn't get the message on her phone because she's busy, so only husband gets it. Wow!Now, back on track. Let's pack and go drive to the airport. Oh no! The highway is packed because of the panic from that small bit of comet/asteroid/Clarke or whatever falling. Let's go drive another way, I'm smart and it's easy to fix my issues, and backing up the car like this isn't dangerous at all. Oh gosh! We got to the airport place, but my son is diabetic and I somehow forgot his insulin, one of the most important things we need to carry around for him, and we just casually left it in the car in his backpack.Don't worry, honey, I can run all the way back through security, through the crowd, to the crowded cars, to our car to find the insulin, then back through the crowded cars, back through the crowd, and security to see you again, all within about fifteen minutes! Easy!Oh no! While my husband was gone, I found out that my son can't go on because he has diabetes, even though he was specifically included in the message for who could come to the super secret classified shelters, not to mention it's a surprise they didn't find his inslin pump before, especially when they were using the metal detectors. I beg the miltary lady and get nothing, oh man, what a shame for me. Then, uh oh, me and husband get split up! Oh man, our phones for some reason just won't send messages, I guess we have no service for some reason, awww, shoot!Maybe it's because of that small piece of comet/asteroid/Clarke that hit preventing us from getting service? Well, the movie never tells us, so I'll just assume! Oh gosh! We're still split up and so now we're gonna go to our dad's house which is super super far away but whatever we left a note for my husband. Now, allow me to skip some details and parts of the movie here, because if I listed every problem, I'd get pissed. Oh, no, drugstore shooting! Haven't seen that one before, definitely not, for sure.We got picked up by nice nice people who give my son a sandwich which is.in their car for some reason, but uh oh, they don't see to like people who got to go to the super secret classigied shelter. Hmm, now I wonder if that's foreshadowing anything. Stupid mother and son tell them that they're apart of those people, despite the red flags. At this point I knew this old couple was gonna do something bad. My guess? Taking their bracelets. Then we're back to the husband, and I was zoning out at this part, honestly, but I caught some stuff about Canada and whatever, which I immediately assumed that meant it was info that was gonna show up later in the movie.Husband and mom (though I guess they're maybe divorced? I'm so uninvested in this movie I dunno but they don't like each other, I think because husband cheated? No idea here.) both are getting driven to the same place or roughly so somehow, and both their free rides go wrong. Just as I predicted, the couple, or at least only the guy since the girl cries for him to stop but doesn't actually do anything and later on seems just fine with it steals mom and son's bracelets. Except not really. For some stupid, stupid, reason, instead of taking their bracelets, they take one bracelet... and the boy. Why?I admit that even taking their bracelets was stupid because they're likely personal, but why take the boy? There was actually no reason, especially after you got told the boy was declined for being diabetic. Did I miss something? Was there a smart reason for them to only take the boy? Now you're missing a bracelet because it's on the boy instead of your girlfriend/wife. And the couple thinks they can convince the miltary and stuff that this is their son and all. Also, the mom doesn't at all try to get her son away from the couple. She doesn't even unbuckle him so he can run or do much of anything.She just panics and whines and wails like an entitled mother. Nice job, your son's been kidnapped now. Not only that, but all the cars refuse to pick you up now for some reason, and leave you crying and screaming on the road... Actually, maybe it's because you're crying and screaming, nevermind. Here's my next guess: Oh, the couple's gonna get detained, they put the boy in the camp somewhere, the mother's gonna get to the camp somehow, and they'll reunite. Guess what happens?They get there, and they tell the boy ""Now pretend we're your parents"", like... Of course, the boy you just forcefully kidnapped and took away from his mother during the midst of this stressful world-ending event is gonna pretend all good, perfect, and nice. They get up there and go and pretend and the guy is like ""My bracelet was stolen! Please let me in, this is my son and my wife!"" and they're about to let them in. How incompetent is the miltary in this movie, by the way? Some planes packed full of people got blown up earlier too, right? Can't the miltary do their jobs?Anyways, the only reason they don't get let in is because the boy says these people aren't his parents. And you know what the couple does? They... say stuff like ""Oh, he's just scared."". Why? Why do kidnappers do this, do they think it'll actually work? If a kid approached me, *crying* and saying these people aren't his parents, of course I would believe him! No way am I gonna believe someone saying ""He's just scared."" or ""He's confused."". What?!They get taken away and the boy's put somewhere in the camp, of course. The mom shows up later hysterical and freaking out and then they look around and I managed to actually count down to when she would find her son again because of the music ramping up. Everything is so predictable. Oh, you're probably wondering about the husband now, right? Well he gets into a fight or whatever.I forgot the reason why he did, genuinely, but I think it's because some guy was mad about his bracelet or America or something, which I figured would happen too, because we always need some drama about the bracelets. Anyways, the husband actually commits murder here, I guess in self defense but it was murder still. No one really comments on this. He doesn't even seem to have too much guilt for it. In the scene he seems guilty but this guilt is never later on addressed in the movie, I'm pretty sure. So he just kinda murders and then we forget about it.Around here my memory really starts to blur, because I was losing interest, and I already didn't want to watch this movie the first ten minutes in. But somehow, mom and son get another ride... maybe? Or maybe they walk? I don't know. There's some stuff, husband has a breakdown, looks at some TV, sees that there's a 24 hour countdown to the big big comet/asteroid/Clarke whatever hitting and he gets very sad over it. How lucky that he turned the TV on during then to learn he has *exactly* 24 hours left.Have I mentioned husband and mom still haven't found each other? Husband steals a car to go to his father in law's place, meets him there, they talk a bit, and then later on they find out mom and son just so happen to be at a store very close by! They can drive there! So they do. They drive there and pick up mom and son and there's the happy cute reunion or whatever. There's some cuteness so I thought finally there'd be some downtime in this movie, but nope, I was wrong! There is quite literally no downtime in this movie at all.Now, there's an entire chunk of the movie gone from my memory. All I remember is that they remember that Canada/Greenland thing from earlier, which, of course, I unfortunately predicted again. There's some drama, more driving, did I tell you about how much driving this movie has? They eventually stop a plane on the runway with their car, genius idea. They lie a little and somehow get the pilot to let them on. Last minute this, last minute that. I swear, everything in this movie is last minute.They go and stuff and I don't remember anything from this point until the end where they step out of their shelter and the landscape is super messed up but, oh my gosh! There are birds! That means hope for us! Yaaaay! The end.I would not make my worst enemy watch this movie. There were so many points where I wanted to beg my father to turn it off. In fact, I did beg my father to turn it off multiple times, but he didn't entertain my pleas. This movie, to me, was like scraping nails against a chalkboard. This movie was so bad that I've already forgotten the names of mom, husband, *and* son, despite watching it really recently.And why does the boy being diabetic only show up like three or four times, usually as a plot point to get another cliché moving along?! I remember them mentioning he can't have pancakes (really?) because of his diabetes, and that's about the only normal time they bring up his diabetes in a way that doesn't involve plot.Not only that, but if it isn't obvious, they don't even seem like a family in my brain. This is why husband is 'husband' and not 'dad', and why mom is 'mom' and not 'wife'. We barely even get to see them bonding or having genuine quality time because most of the movie is husband and mom trying to find each other!If you liked this movie? Cool! I have no problem with that. You can find it enjoyable! But for me? For me?My rating on this movie is: Please. Never make me watch this ever again.",Greenland

I am massive fan of the apocalyptic/sci-fi genre, it's my go to.This ticked all the boxes for me, deep impact, 2020, Armageddon, it follows the usual disaster movie route, but it was riveting from start to finish!The way in which the movie rolls out is fantastic, yes it can be far fetched at times, but the movie genre in general needs this to happen for there to be a film!Some of the scenes, camera angles used and overall intensity made it for me, you truly never know what's around the corner throughout (although you'd think it's predictable) curve balls are always welcomed, and they are provided in abundance.There were many moments of epic CGI visuals to admire (which is always a plus) have the volume turned up LOUD! For the atmosphere created is brilliant in certain scenes.The movie drags you in emotionally which I enjoyed, maybe I'm a soft touch but it nearly had me going!The only reason it's not a 10 for me is because I wish it went on for longer!Overall I'd thoroughly recommend this movie, and I for one will probably watch it again soon.
Love G.Butler, great actor and for me it's close to trumping one of my favourite movies, chasing Mavericks.",Greenland
1593,awholeflaffer,MEH,3,4 January 2021,"If not for the SFX I would rate this movie a 1. The dialogue is downright terrible, Butler's acting in this film is wooden and Scott Glenn is there for the paycheck. I'm sure it will do well as a in-flight movie.",Greenland
1594,again_fai,Good movie,10,11 October 2020,That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in 2020. Seriously! I think the movie should be 7.0 at least.,Greenland
1595,fatimamalahan-54060,Greed,2,17 November 2020,This movie had decent acting. What I fail to understand is why was it important for the father to not give up his band. I mean they were refused in already so what was the issue to just give the people.,Greenland
1596,dmjhfc,Dreadful,3,16 February 2021,"2 hours of poor acting with contrived storyline that drifted aimlessly throughout. No warmth / chemistry between the characters, stilted dialogue...I could go on.",Greenland
1597,sarahandmason,Fantastic,10,18 November 2020,Really makes you think about life and what you would do if this was to happen gives all kind of emotions off about the world definitely worth a watch i shed a fair few tears watching this,Greenland
1598,harshbhalala,Like this happen in real bcz its 2020😁😁,8,21 December 2020,If they added more effects then it would be perfact,Greenland
1599,isaab-99396,Predictable,3,19 February 2021,"Cringey, predictable and quite frankly awful movie. Steven Gerrard could of played the role better than Mr butler. Shame on you, ps Liverpool title defense has been embarrassing",Greenland
1600,almosantolik,Family Vacation Gone Bad,1,1 January 2021,"The scene from ""Greenland"" is actually Iceland, why would you show us one the most famous waterfalls from that region? Its like showing us the colosseum, saying this is Berlin. The airplane they use to get there is fully loaded with passengers, it would never get you to Greenland, it's simply not adequate to cover this kind of distance. Why would ""Greenland"" host thousands of Americans in their bunkers? If this is an extinction level event why is everyone running around like idiots? Why is the media broadcasting this event all the through the movie like narrators? Why would you start packing clothes in likely end-of-the-world-scenario, but adequately forget to pack your kids meds for a few hour trip on your way to the bunkers? The characters or should l say, the parents are plain out idiots and ignorant, the plot doesn't make any sense, the cgi effects are actually worse the your category ""b"" movie. This whole thing is so bad, you actually wish the main characters perish half way through the movie.",Greenland
1601,weskahle,Mercy is having the comet hit you 20 minutes in,3,28 December 2020,"So, where did we go wrong, was it:
1. We couldn't afford a decent special affects?
2. We decided to let Gerard Butler try his hand at Producing? (he's in the credits)
3. Was it that the scriptwriters ran out of steam after Tampa and Disney World were trashed?I don't know, but I found myself fast forwarding through the enumerable travel sequences (like I said, no budget for special effects), the fawning over the kid with diabetes (a personal tragedy to be sure,,,,but heh, when compared to the 400k folks in Tampa who were incinerated...meh), and reconnecting with dear old Dad (although it was good to see Scott Glen can still run at age 81). Then there was the stupidity of a 9 mile wide comet hitting ""Western Europe"" and images show that the Eiffel Tower in Paris was only knocked over....funny, 2 minutes earlier in the movie Paris and all of Western Europe was being ejected into space.Like Mulan, save your $20 and wait for this to come out for free in 2 months.",Greenland
1602,hoangpal,I am 68years and this is the worst movie i have EVER seen in my life,1,13 November 2020,"I give this a minus 400 out of 10 it is like watching a slow moving train wreck, you watch just hoping it may improve but no it sinks to the next lower level and keeps going until rock bottom",Greenland
1603,airinwongso,Awesome movie!,10,25 December 2020,"You'll need this in quarantine, it's making you feel like you are in that moment with them",Greenland
1604,eliajhelmore,2012?,4,29 October 2020,I would say they used a lot of similar story to 2012 except ALOT less disaster and ALOT more drama. The Acting was amazing! But the storyline Had parts that dragged on forever.If there wasn't an occasional loud noise from a disaster I would have fallen asleep in the empty theater.Worth a one time watch but not worth the movie ticket price.,Greenland
1605,dexterm-65462,Better than expected,8,15 November 2020,It had the expected story line of a end of the world movie but it's more realistic and I found it to have more suspense. Acting was perfect. CGI not so good.,Greenland
1606,basemsassi,Great and full of excitement,10,25 December 2020,"I really liked the movie, it is full of thrilling and excitement",Greenland
1607,n-20049-07926,"Typical apocalypse movie, but more annoying.",4,18 February 2021,"I really tried to get into this movie, but there is so much standing around and doing pointless stuff when they're supposed to be in a rush, people making stupid decisions (like the husband leaving his wife and kid to go back to the vehicle, the wife and kid leaving instead of waiting for her husband to return, husband not texting his wife when he has cell service but tries to call instead for whatever reason and then the call cuts off and he still doesnt text her back, husband refuses to give up his useless wrist band and useless driver's license to some guy threatening him with a hammer, etc etc etc)If you find stuff like that annoying then don't waste your time with it because it's literally non-stop.",Greenland
1608,k_faizanahmed,It was an great experience,10,21 December 2020,Movie starts it was like nothing is going to happen what were the movie like when you go in the middle it's so intense and it's so incredible you love it if you like geostorm.,Greenland
