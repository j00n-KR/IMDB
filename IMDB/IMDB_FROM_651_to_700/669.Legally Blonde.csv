0,MartinHafer,Not particularly deep or convincing...and that's something I can live with sometimes.,7,6 September 2009,"Elle is the ultimate stereotypical ditsy blonde. She is about to graduate college and has spent the last four years being very happy--and caring less about her future. She's the president of her sorority, homecoming queen and has a great fashion sense. Her plans after graduation are to marry her college sweetheart...period. However, when the boyfriend announces that he's going to Harvard law school and gives her the brushoff, at a spur of the moment she decides she's going to Harvard law as well! While no one would think she had a brain, it turns out Elle is at the top of her class and scores a nearly perfect LSAT--and she, too, is admitted to this prestigious institution. There, however, she's like a fish out of water--and everyone laughs at the audacious and seemingly out to lunch blonde. Will Elle fail or rise to the top? No big surprises here, but it sure is a nice ride.LEGALLY BLONDE is a movie that has no pretense. It knows it's not great art and won't be winning Oscars, yet it also is clever enough to avoid stereotypes or at least defy them. It also knows darn well that the plot is utterly ridiculous but runs with it. However, this isn't so bad, as sometimes you just need to turn off your brain and enjoy a film for what it is--entertainment. I know I am a super-critical person (hence, my 7100+ reviews on IMDb so far), but occasionally it's nice to see a film that isn't an independent film, art film, foreign film or silent--all types of films I usually watch. Sometimes you just need some brain candy! Excellent acting, a nice light directorial touch and good writing make this a standout film--and a lot better than you'd probably imagine.",Legally Blonde
1,TheLittleSongbird,Surprising,8,21 June 2010,"As several reviewers have said already, I wasn't expecting too much when I saw Legally Blonde, but it was for me surprisingly good. The plot may be a little predictable and heavy-handed, but everything else was nicely handled.The film does move quite quickly, the script is nice and fluffy like a soufflé, the soundtrack is authentic, the pacing is efficient as is the direction, and the scenery and costumes are lovely. And I enjoyed the acting, Reese Witherspoon is really beautiful and charming, not to mention funny, in the title role, while the supporting cast especially Victor Garber and Selma Blair is very nice.Overall, this was a surprising film in a good way too. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Legally Blonde
2,bkoganbing,Reese Goes To Hah-Vard,8,14 July 2008,"Legally Blonde finds Reese Witherspoon in one of her breakthrough roles as sorority queen Elle Woods who is dumped by her preppy boyfriend Matthew Davis. He's moving on to Harvard Law School where he will get his law degree, marry a woman of good background in Selma Blair and claim the family legacy of public office. So there's no time for his homecoming queen Reese although I'm sure he'd arrange something on the side later.She's totally floored by this, but our intrepid girl vows to fight fire with fire. If he can go be a Hah-Vard Law School Graduate so can she. I mean she's got a 4.0 GPA even if it is in fashion design.But beneath her Barbie Doll personality, she actually does have a brain. She aces the law boards and sends a unique video essay that is something different for the admission committee to ponder. She gets to Harvard to be with Davis, who's unfortunately there with Blair.At this point the charm of Reese Witherspoon really takes over and dominates the film. I'm not sure anyone else could have pulled off the part of Elle Woods. With that wonderful combination of charm and guilelessness, Reese Witherspoon has created an endearing character, one she's already done a sequel film with.She's nicely aided by Luke Wilson as an attorney and crony of one of her law professors. Another performance that I liked was that of Holland Taylor as a feminist law professor who's initially put off by Witherspoon, but gradually comes to appreciate her worth. In fact in the end just about everyone in the film comes to appreciate her worth, some to their regret.I don't know about you, but I'd like to see a Legally Blonde 3.",Legally Blonde
3,Leofwine_draca,Not bad at all,6,16 August 2021,Not bad at all from what it is. I'm not the target market so if you're a fan of Hollywood comedy you'll probably want to rate it higher. It starts out as another offputting 'airhead' type comedy but then offers a different perspective on the legal system and as such it remains fresh and funny throughout. Witherspoon in particular works hard in this one and her commitment pays off.,Legally Blonde
4,SnoopyStyle,Get rid of the Bend-and-Snap,6,16 December 2013,"Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) is the president of her sorority, and the girlfriend to Warner. But he dumps her just as he's about to go to Harvard Law School. She's not the type that he wants to marry if he wants to run for office. She decides to rally by getting into Harvard, and getting back with Warner. Only he has a new girlfriend Vivian (Selma Blair).This is a fine underdog story. Reese Witherspoon is super sweet, and that why her character works. It would be easy to go too silly, but she needs to be smarter than that. That's why I have a big problem with the Bend-and-Snap. It is TOO silly. It diminishes her, and it diminishes the movie. It's the one big misstep in this movie. There's no way B&S is funny. Otherwise, this is very cute fun movie.",Legally Blonde
5,Prismark10,Judgment due,6,5 February 2014,"Legally Blonde has Reese Witherspoon playing Elle a vacuous blonde who anticipates a marriage proposal from her boyfriend Warner Huntington III but instead gets dumped.Warner plans to study law at Harvard and in a stalkerish move, Elle follows suit and somehow gets accepted hoping Warner changes his mind about her.At Harvard, Elle has trouble being accepted by Warner's friends and by the more intense students.However she applies herself and gets to assist in a murder trial and manages to show that she has more skills in the application of the law.This is a light, breezy film turned into a hit musical thanks to producer of the film Marc Platt who also produced 'Wicked' on stage.It has all the beats with Elle struggling at Law School then being befriended by Luke Wilson. She then becomes part of the defence attorney team for Ali Larter who stands trial for murder.Witherspoon is winning in the lead role and brings likability but the film is all froth.",Legally Blonde
6,lee_eisenberg,Who says that blondes have to be dumb?,10,10 October 2005,"If you've never heard of ""Legally Blonde"" and you only see a few ads for it, you'll probably get the wrong impression. This is not some half-formed, oh-I'm-so-totally-hot story. This is Reese Witherspoon showing that she can be hilarious and biting in the same movie.It all begins when fashionista Elle Woods (Witherspoon) is about to get married when groom-to-be Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis) jilts her and heads off to Harvard law school. Not about to get railroaded over, Elle follows him there, and decides to enroll herself. At this point in the movie, we can safely assume that the SoCal, vegetarian, pink-clad Elle probably won't totally fit in with the stuffy Harvard people; however, she's not about to let anything stop her. Elle has certain plans, and she'll do whatever she has to in order to carry them out (don't worry, it's nothing illicit).You can tell that everyone had a great time with their roles. And you'll have a great time with this movie. Part satire, part pure fun, they pull out all the stops. And there's one part that, in my opinion at least, says that in fact it is a good idea to allow fashion fetishists to participate in trials. All in all, Reese Witherspoon has acted in some great movies in the past few years.",Legally Blonde
7,jboothmillard,Legally Blonde,6,12 May 2008,"This is one of those ""chick flicks"" you could not escape from, I had seen the poster and heard the title so many times, so I was glad when I got the opportunity to watch it, directed by Robert Luketic (Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!, Monster-in-Law, Killers). Basically, Elle Woods (Golden Globe nominated Reese Witherspoon) is a fashion merchandising student and sorority girl. At an expensive restaurant, she is expecting rich boyfriend Warner Huntington III (Blue Crush's Matthew Davis) to propose, but instead he dumps her, he thinks she is not that ""serious"" enough to make a good wife. Ellie believes she can win Wayne back if she proves herself to be smart. So, after months of studying, she scores highly on the Law School Admission Test, including a 4.0 GPA (grade point average), and she is accepted into Harvard Law School, where Wayne is attending to become a successful politician. Arriving at Harvard, Elle's Southern Californian personality is a complete contrast to her East Coast classmates, who cannot take her seriously. Elle soon finds Warner but discovers he is engaged to another classmate, his old girlfriend Vivian Kensington (Cruel Intentions' Selma Blair). She is comforted by Paulette Bonafonté (Jennifer Coolidge) at a hair salon and practises her law skills to helps Paulette get her dog back from her ex-husband. Vivian is a snob and sees Elle as a fool and constantly treats her like one. Later, Elle tells Warner that she intends to apply for one of her professor's internships, but Warner tells her that she is wasting her time because she simply isn't smart enough. This is when Elle realises that Warner will never take her back or take her seriously, she is motivated to prove herself by working hard and demonstrating her understanding of the subject. The following semester, Professor Callahan (Titanic's Victor Garber), a respected professor, the state's top defence lawyer and part of a prestigious firm, decides to take on some first-year interns to help with a high-profile murder case. Elle is chosen, alongside Warner and Vivian. Callahan is defending prominent fitness instructor Brooke Windham (Ali Larter), a role model for Elle. Brooke is accused of murdering her husband but unwilling to produce an alibi. She later tells Elle in confidence that she was having liposuction, a fact that would ruin her reputation, and Elle promises not to tell anyone. Vivian earns a new respect for Elle and even reveals that Warner could not get into Harvard without the help of his father. Emmett Richmond (Luke Wilson), Callahan's junior partner, has also taken notice of Elle's potential. Elle contributes during the trial when a fake boyfriend is brought forward, and she realises, from his knowledge of fashion, that he is gay. One night, Callahan come on to Elle, she believes this is the only reason why she got the internship. Vivian is mistaken into thinking that Elle slept with Callahan in exchange for a spot during the case. Devastated, Elle quits and nearly returns home to California, telling Emmett what happened. Emmett explains Callahan's to Brooke, who in turn fires Callahan and replaces him with Elle (under the guidance of Emmett, as she is only a law student, citing a Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling that law students may represent clients as long as they do so under the supervision of a licensed attorney). Elle cross-examines Brooke's stepdaughter Chutney (Linda Cardellini), and notices inconsistencies in her story. Chutney claims she was at home in the shower when her father was murder and did not hear the gunshot. Elle realises that if she had her hair permed, she was using products that would ruin her curls. With her story falling apart, Chutney confesses that she accidentally killed her father, she actually intended to kill Brooke because she hated the fact that her father married someone who was the same age as her. After the trial, Warner approaches Elle and asks her to take him back, as she has proven herself intelligent. Elle rejects him, calling shallow and a ""complete bonehead"". However, she and Vivian and become good friends, and Vivian dumps Warner. Two years later Elle, having graduated top of her class, gives the graduation speech. The final text reveals that Warner only barely managed to graduate, Emmett has started his own law firm and has been dating Elle for two years, with plans to propose to her. Also starring Holland Taylor as Professor Stromwell, White Chicks' Jessica Cauffiel as Margot, One Million Years B.C.'s Raquel Welch as Mrs. Windham Vandermark, Alanna Ubach as Serena, Oz Perkins as Dorky David Kidney, Bruce Thomas as UPS Guy, James Read as Elle's Father, Stripshow's Tane McClure as Elle's Mother, and American Pie 2's Kevin Cooney as Head of Admissions. Witherspoon perfectly plays the slightly air-headed but ambitious young woman, and there is good support from Blair as the mean new girlfriend, Wilson as a love interest, and Coolidge as the equally naïve hair salon worker. Obviously, a few of the events are preposterous, but the leading character wearing all pink and radiating positivity is infectious, some of the law stuff goes over your head a little, but there are plenty of laughs along the way, a satisfying comedy. It was nominated the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Good!",Legally Blonde
8,ccthemovieman-1,Only In Hollywood!,6,14 May 2006,"A bimbo becoming a top lawyer: only in Hollywood!! That's the premise here and a winsome Reese Witherspoon pulls it off in a charming way, which she would have to do to make this ludicrous story watchable. It's a bit on the feminist side with most men pictured as shallow but there are women pictured the same, too. In an era PC baloney, at least this film pokes fun at everyone, not just select groups.Witherspoon and Luke Wilson both play good, nice people and it's nice to see a Wilson brother NOT playing someone stupid. There are stupid parts in here, but you get that in any comedy. There are also some very clever lines in there, too, but overall it's pretty low-brained material.....just played for fun. It would have been more innocent without a needless off-key or profane remark here and there.",Legally Blonde
9,rmax304823,Dutiful But Not Dumb.,6,2 October 2010,"I pay little attention to this sort of thing but I'm beginning to believe a genre is established. Since I'm not a fan I can only mention as other members of the set ""Clueless"" and ""Pretty Persuasion."" The genre is characterized by the central character of a young woman, usually in high school or college, various intrigues and power plays, a ludic tenor, and cute dialog, sometimes pretty clever. The title of this film is an example of what I mean. ""Legally Blond."" (Based on the expression ""legally blind,"" get it?) It's filled with resonance. Stereotypical blondes are stupid. Yet, in this movie, Reese Witherspoon outwits everyone else in sight while a first-year law student at Harvard. ""Law"" justifies ""legally.""Well, I don't know nothing about no snooty schools like Harvard. No, nor not much else neither. An ex-friend once dissed me by saying I didn't have too much in the upper story. Okay, so's I don't know nothing about law but I know what I like. And I am like hip enough not to shoot up in front of a police station.I'm not sure Reese Witherspoon's character is even that sophisticated at the beginning of this film. She's a Southern Californian airhead who just finished college with a major in Fashion Design Marketing. She wears too much make up, sports tiny pink clothes, mussitates over Cosmo, and bears the usual earmarks of surferhood. But when her patrician boyfriend leaves for Harvard Law, she decides to apply too, just to be near him, and she's accepted for reasons only the screenwriters know.But the movie doesn't skewer Reese Witherspoon any more than most of the other characters. Stereotypes abound. Harvard Law students, for instance, are all a bunch of nail-biting neurotics or loud-mouthed megalomaniacs. It's probably not necessary to spell out the rest of the plot. Before you know it, she's wearing multilayered dark clothing, sloughing off her boyfriend, winning a case in court, and becoming class valedictorian.As the template requires, the comedy has an underlying serious theme, which might be called, in an Afterschool Special, ""the message."" It's stated explicitly, the last line of dialog in the movie. Never judge by appearances. That groaning sound you hear emanates from Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris where Oscar Wilde is doing his damnedest to roll over in his grave.I'd put off watching this for quite a while because, well, it's difficult to sit through an hour and a half watching a teen-aged girl manipulate others or find herself or get in touch with her feelings, despite the occasionally witty cutting remarks. However, like the other members of its set, I kind of enjoyed it. Not enough to ever dream of seeing it again, but smiles are getting rarer these days and we need all the help we can get. A perfect performance by Selma Blair, by the way, as the supercilious and venomous preppie who wins Witherspoon's first love away from her. And good riddance.",Legally Blonde
10,Tweekums,An enjoyable feel-good film,7,3 March 2017,"At first glance one might think Elle Woods is the stereotypical shallow blonde Valley Girl; she Fashion merchandising student who is just waiting for her hunky boyfriend Warner to propose to her. Unfortunately just as she thinks he is going to propose he announces that their relationship is over he intends to have a career in politics and believes his wife must come from East Coast old money not a girl like Elle. She is determined to prove that she can be serious too so enrols in Harvard Law School, where Warner is studying. She soon finds that life in Harvard is very different to life in LA; here she is very much the odd girl out. She also discovers that Warner has a new, 'more suitable' fiancée. After a shaky start she gets stuck in and impresses one of her lecturers, Prof Callahan, enough to be invited to help with the preparations for a murder trial. Now Elle is in her element as the client is a prominent west coast fitness instructor who Elle considers a role model. Unlike her professor Elle is convinced of the client's innocence and is determined to prove it and the things that others thought made her shallow will be just what she needs for the case.This film is a lot of fun. This is largely down to Reese Witherspoon's performance as Elle; it refreshing to see that her character wasn't portrayed as a 'dumb blonde'; it is made clear early on that she is actually very clever, she is also a genuinely nice character who is happy to stand up for others. Other clichés are avoided too; for example Warner's new girlfriend isn't as bad as she first appears. The rest of the cast are pretty good too; notably Victor Garber as the professor who isn't as nice as he first appears and Luke Wilson as the lawyer Elle befriends. One or two clichés do unfortunately persist; the way Elle discovers that a character is gay because he is aware of what brand her designer shoes are is a bit too obvious. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody looking for something inoffensive and fun if a little light-weight.",Legally Blonde
11,moonspinner55,Cheerfully ridiculous...,6,8 December 2007,"Shapely California blonde cleverly maneuvers her way into Harvard Law School; soon, the plucky lass is involved in trying her first legal case alongside her professor and associates...and you can guess the rest. Perky, though surprisingly not obnoxious fantasy-comedy with jokes leaning towards ""Clueless"" territory. We never see much studying amongst these kids, yet the film has a great deal of bounce and heart, with many things to recommend it (not the least of which is an adept Reese Witherspoon in the lead, clearly having a good time). The drawbacks would have to include leaden Luke Wilson as a potential boyfriend and too much cartoony hamming. The film has a strong 'oh, brother!' quotient, but meet it halfway: if you come out of it smiling, it has done its job. **1/2 from ****",Legally Blonde
12,dbdumonteil,rubbish,3,20 September 2003,"This the story of Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), a pretty girl with blond hair who is also a brilliant student (how original it is!). With her boyfriend, Emmett Richmond (Luke Wilson), they are living love's dream. But one day, he's leaving her by announcing him that he's engaging in a politic career. For this, he'll study law in a brilliant university. You can guess easily Witherspoon's feelings: sadness, frustration but revenge too. In order to have her revenge and to get her darling again, she's registering in the same university... This is from this moment on that the movie becomes poor. ""Legally Blonde"" is a bad movie because it's based on a cock and bull screenplay that often falls into foolishness and it includes several unlikelinesses. Even in one hour and a half, you find time to get bored and this movie that is supposed to be a comedy isn't funny at all, in the long run. So I can't believe that this movie is rather well marked: 6.6 out10!.Uneventful and boring. At a pinch can we save Reese Witherspon 's rather good performance.",Legally Blonde
13,blanche-2,Fun comedy,8,5 June 2008,"Reese Witherspoon is ""Legally Blonde"" in this 2001 comedy that's a switch on the old nerd who wants to be one of the beautiful people and gets a makeover. This time, the beautiful person wants to be one of the nerds. After her boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis), who's from old money, breaks up with her and goes to Harvard, Elle decides to get into Harvard too and prove she has what it takes to be Mrs. Warner Huntington III. Along the way, she learns that the only thing that's ""blonde"" about her is her hair.This is a very light, fun comedy buoyed by Witherspoon's charming performance, which hits just the right note. She gives us a complete character, a person into exteriors who also has brains. She's a complete bubblebrain, all about superficiality, who finds out there are other things in the world, such as brains, integrity and depth. One of my favorite scenes is her coaching of the beauty salon employee on attracting the UPS guy - priceless. My other favorite scene is when Elle's fashion sense prevails in the courtroom - hilarious.I love the film's complete lack of vulgarity and sense of fun, as well as its excellent cast which includes Victor Garber, Holland Taylor, Selma Blair, Luke Wilson and Jennifer Coolidge. It makes its point without taking itself too seriously. Highly recommended.",Legally Blonde
14,Quinoa1984,A pleasant summer comedy,7,6 July 2001,"It would seem strange for me to like a ""pleasant"" summer comedy, but I think this one is actually watchable and even gives laughs sometimes.  It is John Grisham meets um, should I say Clueless?  A ditzey yet very smart college girl gets dumped by her boyfriend, and figures out that if she becomes a law student and perhaps even a laywer, she might win him back (even after she realizes he's engaged).  Clumsy at times and of course cliched (aren't they all nowadays), but also fun in a brainless dead-zone way. B",Legally Blonde

17,studioAT,Average. I don't get the hype,2,4 April 2017,"I can see why this film is popular, especially with women. It's essentially the film version of the saying ""don't judge a book by its cover"".It's an OK film, rather than a spectacular one. Without Reese Witherspoon's considerable charm it wouldn't be half as good, because she really carries it.It has it's moments, but is not a film that I can imagine myself going back and watching time and time again.

But when she is dumped by her beau her world caves in. Jumping out of her depression she decides to follow Warner to Harvard Law School in the hope of winning him back. A complete fish out of water, Elle surprises everyone by proving to be a hit with her unorthodox, blonde methods.A monster hit that took many by surprise {it made a staggering Worldwide profit of nearly $124 million}, Legally Blonde stars Reese Witherspoon {Elle}, Luke Wilson {Emmett}, Selma Blair {Vivian} and Matthew Davis {Warner}. It's directed by Robert Luketic and is adapted by Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith from Amanda Brown's novel.Essentially a film that's outcome is never in doubt, Legally Blonde became the success it was on account of Witherspoon's impressive performance and the fact the writers never resort to dumb frat humour to get its laughs. Yes all characters are stereotypes, Elle and her friends are spoilt bubble-heads and the Harvard Law crowd are boorish stiffs. Yet once Elle gets to Harvard, in a blaze of shocking pink and with token Paris Hilton dog in tow, she proves to be resourceful. And the fact that she's very much alone, means she becomes a character the audience can quickly get on side with. Her solitude as she is shunned by the so called next generation law elite, only strengthens her resolve, and thanks to Witherspoon's engaging turn, we are with her all the way. Good support comes from Wilson and Blair, while Ali Larter adds some sexy spice as we get to the inevitable court room finale.Simple without being stupid, Legally Blonde is an easy film to like and enjoy. 7/10",Legally Blonde
19,Doylenf,"Breezy, shallow comedy owes all its charm to Reese Witherspoon...",6,10 July 2007,"Although the premise is flawed and nobody as shallow as Paris Hilton and her gang would ever get past the hallowed gates of Harvard (let alone attempt to go there), LEGALLY BLONDE is good for laughs thanks to the adroit performance of REESE WITHERSPOON as a vacuous Valley Girl whose sole intent for going to college is to land the man of her dreams (MATTHEW DAVIS).One of the film's funniest scenes has Witherspoon going to dinner with Davis, all under the belief that she is about to get a marriage proposal. Instead, he's arranged the date to give her the brushoff because--her boyfriend explains--a man expected by his family to be a senator by the time he's thirty isn't going to pick a girl like her to be his ""Jackie"". Witherspoon's expressions are a marvel to watch as she registers first breathless impatience and innocence, then surprise, then outrage, all within the space of a few seconds.The players around her have plenty of opportunity to shine too, especially JENNIFER COOLIDGE as a lovestruck manicurist unable to show her affection for a United Parcel man smitten with her. Luke Wilson, as a fellow law student, is engaging and obviously sees the joke in the material, and VICTOR GARBER is excellent as a law teacher on the make for legally blonde Witherspoon.There are lots of punch lines along the way and the humor is never really subtle, but it makes a good screwball comedy. One can picture Carole Lombard making the most of this sort of role in the '30s or '40s.Summing up: Pretty shallow stuff, but nevertheless very funny.***** POSSIBLE SPOILER *****Trivia note: She wins the courtroom case at the finale only because she knows something about women's permanents. But what about future cases where this kind of knowledge is irrelevant? Hmmmmm.",Legally Blonde

Elle, determined to get him back (and steal him from his new girlfriend--a scowling Selma Blair), enrolls and gets in (!!!!) to Harvard Law and tries to get him back. Unbelievable to the extreme, but all well-done.  The script could be funnier, but the movie looks great (beautiful aerial views of Harvard); Davis and Witherspoon are easy on eyes and the mood of the movie is very cheerful and upbeat.  Witherspoon is absolutely wonderful as Woods--she takes what could have been a very empty role and brings it to life--she's got a great career in front of her.  Davis is handsome but somewhat wooden as Warner.  Blair does what she can (which isn't much) in a horribly underwritten role.

Perhaps if I were American, I could get more from the ""frat"" culture that this is predicated on, but I'm not and so it just came across to me as a pushy girl used to getting her own way, having to deal with a few bumps in the road. There is comedy, but it is pretty puerile and one only hopes Harvard has since beefed up it's entrance exams. Witherspoon is good - she evokes well, something I found detestable about the character she portrays; but i'm afraid I just found it all just a bit too predictable. By no means the worst from the spate of rom-coms that started off this new millennium, but that doesn't make it good either.",Legally Blonde

Eventually, Callahan makes a pass at Elle and she quits. Brooke fires Callahan and has Elle takes over the case. She uses her knowledge of fashion and hair care to exonerate her client. As it turns out, Heyworth's jealous daughter shot him because she found it disgusting that Brooke was her age. Elle graduates with top honors while Warner gets by without honors. The romance between Paulette and the UPS delivery man is amusing. Reese Witherspoon bares wattage with a winning smile.Don't take ""Legally Blonde"" seriously because it isn't serious.

25,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,An OK teen comedy,6,6 February 2004,"This is a typical PG-13 teen comedy, with a pretty original idea(to the best of my knowledge); a blonde who wants to go to Harvard Law and become a lawyer. Elle Woods, the blonde, is considered stupid by most characters throughout the movie, but we find out that while she isn't a genius, she has some inner strength, and isn't a total dimwit. The plot is good enough, for this type of movie, but apart from the original concept, it seemed too slow and rarely very funny. The characters are believable, the acting is good, mostly, and the humor, while somewhat rare, is mostly pretty funny. There are some very entertaining court scenes near the end, which I enjoyed very much, as I'm a big fan of court dramas. The film is too slow though, and if I had seen it at the cinema, I might have fallen asleep. I found it worth sitting through for the final court scenes, though, and I'd say that they are easily the funniest thing in the movie. I'd recommend it to teens who don't have too high expectations for PG-13 rated teen comedies, and people who enjoy sexual innuendo, as the film has plenty of it. 6/10",Legally Blonde
26,Uriah43,Funny in Its Own Unique Way,6,31 October 2016,"Under the impression that she is soon to be betrothed, ""Elle Woods"" (Reese Witherspoon) is heartbroken when her boyfriend ends the relationship because he is headed for Harvard and wants someone who is more intelligent and serious than her. So to prove to him that she is the serious person he is seeking she decides to apply for the Harvard Law School--and somehow gets accepted. As a result the bubbly--but rather protected and naive--social debutante from Bel Air finds herself like a fish out of water among highly competitive--but extremely snobby--students and needs to find a way to succeed in a world that she is not accustomed to. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that despite being somewhat predictable and full of clichés, this film still managed to be funny in its own unique way with Reese Witherspoon being tailor-made for her particular role. In short, while it may not be the best comedy ever made it was still entertaining enough and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Legally Blonde
27,anaconda-40658,Legally Witherspoon.,7,13 July 2015,"Legally Blonde (2001): Dir: Robert Luketic / Cast: Reese Witherspoon, Luke Wilson, Selma Blair, Victor Garbor, Jennifer Coolidge: Comedy about misconceptions and reels them around to finger point the accuser. It stars Reese Witherspoon as a none too bright blonde who is full of life. In her senior year of college she anticipates a proposal from her boyfriend but is met with rejection when she states the need for a serious relationship. She decides to win him back by attending Harvard Law School as he did. Directed by Robert Luketic with a hilarious performance by Witherspoon who pretty much carries the film. With her inability to fit in and her frilly pink fashion she uses her own wit in dealing with a crucial case. Luke Wilson is the obvious love interest who will assist her with the case and he can do nothing to bring life into it. Selma Blair plays the serious girl engaged to her ex-boyfriend. She is typical and totally lifeless. Victor Garbor and Jennifer Coolidge are two veterans that cannot elevate above where Witherspoon thankfully takes it. Witherspoon is the only element that presents any fresh vibe to this recycled story. We learn that success does not rest on another person. Where this whole dumb blonde bit originated is not known but this comedy stresses that it isn't the colour of your hair that make the grade but a better screenplay might have helped.

29,JamesHitchcock,"Deep down, it's shallow",4,16 April 2007,"The heroine of this film is Elle Woods, an undergraduate studying fashion design at a Californian university. Elle is rather cruelly dumped by her ruthlessly ambitious upper-class boyfriend, Warner Huntington III, who has just been accepted by Harvard Law School and intends to be a Senator by the time he is 30. Warner considers that Elle is insufficiently serious and intellectual to marry a man like himself; as he puts it ""I need a Jackie, not a Marilyn"". (What Warner fails to consider is that, with Marilyn Monroe as a potential First Lady, JFK might have been elected by a landslide instead of having to rely on highly contentious results in Illinois and Texas to put him in the White House).Actually, Warner's misgivings about Elle seem to have some foundation in reality, as she gives the impression of being a shallow, superficial airhead, concerned about little except her appearance and her clothes. (Elle appears to be from a wealthy family; I found myself wondering whether her character was modelled on Paris Hilton, especially as, like Paris, she has a pet Chihuahua). Elle, however, is determined to win Warner back and applies to Harvard Law School herself. Surprisingly, she is accepted, largely because she impresses the male admissions tutors by wearing a skimpy bikini while making her admission video. Once at Harvard, Elle discovers that Warner has now got engaged to Vivian, a snobbish upper-class brunette. After a difficult start, however, she finds herself coping surprisingly well with her academic work, wins an internship with a prestigious Boston law firm and even helps to defend Brooke, an old college friend charged with murdering her elderly husband.James Berardinelli said of ""Legally Blonde"" that it takes a talented performer to make a dumb character likable as opposed to irritating, an opinion from which I would not dissent. Reese Witherspoon is, of course, a very talented performer, as evidenced by her well-deserved Oscar for ""Walk the Line"". Even she, however, (and here I would dissent from Mr Berardinelli's view) is unable to make Elle a character one can warm to. The script might tell us that beneath Elle's shallow exterior there is a highly intelligent and resourceful individual. Ms Wetherspoon, however, seemed unable to show us this; her demeanour, her ridiculously overdone dress-sense, her constant changes of hairstyle and (worst of all) her irritatingly high-pitched voice only served to reinforce the impression that beneath Elle's shallow exterior was an equally shallow interior.Elle is the sort of character who in the eighties or nineties would have been played by Melanie Griffith- the film, indeed, has certain similarities with Griffith's ""Born Yesterday"", another film about a seemingly-dumb blonde with hidden depths. Griffith has always struck me as a much less versatile actress than Witherspoon, but in ""Born Yesterday"" she succeeded where Witherspoon failed, making her character Billie Dawn surprisingly likable.Moreover, for a film which ostensibly has a ""don't judge a book by its cover"" message, there was a surprising amount of sexual stereotyping going on. According to this film, lesbians are all plain, dowdy and politically radical; gay men are all camp, narcissistic and hysterically over-emotional. They also, apparently, know everything there is to know about fashion designers, a subject about which straight men are woefully ignorant. Indeed, with the exception of the token ""good guy"" who becomes Elle's new boyfriend, straight men do not come out of this film any better than gays. Apart from the arrogant and self-obsessed Warner, there is a male law professor who turns out to be a creepy sexual predator, an unattractive nerd who cannot get a date without Elle's assistance and a poor-white-trash deadbeat living in (of course) a run-down old trailer. With the exception of Brooke's oddly-named stepdaughter Chutney, all the female characters are portrayed sympathetically. The formidable-seeming female professor turns out to be more decent than her male colleague, and even Vivian, who is initially portrayed as a social and intellectual snob and a prize bitch, goes through a change of heart and becomes Elle's best friend.""Legally Blonde"" is essentially a one-joke film, the joke being that although Elle might look, dress and behave like a dumb blonde bimbo, the sort of girl who (as Pamela Stephenson said about Kate Bush) needs an intellect like she needs a hole in the head, underneath the surface she has hidden qualities- not only academic intelligence but also kindness and strength of character. The problem with the film is that, unlike its heroine, it has no hidden depths. The dialogue is flat, the humour is forced and the characters are all stereotypes with whom I could not sympathise. Deep down, it's shallow.",Legally Blonde
30,StevePulaski,"Carried by a performance, and we're left with a subtle yet favorable impact",8,31 July 2012,"It is very rare that films are carried almost solely by one character's charisma, but Reese Witherspoon throws herself into the role of Elle Woods in Legally Blonde, one of the most genial and unoffensive comedies I've seen in a while. Elle is a goofy, girly woman who enrolls into Harvard Law School after her boyfriend (Matthew Davis) breaks up with her at an attempt to lead a life of utter seriousness. Elle is a shamelessly blonde California girl, used to having others think for her, but she is not witless and without a brain in her head. She just prefers not to work it too hard.After breaking her back to become accepted to the school, she quickly becomes exiled by her peers because of her bubbly nature and transparent naivete. She too notices her boyfriend's new stuck-up fiancée, Vivian, played by Selma Blair, as always, doing some fine work. Meanwhile, she also becomes acquainted with fellow law student, Emit (Luke Wilson), and her connections with him and her teacher will eventually land her a spot defending her former fitness instructor, who is on trial for allegedly murdering her husband.One must be careful as accepting Legally Blonde as a film trying to motivate blondes, and not ostracize or provoke them. They are often labeled as slow, incompetent, and unable to perform simple tasks, but Elle puts many redheads and brunettes to shame with her quick-witted nature, her lovable quirkiness, and her beautiful and expressive smile. Witherspoon was born to play this role, and after seeing her as a venomous bitch in Alexander Payne's wonderful Election, it seems we needed her to appear in a film like this just to remind audiences of the good-natured woman she can be.Legally Blonde, which would later spawn a sequel, a spin-off, and a Broadway musical, may become overbearing for some, because so much of the film is weighed on Witherspoon's shoulders and if one tires from her fast, the experience could very well be a tedious one. I was left fulfilled and never bored from this, and can always respect a film that is able to shred my cynicism and offer compelling insight that could definitely prove factual in today's society. What can I say? It did the job, in more ways than one. But then again, why trust me?

34,sddavis63,Reese Witherspoon Is Over The Top Funny,7,20 July 2002,"The real trick to appreciating this movie is not to take it at all seriously. If you analyze this too much you'll hate it. Quite honesty, the storyline is virtually non-existent, and where it does exist it's really quite nonsensical; the acting is ordinary at best, with only two exceptions: Reese Witherspoon put on an over the top performance as the blonde law student Elle Woods, and Victor Garber was notable as Professor Callahan (notable because, without giving too much away here, I was actually quite convinced through most of the movie that he was a reasonably good guy.) Anyway, with that introduction, this movie doesn't look too promising so far.Except that you have to remember the rule: don't take it seriously. It's full of dumb blonde jokes and stereotypes, it's sexist and it's deliberately silly. This isn't meant to be ""Gone With The Wind."" It's meant to be fun, and for the most part it succeeds. Just learning about ""the snap"" made this worthwhile viewing!I really had only two significant criticisms. I would have liked the movie to have focused more on Elle at Harvard. We seem to get only a brief glimpse of her at Harvard, but I really think that would have been funnier than Elle working at a law firm and Elle in the courtroom, and the plot twist in the last quarter or so of the movie was just totally unbelievable (I know it's hard to say that anything could be unbelievable in this kind of movie, but this went a bit too far even for this.) If it weren't for those two weaknesses, I'd probably rate it higher. As it stands, I still think it's worth a 7/10.",Legally Blonde

36,Lejink,Blonde ambition,6,6 June 2010,"Unbelievably, a Hollywood rom-com from the Noughties that I actually quite enjoyed. Too tired to switch channels after a sports programme, ""Legally Blonde"" fell into view and I warmed to it before my well-founded bias against this type of film got the better of me and I could zap to something else.Of course the story is pure fluff, comprising not so dumb blonde Reese Wotherspoon's unlikely attempts to win back her snooty society boyfriend who's stomped on her matrimonial plans by dumping her for an altogether more up-market wealthy college girl. This leads to her winning a place in Harvard Law School where naturally with a combination of looks, determination and street smarts she overturns everyone's preconceptions of her to triumph to the extent that she can kiss off her now adoring ex when he comes running back after her by the end. The American Dream in microcosm...! I'm joking of course, and while making some fairly gentle digs against male prejudices and basically anyone else who ever cracked a ditzy blonde joke, the film doesn't take itself too seriously and propelled by an effervescent lead performance by Wotherspoon, ably supported by just-getting-noticed Selma Blair and Luke Wilson, it packs enough amusing lines and situations to keep you watching.I hesitate to call them highlights and thus elevate the film above its station, but you will undoubtedly smile at Elle's ""stretch and snap"" tutorial to get a man's attention, her bunny-costume appearance at the bogus party called by her rival and her Perry Mason meets Petrocelli courtroom demolition of her client's accuser's evidence (in a fetching fuchsia pink twin-set, indeed!).I could have done without the too-modern-for-my-taste music soundtrack and one or two of the risqué lines, both obviously inserted to cater to its primary target teen audience, but directed with zip, I was pleasantly engaged over the course of its 90 minute running time as I think anyone would be.",Legally Blonde

'Legally Blonde (2001)' gets all of this across remarkably well and, unusually, none of its ideals are ever diluted or corrupted, even during some of the flick's sillier scenes (a pseudo dance number sticks out as the strangest) and some ever-so-slightly problematic moments (more due to an early 2000s ignorance than ill-intent). It's when the film stops poking fun at the protagonist and starts to expertly put you in her fish-out-of-water shoes that it sets itself apart from others of the kind, keeping a kind heart and ending up wonderfully endearing and crowd-pleasing affair. The central character arc is actually really well drawn and realised, with a tangible difference between what she wants and needs, which means the inevitable completion of that arc is extremely satisfying and, actually, quite uplifting. 7/10",Legally Blonde

40,atlasmb,Reese Witherspoon Is Great In This Role,8,5 June 2018,"Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) is a girly-girl. She adorns herself in shades of pink.

She lives for the love of a boyfriend and she lives by the bible of her personal cosmetocracy-""Cosmo"".She is the Cinderella of this fairy tale, so it's no surprise that she gets her prince in the end (sort of). And the problems of her fairy tale world melt away like pink gumdrops under a sherbet sun.But don't dismiss this film as cinematic fluff, not entirely. Because Elle transforms before our eyes into something more than a princess. She becomes something more than she even knew she hoped to be-a woman empowered. This is an enjoyable journey-primarily due to Reese Witherspoon's incredible characterization.Much like Alicia Silverstone's portrayal of Cher in ""Clueless"", Elle embraces her quirky individuality and makes the most of it. And she learns to accept her own intelligence as valuable.It's unfortunate that the script sees the man-woman dynamic as a zero sum game, and feels it must unnecessarily belittle men in the process of lifting women up. It is possible to create really positive transformations in characters of both genders; it just takes a little more work and a more nuanced approach.Still, Elle is a very likable character, full of optimism and a sunny disposition.

41,sol-,More charming than it sounds,7,23 November 2015,"Told by her boyfriend that she is ""not serious"" enough, a fashion student enrolls in the same law school in a bid to win him back in this fun fish-out-of-water comedy. The film's success is due largely to the spunk that Reese Witherspoon brings to the part. At first, she seems like just another spoiled teen with her elaborate wardrobe and accessories, but she soon shows wit and gumption, calling out a swindling shop assistant, and there is something to be said for how regimented she renders her sorority. The film is about overcoming appearance-based prejudice and about choice; she obviously always had the brains for law but she chose to become a sorority queen. Along such lines, there are several touching dramatic moments, such as an excellent shot of Witherspoon's pensive reflection in an elevator as the doors close on her. The comedy is, however, very uneven. Only so much humour can be milked from her ""Barbie""-ish outfits, accessories and personality clashing at Harvard. One also wonders whether such a smart girl would really not be aware of how out of place she is. Her intelligence again seems questionable in the film's climactic courtroom scenes where her success comes more through luck than ingenuity. Never to mind, the film bounces along nicely provided that one simply accepts the fact that Witherspoon is as intelligent as her test scores dictate. The song soundtrack is great, Luke Wilson makes an appealing (if too obvious) alternative love interest, and Witherspoon gets so into her character that it is hard not to be caught up in her pure energy.",Legally Blonde

43,Anonymous_Maxine,"Undeniably skilled filmmaking, but the movie doesn't know where it's going.",6,4 August 2001,"Legally Blonde is obviously one of those silly comedies in the tradition of the much better Clueless (what with all of the air headed blondes and big lawyers), but the film really loses its way in the final act. Elle Woods, a cutesy sorority president at the charmingly named CULA (real creative name, guys), is jilted by her boyfriend when he breaks up with her on the night that she thinks that he's going to propose to her. He arrogantly tells her that he needs to find someone more serious, basically telling her that he is more interested in finding someone that will help him further his career than he is in marrying someone who loves him. Elle goes through a period of boyfriend mourning, and then decides that she'll follow him and go to Harvard Law school (`What, like it's hard?') to prove to him (and the audience) that she really does have a brain underneath all of that fluffy pink exterior. Her acceptance is barely, but successfully, made moderately believable, and she's off to Harvard in her Porsche Boxter and with her tiny tiny dog. As is to be expected, she encounters significant difficulties at Harvard because no one there takes her seriously, because she is obviously not one of the `intellectual' types that are commonly seen there. It turns out that her plans to win back her boyfriend, Warner, have backfired, because he has already gotten back together with an ex-girlfriend by the time Elle gets to Harvard, and this is when we really know that Warner will not be a part of Elle's future. His new girlfriend Vivian (played by Selma Blair, who we remember from a significantly different role in Cruel Intentions), treats her no differently that many of her professor's treat her, as a dumb blonde who doesn't belong at Harvard. As a Harvard Law School graduate, I can completely understand the troubles that she is going through, because it is an intensely intellectual school (disclaimer: I never went to Harvard Law). Elle deals with all of her problems at Harvard by keeping in touch with her air headed bimbo buddies from back at CULA (I never went to UCLA either, but I've been there enough times to know that this really is what a good portion of the female population looks like at that school), as well as by forming a heart warming friendship with Stifler's mom (`Bendand SNAP!'). The overall plot is not really something to complain about. It's the same old underdog coming out on top premise, but Reese Witherspoon fits her role perfectly and there is plenty of comic relief to keep it moving and to keep you entertained. (spoilers)The part where the film really goes wrong is with the trial at the end of the film. It's great to see the progress that Elle makes during the case, but the outcome completely contradicts the rest of the film. There were some hilarious cross-examinations (`You bitch!') on the stand, but the end is awful. We spend the entire film watching Elle struggle through law school trying to prove to everyone, including her parents, that she has the mental capacity to get through it, but in the end, it is her knowledge of the beauty salon that comes to the rescue to help her win the case. Her entire speech as she is cross-examining the murder victim's daughter consists of little to no legal jargon whatsoever. Any ditz straight out of the hair salon could have convicted that woman. It's too bad that the movie got so lost at the end, because it was otherwise a very entertaining comedy. Elle is never for a second made into a believable lawyer OR law student (the scene where she pretends to be Paulette's attorney in order to get her dog back, in which she spouts legal mumbo jumbo that she clearly doesn't understand, certainly doesn't help either), and we're left with a film that amused us for an hour and a half but didn't really do anything. We can only hope that the guilty party in any trial that Elle conducts in the future makes a mistake in commiting their crime that involves some sort of cosmetic augmentation that Elle can latch on to and use to solve the case, because the one we saw at the end of the film was, as they say, dumb luck.",Legally Blonde

Why this has happened? I am not sure why. I object for this film to receive those accolades because it was simply not that good. Even though I did enjoy Reese Witherspoon's spunky performance, the whole interest premise of the film dyed very early. The root of the film is about a blonde who decides to enroll in Harvard to win back her ex-boyfriend who dumped her because he thought she was not smart enough. The only highlight of this movie was watching the skilled performer in Witherspoon do her thing. Unfortunately, the lame screenplay did not add color to the rest of the film. `Legally Blonde' is the most overrated film of the year and it is simply not that much fun. *** Average",Legally Blonde

Reese Witherspoon is perfect as a slightly ditzy sorority blonde who is dumped by her boyfriend and follows him to Harvard.

49,mattkratz,funny,8,9 March 2018,"Yes, this movie is predictable and formulaic. You know how it's going to end. Yet, it's still funny with good performances, especially by Reese Witherspoon in the lead. If you've seen My Cousin Vinny, you know how this will end. She gets dumped by her boyfriend when she thinks she's going to be proposed to, and winds up going to Harvard Law School to try and win him back and finds herself as a fish out of water. I loved the ""bend and snap,"" the part where the law professor hits on her, and the final courtroom scenes. This is meant to be a comedy. Keep that in mind.** 1/2 out of ****",Legally Blonde
50,noralee,Reese Witherspoon Shines,7,6 December 2005,"I was surprised that going to see ""Legally Blonde"" turned into a family outing. When I mentioned that I was a fan of Reese Witherspoon my older son piped up that ""Reese is hot!"" and that he'd seen previews of her in a bathing suit, while my husband enthusiastically leaped at the chance to go to the movies on a beautiful sunny day. And judging by the reactions of the many other guffawing guys in the theater, I can't quite call this a chick flick, though my husband insisted that all the tween girls also in the theater must have benefited from the message of female empowerment. So I guess in this day and age Cosmo Girls are family entertainment.The pre-lawyer and lawyer in the family managed to concur on the movie's locale, education and legal accuracy, when they could think besides ogling.Witherspoon doesn't have the advantage of the writing or satire of ""Clueless"" (which capitalized on a classic work of literature as its source material), but she captures the screen as effectively as Julia Roberts and is the whole reason to see this fun movie. It helps that we really do know and can tell that Reese is one smart cookie under that hair, plus she sure looks good for a very young woman who had a baby a year ago. Who knew that rich California Girls are really an oppressed class that we could root for her as an underdog, er, under-Chihuaha? The sisterhood solidarity angle is used effectively and amusingly, especially in that great class leveler, the beauty/manicure parlor, and not all the guys (or other women) are jerks.I look forward to an episode of ""Sex and the City"" when she'll come to Miranda's law firm.The soundtrack is a missed opportunity. The guys plopped themselves on the couch to watch The War Channel as soon as we got home, so they weren't permanently damaged by seeing a chick flick. (originally written 7/14/2001)",Legally Blonde

There was only one person that I hated throughout most of the film, and that was Vivian (Selma Blair). The reason I hated her throughout most of the film was because she was really snobby! Even though I had that negative thought about her throughout most of the film, I thought this film was really funny, charming, witty, and sweet. It was especially funny during the trial of Brooke Taylor-Windham (Ali Larter). Also, even though Elle (Reese Witherspoon) acted a little crazy at times, I thought she did, indeed, have a lot more legal savvy than she thought she did.

The charisma and cute fun That Witherspoon brings to her role and the movie as a whole is certainly refreshing. The script is pretty good, it has some clichés of course, but I didn't take much issue with it. I enjoyed Reese and Selma Blaire in here, they were both good in their respective roles and interacted well with each other. There were funny scenes with amusing dialogue, even if some were worn. The film does work for what it is going for, a light cute comedy starring Reese Witherspoon. Although some of the jokes don't flow all too well sometimes. Luke Wilson was good as well, I enjoyed his acting in this. Legally blonde is a pretty average, charming because of Witherspoon comedy. 6/10.",Legally Blonde

What the hell was that? I was waiting for the musical number to start after seeing this take place. It did nothing for the film except for making people feel it was a better time than any to get up from their seat to get a drink. Second, the ending. The last thing we read on the screen is that she is going to be asked for her hand in marriage. Ok, its a happy ending, but what does this ending do for the ""90's independent woman?"" Yes, she proved to the world and to herself that she could do things without a man in her life, but does this mean her reward is getting a man? Whether or not the whole film was spent trying to prove to the man she thought she loved that she was worthy, she ends up being put into the situation of being some ones wife.

55,Agent10,"Yeah its a chick flick, but hey, I liked it",7,21 May 2002,"Why would I enjoy a chick flick? Is Reese Witherspoon a good enough reason to see a movie? Well, none of those questions came to mind after watching this film. The good thing about this movie is they hired a comparable actress to play the role of Elle Woods, not some random buxom blonde who was fresh off the pages of Playboy or something. Now, the premise to the film is certainly convoluted (however, the admissions board choosing her because of her looks isn't too improbable), but it still brought about some very interesting commentary about our society. Sadly, Elle Woods was quickly judged due to her bust size and outgoing personality as opposed to her abilities, which tend to be a trait all people fall under.

She is surrounded by a capable cast, including Matthew Davis as the villian, Selma Blair as the villianess turned friend, Victor Garber as the other vilian, and Luke Wilson as the man who wishes she'd realize all the potential she has and use it 'for the greater good'.Also it was nice to see Osgood Perkins, son of Tony..he's doing some of his fathers nervous mannerisms but it seems touching in way.

She also meets Emmett (Luke Wilson) who's role is not sure in the beginning of the movie. Elle who is definitely not like the others on Harvard slowly learns that Warner is probably not what she wants.What happens is pretty predictable but also very funny and charming because of Witherspoon.

If anything I like the way Legally Blonde pokes fun at the Barbie personality, the self-centred, capitalist, materialist girl from The wealthy LA suburbs. At the same time Legally Blonde can be equally frustrating. It pokes fun at credible intellectuals, like Harvard folk. Here is a movie that which tells us it is more likely that a know-nothing California sorority queen is more likely to get into the hardest programme at America's top University, than it is likely for hell to freeze over. The film takes us on a rushed trip, which is unbelievably dopey, but just occasionally amusing and provokes giggles. I wouldn't say that is enough of a pay off for investing your time in this film.

Well done fluff can be awfully fun, where would the movie world be without it? Elle Woods isn't just another movie character, Witherspoon really does give her a well developed personality and make her the heroine of the movie. It's a real girl power movie in one sense, and it's also a great tribute to blonds, lawyers, females in general, people who have ever been thought to be less intelligent then they are...etc. It's a tribute to a lot of things and what's more it's fun! And funny. Great one liners. Great clothes, such as Reese's pink sundress, seen at the beginning. And it leaves you feeling good. What more could you want? So go blonde for a night!

As we know from the movies, gentlemen prefer blondes but alas not a gentleman whom Elle is dating and expecting him to propose any minute. Instead, as the movie turns, the blondes also have blues because they are not taken seriously by the men from the blue blood families. When the object of Elle's desire heads off to Harward Law School, she decided to get him back by proving that the blondes have ""a head for business and a bod for sin. Is there anything wrong with that?"" The first step for Elle was to get admitted to the same school, and she did it. But that was only the beginning...You know, I've seen ""Legally Blonde"" several times and I know that it is not the best movie ever made, far from it but I like it. I am not a Witherspoon's fan, I don't find her a stunning beauty but she is a talented young actress who brought a certain charm to the role. I am also a true believer that ""happy people just don't kill their husbands, they just don't"" and I like how Reese delivers this piece of wisdom.

63,raulfaust,Wut a shame,5,29 November 2010,"As a law student, I read the synopsis before watching and thought I was gonna enjoy it.The movie began with a great scenario: a not so clever girl in the middle of a bunch of serious people. The director did well describing her as a rich and regular teenager who wants to live life. They didn't make her look like too futile, just a little bit, what makes the audience kind of respect her style.It was good either to show what people are willing to do for love. She did everything to get to law school and to recover her boyfriend. She accepted living with arrogant people and being oppressed just for love. So, until this moment I was pretty amused with the film.But the writers may have had some problems towards writing time, so it just went everything downhill from there. First of the plot holes, was when Elle got flirted by the professor. She went right to the elevator and Vivian accused her of being dishonest. Why didn't Elle just said that she didn't accept the dating deal from the professor before the elevator's door closed? What was funny or believable when Elle pretended to had sex with that nerd? Which girls would dance just like another in a beauty salon if she wasn't even talking to them? Which court would allow animals in? Which court would allow two girls coming in the court speaking high and disturbing judge's speak?

No, all I could think was: 'If I see even more pink or blonde the next few hours then I'm going to scream, yell, kick,...'. I guess that already sums up pretty well how I feel about this movie, doesn't it? The idea is original, a blonde fashion student is dumped by her boyfriend because he goes to law school and needs a more serious person next to him when he will become a senator. Of course Elle is upset, but instead of keeping to stuff herself up with sweets or crying her eyes out for the rest of her life, she decides to prove him that she isn't the dumb blonde he always saw in her. She enlists in law school as well and despite the fact that everybody laughs with her, she persists and eventually even wins a case thanks to her fashion sense...I guess I don't have to explain to you that this kind of movies isn't exactly meant to be intelligent and ""Legally Blonde"" doesn't even try to pretend to be it, which in this case is a very good thing.

She has a great life, she is the queen and the president of her sorority called Delta Nu, and she does not have to worry about anything. Her big dream is to marry her boyfriend, and one day, when they are having dinner, Warners tells her something important: He is going to Harvard to be a Law school student,but he foes not need a Marilyn....he wants a Jackie! Or in a easy way: He will not date Elle anymore, because he wants someone who is more serious and less futile.Elle stays angry and devastate,but during her depression, she had the idea about studying and going to Harvard to be 'more serious'. There, she finds out that Warner is engaged to Vivian Kensington, a brunette girl who starts to become Elle's rival,and she also meets Emmett, one of the professor who work in Harvard. With the help of Paulette(the manicure) and Emmett, she will show the real power and the things she is capable to do,since people always think that she get things only because of her looks.One of the things I love in this movie,is Elle's change for a new girl with new purpose in her life, and even her personality's transformation without loosing her charisma.

The lecherous and obnoxious college professor. If it wasn't so well-directed and paced, it would have been a highly-forgettable ""B"" movie. The murder trial ending is very ""Perry Masonish"" and unbelievable. Even Reese Witherspoon has not been able to achieve as much success with the sequel, spin-offs, and musical (a few years back).

68,tomsview,Totally blonde,7,7 September 2013,"In a film that is far more engaging than expected, Reese Witherspoon's character in ""Legally Blonde"", Elle Woods, speaks blonde. According to this movie blonde is more than just a language or even a state of mind, it's a philosophy.Elle's boyfriend, Warner Huntington III, dumps her because he thinks her blondeness equates with vacuousness. Not a woman to take being dumped lightly, Elle successfully enters Harvard Law School to impress him with her worth.By the end of the movie, Elle not only achieves her aim, but also shows the non-blonde, and somewhat unattractive alumni of Harvard that there is very little that cannot be achieved by the earnest application of pink nail enamel and rigorous accessorising. This process is helped by the liberal use of the adverb ""totally"" to emphasise every second point.""Legally Blonde"" is beyond normal notions of criticism. It hits its target market so effectively that its formula – and there totally is a formula – should be the basis for serious study in marketing institutions. ""Legally Blonde"" has a message for teenage girls dealing with school, puberty, parental expectations, oppressive, all-consuming peer pressure and the paralysing choices between Moschino, Gucci and Dolce & Gabbana. Elle Woods demonstrates that there is infinite power in an almost total absorption in how one looks and what one wears.At Harvard, Elle not only grasps the intricacies of complex legal argument, but also becomes an intern in the legal firm of one of her lecturers. Much of Elle's success comes through the judicious application of blonde philosophy, which according to ""Legally Blonde"", gets to the root of a problem quicker than Decoré Blonding Creme gets to the roots of dull brown hair.Her legal firm is defending a woman accused of murdering her wealthy, older husband. Elle is the only member of the defence team who believes she is innocent, ""Blondes don't commit murder"", she states, basing her faith in the woman's innocence on the fact that she runs a successful body sculpting gym.Contrast is used to great effect in ""Legally Blonde"". Against Elle's ensembles of pink and emerald, her fellow students at Harvard, including Vivian Kensington played by Selma Blair, are a colourless lot. For the most part they wear jackets, skirts, pants and vests of varying shades of grey and brown. Although for the most part, dark-haired, they are not dark-skinned. In fact, there are few black people in this movie at all. Of course, in a film that establishes blonde as such a preternatural force, it is hard to accommodate what is after all, the exact opposite look.Reese Witherspoon is perkily appealing in ""Legally Blonde"" , and the film does not overstay its welcome.

70,DeeNine-2,Pure schmaltz...,6,29 January 2002,"But I liked it. This might be seen as a continuation of Election (1999) as a slightly dingier Reese Witherspoon graduates from 'CULA' (sic) and goes on to Harvard Law School. There's a kind of irony here--the real Reese Witherspoon with her drive and intelligence could actually do it. Her character in the movie: I don't think so. In fact, just about everything in the movie requires the maximum use of the suspension of disbelief option on the part of the audience because virtually nothing in the movie is real.Well, the dogs are real, but I think they were drugged, they seem so passive. Witherspoon, of course, is real, but her performance was a little weary in parts, as though she is tired of playing ditzy blonde airheads and would like something more serious. This script understandably was very difficult to turn down since it practically amounts to a vehicle for her, and her character triumphs over every obstacle and ends up with a choice of two attractive men and a fast track career.Selma Blair, whom I recall from Cruel Intentions (1999), provides fine support as the other girl. Robert Luketic's direction while undistinguished is crisp and even witty at times and gets a lot out of a mediocre script. However those who enjoyed Election might find the pandering to a mass audience in this one annoying. Certainly there is no comparing the scripts.However there are some funny bits and if you're a little, shall we say, relaxed, this might wash over you like a pleasant massage.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

No blonde hair, cute clothes and perfect body to get her through, although sometimes, not all times -- it helps.

Elle is initially despondent, but eventually decides to change her major and through an elaborately produced video essay and cramming for the LSATs Elle against all odds is admitted to Harvard where Warner has already taken up a new girlfriend, Vivian (Selma Blair), while Elle's transition is rough at first she finds support in Emmett (Luke Wilson) a legal associate doing research for professor Callahan (Victor Garber) as well as pedicurist Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge) whom Elle befriends helping her get her dog back from her ex-boyfriend and playing cupid with her crush UPS Guy (Bruce Thomas). Eventually Elle's hard work gets her into Callahan's internship program and Elle puts her legal knowledge to real world practice (with her own spin of course).Adapted from the at the time unpublished (since published) novel of the same name by Amanada Brown based on her experiences attending Harvard Law School as a blonded, Legally Blonde was released in 2001 to massive box office success and elevated Reese Witherspoon from more obscure but well regarded prestige and indie work to a bona fide leading actress. A passion project for producer Marc Platt and ausie newcomer Robert Luketic, Charlize Theron, Gwyneth Paltrow, Alicia Silverstone, Katherine Heigl, Christina Applegate, Milla Jovovich and Jennifer Love Hewitt were all considered for the role prior to casting Witherspoon whom MGM was reluctant to have lead as her performance in Election had endangered her of being typecast as ""a shrew"". The movie eventually became a breakout hit opening at number one and making shy of $100 million at the U. S. box office serving as a much needed hit for MGM at the time and kickstarted a franchise based around the character (with some parts better than others). While parts of the movie are really rough, Legally Blonde was and still is a great showcase of Reese Witherspoon's charisma and talent which the movie is carried by.Witherspoon's performance IS the movie and if it weren't for that performance the movie would not work. From the opening inro where we're introduced to Elle Woods who while fashionable and fun is also savvier and smarter than people give her credit for (as seen when a clerk assumes she's dumb only to have Elle tear down her lies). The movie works because Elle is made a three dimensional character through Witherspoon's likability and energy that makes her a protagonist you want to succeed. The supporting cast is also quite good with Jennifer Coolidge and Luke Wilson both great tethers for Elle who serve as her ""port in the storm"" during the tough times, Selma Blair is quite good as Vivian playing an abrasive character who's softer beneath the surface, and Matthew Davis and Victor Garber are both ""boo/hiss"" characters playing Elle's unfaithful, opportunistic, and shallow ex-boyfriend and Elle's lecherous professor respectively. It's a really good cast and it makes the movie work.Some of the writing is good and allows for some very humorous or charming moments. Elle's ""perm"" defense in the climax of the movie is a scene that feels almost inevitable for audience applause in the theater, and the ""Bend and Snap"" scene which almost didn't make it into the final film is such a high energy sequence it's impossible not to get wrapped up in it. But the writing is very for a lack of a better word ""late 90s/early 00s"". While the movie tries to base itself on the premise of not judging people on the surface level with the movie really being a counterpoint to the ""dumb blonde"" stereotype, its credibility becomes rather flimsy when it indulges in stereotypes itself. There's a prominent character named Enrique who's important to the trial Elle is involved in, and without giving too much away not only is his motivation not explained but his resolution is very ""Will & Grace"" levels of broad exaggeration that undermine some of the movie's goodwill and charm. There's also a few other exchanges that have similar issues and they're kind of hard to ignore even if there's clearly no malice in them.Legally Blonde is a flawed film, but it's also an entertaining film. With a strong lead in Reese Witherspoon and a talent cast of performers for her to bounce off of, Legally Blonde is certainly predictable and formulaic, but it's so well done and so energized you find yourself overlooking it and going along for the ride, and what a ride it is.",Legally Blonde
75,mattymatt4ever,"Relatively harmless comedy, but predictable and only sporadically funny",6,11 November 2001,"I didn't hate this movie, but I don't see what people loved so much about it.  Some of my favorite critics gave this movie enthusiastically good reviews.  And most of my friends who saw it said it was surprisingly good and much better than it looked in the trailers.  Well, I actually thought it looked cool in the trailers.  And I was disappointed by the end result. 
I think ""dumb blonde"" stereotypes on film have grown tired and annoying. Luckily, in only a few scenes are we subjected to those annoying stereotypes in lame gags.  Yes, stupid can be funny, but there has to be a certain amount of wit behind the stupidity.  For example, I cracked up at Elaine May's portrayal of an airhead in Woody Allen's ""Small Time Crooks.""  Though Reese plays a dumb blonde herself, intelligent only in health and beauty products, she has enough charm to pull it off.  One of my favorite comedies is ""My Cousin Vinny,"" and it's hilarious to watch Vincent Gambini (Joe Pesci) as a fish-out-of-water, new to the whole legal system and using his Brooklyn-born street smarts to win the case. Sure, Vincent Gambini wouldn't really be able to pull off that whole act, but films are not meant to be reality; they're meant to be a depiction of reality.  And the depiction was quite well.  And some of his evidence was quite sufficient, helping us suspend disbelief.  In Elle Woods' (Reese) case, we're supposed to go along with her shallow philosophies and cheer her on:  ""Exercise builds endorphins.  Endorphins make people happy.  Happy people don't murder their husbands.""  OK, she's right.  But a chimp could've thought of that.  Her shallow philosophies certainly won't hold water in an actual courtroom.  I'm sure people in the law profession will watch this movie and roll their eyes from start to finish.  Face it, Elle Woods makes Vincent Gambini look like Johnny Cochrane.  The plot is predictable from start to finish, filled with painfully familiar subplots.  Elle gets dumped by Warner.  This Warner guy was obviously a complete jerk from the start, and she's going to do whatever it takes to enroll in Harvard Law to get this idiot back?  And of course, we have that tired subplot involving snooty popular kids and naive geeks.  The snooty kids don't become so snooty after a while and reveal their nicer sides.  The geek boys and geek girls rise to popularity.  Anything we HAVEN'T seen before?  I laughed a few times.  I enjoyed the scene where the pool boy is revealed as gay, and tries to prove otherwise.  Then his boyfriend Chuck rises from the jury and walks out the courtroom yelling ""You b**ch!""  The beautiful Ali Larter is in the cast.  Boy, I love that girl!  And I love that song ""Perfect Day"" by Hoku.  ""Legally Blonde"" is a harmless comedy that simply tries to undermine the intelligence of its audience, making it not much different from all these other lame teen comedies in past years.  And it hardly reaches its comic potential.  I wouldn't completely overrule this comedy, but audiences deserve better.  My score:  6 (out of 10)",Legally Blonde
76,jhclues,Reese Witherspoon's Best Performance,9,11 November 2001,"Don't judge a book by it's cover.  An old saying we've all heard so many times it doesn't seem to mean anything anymore.  But it does mean something, and it's important; and, before we proceed, go back and read it again.  In fact, let me help you:  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  There.  Now take a moment to think, really think about it.  And if it still doesn't mean anything, take a couple of hours and check out `Legally Blonde,' a comedy with some real teeth in it, directed by Robert Luketic and starring Reese Witherspoon.  The premise of the story has to do with upscale sorority girl Elle Woods (Witherspoon), who instead of getting the long awaited, much anticipated marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), finds herself jilted as he prepares to leave for Harvard Law School.  Elle, it seems, just doesn't fit the oh-so-serious, somber profile that the wife of a future Senator must have.  It's all about image, and Elle's own 4.0 grade average earned in her `frivolous' curriculum apparently doesn't carry any weight.  Being outgoing, positive, beautiful AND intelligent just won't do among the `serious' of the `upper crust' elite.  So, because she looks good and enjoys her life, Elle is given the gate, and she just can't understand why.  She's devastated.  But she's also smart.  Smart enough to pick herself up and make a decision that stands them all on their ears. With the grades and the wherewithal to swing it, she enters Harvard Law herself, initially with the intent of winning back Warner.  But along the way she  learns something important-- about the way things really are, about people and about herself, as well.  And she sets out to prove that if there is any `shallowness' around, it's only in the minds of those who perceive her as something and someone other than what she really is.  And, for the viewer, right out of the gate this is someone you want to see succeed in her quest, because her triumph-- whatever it may be or however it comes out-- is going to be one you share right along with her.	Make no mistake, this is one funny movie-- in fact, it's downright hilarious at times.  But beyond the laughter it evokes, there's a flip side to the same coin.  Because beyond all of the comedy there is some serious issues at the heart of this film, and anyone who's ever been subjected to trials and tribulations simply because they didn't happen to fit a certain `mold,' or coincide with someone else's `opinions' of the way things should be, will be able to identify with Elle's situation.  And it's something you have to be aware of, because even while you're laughing at the funny stuff, at the same time it's almost painful to watch Elle endure the senseless, heartless, unnecessary and unwarranted acts that are perpetrated upon her. At the core of the matter is not only the need for tolerance and understanding, but the necessity and importance of keeping an open mind about everything that transpires around you.  Who knows what monumental contributions an individual is capable of making in this imperfect machinery we call society if they are prejudged into oblivion?  So there's a lot more to this film than meets the eye; `dumb blonde' jokes get nipped in the bud, and by using a comedy format, the filmmakers here have produced a film that is not only entertaining, but thoroughly thought-provoking, as well.
	Reese Witherspoon opens herself up and gives a dynamic performance here as Elle; she conveys such a full-of-life spirit that it is easy to empathize with her, and when the hurt comes, you feel it with her.  And through it all, the way she takes it on the chin then moves on with her life makes her a role model for those who may find themselves in a similar situation.  On one hand, when Elle finds solace by getting a manicure at the local beauty shop, it makes for a falling-on-the-floor moment of hilarity, and yet you're always aware of that other side of the coin, as well.  And it makes you root for her all the more.  Witherspoon has a perky, vibrant screen presence that makes her perfect for this part, and she makes Elle a flawed and therefore very real person.  When she gets knocked down, you feel for her; and then there's that feeling of triumph when she gets back up and stands her ground. There's no question that this is Witherspoon's movie, and it's one of the best performances of her career.	The supporting cast includes Luke Wilson (Emmett), Selma Blair (Vivian), Victor Garber (Professor Callahan), Jennifer Coolidge (Paulette), Holland Taylor (Professor Stromwell), Ali Larter (Brooke Taylor-Windham), Jessica Cauffiel (Margot), Linda Cardellini (Chutney), Alanna Ubach (Serena) and Oz Perkins (Dorky David), with a special appearance by Raquel Welch as Mrs. Windham-Vandermark.  An entertaining, accessible film that should be embraced by a wide audience because of the clever way in which it gets across it's message, `Legally Blonde' can be enjoyed by just taking it at face value and soaking up the jokes, but offers even greater rewards to those who really delve into it and see it as an examination of human nature. Not always, but occasionally, a movie is so much more than what it appears to be on the surface, and this is one of them.  What makes it so good is the fact that it can really make you laugh, while at the same time it's subtly telling you that there is no place for cruelty within the realm of human relationships.  It's a film that's worth seeing many times over, and that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",Legally Blonde
77,tim-764-291856,Ditzy blonde makes good!,7,12 May 2012,"As a middle-aged bloke, a ditzy, frothy blonde who dresses in designer pink and who has as a pet a Chihuahua, who also dressed in pink would have me running for the hills, screaming and violently pulling out my own fingernails.Unless it's Reese Witherspoon, for whom I do have a soft spot for especially when she's exactly like Miss Elle Woods here. The story itself is really rather far-fetched but even this aspect is sort of sorted by some generous bending of unwritten rules and smart legal jargon.Legally Blonde will always work better for me, when Miss Woods is gaily arranging sorority parties and being just ridiculously OTT about fashion choices and tartly responding when others try and make her look ridiculous. This comic timing is perfectly suited to the bubbly and vibrant Witherspoon and she remains a tonic throughout.The court case that she falls into defending might be essential to the story of how she gets her legal qualifications and to prove all her doubters totally wrong, but for me, this plays second fiddle to the comedy I mention. The romance angle, an essential premise, as at the start, her boyfriend Warner, who she was absolutely sure was going to propose to her, dumps her, essentially because she's a 'dumb' blonde.He's off to Harvard and so, naturally, Elle scrapes through the preliminaries with the skimpiest of appropriate qualifications (majoring in obscure fashion, for example) so that he could no longer hold that reason against her. He, though, is already dating the surly Selma Blair.I've probably seen Legally... three times now. The sequel/s don't command any great affection for me but this original is one that is both a great comedy and has a real feel-good factor too, without resorting to the gross-out and toilet humour that's unfortunately seen as an essential ingredient in today's US comedies.",Legally Blonde

79,Bob-45,"Not Dumb, Just Superficial",6,16 July 2001,"""Legally Blonde"" demonstrates just what I've always said, Blondes aren't dumb, they are just superficial.  Actually, I said that about ALL people such as Elle, the character played by the enormously talented Reese Witherspoon, AND the people who created ""Legally Blonde"".  To expect such a creature, intelligent as she is, to suddenly transform her interests from bikini waxing to litigation is insulting to BOTH lawyers AND bikini waxers.  I once scored the highest math aptitude on an achievement test in the history of the state of Florida; but, because my interests lay elsewhere I can barely balance a checkbook. Is this movie (gasp! gasp!) superficial?  What can one say about a movie which manages to stereotype blondes, preppies, Jews, gays and Hispanics, some SIMULTANEOUSLY?  At least the filmakers redeemed themselves by making Elle's rival (Selma Blair), transform from preppie bitch to nice person. The only thing TRULY remarkable in ""Legally Blonde"", is how incredibly beautiful and classy Raquel Welch looks at nearly 61. Excess poundage or not, Welch is still FAR more desirable than Witherspoon, even considering Reese's pout and Barbie Doll figure.""Legally Blonde"" is an amusing timekiller, nothing more.",Legally Blonde
80,jon.h.ochiai,"Blonde ""Shrek""",8,9 August 2001,"Robert Luketic's ""Legally Blonde"" is a complete surprise. The movie starring Reese Witherspoon is smart, cleverly written, and flat out funny. From the movie trailer, ""Blonde"" looked to be a rip-off of ""Clueless"". The movie stands on it's own, and is a star vehicle for Witherspoon. ""Legally Blonde"" is the movie foil of this summer's ""Shrek"" in that they both deal with not ""judging a book by it's cover"". In this case it's not judging a Blonde by where she shops. The screenplay by Karen McCullah and Kirstin Smith adapted from the Amanda Brown book is solid funny material with a keen eye on the inflexibility of stereotypes. Director Luketic orchestrates this comedic journey with our heroine, Elle, with an underlying sense of humanity and respect for his characters.Reese Witherspoon plays graduating Elle Woods, sorority sister extraordinaire, glamor princess, with a 4.0 GPA in fashion sciences. She has dinner with her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis who is good here), who she believes is going to ask her to marry him. Instead, to Elle's shock, Warner dumps her. Apparently, she is not the ""serious girlfriend"" he requires. Warner is off to Harvard Law School in the fall, and looking at a future in politics. She does not fit in those plans. Then Elle gets the idea that she can win Warner's heart back, if she too attends Harvard. Elle studies hard and aces the LSAT-- remember she does have a 4.0 GPA. She also submits a killer application video to Harvard. ""Being in a Ricky Martin video"" is exactly the kind of diversity Harvard is looking for. Welcome to Harvard Law, Elle.Early on we get that flighty and fashion coordinated Elle is very smart and talented. We also get that Warner is a stupid loser. So why is she going to Harvard Law School? Duh! Reese Witherspoon is awesome as Elle. She displays an air of trust, fun, and a razor intellect in nailing this role. Ultimately, her Elle is finding that she is not just a pretty blonde, and that she is a brilliant and talented young woman. That gains her a mentor in Prof. Stromwell (the great Holland Taylor). She is chosen as a law associate by another Prof. Callahan (Victor Garber) for a high profile murder trial. This is where she meets his senior associate, Emmett(Luke Wilson), who quickly sees Elle's brilliance. Wilson is charming, smart, and sufficiently breezy-- which is good here. Then it all comes back to Elle being trapped by her looks, and not being seen as the awesome person she is. Does it work out? Duh! Come on. Luketic's directs this movie with style, a sense of humor, and a big heart. He also has a huge star in Reese Witherspoon. You go Girl!",Legally Blonde
81,jluis1984,A nice surprise...,7,14 May 2007,"When a young Amanda Brown attended Stanford Law School, she discovered that the life of a college student at a highly competitive private university had a kind of problems a bit different than the ones she thought she would find there. While her academic performance at Standford wasn't bad, she found a very hostile and antisocial kind of intellectual elitism among the students, that made school almost a hell for her easygoing, ditsy and somewhat naive personality. During those years at college, Brown wrote many letters to her friends, writing about her funny (and not so funny) experiences on campus in order to find something nice out of them. Soon, the letters became the basis for her first novel, ""Legally Blonde"", and later, the novel became the basis for a fun movie that would become one of the embodiments of ""Girl Power"".""Legally Blonde"" is the story of Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), a young and spoiled valley girl who after graduating from University, seems to be heading for the perfect life after she marries her boyfriend Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis). However, destiny has a surprise for her: Warner decides not to marry Elle, as he thinks that her style is too frivolous and vain for his plans to become a politician after attending Harvard Law School. Brokenhearted and disappointed, Elle decides that in order to recover Warner, she needs to prove him that her life can be more than shopping and beauty salons, and that she can be as intelligent as he is. So with that in mind and and exceptional LSAT score, Elle travels to Harvard determined to become one of the top students in her class. In Harvard she'll find not only difficult classes, but also the hostile and skeptic reception from the rest of the students.Remaining relatively faithful to Brown's novel, ""Legally Blonde"" joyfully plays with the typical conventions of chick flicks and gives them a nice (and much needed) twist. Avoiding the usual stereotypes of the teen comedy, the screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith succeeds in that it is not only funny, but also witty and surprisingly intelligent. Like the source novel, ""Legally Blonde"" is more than a romantic comedy about winning back a boyfriend, it is ultimately a tale of self-discovery about a woman decided to surpass what was expected from her and become better without stopping from being herself. While silly at times, the story never loses its charm thanks to an assortment of funny and well developed characters that turn this piece of fluff into a very funny and respectable comedy film.In this his first feature length film, director Robert Luketic takes the wise decision of taking a restrained approach and simply letting his cast do the magic. This simplistic take on the story works for the best, as by keeping the film focused entirely on the characters and the story, Luketic avoids teen comedy's clichéd devises such as over-the-top physical comedy or the abuse of toilet humor. In fact, this focus often brings back good memories of those fish out of water comedies of old, but with of course, a very sleek and modern approach that benefits from the good dose of post-feminism (and fortunately, not overtly preachy) that carries the source novel. While not exactly a very original work, some credit must go to Luketic for managing to get some remarkable performances by his cast in this his debut as a director.Now, the true highlight of the movie, and probably the best reason to give this film a chance is without a doubt Reese Witherspoon's performance as Elle Woods. As the determined blonde of the title, Witherspoon is delightful and shows an extraordinary talent for comedy, having lots of fun while making her character a very real and sympathetic person, far from the stereotypical Valley girls that are often used as stock villains in teen comedies. As her former boyfriend Warner, Matthew Davis has some nice scenes, but he is completely overshadowed by co-stars Luke Wilson and Selma Blair. Wilson showing off his natural comedic talent and Blair making a nice performance as Elles's rival. Jennifer Coolidge and Holland Taylor appear in supporting roles that only improve the film's charm with their great performances.If one approaches ""Legally Blonde"" expecting some deep and insightful comedy, the disappointment will be, without a shadow of a doubt, of truly enormous proportions. However, taking on account the lack of pretensions of this movie, it becomes a very funny experience that never gets boring despite its complete lack of realism in its plot. In fact, one could even say that the film's big and only problem is the fact that despite its twists, the story ends up as predictable for the very nature of the fish out of water style of comedy (underdod beats obstacles against all odds). Still, while the ending may be predictable, it's everything in between what truly matters, so ""Legally Blonde"" makes up for that flaw with very funny jokes and the great performances by its cast.""Legally Blonde"" is not a comedy masterpiece, and without Witherspoon, it probably would lose a lot of its charm, nevertheless, it's joyful play on the genre's typical stereotypes, together with its nice message and why not, its unabashed silliness, make it an extremely attractive and charming comedy for those days when mindless entertainment is preferred over complex film-making. Reese Witherspoon makes what otherwise would be typical fluff, into almost comedic gold, and ""Legally Blonde"" is legally good. 7/10",Legally Blonde

90,FlickJunkie-2,Witherspoon showcased as a talented lead,7,19 January 2002,"`Legally Blonde' is a showcase for Reese Witherspoon that continues to highlight her talents.  The film draws comparisons with `Clueless' since the theme is essentially identical.  Elle (Witherspoon) progresses from a culturally challenged blonde bubblehead to a high achieving Harvard law student for all the wrong reasons.   All the while she has to endure mockery for her valley girl attitudes. Of course, she triumphs over east coast bigotry and over own limitations, but for all the wrong reasons.The story is cute, but lacks the insight and nuance of `Clueless'.  However, Witherspoon outdoes Alicia Silverstone's performance with her sheer energy and determination.  Both were excellent, but Witherspoon is the more dynamic.The acting by the ensemble of supporting actors is very good and helps Witherspoon look that much better.  The cast is rich in aspiring actors with strong talent and little name recognition.  Of particular note are the performances of Selma Blair and Luke Wilson.  Blair plays the uppity girlfriend of Elle's former boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis).  Blair is wonderfully condescending and catty throughout most of the film, but shows the ability to move into a softer, more likeable portrayal by the end. Wilson's soft spoken demeanor is perfect for his nurturing role in this film.  His support is the catalyst that makes Elle's transition work.Reese Witherspoon has been gradually moving to progressively larger parts for the last ten years, and at age 25 she made the leap to the lead with this film.  She definitely makes the most of the opportunity.  She simply dominates the entire film with a high energy performance that has as much steel as perfume.  She makes Elle as lovable as she is ridiculous, while instilling her with qualities that you can't help but admire as the film progresses.  If this is representative of the wattage she will bring to films, then her future is likely to be very bright.This is not a great film, but it is very charming and watchable.  I rated it a 7/10.

I'm not sure if I should say Legally Blonde is in the same classic league as Clueless is, but maybe. I didn't think I was going to enjoy Legally Blonde as much as I did. And, I really did like it. It's a different teen comedy which is fun and sweet all in one. Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, a pretty young blonde girl who gets dumped by her boyfriend, Warner, for being too blonde and not being smart enough. To try and get him back she gets in to Harvard Law School, the same school he attends. Teachers and students, (Including Warner's new girlfriend, Vivian, who doesn't like Elle (At first.) and who even embarrass' Elle by telling her that a party for the Harvard students is a fancy dress when of course it isn't.) don't take Elle seriously though, until she proves them wrong with the many of the good things she does.The cast in the movie which includes Reese Witherspoon, Selma Blair, Luke Wilson and Ali Larter all do give great performances here. For example Witherspoon, I've never been to keen on her. I don't mind her or anything, but seeing as I've liked her in a couple of movies, I wasn't to sure what I would think of her here, but she does do good here. Jennifer Coolidge who plays Paulette a friend of Elles is also funny here especially with the guy she's trying to get together with.  I also liked the small cute performance from Linda Cardelli, who played Chutney Widman, who played the daughter of a murdered man. (Obviously watch the movie to find out more about that.) If you like teen, comedy, movies then Legally Blonde for you. This is also quite a grown-up teen movie so adults will enjoy it too.

95,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: solid but uninspired drama,5,13 April 2002,"Legally Blonde is more a drama / comedy than a comedy. The movie isn't exactly bad, but nothing about it stands out. The plotting is generic and transparent and there isn't much at stake. For an action movie guy like me who likes it when stuff blows up, it was a little slow-paced.You might think, with the premise being a little original, that the film would be a little original too. Nope. The main problem with the film is that the humor comes from the protagonist's extreme of being dopey and self-involved with glamour. But to pull that off and to also have a glimmer of brilliance that makes the obvious and inevitable direction of the film ""work"" for the viewer was apparently beyond Reese Witherspoon.Thus, there's a romance, but it's given little screen time and didn't work for me. Also, the well-used ""finding yourself"" theme wasn't powerful.Who should see this film:-- law school students (but see ""The Paper Chase"" first)-- comedy movie lovers who know what they're getting into,but only on a rainy day with nothing better to do (but first, see power woman movies ""Fried Green Tomatoes"", ""Working Girl"", ""Nine to Five"")-- sorority sisters with hair in pigtails looking for a way outI reluctantly give ""Legally Blonde"" a same-old same-old 5 out of 10",Legally Blonde
96,ruby_fff,Reese Witherspoon goes Harvard - entertaining fun and laughter guaranteed,7,31 July 2001,"It's thoroughly enjoyable! Happy. Satisfying. Not to worry, it's not sugary all through. There are sprinkles of salt and pepper. Reese Witherspoon anchored the movie well. She is truly radiant. Glamorous. Talented. Lots of fun and heart. Her character Elle Woods is never malicious. She genuinely cares. It's not emotionally deep like ""Billy Elliot,"" but it has that common quality that easily brings a smile to your face, or simply makes you laugh out loud cheeringly. You want the central character to succeed.
I first remember a young Witherspoon in Robert Mulligan's ""The Man in the Moon"" 1991, she can really act at a tender age of 15; applauded her energetic delivery of the modern day little red riding hood in writer-director Matthew Bright's ""Freeway"" 1995, playing opposite a quite malevolent Kiefer Sutherland. She is absolutely a shining star in writer-director Alexander Payne's ""Election"" 1999, opposite a multifaceted Matthew Broderick. Seeing the glamorous side of her in writer-director Mary Harron's  ""American Psycho"" 1999 sure felt natural for Witherspoon to slip right into being Elle Woods in director Robert Luketic's ""Legally Blonde."" She is stunning to look at, alright, and continues to give an effortlessly fantastic performance. She is the backbone of the movie without whom ""Legally Blonde"" just might be too cliché and trite. Luke Wilson, who was in the somewhat quirky romantic comedy ""Home Fries"" 1998 opposite Drew Barrymore, provided a subtle supporting role to Witherspoon. Selma Blair, four years older, who was with Witherspoon and co. in writer-director Roger Kumble's ""Cruel Intentions"" 1998 (a modern day version of ""Dangerous Liaisons""), once again appeared with her in ""Legally Blonde."" Another film that also broke the cliché barrier in spite of its cuteness is ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"" 1997 with Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino as the impossible pair! The fun is watching the two brainy actors compliantly doing no-brainer stuff. If you want all encompassing entertaining fun, emotional depth, cutting taste of crazy violence (from Ray Liotta), high school reunion, blonde and brunette all at once (from Melanie Griffith), and somehow balancing all these elements against all odds (by Jeff Daniels), try Jonathan Demme's exceptional delivery of ""Something Wild"" 1986.",Legally Blonde
97,shark-43,"Witherspoon Shines, Script Withers!",4,13 August 2001,"I had heard such good things about this film, I guess I had high expectations. Witherspoon continues her great work with another fine, comedic performance (she is so much better in such a smarter, funnier film, ELECTION)and the premise of this film is strong and it starts out on the right track, but by the time ....SPOILER ALERT      SPOILER ALERT   SPOILER ALERT ....they introduce the court case she is going to intern on, the film tries to be too many things and it collapses under the weight of the ridiculous courtroom antics (""He's gay! Next!!!"" I mean - come on. Yeah, that would stand up in court. I guess the judge had never heard of the term bi-sexual) and then every single cliche is taken care of - her professor turns out to be a creep, she helps the poor trailer trash find love, she becomes friends with her rival and her ex-boyfriend is dumped and then Elle gets engaged. Plus, the fact that the film ended on that note - that she was GOING TO BE PROPOSED TO seems like the ultimate goal for a girl. But, wasnt the film moving along to show that there is more to life than getting married to someone just because everyone else is?? Here she learns to use her mind and her skills and to believe in herself and yet....it wouldnt be a victory without nabbing a fella!!! Sheesh. So, I ultimately was very disappointed in this film. The second half just seemed to have ""studio notes"" written all over it, which is a shame, because aside from Witherspoon, Holland Taylor, Garber and Selma Blair give good performances with what they are given to play. This film has been compared to CLUELESS and I just think CLUELESS is a much better comedy.",Legally Blonde
98,buiger,Fun to watch!,6,12 January 2010,"How refreshing! Finally a movie that is simply fun to watch! 'Legally Blonde' is an intelligent, witty, and well made motion picture. Oh, and to make things better, Reese Witherspoon is phenomenal in her role, this should have been worthy of an Oscar Nomination, if the Academy members weren't snobby about the type of roles they awarded the prize to (much like the snobs pictured in the movie I dare say...). Another department worthy of mention for an award in this movie is certainly the Costumes, since I believe they did their job flawlessly. Some of the outfits and accessories Ms Witherspoon wears are pure genius, not to mention the dog's outfits... This might seem trivial, but to do something so well with such attention to detail as they did in this film, is just as difficult as 'serious' costumes design (historical and similar which always win the Oscar).All in all, certainly not a great movie, but a good, well made film that is definitely fun to watch!",Legally Blonde
99,chrisbrown6453,Brunettes beware.,8,2 July 2002,"After you see Legally Blonde and fall in love with Elle Woods, and her cute wardrobe and her helpful interior motives, you might want to do exactly what this movie's tagline: ""This summer, go blonde!"" Blondes may unjustly be the center of countless ""dumb blonde jokes"" and California-Barbie-bimbo stereotypes. Even though this movie pokes fun at those generic clichés, however, its message is more real than those assumptions and beliefs.Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, a bubble and witty sorority sister originating from the sunny California. She fits in perfectly with her sisters, due to the fact it's perfectly clear that they all spend the same amount of time on their hair and nails as she does. But when it comes time for Elle to leave her girls and roots in pursuit to follow what she believes to be the love of her life all the way to Harvard Law School, one might think she would have to do some serious readjusting. But in actuality, Elle makes the transition a breeze. She wows the admissions committee at Harvard, thanks to her extremely clever admissions video where she lays in a pool in a sequined bikini and convinces them that she would make a perfect lawyer. And, to surprise everyone she knows, SHE GETS IN! This is where the only downfall of this movie comes in. Maybe this storyline might be a little predictable with plot twists that aren't so tricky, but in the context this fun and cute story, this works just fine. When she arrives at Harvard, Elle becomes the center of attention. Her pink pleather suit, Porsche convertible, spiky rhinestone heels and bouncy blonde hair don't exactly fit in with the argyle socks and sweater vests that the Harvard Law Students choose to sport. Unfortunately, these differences don't bring Elle the attention she wants. She learns that gaining the man of her dreams back will be more than she bargained for.The story provides Elle with an open mind and a warm heart. No matter what might get in her way, she puts that behind her and allows nothing to stop her. Reese really puts this character all together into someone who isn't artificial, a fake, or even a heartless person. She teaches women to be strong and follow what you believe. The audience can't help but love her and her little pooch, Bruiser, that she decks out in all the latest doggy attire. This girl really has it all. This movie is pure fun, and one could sense that these actors and actresses had a blast making it. With a cameo from Raquel Welch, Elle's big-man-on-campus jock of a boyfriend, and countless scenes in a nail salon, this movie also comes with a ball of laughs and an enlightened frame of mind. Even at this movie's premiere, the stars walked out onto a pink carpet and free manicures were provided for all. Whether you are looking for a date movie, or just something you can crack a few smiles at, go see this film. But beware of its deeper meaning and how long you keep that bleach in for!",Legally Blonde
100,bbewnylorac,A fun way to pass the time,7,26 May 2018,"Do not take this movie seriously. Legally Blonde is a kooky comedy that delivers what it says on the packet. Reese Witherspoon is fine as Elle Woods, an apparently airhead blonde who goes to law school to get back at her jock ex-boyfriend, who thinks she's brainless. Initially a laughing stock due to her ditzy dress and manner, Elle wins everyone over and gains self respect by studying hard and winning the trust of her socialite client in a murder case. A big plus for me is the fact that Jennifer Coolidge plays Elle's best friend - a beautician with a crush on the postman. Basically Coolidge is hilarious. Even when she grimaces she's funny. Like Luke Wilson, who plays Elle's love interest, Coolidge is an under-estimated actor. The movie's 'message' of not judging people (i.e. blondes) by their appearances is nice, but a little unconvincing, considering Elle seems to place high value on beauty and appearances, And that there are not many normal looking or non white people in the cast. But again, don't analyse Legally Blonde too deeply. It's a nice chick flick. Enjoy it during a relaxing night at home.",Legally Blonde
101,ethanbresnett,"Bit of a disappointment, but still fun",6,15 December 2020,"I'd heard lots of good things about Legally Blonde, and certain people seem to really love this movie. Perhaps they view it with rose (pink) tinted spectacles as it really isn't all that.I thought the story was a little weak and I wasn't that invested in it. It was also 100% predictable, which was not unexpected for a film of this ilk but still far from ideal.The characters were also a little insipid for my liking. Elle was actually quite a fun protagonist, and Reese Witherspoon was fantastic, but I thought the supporting cast and characters were all a little too cliche and bland.In terms of the humour, it didn't quite hit the spot for me, but was pretty funny in parts. Some of this could be down to the passage of time. I don't think certain elements of the film have aged too well in 20 years.Overall not a bad film by any stretch. Its fun, and does what it says on the tin really. Just don't expect it to set your world alight.",Legally Blonde
102,bsinc,Not very funny,5,28 February 2003,"The main problem with this movie is its banal and severely childish and stupid humor, filling a solid half of the movie.

But still, a comedy that doesn't know if it wants to be smart or just plain blonde.  5/10",Legally Blonde

I mean until Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) actually gets to Harvard the story is dull and uninteresting. I really would have switched off at this point.However, stick with it and some, I do say some, humour comes out. Not great belly laughs, but still funny nonetheless. It's a fun feel good movie, extremely contrived and very formulaic, and guess what, it works for those reasons.Still, it barely works.

104,TaylorYee94,Iconic,8,4 August 2020,"This film is such a joy. You can laugh, feel, and realize which is what movie should be all about. After 20 years, ""bend and snap"" is still talked about; Elle's pink outfit is archetype of protagonist in teen movies or rom-com movies; Bruise is the most famous chihuahua in the world.It seems to follow patterns of chick flick, but it breaks a few stereotypes along the way, making it fuller and more flavorful. Typical teen movie's protagonist is a cheerleader, a sorority girl, or popular/mean girl. Elle was a typical type, but when she was challenged, she shows her ""intelligence"" which, many directors forget, girls also have. She's independent and daring. I like how this film focuses on Elle's growth rather than toxic romance. Now I think about it, Elle also helps another woman, Paulette, stand up for herself from overpowering man. You can call this feminist movieLast but not least, Reese Witherspoon's portrait of Elle is perfection. I cannot imagine any other Elle. She is adorable but strong at the same time.

Unlike several rather unwatchable movies that went through similar success at the box office during that period, ""Legally Blonde"" is actually good. It tells the story of Elle Woods, the penultimate blonde sorority girl with everything going for her and her future fully mapped out, until her perfect frat guy boyfriend skips town for law school and another woman. What's a girl to do, but chase him down and give law school a crack? Thus sets off the humorous, satiric, heavily pink landscape of ""Legally Blonde"", a film that is as light and wispy as Reese Witherspoon's blonde locks, but has a genuine, winning, upbeat personality.",Legally Blonde
106,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Just made my Bottom 10,1,15 October 2019,"This is actually one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am shocked. An actual 1 out of 10 - how is this even possible?This came out when I was in high school, and since I was an angsty teen I had no interest in seeing it. Since then, I believe I have become quite a bit more open-minded, and over the years I have become a pretty colossal fan of Reese Witherspoon and the majority of her filmography. So, after having this praised by a few adult friends in the last couple of years, I thought I would give it a watch.How did this get greenlit? It features some of the most atrocious writing I have ever encountered. Not a single line or sequence that is legitimately humorous (aside from one shot of a chihuahua all set up in a salon chair). All jokes either fall flat or are full cringe - some actually don't even make sense. There is hardly any real conflict, at least none that follow logic (and this is no surreal film). The characters are like parodies of characters that don't function well even as parodies, all either depthless or going overboard with the camp, like someone trying to make camp but not understanding what makes good camp work. Even the directing is means for continuous eye rolls - like a 13 year old wanted to make a ripoff of Clueless/Heathers/Jawbreaker but only took the cheesiest elements of each and then twisted them to make them bad. It's a very hard movie to get through - I had to fight with myself not to turn it off. The dialogue is so asinine it makes your brain want to shut down. The point of the movie is supposed to be showing that a spoiled blonde perceived as dumb can actually excel just as legitimately as anyone, yet she only gets accepted into Harvard Law because she is wearing a bikini in her audition tape and a bunch of horny old men decide they want her there, suggestively for that reason. As the movie continues, it attempts to portray the idea that she is ""getting smarter"" as teachers slowly become more ""impressed"" with her ""offerings"" during debates in class, yet the actual dialogue and writing shows little to no signs of her actually getting smarter. A majority of her passing statements would never, ever fly in almost any form of school.What a painful, painful film. Though it doesn't actually taint her credibility, this movie is the only true stain in the legendary Reese Witherspoon's legacy. I mean, why would you watch this when you could watch Election?

110,bix171,Mediocre,6,25 May 2002,"A sub par script by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (based on a book by Amanda Brown) sabotages Reese Witherspoon's star-making turn as a valley girl who heads to Harvard Law School in pursuit of the upper-class snob who has dumped her but ends up spearheading the defense in a high-profile murder case. It's a cross between `Clueless' and `My Cousin Vinny' but there aren't enough solid laughs to live up to those pedigrees and outside of Witherspoon's lovable blonde-with-a-brain (which owes a great debt, of course, to Alicia Silverstone; it'll be interesting to see whether Witherspoon can avoid Silverstone's subsequent career missteps), the other characters are stock Hollywood caricatures. Everything's predictable, including its smug undertone: although it advocates feminist empowerment, it still gets its greatest satisfaction lampooning lesbians and frigid Ivy League coeds and is only ready to conclude when our heroine gets Mr. Right.

Yes, you can say the set up is daft, the plot is daft, the characters are unbelievable, but unlike the absolute rubbish of 'Avatar' which has the same problems, eg unobtainium anybody?, it is funny and does what it sets out to be - a good, but not taking itself too seriously, movie. Reese Witherspoon excelled herself here and deservedly went into the 'A' list of Hollywood actresses, because she can act outrageously but convinces because it looks natural - unlike a certain Ms Streep who you can see acting and twitching like a ripe old piece of Virginia Ham. The supports are quite prepared to play things straight, and get their own share of laughs, eg the two girl friends who turn up in court and think it just like live TV, and respond accordingly. And the clever, if daffy, Elle Woods is a brilliant creation - naive yet capable of working hard at being intelligent. So why does this character annoy particularly women? The film works with stereotypes, eg dumb blondes, and plays both for and off them - lighten up, brain boxes, or go and watch something serious like 'Sex and The City' (it'll feed your fantasies of being taken seriously!).

I haven't watched this one in about three years, and I wondered if there would ever come the day I would want to watch it again, but the day came! I was amazed again by how good this movie actually was - this is for sure a superior chick flick. Reese is perfectly cast as fluffy Elle who is as bright as she is ditzy. You can not help but like her and darned if I didn't find the ending moving! A great message to this movie about strength and using your brain and there is more to life than men (especially one who doesn't deserve you!). There is still a romantic side to this, Elle does meet a nice guy by the end and Warner gets the boot for once and for all from both the ladies in his life! Added to this, I loved Reese's hair all through this and all the clothes!

As my other reviews will show, I do have a bit of a thing for Ms W. - and Selma Blair - partly because I know any movie with which they're involved will be worthy viewing. They have very different qualities and this is exploited to the full in their on-screen rivalry.Once again the teen movie scores a hit, and once again the supporting cast excels - not a poor performance in sight. Although fairly superficial the plot hangs together well, and benefits from some beautifully crafted characters.

That's the mindset you have to have when watching Legally Blonde, the movie that Reese Witherspoon managed to get a Golden Globe nomination out of. No kidding here. It's really an adorable movie that is appropriate for any age....a very light PG-13.Elle Woods (2006 Oscar Winner Reese Witherspoon) has it all....the perfect boyfriend, Warner, who is handsome, charming, and driven, the perfect life, awesome friends, and a really cute dog. But all of this seems minuscule to the fact that her boyfriend has just dumped her because she is not serious enough, and he wants a girl that is well received by the public when he begins his political career. So, Warner enrolls at Harvard University, leaving Elle (it sounds like the letter 'L') disheveled and sad. Then, 'going where no blonde has gone before' (good use of tagline, right?), Elle decides to work extra hard to enroll at Harvard to win her man back. Well, Elle (funny rhyming there) achieves the requirements in tests and community service, and sends in a very interesting video essay, and gains entrance to the prestigious university. She quickly finds out that not only is her dream man already engaged to another woman (Selma Blair), but Elle is not widely liked around campus. She finds her calling in law, and with the guidance of a friend (the likable and funny Luke Wilson), proves to be a talented prospect in the field.The film is a very watchable film from start to finish, as the movie's opening theme song (Hoku's hit song ""Perfect Day"") is catchy and likable. Reese Witherspoon's performance is so great and hilarious, yet so true to herself as a person. She shines like the sun in this movie. It can be a little silly at times, not to mention a tad unrealistic and dragging, but Witherspoon's ability overshadows those unfortunate facts. The supporting cast is also good, with Selma Blair and Luke Wilson leading the bunch. Also in there is 'Waiting...' star Alanna Ubach, Matthew Davis, Jennifer Coolidge (NBC's 'Joey'), Ali Larter, Victor Garber as Elle's law professor, and 'Scooby-Doo' star Linda Cardellini.This is the ultimate 'girl power' movie that every person without a Y chromosome will love. Not all men will like it, but I enjoy it whenever it's on television. It's not something I'd buy, but one that is a great rent for the whole family.

But I gave it a second chance on video and I enjoyed it. Its not a great film but it is an entertaining one. For the most part, the film is not annoying, like it could have been. Reese Witherspoon is perfect as this character, she does a good job on making Elle likable and not annoying like many other actresses probably would have. Selma Blair is okay, so is Ali Larter. Luke Wilson is fine here. Most of the cast pales compared to Reese's performance but they all do mostly ok jobs. The one problem I saw with Legally Blonde is that although it has humor in it, there were a couple of instances where I saw it was trying to hard to be even more funnier. For instance, when Elles come into court and say that stupid line about the judge. That scene was trying to add humor but it didnt, it came off as really stupid. In fact, they really didnt need to have Elle's friends come into the courtroom at all (they were the most annoying of all the characters). However, the script mostly avoided really stupid lines, it wasnt great writing but it was fine. I will see the sequel but I dont really think it necessarily needed a sequel. Its the same way I feel about the Fast and the Furious it doesnt really demand a sequel. But I will see the sequel and see what I think about it.",Legally Blonde
125,TuckMN,"""Do you suppose she woke up one morning and decided 'I'm going to Harvard Law School.'?""",8,31 July 2001,"This was a totally fun, escapist, summer movie.  Reese Witherspoon has great comedic timing and with a good script, first-class supporting actors and a truly fine soundtrack you have a film that, while not a classic, is well worth your time and money to see.This is wholly Reese's movie  she is in every scene and the entire story and plot revolve around her and her quest for what she believes is true love.She takes the dumb blonde' role that so many Hollywood greats  Jean Harlow, Jayne Mansfield, Judy Holiday and Marilyn Monroe among them  did so well.  Of course, it remains to be seen if Ms Witherspoon has the staying quality of those other blonde icons  but she seems to be well on her way to that status.The supporting characters are all terrific.  Especially Jennifer Coolidge as Paulette Bonafonte  Elle Wood's (Reese Witherspoon) manicurist -- and does wonders with what could be a one-note character  but Ms Coolidge was equally great as Stiffler's mom in `American Pie.'  Another outstanding character was Holland Taylor as Professor Stromwell.  Ms Taylor has a certain regal quality about her that makes her all the more appealing in a light comedy.The soundtrack was good from the opening credits  It was always appropriate to the scene and, at times, even elicited a few chuckles for the songs that were played.The plot to `Legally Blonde' is simple:  Girl loses boy, girl goes in search of boy to make him her own  However, the outcome, while ultimately predictable, is not exactly as formulaic as it could have been and has some good messages about who we all are and that how we think of ourselves ultimately determines our role in the time and space we occupy.",Legally Blonde
126,jace_the_film_guy,More than a Brainless Rom-Com,8,14 September 2021,"On the surface, Legally Blonde looks like the shallow film that pretty people make to overcome their own insecurities regarding their intelligence. Fortunately, this film is anything but shallow and truly has a great message about wrongfully judging a book by its cover.Reese Witherspoon fully embodies the character of Elle Woods as she traverses the overwhelmingly world of Harvard Law School. Her development is clear as she learns the value of dedication and how to love herself rather than fight for the affections of the self-interested.My only complaint of this film (other than some of the cheesy and predictable quips) was the end title character explanations. I do not think that any film should have text explaining what happened to the characters unless it is based on a true story. I do not care to be told that Elle and Vivian are now best friends or that Emmett is going to propose ""tonight"". I want to see it! Adding 10 minutes onto the 1 hr. 36 min. Runtime will not break the bank. If anything, it will add proper closure rather than be told what happened to these characters you have become invested in.Regardless of my final frustrations, Legally Blonde is more than a brainless Rom-Com. It is a charming and enjoyable adventure into the world of Elle Woods.",Legally Blonde

131,senortuffy,A very funny movie.,8,27 November 2003,"This was one of the best comedy films I've seen in a couple of years.  The story line is one that's been done before, but the way it's handled by an excellent cast and film editor makes it a very entertaining movie.Reese Witherspoon plays a blond sorority girl in Los Angeles who decides to go to Harvard Law School in order to win her rich boyfriend back.  Her valley girl persona clashes immediately with the snobbish law school culture, but through intelligence and a good attitude, she wins everyone over, and dumps her jerk boyfriend in the process.Reese Witherspoon is terrific in the lead role.  She's really from the South, but she affects the L.A. character perfectly.  She's both funny and touching, and when she needs to project intellect, she does so naturally and makes the transformation during the film believable.  You definitely find yourself rooting for her.The editing is very tight and there are few wasted moments in this hour and a half film.  There are also a few side stories, like the manicurist's romance with the UPS guy and the relationships between Reese's fellow students and law professors that add to the depth of the film so that it's not too linear.  A sign of a good comedy is when the secondary characters are funny also.Easy to see why this was so popular in the theaters a few summers ago.",Legally Blonde

134,rmirchandani,"""The law is reason, free from passion.""",9,3 October 2021,"Legally Blonde benefits from its early 2000s aesthetic, clever script, vibrant costumes, a great supporting cast, and a talented lead actress that can pull off literally anything. Reese Witherspoon is frankly the only actress that can portray Elle Woods. She brought her character to life with love, care, and passion. I hardly can imagine any other actress portraying this iconic character. Before Reese Witherspoon, Luke Wilson, Victor Garber, Holland Taylor, Jennifer Coolidge, and Selma Blair expanded their acting filmography, they starred in a now iconic chick flick that changed their careers for the better. Victor Garber, Holland Taylor and Jennifer Coolidge were A-List actors at the time. Reese Witherspoon, Luke Wilson, and Selma Blair were in the early stages of their careers.After her boyfriend broke up with her, Elle Woods decides to win him back by enrolling at Harvard Law School. Little did she know that her decision led to a string of unexpected events. As a viewer, you may have a clear picture of who Elle Woods is, but she turns into quite a multifaceted character.Elle Wood's dog Bruiser played by Moonie is such an underrated and underappreciated character. Bruiser really did get limited screen time in this movie.Since Elle first set foot at Harvard, she has been discriminated against. Reese Witherspoon manages to not portray a stereotypical sorority girl, rather a genuine, honest, and cute girl with a big heart.After watching the film, I went to the trivia page on IMDB and found out that Luke Wilson is the younger brother of Owen Wilson. This was quite mind blowing to me. I thought that they were not related yet had the same surname. I was first introduced to Luke Wilson on DC 's Stargirl where he portrays Pat Dugan aka S. T. R. I. P. E.The film manages to stay fresh and authentic even after 20 years. It is an iconic piece of cinema that should be kept for generations. Legally Blonde compels the audience to never lose faith and to not judge a book by its cover. For instance, the character Vivian is introduced as the unlikeable fiancée of Elle's ex-boyfriend who immediately detests Elle. Throughout the film, Vivian becomes a sympathetic character who befriends Elle and dumps Warner.To conclude, the 2001 film ""Legally Blonde"" is a pleasant surprise that further proves Reese Witherspoon's acting versatility. It entertained me from start to finish. The ending put a huge grin on my face. Legally Blonde is a feel-good movie that does not take itself too seriously. I expected a cheesy and formulaic romantic comedy but received a film with lots of heart and humour. A definite must-watch for literally everyone.Final verdict: 9.5/10Memorable Quotes:""You know what competition is really about. Don't you?

138,clydestuff,A Blonde of a different color,9,9 February 2004,"In general, Hollywood comedies have not been kind to blondes.  Often their appearance in a film is for the purpose of throwing in a few dumb blonde jokes.   When a blonde female is given the lead, they often overcome whatever obstacles the plot devices may put in their path in spite of their seeming lack of intelligence.  An actress such as Marilyn Monroe, made playing the dumb blond a true comedic art form in films such as Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Monkey Business, The Seven Year Itch and Some Like It Hot. She was also able to go beyond those roles and stretch her dramatic legs at times, though it was a struggle for studios to her in that regard.  Some actresses are never that fortunate.In the character of Elle Woods, Reese Witherspoon gives us a new kind of blonde.  She is every bit the pampered rich girl, can recite chapter and verse on fashion, makeup and hair styling, and.....she wants to go to Harvard.  Elle fully expects her longtime boyfriend, Warner Huntington III(Matthew Davis)to propose just before he goes off to Harvard Law school. Being from a strait-laced New England family however, marriage to Elle is out of the question.  As Warner puts it, ""If I want to be elected Senator by the time I'm 30, I need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn.""  So instead of a proposal, Elle gets the big kiss off. Undaunted, and believing that getting into Harvard is the key to Warner's heart, Elle decides to follow a new career path and it's off to Harvard Law School.Some of this is your basic fish out of water story.  Elle Woods is not what one would expect to find walking the halls of Harvard or any other law school for that matter.  She dresses in blazing pink, dresses her always by her side chihuahua Bruiser in pink, and takes her belongings with her in a moving van.  Indeed for someone whose previous big problem was what kind of toilet paper was being used in the college restrooms(the kind that chafes or Charmin), Harvard is a whole new world.Legally Blonde also gives us a lesson in not judging a book by it's cover. Yes, Elle may be a naive socialite, who may have had no aspirations beyond marrying Warner and making sure her outfits are color coordinated, but she is certainly not dumb.  It is obviously that what Elle had previously desired in life was influenced in large part by her socialite upbringing. Trying to make an audience care about a spoiled rich blonde is not an easy task, but thanks to Witherspoon's performance, a clever and funny screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, and skillful direction by Robert Luketic, we not only like and care about Elle, we root for her throughout. It was important that since Elle is being constantly misjudged by her peers, that the character would be just the opposite, sympathetic and understanding.  Nothing could be more important than a film where the main theme is judging people for who they are, and not what others think they are. As Vivian Kensington, Warner's new fiancee, Selma Blair gives a good performance as the woman whom we, along with Elle, are ""supposed"" to hate. Because of Blair's ability to give the character some depth, and the crafty screenplay, Elle along with us, learn there is always something more to a person than meets the eye.  As for Matthew Davis's Warner, there is never any mistake about his true intentions.  Also on hand is Jennifer Coolidge, as the ditsy hairdresser Paulette that Elle confides in, and Paulette does likewise.  The role is memorable enough that Coolidge was brought back for Legally Blond II.  Victor Garber plays law professor Callahan, an overbearing ""I Can Do No Wrong"" type.  Luke Wilson as Emmett Richmond gives Elle some sympathetic advise, and believes in Elle when others don't.  In truth, the entire cast of this film is running on all cylinders to make it work, and it all runs as smooth as a shiny pink Rolls Royce.There have been many formulaic comedies that I may have had a few good laughs while viewing.  A week later, I'd be hard pressed to remember the title let alone what the film was about.  Legally Blonde may be a situation comedy also, but in giving us a memorable story, wonderful well defined characters, and a sharp witty script, we'll remember it for a long time. For that you get my grade which is an  A.",Legally Blonde

Unless she is the Einstein who's been hanging out with the wrong crowd, it might be the case in the 1940's, but hardly nowdays. Even so, the acceptance to Harvard was still far fetched, and we never really see her transform to a serious genius.  The court case was just more of applying her knowledge from her ditzy undergraduate days.  But Witherspoon seem to have enough to most of it off.

145,heyimmyx,Immy's review : Absolute classic,8,25 August 2020,"A sweet and heartfelt movie about a young woman who decides to go to Harvard law school to win back the love of her life. I love this movie for showing women in a ferociously strong light, portraying a subtle message that the 'pretty' or 'girly' girls can be intelligent too, and that they are worth much more than their looks. Legally blonde is a light hearted but charming affair as we follow Elle Woods attempt to navigate the terrifying world of law and studying, all with a motive to win back the man who previously dumped her, however through time she learns that her intelligence and feelings of achievement is worth way more than any guy. I like how the film doesn't have a strong romantic focus, as it's apparent that the story is all focused on Elle and her eventual realisation that she doesn't need to rely on a man but only herself ; She comes to know her true self worth. Due to this, the movie feels refreshing and unique to other chick flicks that usually take a more romantic route, as here we actually focus on a woman's success in her career. The movie is extremely girl-power driven, but told in a non patronising or lecturing way, which is what makes it work so well. Reese Witherspoon gave a terrific performance as the vibrant and loveable Elle Woods ; Her character was flawless from start to finish, and she never brought a dull moment on screen. Her character is extremely well written and developed, as although she acts as a dumb blonde and is high maintenance, she proves to those around her that she's actually very capable of being intellectual, and more of a successful lawyer than they could ever be. Her character was extremely likeable due to her kindness and sincerity, as she was never mean to those around her, only they were to her. Her drive and willpower to prove to everyone who didn't believe in her that she could succeed was heartwarming, and made her presence very powerful for those who feel the same in life. The film breaks boundaries by defying the cliches and showing that woman are worth more than their bodies or looks. Overall, a funny yet heartfelt film about self worth and proving to people what you are really capable of, told in a lighthearted and charming manner. Highly recommend!",Legally Blonde
146,Captain Ed,Overrated,5,2 March 2002,"This movie had promise at the beginning but rapidly dissipates as it moves into the second half.  The problem with the movie is that the characters stop acting and reacting in any manner that suggests reality, with the possible exception of the slimy defense attorney.Reese Witherspoon has maintained her record for poor choices with this weak script, and the supporting cast fails abysmally to deliver.  Luke Wilson seems earnest enough but winds up being an expensive cheerleader. Otherwise, everyone else is eminently forgettable.** SPOILERS **In the beginning, the movie reverses the tropes of the outsider movie; the person who you'd think would be the popular one instead becomes the object of derision, and you feel for Elle as she realizes that she's the school joke.  However, instead of following this to more interesting insights (which is possible to do even in a broad comedy), we get a very lame courtroom drama that recalls the stupidity at the end of Big Daddy.  At the end of the film, you could retitle it to Everyone Loves Elle, and even the where-are-they-now screen crawls leave you with the fact that Luke's gonna propose.  IS THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE MOVIE??  Gee, what a rush, after 90 minutes of sisters doin' it on their own!!Watch the first half of the movie if you must, but turn it off about the time Elle realizes that the defendant is a sorority sister.  It's all downhill from there, sisters and brothers alike.",Legally Blonde

Reese Witherspoon deliver a catchy performance here, and so with the plot and film's construction.

149,n-mo,Fun and fluff make up for thinness of verisimilitude,6,12 October 2018,"A cardinal rule for ""chick flicks"" is that you have to be willing to suspend a quantifiable amount of disbelief. At their best, they simply embrace the impossible: the makers of 'Clueless' reveled in the absurdity of the prissy fantasy life (it helped that it was based on a true literary classic); with 'Charlie's Angels,' you just have a gender-bending sort of James Bond (appealing to women for the ""power chick"" aspect and to men for... well, let's face it: mostly pornographic reasons). 'Legally Blonde' isn't quite that self-aware, but it takes itself a heck of a lot less seriously than 'Pretty Woman' or (shudder) anything Richard Curtis ever turned out.As a ""fish out of water"" story, the film falls flat in that it embellishes, exaggerates and ultimately vindicates the sorority valley girl, Reese Witherspoon as Elle Woods, while failing to do so for the Ivy League context in which she is immersed. Harvard is portrayed as a studious, slightly snobby yet ultimately human and sympathetic place: such a portrayal lacks in any real dramatic tension or satirical embellishment, and any lucid sentient being who's attempted anything resembling peer interaction with Harvard alumni who is not himself a Harvard alumnus knows it's hogwash. That the filmmakers don't, betrays the fact that this sort of context and ultimately, sad to say, this story is really above their heads. Harvard as a truly rough, nasty, unforgiving den of status-whoring and social climbing would have offered a much more entertaining contrast and array of options for Elle to bounce off of.Fortunately, the movie is saved by Witherspoon herself. She's as sexy as ever here and very likable, strutting along confident that all is or can be made well with the universe (and never gets down for more than a very brief period, and quite easy to pick back up), surprisingly believable as an untapped genius with both the talent and the motivation to prove just that. Without a vengeful bone in her body, just by being her natural self Elle brilliantly sends up petty naysayers (especially her goober ex-boyfriend) every step of the way. But ultimately the watered down, sugar-sweetened environs of her Ivy League law school don't amount to much of a challenge against which to prove her worth.If you're short on ideas for movies for the night and you happen across this one, go ahead. Just don't expect anything deeper or more clever than the standard high-grossing comedies of the 90s and early 00s. Elle's adventure is entertaining enough, but all said and done it's just not that adventurous.",Legally Blonde

The acting is good, highlighted by Witherspoon's and Wilson's performances, but falters at times, mostly due to odd dialogue and on and off writing.

The worst aspect is the gay stereotyping at a climactic point, and any lawyer should be cringing after about 45 minutes due to the accumulated absurdities and wildly improbable, if not utterly impossible, plot twists.I will say this - you may enjoy it if you are looking for mindless escapism. Imagine yourself one day suddenly awakening and chirping, ""Hey, if I become <fill in the blank> I'll really show them all!""  Then, presumably, you could go out there (without undergoing anything onerous and un-hip like, you know, preparation or planning) and, you know, like, Just Do It.  The film tries to make a statement about the Ultimate Power inside females/teens/what-have-you, as if to say they are sleeping giants who will ROAR when finally motivated.  Well, why should talented people need some outside force to motivate them?  What is missing in their lives in the first place?  The theme insidiously suggests that hard work and such is irrelevant - all that really matters is innate aptitude and karmic destiny and the trigger that sets it off, as if every human profession were on a par with modeling.Whoa, stick with the program, dude.  Don't worry, this film never addresses anything serious like that.  Instead, it's just fantasy fulfillment for the acne set.Aside from everything else, the plot is convoluted to no purpose (real sexual harassment is just sort of thrown in for effect, like an extra toy in the pinata, just to make one particular character look evil as well as stupid), there is a truly grating musical number that pops up out of nowhere in the middle, and the females (including Witherspoon, even in the bikini) are not particularly sexy.  Sorry, fellas.  They are overly made up and fussy, which I, at least, found unattractive.  The movie relentlessly stereotypes and labels whatever it can.  If the intent was to undermine those types of attitudes (which I doubt), it fails miserably.On the positive side, there are colorful visuals and a few chuckles in the first half of the film (before the law school and courtroom scenes, with their dark tones and semi-serious attitude, send the film into the toilet) and occasional, very faint, stylistic echoes of better films like ""Clueless.""  I recommend that you rent that one if you want a fluffy ""hip"" comedy about vivacious young women.Beware the hype, this movie stinks.  Don't waste you money.  One out of ten.",Legally Blonde

155,eschetic,Amusing fluff for little girls who still need empowerment,7,4 April 2007,"Since nearly ALL movies are made to make money, there's certainly nothing wrong with the film makers here taking the single funniest scene in a successful comedy (MY COUSIN VINNY - where the oddball girlfriend knows something which the ""smart"" lawyer boyfriend doesn't and solves the case) and building an entire film around it. The conceit probably wasn't even original with MY COUSIN VINNY, and it certainly isn't in LEGALLY BLONDE, a sexist farce pretending to be ""enlightened,"" but more or less saved by a passel of above average performances from a very appealing cast.Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon in a less brilliant but just as surface starring follow-up to her break-through appearance in ELECTION) is an air-head Valley Girl waiting for the expected proposal from her preppie boyfriend (the appropriately smarmy Matthew Davis) when he announces that he's going to Harvard Law enroute to the U.S. Senate, and while she's been a great college lay - excuse me, girlfriend - she isn't good enough for a prospective senator's wife. Well, um, yeah . . . but it is sort of changing the rules Elle had been led to expect mid-game.This sort of plot can go one of two ways - Elle can go for revenge (the funny but nasty SHE-DEVIL or DEATH BECOMES HER) or she can set out to get him back - and frequently find someone better in the effort (the vastly underrated ADDICTED TO LOVE). LEGALLY BLONDE tries to have it both ways. She'll get herself into Harvard (the best line in the film: ""What? Like it's hard?"") and SHOW him how ""good enough"" she really is.Predictable, shallow but frequently funny complications ensue - along with some very nice performances from Luke Wilson (as a low-key associate attorney) and Holland Taylor (as a professor/mentor) and less impressive ones from Victor Garber (as a dour ""powerful"" attorney), Jennifer Coolidge (as a class-free beauty shop friend) and a mildly irritating chihuahua (as an irritating chihuahua). The funniest bit, exposing a lying witness (remember the bit from MY COUSIN VINNY?) also comes across unfortunately as homophobic - though it probably wasn't intended as such. The film makers simply didn't know any better than to pander to what they assumed were the continuing biases of their target teenage audience. The film would have been funnier if they had respected their audience more.As it was, it was successful enough at the box office (very, actually) to generate a sequel (yawn) and in 2007, a Broadway musical comedy version. The script and score for the musical were sort of second rate (rather like the musical version of THE WEDDING SINGER and the silly movie which spawned it), but a first rate director/choreographer was able to work much the same alchemy on LEGALLY BLONDE The Musical that Robert Luketic was able to work on LEGALLY BLONDE The Movie and turn so-so material and an ""all right"" cast into something resembling gold. A good time was had by - well, if not all, enough.Don't expect great art or even great comedy, but the movie's a nice diversion for a slow day or for little girls who need empowerment (the musical too).",Legally Blonde

They got ""we are here to make a quick buck"" labels all over them. But upon seeing the the premise of this movie, I thought the potential is there - in Tinseltown, being a blonde female who also happens to be smart means a lotta power (and admirers) and it seeks to destroy the myth that all good-looking people have no brains. Interesting, I thought - the chance for social commentary is vast, as well as its entertainment value. So I went in to see it.At first, I enjoyed it and laughed a few times. On a side note, Reese Witherspoon is one of those rare actresses who always manage to deliver intelligent performances (see Election, where she really shines). There's a spark that makes her good to watch.But alas, after a reasonably good start and several funny moments (the ""Bend down ... and snap!"" routine is particularly amusing), the movie plunges headlong into your typical movie.

The screenplay was one giant cliche and I easily guessed everything that was going to happen, even the alibi of Ali Larter's character.  The outcome is not surprising.

That is, you can predict the jokes and plot twists well before they actually happen.  And I found Reese Witherspoon's one-note perky performance annoying most of the time.      There are plenty of obvious sight gags involving Reese's cute  little dog dressed up in various outfits. The director might as well have had a 5 minute slide show at the film's beginning to get all of that out of the way.    Only a couple scenes made me laugh.  I liked the two sexual innuendo lines the UPS man had, I chuckled when the students sat on the lawn and introduced themselves on the first day of school, and the sketch artist in the courtroom made some funny drawings. I also laughed when the brunette sadly realized that she had misjudged Reese's relationship with the lawyer. Trying to make this movie the least bit heart-wrenching seemed hilariously absurd at that point.

174,FunnyMann,Funny and harmless,7,29 July 2001,"OK, so ""Legally Blonde"" isn't the type of movie that sparks deep thinking or meaningful conversation. It won't be hailed years from now as a cinematic masterpiece. In fact, you'll probably forget most of it the instant you leave the theater. You will, however, be surprised how well this funny little throwaway film works.Everyone involved with ""Legally Blonde"" knew they were creating a pleasant snack, enjoyed briefly and then forgotten. And on those terms, the film succeeds beyond all reasonable expectations. A silly, predictable plot and zero character development don't diminish its entertainment value one iota.
Reese Witherspoon does a particularly good job as Elle Woods, the manicure-loving, Chihuahua-toting, pink-is-my-life sorority chick who battles all the standard obstacles thrown into a film like this. She's not Ellen Burstyn in ""Requiem For a Dream,"" but she snugly and charmingly inhabits a role other actresses might have beaten to death in a flurry of scenery-chewing cliches. Witherspoon knows when to squeeze a joke for more laughs and when to get out of the way.

She was in the pool asking daddy like a little poddle would.  Look at her posture at that moment.Then the part when she walks by with the computer and the others stare at her.  Notice how everybody has a Starbucks grand size cup of coffee in their hands.When you first watch the movie you do not notice those details.

Instead, I found myself joining the ranks of Reese Witherspoon fans, marveling at the way she could take such weathered humor and make it something fresh. It was as though she were saying to us, ""Look, at this bit of nonsense, and let's have some fun, and make a couple of important statements at the same time."" And fun we had. Actress and audience alike can appreciate that Legally Blond isn't going to win any awards, but Ms. Witherspoon and company work effortlessly to keep this film from becoming a haven for moronic one-liners and stupid sight gags. Legally Blonde tells the story of Elle Woods, a Silicon Valley Girl and Sorority Queen who's twin goals in life consist of getting her man while looking FC (fashionably correct). Early in the movie, we get a glimpse of just how smart our blonde sister is, when a smug saleswoman attempts to sell her a shoddy knockoff at full price. This is not a movie about a girl has guy, girl loses guy, and then girl wins him back at the final curtain. Instead, Blonde becomes a journey of a young woman who grows into a three-dimensional diva by exploring an unlikely career option in a foreign setting. Our West Coast fashion maven heads east to win back her man by proving she can be smart enough to get a law degree (well, long enough to get him to say ""I do""). West meets east with unpredictable results. In the course of about 90 minutes, our heroine manages to realize her ex-boyfriend is a joke, earn an internship, win a court case, and become valedictorian of her graduating class. Along the way, she also inspires one working-class friend to become more assertive, demonstrates her compassionate nature by accepting a former rival as a sister in spirit, and exposes a male professor as a pathetic letch. And while the circumstances that Ms. Woods finds herself are a bit of a stretch, the enthusiasm and energy flow effortlessly towards a happy ending (with Luke Wilson) and its predictable sequel (Red, White, and Blonde).",Legally Blonde

Reese Witherspoon gives a star making performance if I've ever seen one.  I have the feeling we will be buying this one, since it's worth seeing again.

Indeed throughout she shows that it is possible to be whoever she wants in a world that takes everything at face value. Tripping up on the way is just part of the enjoyment value of this film and not an excuse to believe the character is stupid beyond belief.Many people who have thought this movie rubbish have appeared to fall into the very trap that Reese Witherspoon's character is trying to escape from i.e. that being blonde doesn't mean being dumb.On this level the film works very well and can indeed be compared very favorably with films such as Election and Clueless.

And things are going to get even better! He's going to propose to Elle! Or at least that's what she thinks. But things go horribly wrong at dinner when instead of asking for her hand in marriage, he dumps her. In his mind, for his time at Harvard Law School to be successful he can't have such an unserious girlfriend, he needs a much more sophisticated and conventional girl. But Elle is heartbroken, for she is in love. But what's a girl to do? Duh! Isn't it obvious! Just improve your grades insanely high almost overnight, get into Harvard yourself and show him you're the smart girl you know you are. Like totally cool!This is such a boring, unfunny, hypocritical, lame and unintelligent movie.I'm not sure if it's because the last movie I watched before this was Spike Lee's legendary `Do The Right Thing', but I found this movie to be terribly white. I just got so sick and tired of seeing so many white people in this movie. (And I'd like to point out that I am white.) There are very few black or ethnic people in the film, with just three customers in a beauty salon (one completely in the background), an Asian woman in another beauty parlour and a judge only coming to mind. And the scene that includes the Asian woman turns disgusting as the subtitles say she swears. I found this terribly offensive and quite distasteful. Are there actually people out there that would find this drivel funny?In one rather poorly constructed and pointless scene, a rather average looking guy asks a girl out on a date. She flatly refuses and call's him a loser. Upon overhearing this, Elle wants to help. So she pretends she spent a night with him filled with red-hot passion. The girl that called him a loser is now impressed and wants to go out with him. Yay for Elle for saving the day! Does anyone else see the immorality shown in this scene? The disgusting lack of ethics displayed in this atrocious scene pretty much sums up the movie. It is well meaning and wants to make a difference but is severely unintelligent in the way it goes about achieving its goals.And how are we to believe that Elle truly has intelligence? In my mind anyone that actually believes someone that despises them has just genuinely invited them to a party is not only stupid but also profusely naïve.The character of Vivian (played by the excellent Selma Blair, who struggles with the pathetic material she gets here) is ludicrously 'written'.***SPOILER***Vivian's turn around is just incredible. It was at this point that the film really lost me.*** END OF SPOILER ***The character of Paulette, who becomes a sort of confidant and shoulder to cry on for Elle, is one of the worst characters. Her character should have been limited to her first scene or completely cut. Words like arduous, pointless and inane spring to mind when thinking about Paulette. And the 'bend and snap' scene is one of the most truly horrendous moments ever captured on film. I felt like I wanted to be sick. It is the stuff nightmares are made of.Reese Witherspoon is a great actress and here she comes off quite well. Though I never felt sorry for Elle, and in the end I didn't care about her at all. With some better writing this could have been the `Election' of law. Certainly, it's the writing and direction that makes the film a disaster, not the acting.Elle's boyfriend, Warner Huntington III, at least adds something to the movie with one of the most truly funny lines in the film, `If I want to be elected Senator by the time I'm 30, I need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn.'Luke Wilson is as wonderful as ever. But it's a shame he isn't in the film more as it's a case of blink and you'll miss him. And the same goes for the unbelievably talented and beautiful Holland Taylor (who plays a judge in The Practice). But she is in so little of the film it's very disappointing. And her last scene is awful; I felt sorry for her having to deliver such dire lines.The film is very hypocritical. One of the main themes is 'don't judge someone's intellect by what they look like'. But the film goes back on its own words, when, shock, horror; Elle begins to show signs of intellect. Her wardrobe, even though still colourful, becomes much more conservative. And becomes more and more conformist as the film continues.
*** SLIGHT SPOILER ***And the film's lasting message is cruel, deluded and just plain moronic. Good people end up with good lives and bad people end up alone and with bad lives. How could anyone find that uplifting and inspirational when a message like that is totally fraudulent and fanciful?***END OF SLIGHT SPOILER***I love anything to do with court cases. The Practice is one of my favourite television shows, and I even loved Ally McBeal. But the court case in this movie is so boring and insanely predictable. It felt like a rejected script from Ally McBeal. The woman, who they are defending in a murder case, is very dislikeable and ugly.I understand the movie is not meant to be serious or realistic; I didn't watch it thinking it was going to be a hard-hitting drama. But if a film is meant to be light and fluffy it should at least be entertaining and funny. But this movie is just one boring and arduous scene after another. If you want to see a simular film (in style, not story), try the much superior 'Never Been Kissed'.'Legally Blonde' is laborious and unintelligent garbage.

I actually liked it and was surprised to find myself enjoying it. The jokes all worked and the story was decent.  The only part that had me cringing were some nail salon scenes.I hear they are making a sequel to this which is a huge mistake.  The joke is going to wear thin-there is only enough humor in this concept, I think, for one movie.

Fortunately, she buoys the lame comedy and manages to pull it all off, even generating a single, solitary laugh out of me.  Also, kudos to Luke Wilson for suffering through his thankless role of appearing at all the right times.  Please do yourself a favor and catch him in ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", a much better comedy than this one.Speaking of ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", I find it highly odd that anyone even remotely responsible for the Golden Globe nominees could find ""Legally Blonde"" to be worthy of a Best Picture nod instead of that infinitely more superior film.

For this reason, it is a comedy that can truly be taken seriously. This movie can serve as a great inspiration for anyone making any kind of important decisions in life pertaining to career goals, etc. If you haven't checked this movie out because you figured it would be an immature comedy, I encourage you to rent it and watch it when you have the chance.

But Elle didn't hope that her ex-boyfriend has begun dating with another girl, a prim and serious student. Even so, Elle decides to dedicate to study to become a good lawyer someday. The rest of the cast completes Luke Wilson, Selma Blair, Jennifer Coolidge, Matthew Davies, Victor Garber and Ali Larter.

What's not to like?,6,14 July 2001,"It is a curious fact of American life that beauty is often the catalyst for discovering unsurpassed wealth and fame while the less fortunate- looking individuals are forced to work that much harder to find the same level of achievement.  The premise of ""Legally Blonde"" validates this stereotype but goes beyond it and forces it's heroine Elle Woods played by Reese Witherspoon to work hard once she's got her foot in the door.The film is a fluff comedy that sets out to be the twin sister of ""Clueless"" and works remarkably better by allowing it's character to branch out of her valley girl image and find worth in inner beauty.  Reese Witherspoon and satire make for a movie with many laughs that is never boring and makes you feel good when you leave the theater.  Elle Woods is sort of the anti-Tracy Flick from ""Election"" and Witherspoon shows amazing versatility in making Elle so likeable.  Alicia Silverstone played her ""Clueless"" character as a one-dimensional cartoon who we couldn't really sympathize with.  Despite her snobby Beverly Hills background and valley girl image, we can't help but love Elle because of everything Reese is that Alicia was not.  Witherspoon has really branched out in recent years with her choices of movies. ""Election"" should have garnered her an Academy Award nomination and ""Pleasantville"" saw Reese stealing the show out from Tobey Maguire. ""Legally Blonde"" will not be bad for her long resume but is certainly not worthy of mention except in passing.""Legally Blonde"" is an excellent popcorn movie for a lazy Saturday afternoon when your looking for a good laugh and movie for your teenage daughters. It shows that hard work and desire for success is a good thing and that women are worthy of it.  One qualm is that it's fairly predictable (due in part to a revealing trailer) and it demonstrates that ugly people often finish last.",Legally Blonde

None of the above named movies had any real longevity to them.  Sure you watch it once and you laugh, but the jokes are boring the second time around.  Legally Blonde differs from this.
I have a two year old nephew that i watch once a week, and everytime he comes over he goes straight to the DVD rack and pulls out this movie and we watch it.  I think he likes the dog.  I must have watched this movie close to a hundred times by now and i find myself still able to laugh all the way through....i even find myself reciting lines and laughing to myself in the super market.Excellent flick, i can not stress this enough, full of laughs, not generic tricks, and a very heartfelt and truly uplifting story.What i find great about this film is Elle, played by Reese Witherspoon, who is the blonde in the movie, but despite having stereotyped traits, is not typical in any way.  She is not stupid, rather she is not as serious about some things as she is about others, which is the case for everyone in the world.

This is simply one of the more entertaining movies of 2001. If you like to laugh and be entertained at a movie, go see this.
For some reason, critics have also dismissed this as a teen-girl movie - making it sound like a made-for-video Kate & Ashley Olsen adventure in Boston or something - nothing could be further from the truth.
Again, if you enjoy clever writing, solid acting and a fun time at the movies - then we should all hope and be so lucky that more movies are aimed at ""teen-girls"" (cause frankly, the ones aimed at teen guys are not cutting it).This movie is not an Oscar caliber movie but it sets out to tell a funny story about a girl who gets into Harvard Law to win back her beau - and it delivers it with wit and style. Movies are supposed to entertain us and take you to another place - this certainly does. It also has a nice message without stopping the movie dead in its tracks to lecture us (a nice pleasant surprise!) and this may be the first PG-13 movie in a long, long time without swearing in it (okay, I may have missed a mild one but I believe 'butthead' is about as severe as it gets).Go reward the film-makers so we can encourage more fun, witty, light summer movies such as this.",Legally Blonde

TO GET A NEW ONE! And do ya think she does it... oh, I won't ruin that special drama for ya. This movie is straight out of the flops of the 80s. I suppose bad movies like this have to be made every few years as stepping stones in cinema history... but I'm still a little sorry I watched this.
I was told this movie was funny and clever. I suppose this is probably from the people who use words like 'hip and funky fresh' to describe movies. Legally Blonde gets one star and is worse than IMDB's 100 worst list's #1, Manos the Hands of Fate, because, at least Manos had a MST3K on it which made it.... FUNNY.

I was very pleased by the end of the movie to have been entertained by what is a good comedy.  It's a fresh approach to the blonde issue - especially since it starts with the stereotypical ditzy California blonde and ends with a confident young woman, ready to take on the world on HER terms.  The steps that Elle Woods (Reece Witherspoon) take in growing up are humorous, touching, and quite affirming that there is something inside all of us that we can bring out to become confident adults.  *Minor Spoiler* - It was only when looking through the deleted scenes that we realized that the ex-wife was Raquel Welch.  And the two California girls coming to see Elle at the trial - 'with a judge and jury people and everything' - is sidesplitting.*Minor complaint* - The deleted scene (shown on the DVD) where Emmett tells Callahan he's an ass because he hit on Elle should have been left in.

The story of 'Legally Blonde' is highly unbelievable, and yet enjoyable at the same time.  Witherspoon easily becomes her character and is able to portray an ultimate stereotype with a new freshness.Holland Taylor is perfectly cast as one of Elle's law professors at Harvard. Taylor is a judge on TV's 'The Practice,' and so her character is immediately recognized as being law-savvy.  Victor Garber also does well as a colleague of Taylor's and partner of a prestigious law firm.  Finally, Selma Blair portrays the role of a seemingly snooty, uptight intellectual well.

The movie has more wit than it could have gotten away with, it's genuinely funny (as opposed to just having funny surface schtick like so many contemporary comedies), and it has a star-making performance by Reese Witherspoon, who proves herself to be Hollywood's newest comedienne.This is no masterpiece -- just a smart, funny, eye-pleasing little movie which successfully immerses you in its world.

For instance in one scene Vivian shakes her head, parodying Elle's chipperness, and she gets it just right -- perfect parody and perfectly mean. And the extended scene where the camera stays long on Elle's face as her former boyfriend tells her she's not smart enough for law school . . . Witherspoon's subtle changes in expression are classic.

I find it slightly disappointing that we will probably rarely (if ever) see her again in something like ""Election"", but Witherspoon is now slowly becoming America's sweetheart, and if she can live up to the standard that is all we can ask of her. The movie itself involves Witherspoon getting into Harvard Law for the sole reason of winning back her snob boyfriend. Selma Blair shows up for the 18th straight film as the ""other girl"", Luke Wilson is Witherspoon's new love interest (which is obvious the first time you see him), and the rest of the cast is a bunch of character actors no one knows the name of.It doesn't really matter, seeing as the film is solely a vehicle for the beautiful Witherspoon to work her charm on us. She is not a cynical hero like most teen movie characters are, but a sweet, naive, and utterly determined young woman who succeeds in the end by her very get-to-itiveness.

This is the biggest insult to such a school in the history of movies. The famous line heard round the World as her boyfriend (upon meeting again) says, ""You... got into Harvard law?"" Elle responds, ""What like it's hard? Oh my god this year is gonna be just like last year except funner!"" Upon that line I cringed and stabbed myself twice in the neck. The pain endured was half that of watching this rubbish.So Elle continues along and finds out her boyfriend (who is now the enemy girls...) has a woman. The woman is a royal tool and eventually Elle just starts owning everything. She meets this other tool and they start to get a little love fling going. Then she gets on some team and starts helping out on a case with this woman she knows who was indicted because she was thought to kill her husband. Either way the real lawyer (who is also Elle's teacher) gets fired because the client is blonde and needs blonde power from Elle now. *SPOILER - should you even care* So Elle solves the case because the real murderer said she was in the shower and the perm is still in tact which meant she wasn't in the shower, meaning she killed her father. Here's now an insult to Harvard law professors. I love how some PORTRAYED blonde bimbo discovers this, yet a big shot lawyer can't. Is this a joke or what? In any event the ending is the cheesiest piece of crap alive. Elle and the one tool are dating, her old boyfriend is now a loser, and the new woman of the old boyfriend is now best friends. I crapped myself 5 times after finishing this movie and quickly downed a bottle of Listerine in an effort to dull the pain. I then slept for 5 days and awoke still hearing the stupid blood-curling scream that blonde over-hyped girls do. You know when they jump up and down and shake their hands high and scream with that whiny face. YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKKK!!!!RUN FROM THIS MOVIE. RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!!",Legally Blonde

However, this film I ve seen a few times and have enjoyed it each time. It's described as comedy, romance, but really it's just comedy. Reese Witherspoon is brilliant. The script is full of double entendres (""I ve got a big package""), so it doesn't take itself seriously.

230,#1 Gracie,Legally Fun,8,28 July 2001,"Legally Blonde, when you see the previews, looks like it's going to be another lame teeny-bopper movie that Hollywood punches out thinking that all teens will love it (which they don't, I know), when in reality it has a lame script, an even lamer cast, and an audience that wonders how this film ever got green-lighted. But that is not the case (no pun intended) for the quirky and funny Legally Blonde.The story begins in California, where Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) is living on top-she's President of her sorority, majoring in fashion design, has lots of friends, and has a boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis II), who she loves dearly. But then Warner dumps her, saying that if he's going to be a senator when he's 30, he needs a girl that's ""more serious"". So Warner leaves for Harvard and leaves Elle with a broken heart. Not wanting to just let Warner leave her grasp, she applies for Harvard to prove she in fact is serious. But when she gets to the school, she has some problems: not only are the classes tough, but she has to deal with Warner's snobby fiancee` Vivian (Selma Blair), aka ""the brunette"".This was one of those few teen movies that was actually good. The jokes were funny, the story was good, and the acting was good. Reese Witherspoon was excellent as the smart but valley-girlish Elle Woods, and Selma Blair nailed the cold snobbiness of preppy Vivian.It was a good story, but not 100%. One word: predictability. I was guessing things in the movie that would then happen an hour later. Of course, this being a teen movie, that's to be expected. Not all teen movies can be THAT good. But still a good script.All in all, it was fun. That's the best way to sum up ""Legally Blonde"": fun. A good way to spend my Saturday.8/10, B+",Legally Blonde

I have read some things that compared this to ""Clueless"" and I never saw that movie so I can't say anything.  But, seriously, how predicable can one movie get.  I did not laugh once, and the audience was laughing at things I saw coming a mile away.  Parts of the trailer didn't make the final cut, normally not a good sign.  Some of it could have made this movie funny, at least the part where they were betting on how long Elle (Reese Weatherspoon) would stay at Harvard.  A scene that was not in the movie.  The trailer spoils 80% of the movie.  There was one sub-plot which wasn't really needed.  I think that was thrown in there to make this longer. It is 93 minutes not counting previews.",Legally Blonde
232,LuxuriousWoman,Great movie for women,9,18 January 2017,"The movie is basically about a sorority girl named Elle Woods who cares a lot about fashion and other stereotypical girly things. Her boyfriend ends up dumping her because he implies that he wants to marry a smart girl. She gets heartbroken and decides to follow him to Harvard Law School in hopes of winning him back.Feminine and PowerI like how Elle isn't a character that's not like other girls (looking at you Andy from Devil Wears Prada). She likes girly things, and still ends up being one of the smartest characters in the movie. She's like the other girls, and that's okay. She helps other women around her as well improve their own lives. Elle ends up winning the respect of the strictest professor (also a woman) because she's a hard worker who doesn't give up and is intelligent.A few nitpicks""No movie is without sin"" -CinemaSinsElle saying she's discriminated against because she's blonde is inaccurate. Blonde women actually hold more positions of power despite brunette hair being more common, and the myth that blonde people are dumber. Blonde women are the standard of beauty in society, so no discrimination. The 2000s was not a good time for the LGBT movement. We were still behind as a society during that time period with the stereotypes. We are still admittedly behind the times unfortunately. I say that to say that I hated how Elle knew he was gay because he knows fashion. The early 2000s and before tended to perpetuate the stereotype that gay men are fashionable and feminine (basically women in men's bodies), while straight men could care less about fashion and can't spot a designer's outfit at all.Werner was a douchebag, but him not getting any offers is unrealistic. Wasn't his brother like some bigshot? Isn't his brother married to a woman from a famous political family (starts with a V)? His father pulled some strings to get him into Harvard Law School, so wouldn't he pull some strings to get him a job? OverallThe movie was great and really empowering. They even had diversity with the black women at the salon, and a black female judge. The professor harassing Elle ended up in a bad position which is the opposite of actual society.",Legally Blonde

This is impressive considering that this tale about a dumb blond evolving into a smart lawyer could have been either a crashing boor for the intelligentsia or mindless pabulum for the masses. The director, Luketic, found the sweet spot where entertainment and intelligence meet. Witherspoon, despite the fact that I would have preferred she move on to more serious roles, was perfect in her part. The result is a movie that is entertaining and delivers the lesson that it is better to rely on your intelligence than your looks. My only caution is to parents that there is a short discussion in a law class about masturbation that may or may not go over the heads of your children. Other than that I would say this is for the whole family.",Legally Blonde

Its really funny and it moves along well. I was contemplating seeing the sequel while watching an interview with Reese Witherspoon the other day when it hit me just why this flick was such a raving success. REESE WITHERSPOON. She just loves this role and she is a really fabulous actress. I'm sure that her own life fuels the power she delivers in this role of ""dumb blond,"" I mean she looks the part doesn't she? You'd never know by looking at her that both her parents are doctors, she was a straight ""A"" honors student, was accepted into Stanford and might have easily have become a doctor herself if she hadn't decided to follow an acting career.

So what in the world was I doing in a theatre watching ""Legally Blonde"" and why did I like it so much?It doesn't have much depth, the main character is much too perfect, and the storylines are rather predictable. Still, it's so charming that I really didn't care about that other stuff. It simply is a fun movie with no pretentions or cause. I would've missed out if I had looked down my nose at it just because it's a Hollywood blockbuster and not one of my art-house flicks. Besides, not all of those independent movies are all that great anyway.I read a comment somewhere comparing ""Clueless"" to ""Legally Blonde,"" and there are some similarities.

The lead character expects everything to go her way, so following crass Hollywood tradition, it does.

The only so-called comedy movie I can think of that is significantly less funny than Blazing Saddles is Team America. But a lot of Americans think those are the funniest things they've ever seen. Both pits dreadful, as I saw them. Conversely, Legally Blonde didn't seem to find favour (initially, anyway) among US film critics. Check out a quantity of dorky reviews from the humour challenged on various websites. I thought Legally Blonde was hilarious from start to finish. It is quite beautifully well-written, well-paced, well-timed and directed, gave me a truly good feeling, and made me feel happy. The performances are terrific, from all involved. Maybe part of the enjoyment was that I got to laugh loudly at behaviour that I registered as archetypically American, and maybe that was the reason many Americans couldn't quite approve. I must have a New Zealand kind of sense of humour. Still, most of the ordinary, less pretentious Americans obviously thought it was funny as well. Sure, it was silly and lightweight. Isn't that what comedy is usually? Who ever stopped to complain about a comedy having plot holes? I felt years younger just for watching this sweet, lovely film for an hour and a half.

Probably a movie about some shallow, upper class, white teen girl getting into law school because of ""connections"" and realizing it's actually hard, right?Big wrong.I did cringe at the intro of the movie, because it seems like Elle's motivation to get into law school was simply to get closer to her ex and trying to win him back. But after some realizations, she didn't care about her ex nor some romantic relationship anymore and did her best to keep up with the workload, getting internships, be responsible, proving people that she's not a ""basic white girl"" who probably graduates from Harvard with ""special treatments""I love this movie because they didn't emphasize the importance of having a boyfriend/fiancé/romantic relationship (which is what usually happen to women characters in movies) and instead showed Elle's hard work whilst being underestimated. Elle still has stress and frustration, and she solved it by visiting the salon and make friends along the way. On top of that, the movie created a pretty realistic university scenes, from work stress, bullying, underestimating, to sexual favors--of which Elle handled them gracefully and responsibly.While all of this is happening, Elle also managed to still stay stylish!

Perhaps my laughter was hitting upon sensitive chords within themselves, and that they were being drawn to recognize too, the subtle send-up of themselves in this great little movie.Look for the subtlety that tends to go over the heads of those who have not experienced teenage parenting yet.

'Legally Blonde' is a straightforward story about a brainy character who is stereotyped as dumb because of her lifestyle.Anyway, this movie speaks to me because I know a few people who are not really that smart but are viewed as such because of their goals, chosen vocation, how they talk, etc. I also know a few people who are smart but choose to play it unconventionally. I have no problems with either of these types of people. But it is disappointing to find out that a person's lifestyle is used to place weight on his or her words.But enough of that.

Selma Blair plays Vivian, a girl who first becomes an enemy of Elle and later becomes her best friend. Selma gave a wonderful performance! As did Luke Wilson, who played Emmett, a boy who likes Elle. Matthew Davis played Warner, the selfish ''boyfriend'' of Elle, and however unpleasant the character of Warner might be, Matthew gave an excellent performance in the movie. Jennifer Coolidge also gave an excellent performance in this movie! Jennifer played Paulette, a middle-aged woman who becomes a good friend of Elle. Jessica Cauffiel and Alana Ubach's funny performances made me laugh. They played Margot and Serena respectively, the two stylish and funny friends of Elle. In short, the casting was excellent!

253,Mirax,Clueless Goes to Grad School,9,9 July 2001,"I will be short and sweet on this one (ha, you wish): this movie is very funny, sugary sweet without being cloying, and visually uncomplicated and satisfying.  I really enjoyed it.  Never far away from the material which first brought us the shallow, yet deeply involved in her shallowness, Beverley Girl (""Clueless""), ""Legally Blonde"" (awful title, boys) plunks this new Cher, named Elle, into the alien world of Harvard (obviously, except for the first arresting aerial shots of the vaunted institution, filmed in Los Angeles or thereabouts) and follows her through preppie parties and intimidating classes, accompanied by a band of clownish, broadly drawn, and entertaining supporting characters and temporary villains.A note on acting: Selma Blair is funny without being annoying, a new move in her career which I applaud her for, as Vivian Kensington, legacy bitch of Harvard Law and Elle's competition for the shriveled heart of her former boy toy; Luke Wilson, as well, has managed to not only not annoy me, but has made me fall in love with him as a softhearted associate at the law firm where Elle gets an internship.  In many movies (Home Fries, to take a memorable example), Wilson's dimwittedness made you want to slap him. Ironically, here, where he is playing an intelligent lawyer, the doofy act is endearing and not annoying (""Did you just call me a butthead?  It's just that I don't think anyone's called me that since, like, 9th grade."").  Reese Witherspoon is sweet and that look of sudden enlightenment, which she can maintain throughout a conversation, is priceless.  Holland Taylor is underused but perfect, and all the males not branded doofy, and thus acceptable, are perfectly and convincingly slime-coated.Don't think too hard -- that's what killed this movie for my sister, a bona-fide Harvard student.

You could almost make the connection with formula Adam Sandler movies: harassed underdog scores big in opponent's home court, all the while ridiculing all obstacles with self-important snide.Maybe it's just my sense of decency, but the fact that you can still be a bubbly cheerleader and defend a case in a court of law is not exactly how I see one giving a stuffy system a breath of fresh, liberal air.

The interesting plot is well-enhanced with a lot of fun-poking at blondes and a bit at lawyers. Added to it are the regular dose of melodrama and a couple of interesting court-room scenes.

Yeh this comedy side-tracked me because as an Asian American I found it offensive that somebody allowed the scene where a woman was trying to speak Vietnamese.  It was the way she tried to speak it...almost as if she's mocking the culture/language.  This really isn't cool since growing up I had experience racism first hand where strangers would be cruel by making fun of the asian language.  If director Robert Luketic or writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirten Smith thought that it was funny, this movie-goer certainly didn't think so.  Did anyone forget about ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" and the ridiculous chinese restaurant scene?

There was great humour and an extremely imaginative but gripping storyline. However, I did find it strange that throughout the whole film, the idea was that Elle was discriminated against because she had blonde hair, when in reality, it was because she was a very ditsy little rich girl who didn't know anything about anything other than fashion. If you watch the film closely, I don't see any of the students having blonde hair, this is obviously a trick to make Elle stand out more in the crowd as the dumb girl. The only line which suggests the film is discriminating blonde's is 'you're breaking up with me because I'm too blonde?' Which was never actually said by anyone other than Elle, that was her interpretation of him calling her too stupid really, throughout the film, the only one who makes any suggestion that blonde's are stupid is the blonde in question. However, other than this, it was a great film and a fun watch for all the family to enjoy",Legally Blonde

Also, the movie is riddled with cliches, yet they do not hurt its' appeal.  It's intention is to entertain, and it does!  Fairly formulaic, yet still fun, I would recommend this movie to anyone who in search of a good laugh.  Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, a seemingly two-dimensional character with more depth than people give her credit for, wonderfully.  Movie comes complete with feel-good ending and enjoyably ditzy characters and should leave its viewer (properly prepared to NOT pick it apart) well satisfied!

Fast Times (watched part of it the same day actually) Hilarious (Sean Penn is Comedically Mesmerizing as Jeff Spicolli), Clueless (under rated I believe) but I could not see the appeal. It just wasn't funny. The cast was O.K., the writing alright and it sort of kept my attention but it wasn't funny at all and definitely not rememberable.

264,benignifan,Legally Blonde...Legally Impressive.,8,18 July 2001,"""Legally Blonde"" is a delightful comedy about a young valley girl named Elle Woods (played incentively by Reese Witherspoon).  In the beginning, Elle is expects her boyfriend to propose to her while on a date.  Instead, he dumps her.  ""I need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn,"" he replied. So, Elle decides to become the Jackie type...she applies for Harvard Law School and eventually gets accepted.  The Elle Woods character is very likeable. She's rich and comes from a well-to-do family, but never gives us any indication of being a stuck up snob.  She makes friends with all kinds of people...rich and poor, and she thinks of others more than she does herself.  The film has many funny points.  Reese Witherspoon is excellently cast and the rest of the cast is ideal as well.I give ""Legally Blonde"" ***(B).",Legally Blonde

She was terrific in ""Election"", ""Cruel Intentions"" and ""Pleasantville"". Yes, I realize this is light-hearted comedy, definitely not to be taken seriously. But this has very little to offer, regardless of how one takes it. The biggest culprit here appears to be the script. There were some huge lapses in all of the boutique scenes, and the Jennifer Coolidge character was just wasting screen time in all of her scenes. The courtroom drama contains a very weak revelation that comes nowhere near the similar, yet more powerful and convincing element in ""My Cousin Vinny"". Finally, Luke Wilson grimaces just a few too many times, suggesting perhaps that he was enjoying the whole affair even less than I was. Sorry folks, but this is definitely not Reese at her best.",Legally Blonde

268,devon_chris,Enjoyable cheese-fest,7,22 July 2002,"Reese Witherspoon does everything she has to do in this neat, satisfying, feel-good exercise. The film is cliche-ridden, but in a way too insincere for it to be a flaw in the overall effect. The director clearly revels, as do the characters, in the quirky stereotyping in the fashion-school scenes near the beginning, and in Witherspoon's part as the dim-looking-but-actually-very-sharp blonde law wannabe. The plot is not meant to be taken seriously, and should not be if it is to be enjoyed. There is little likelihood of the heroine succeeding in getting into Harvard on a whim, and in the charismatic way that she does, and the courtroom scenes must be viewed with a serious pinch of salt. But I don't think we as the audience are meant to bother with the minutiae of this piece - it is simply to be enjoyed. You can see the ending coming from a mile off, and nothing in the now-dated text 'fill-ins' at the bottom of the screen at the end for each character contained any surprises for me. Some critics (who have clearly looked far deeper into this film than is sensibly possible) claim the film to contain a message of hope for blondes everywhere, or even a moral that charisma will always triumph over the all-encompassing greytone colours against which Witherspoon's gloriously colourful character is set. And yet this is nonsense. If anything, the film is more of a light-hearted dig at the charismatic 'blonde' mentality than a defence of it. But this is besides the point; there is no philosophy in 'Legally Blonde', other than the shameless shot at the class-obsessed socialite mentality of Witherspoon's college sweetheart in the movie. You do not come out of this film having learned anything, or been made to think. You just come out of it feeling happy, entertained and amused (the script, if predictable and surreal at times, is dynamic and boisterously good fun), and that to me makes it well worth watching.",Legally Blonde
269,rowan_red,"I wanted to like this movie, I expected to like this movie, but...",1,4 November 2004,"... I just didn't like it. I did not find it very funny. The film was full of images that I would strain to rid from my memory: Reese Witherspoon waddling around in awful pink outfits, carrying an ugly chihuahua wearing awful pink outfits; and a horrible women's musical ensemble scene about bending over. The movie is morally skewed: Elle's ""bible"" is Cosmopolitan Magazine. The ""smart"" people are depicted as not nice to beautiful blond Elle: it never seems to happen that way in real life! In fact, this movie stands up for the one type of person who needs standing up for least: the rich, smart, blond, pretty girl. You may try to guess that I'm just a jealous brunette with sour grapes to squeeze, but I think the movie just doesn't show a blonde's life the way it really is; and comedy works best when it is based on real life stuff.Many people I know loved this movie; I usually love light comedies.

Reese Witherspoon is Excellent as the legal genius/bimbo, Elle Wood. there are many funny side characters as well, including Elle's sorority friends, and her snobby Harvard classmates. If you are going to law school or have gone to college, this movie has a lot to relate to, besides the occasional Hollywood feel good scenes which are sometimes a little too obvious, but the movie is so well-made and REese witherspoon is so excellent that you instantly sympathize with her and the movie as a whole, making everything acceptable... just go with the flow and enjoy the whole movie, it's GREAT! very smart!",Legally Blonde

Reese Witherspoon was excellent, in so far her best performance ever no other actress could have done this role but her. One or two things that I did not like in this movie is that the music could have been better and the ending of the movie could have been better.

274,Groovey,"Light, funny parable on being yourself",7,31 March 2004,"I was surprised to enjoy this movie as much as I did.  It is a light-hearted comedy about a classic ""dumb blond"" who goes to Harvard Law School, and turns out, of course, to be brilliant under the plastic exterior.The real irony of this, though, is that Elle comes across as the empty socialite at the beginning, but she is still the same character at the very end.  Instead of being either destroyed or transformed by the stuffy and repressive environment of Harvard Law, she stands up to it, and ends up making a mark on the school itself.Her character represents the epitome of shallow, and she is rejected by the man she expects to marry because she is shallow, yet by holding true to herself through some pretty unbearable situations, she is able to work through her circumstances.  As she does so, we begin to see her develop depth that flies in the face of the stereotype.   She begins to excel without losing her facade.  The characters who spurned her for being shallow are shown themselves to be shallow and inauthentic, while she develops considerable depth while remaining herself.I like the way it makes fun of the stereotypes while pushing through them in a demonstration of strength of character.  You can be as out-of-the-tree as you want and make it work, if you believe in yourself enough.Besides all of that, it's a fun movie.   Favorite line: the one about the hot tub.",Legally Blonde

As it turned out, ""Legally Blonde"" was no waste of my time and money, and I was soon wrapped up in the plot and characters.Elle (played by Reese Witherspoon, it's pronounced EL, not EL-LY) seems to be about as ditzy as she could be, but it's obvious she is no ""dumb blonde"", as an unfortunate shopkeeper finds out the hard way. After her boyfriend Warner breaks up with her because he ""needs someone serious"", and goes off to Harvard, Elle follows him there (with the help of her sex appeal), but learns that attending law school is no walk in Harvard yard. After being embarrassed, stereotyped, and deceived, she pushes herself to really become a valuable law student. Attending Harvard, Elle realizes how smart she really is, and with that she gains something much better than her old boyfriend, she gains a new kind of life, and sweetheart Emmett (Luke Wilson), who can see a powerful mind through that beautiful blonde hair.Unless it's after 12 AM, I cannot stand asinine, pointless humor. I really, truly enjoyed ""Legally Blonde"". It was sweet, funny (anyone who's seen it must remember ""Chuck""), and a whole lot of fun.

In the musical, Elle is definitely clueless when she gets to harvard; in the film, she is clueless throughout the entire thing. Plus, it is so obvious they took the scenes from the musical and tried to make something original out of it...which is a terrible idea when the musical is perfect in the first place. the whole dinner scene at the beginning went on for far too long - __-and it felt awkward, kind of forced as well. (and where the concept worked in the musical, it did not translate well into film) I also hate how they tried to change the lines from the musical into the film, but only slight, like a seventh grader changing up some lines to an essay he clearly didn't write; at least come up with something original. I also can't believe they made the delta sister's unique. In the first twenty minutes, they show two distinct girls from Delta Nu...I understand the need to make characters unique but I feel like they don't really serve in any help in the plot of the film.

Bottom line, silly and funny and all, but if you're familiar with the place, you'll appreciate the subtle nuances that abound throughout the movie.

299,DrKnow,who would have guessed,6,3 October 2001,"This was actually kind of an enjoyable movie.  I never would have guessed. First of all, it's a Reese Witherspoon movie.  There is nothing wrong with her exactly, she just never seems to be involved in good movies.  i.e. Cruel Intentions, Freeway, Election and American Psycho.  Secondly, it co-stars the repeatedly brutal Luke Wilson.  i.e. Soul Survivors, Home Fries etc. However, somehow this movie overcomes those two details to be a rather enjoyable little flick.Legally Blonde is the story of Californian blonde bombshell Elle Woods(Reese Witherspoon).  Elle decides that getting into Harvard Law School is the only way to prove to her ex-boyfriend that she can be serious, thereby winning him back.I really thought that this would be a mildly funny movie worth the two dollars that I was spending on it.  However, my friend failed to mention to me that Luke Wilson was in it.  My friend Dr.ben knows that I can't stand Luke Wilson!  Naturally, when I read his name in the opening credits, I became a lot fearful.  However after the fact, I have never seen Wilson so absent of annoyance.  I actually liked him in this movie.  He didn't come across like a dufus.   Reese Witherspoon was really cute.  Her character is such a nice person, and it was nice to see Witherspoon play someone like that.  It was really easy to sympathize with her.It also has a small part from Ali Larter (American Outlaws,Final Destination and Varsity Blues).

Elle is pretty, sweet, and smart, and yet she spazzes and has to get Warner back, even though she could do so much better. Especially since it is obvious to the audience what a loser Warner is. Also, it bothers me that Elle attempted to gain respect at Harvard while dressing in a skanky way. No wonder guys kept throwing unwanted attention at her.

The movie is full of hilarious one liners and hilarious buildups to one liners, as well as hilarious one liners supporting a hilarious subplot. Every character is developed with the utmost care and creative energy, and every subplot and scene is perfectly shaped to support every tie it has to the characters and story.This movie is definetly more than a chick flick.

Everyone involved - the actors, producers, distributors, and the audience - are in the joke and take this movie for what it is: a light-hearted, funny, warm-hearted romp.

I thought the trailer was terrible, and when the critics reviews came in, and they were mostly positive I couldn't believe it. While at Hollywood Video, I saw this film, and I couldn't resist. I had to see why everyone loved it. I slipped the DVD in, and hesitantly sat down, and watched. Did I like it? Yes. Did I love it? Not exactly. It was a fun, entertaining, and cute film. Very predictable it was, but it did provide me with some laughs, and some solid entertainment. Reese Witherspoon is this movie. Without her, this film would have been nothing. Her performance here is great, and funny, and her character is a riot! But personally, I think it was Jennifer Coolidge who steals the show. She was hysterical in Best in Show and she's hysterical in Legally Blonde! She made me laugh in literally every scene she was in (The bend and snap scene was laugh-out-loud funny). Selma Blair also does great in this film. She plays the bitch perfectly. Luke Wilson did fine, but something was missing with his performance. What is was, I don't know. The very hott Ali Larter had a little part in here, and I loved her.The film does have it's flaws. It wasn't always funny (but when it is funny, it's hilarious (I loved the scene with the gay guy in the court room... very funny), and at some points I was getting a little bored. Also, it's just so predictable! You know exactly what is going to happen right before it does. But overall it's a good film. Very funny at times, and very entertaining. It's nice to see a movie that lets me just relax, and not think for a while (The last film I saw before this was CHASING SLEEP which had me thinking the whole way through). LEGALLY BLONDE is no CLUELESS, but I'm sure I'll be recommending this to anyone looking for a fun film.Legally Blonde: 7/10, B+",Legally Blonde

However, the plot and premise did have a bit of originality and the movie ends exactly how I found myself hoping it would.  The fact that even I cared about the characters and the outcome by the end of the movie is what I think makes it a decent movie.If you can stand the stereotypical dumb blond aspect and the superficial pretty girl mentality, it actually wraps up with a pretty good message.",Legally Blonde
310,hockeyrage88,"Drops her life to spite her ex-boyfriend, how courageous!",1,12 August 2005,"When my girlfriend finally convinced me to watch this movie, I still had extremely low expectations for it, and I am sad to say that I was still disappointed.This film is a giant hypocrisy. It tries to claim that women are just as powerful and smart as men, which I really don't need convincing of, but this film actually made me question that idea instead of support it. The only statement that it makes is that women have to manipulate and lie to men in order to succeed. Sure, Elle may have gotten into Harvard without doing so, which, of course is possible, but the film makes it seem impossible, especially with the stereotypical Harvard students that she meets and cannot manage to get along with. The worst part is that she works so hard to get into Harvard for all the wrong reasons. In the end, it tells young women that they can succeed in life even if they live inside of a little bubble that disregards all other life forms, even their own pets.I almost ripped my own arms off during the 'bend and snap' scene, in which Elle teaches a beauty salon full of women a move that is sure to catch the attention of a nearby man to get him to talk to you. So, in a film that is 'more than just another Girl Power Film', the main character teaches other females how to get a man's attention by showing off her breasts and butt. How innovative.I live in Southern California, and if I see another dog dressed up and being carried in a purse, I am going to move to Sri Lanka. To anyone who thinks that that is cute, please see South Park episode 812, which features Paris Hilton's dog committing suicide.In all, this film obviously appeals very well to young women and I can maybe even see why many would like it, but it also contributes to the growing number of messages the mass media is sending to young women that make me worried about the future. I suppose, however, if it does encourage young women to aspire to achieve something or inspires them in any way to better themselves, then it is a good thing, just as long as they aren't going to prove something to their ex-boyfriend. Do it for yourself, what's so hard about that?",Legally Blonde
311,a9064,To say this film is terrible would be a grave understatement,1,26 April 2005,"The genial sap is a well-beloved main character in comedy, but is also one of the most difficult to use properly. Attention to detail must be exasperating and obsessive, and the hand of humour must be applied lightly to avoid slapstick.Consider P.G. Wodehouse. His character of Bertram Wooster (portrayed on screen very well by Hugh Laurie) is the archetype of this sap. 'Elle Woods' is a poor, irritating copy. Instead of grand, rolling story lines which we have come to expect from this genre, with the sap being revealed as something of a genius, or a very lucky person indeed (saved, as always, by the twist at the end), we are treated to what could be mistaken for a plagiarism of 'Cold Comfort Farm', in that no cohesion is even attempted, save for the single recurring main character. If you want humour, suspense and good natured fun in small bites, watch MacGyver.

But when things go wrong with her boyfriend Warner she chases him all the way to Harvard Law School to win him back. This film is packed full of laughs and Elle is so lovable you can easily get past the fact that she isn't always the sharpest tool in the box. But be warned! You have to watch it past the first couple of scenes because the voice takes a bit of getting used to and your first instinct is to hate Elle's character and switch it off.

317,Mb3,Not worth seeing this Harvard airhead get revenge on her ex. Case closed.,4,9 February 2003,"Elle Woods is a somewhat annoying dumb blonde played by Reese Witherspoon. Elle's ambitions are limited to getting married to the man of her dreams, Warner Huntington III (played by Matthew Davis). But on the night Elle expects Warner to propose, he takes the opportunity to break up with her! He's going to Harvard Law with the aim of being a senator by the time he's 30, a schedule that mandates that he ""marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn."" Miffed, Elle decides to go to Harvard as well, and is accepted, in the name of diversity. She arrives with her scented, pink resume and her tiny Chihuahua Bruiser. The Harvard crowd are somewhat amused but patronizing.Along the way she meets the kind and mature Emmett Richmond (Luke Wilson) who is one of the few who take Elle seriously; stuck-up Vivian Kensington who happens to be Warner's new fiancé (Selma Blair); Brooke Taylor Windham (Ali Larter) as a lady who decides on Elle for legal representation late in the movie; and Paulette, an unconfident manicurist who gets a little inspiration through confiding in Elle (Jennifer Coolidge, best known to most teen movie fans as 'Stifler's Mom'.) The rest of the movie is spent as she tries to succeed at law school, get along with everybody, and let a bit of her favorite color 'pink' rub off on everybody.Much of this film's selling point is due to Reese Witherspoon, who was willing to throw herself completely into the bubbly role of Elle Woods. Perfectly suited to this, she's a confident actress who has risen up the Hollywood ranks and can now sell a flick with her name and face alone on the poster. Her performance is entirely convincing, but this sort of dumb-blonde humour is a product wrapped up nicely for mass-girl-appeal that just doesn't work for a guy like me. I guess it's really not even trying to. So when I say I didn't enjoy it, I've only got myself to blame for hiring it.It seems Elle has figured out where she wants to go and exactly what she wants to achieve, but I don't think this film can. The movie seems to want to make us completely aware that she is so out of place in Harvard, and many scenes are devoted to demonstrating this to the audience, some of which earn no laughs at all, only humiliation for our central character. Once Elle is settled at Harvard, the movie can't seem to decide which direction to take us in. I can't continue to explain the plot, as there are very few plot surprises left to reveal.One thing that studios need to avoid is revealing the whole plot line in their trailers. As the movie went along I realised I had already seen every key scene in the trailer. The movie had no more surprises to give me.The script has weaknesses, with characters changing their attitudes at the drop of the hat. One teacher gives Ella a hard time in her first class, and then the next time we see the teacher, she's convincing her not to drop out of law school and that anything is possible. She is obviously completely out of her league in class, but the script seems to be able to allow her to turn it all around with what seems to be one night of cramming. If only it was that easy in real life! Does Elle have a higher IQ than we are led to believe?The acting, set designs and direction cannot be faulted. They were all capable enough for this film to be a huge hit, especially with the targeted audience of teenage girls who, I suspect, are attracted by the pink poster and themes of female empowerment. The film was targeted well towards them, and the marketing surely helped this movie along its way in grossing over $100 million. Expect a similar commercial success for the sequel.Robert Luketic was given the job as director on the strength of his short film, Titsiana Booberini, which was well received at short film festivals across the U.S. such as Sundance and Telluride. Legally Blonde, his first feature film, debuted at number 1 on the U.S. box office ahead of Robert De Niro's The Score & Steven Spielberg's A.I. We will surely see Luketic directing more Hollywood productions after the commercial success of this. Let's hope he's given the opportunity soon to direct a creation of his own.Out of 5 stars: A 'truly heinous' 2.",Legally Blonde

But it wasn't..which in its own right was a good thing, the bad thing was, it didn't end up being a very good film.Why? Too many themeswe had, Over coming heartbreak, beating the odds, Finding new love, making friends in a new place, being a stranger in a new town etc...if they had narrowed this down to concetrating on maybe two of these themes then it would have been good.Annoyingly it deicded to sflit between them, going serious to funny, to somewhere in between...And let's face it, whilst it would never be a get up and walk out movie, it is one you would never recommend too any friends. It's a background TV movie, one you can flit in and out of whilst chatting to firends.I was  disspointed with this film, as I am a fan of Reese Witherspoon, and I expcted a lot more from her...perhaps she ought to stick to mroe serious roles?The one thing I am glad about, was the fact that i saw it when in a bad mood, so the (few) laughs it did have were able to cheer me up..",Legally Blonde

I was afraid it would really make fun of blondes, but it wasn't too hard on us. Reese Witherspoon is adorable. I walked out of the theater actually feeling giddy, and I can't remember ever feeling that revved up after a film!

But now,I am 21years old.and university student, too.So,I still feel this story is certainly impossible,but this time I realized it's deep and touching theme.The theme is discrimination against good-looking girls.Elle always fight against such discrimination. She always has positive thinking and easy-going.I wanna follow her brilliant attitude.I was moved by her firm self-confidence.and maybe it would be also moving for you.",Legally Blonde

Because American students seem to be enjoying their life much more than us.Even though study there seems to be tougher than in Japan.

I think this movie is very sweet. Why do I think so? There are some reasons.First of all, Reese Witherspoon who is acting the heroine ""Elle Woods"" is very cute, not only cute but also her fashions are so charming. Secondly, I like Elle's character. She is always positive with everything, even if she faces serious or difficult situations. My favorite scene is that where Law School students including Elle, Elle's old boyfriend, Warner and his girlfriend Vivian are taking a class. As Elle's opinion is praised by professor, and her opinion is better than Warner's, Warner and Vivian look each other with chagrined face. When I saw the scene, I felt refreshed, and I wanted to say to Elle that ""You did it, Elle!""I really like this movie! The storyline, all of fashions are cute, and actors as well as actresses are suitable for their characters. This movie is not only sweet, charming and delightful, but also Elle Woods told us that a lot of important things for human's beings. In particular I want many ladies to see this movie, but I recommend this movie to to everyone including young boys!!",Legally Blonde

And pink.A romantic comedy, the film follows the tale of an American Dream relationship gone sour, with the girl desperately trying to rescue the situation going as far to join law school.Packed with moral fibre and healthy smiles, it pulls no surprises with its rosy view on life. Stereotyping left, right and centre, it can be, at times, a little patronising. But then the film never takes itself seriously, inviting the viewer to do the same too.With a formula that reminds of those feel good, high energy films of the 80's, it comes across as a disposable film, watched once then forgotten. But during its lifespan, it never fails to entertain. Candy floss for the masses, it's light, sugary sweet and just what's needed to make you smile.",Legally Blonde

But I loved this movie. It was hilarious, it had a great story, it had a perfect pace, and it made fun of itself before any critic could have had a chance to do so.

Reese Witherspoon is now officially in the top 5 in the best actress category. Election was another clever, funny film I enjoyed her in.This film gives oneself self-worth and determination to achieve where it counts. A lesson we all should realized. Gives those that think they are underachievers ,because people expects them to be one, self-respect to be just as smart as those who are on the honor rolls. Well, this movie will surprised those that think they know it all. Because where it counted you'd be surprised who surpasses the so-called over achievers. And in real life never think the obvious. Always give the benefit of doubt. *SMILES* (no pun intended) *winks*Legally Blonde is one of my top films for the summer of 2001!I'd watch this again and again!Can't wait for it to be on DVD this Christmas!!",Legally Blonde

355,jjjjjjoshi,against all stereotypes,9,9 October 2021,"This movie was waaayy ahead of it's time. I don't even think it's a rom com. Like, yes she gets the better guy in the end in classic rom-com fashion, but that is not what this movie is about. She is uncompromisingly herself from beginning to end. She starts the movie with the strength, determination, and intelligence to be whatever she wants to be. This is a female empowerment story where she learns that she is only limited by the boxes she allows herself to be placed in. Once she recognizes ""oh, i can be more than just a lawyer's wife- i can be a lawyer!"" she shocks everyone with her success because she does it on her own terms. I definitely have a newfound respect for this story 20 years later.And she obv breaks the stereotype ""if you're attractive you're definitely dumb"" and the ""not like other girls"" or ""pick me"" thing because unfortunately most movies try to show that being feminine is bad, fake and weak and doing things like reading books, playing sports are not a 'girls' thing and if you do those things you're not like other girls because girls in movies don't do that- they are just dumb bitches. But Legally Blonde showed how being into typically girly things doesn't mean you are a bully or dumb or trashy, Elle was super sweet and was willing to help others. You can be into makeup and fashion and not be a jerk. She is like other girls and she knows it and she embraces it- like we all should. She embraces her femininity and is always always herself. She can dress in a tight skirt and still kick ass! I like Elle's character a lot. More movies shouldn't ""demonize"" ultra-femininity.Spoilers below!!!I love when Elle says ""I don't need backups. I'm going to Harvard"" like that determination and self-confidence was so inspiring to me. And ""What, like it's hard?"" is so iconic because Warner's dad had to make a call for him to get off the waitlist and Elle got in all by herself. I feel like confident lady while watching this movie and i fucking love it.Can we also talk about how supportive her friends are? Heck yeah, we all need friends as supportive.

359,blinnjo,Legal Blonde theme drives under the influence of other movies.,6,23 January 2003,"""Legally Blonde"" is one of those zany throwbacks to comedy of the simpler, more innocent time of the 1940s or 1950s.  If you liked this film, its premise, and its humor, then you probably will like a Disney movie using much of its plot and storyline.""Cadet Kelly"" is about a teenage girl forced by the remarriage of her mother into military school where her stepfather is the commandant.  Like Elle, Kelly is totally out of her element as she competes for the attention of the most perfect guy who just happens to be the ranking student cadet.In order to impress him, Kelly must find a way to help him win a drill team medal, and that involves ""throwing around rifles like robots,"" to quote Kelly.  She is way in over her head, but somehow, like Elle, she rises to the occasion.This film uses many of the same techniques; instead of the legal profession, the humor focuses on the military, with much of it aimed at adults. since the lines are over the heads of youngsters.Camera angles, gags, and two of the same songs are used in both movies. An example of a gag scene from ""Legally Blonde"" has Elle talking on the phone to her sorority sisters with the bride-to-be taking a fall.  A parallel scene in ""Cadet Kelly"" has Kelly's father doing the same as he talks with Kelly.The two films are very similar as both stress females winning male approval by achievement.  However, ""Cadet Kelly"" leaves a much more positive message about female success, as the two females are only eight years apart, and the younger one appears to be more savvy about how the world works by the end of the movie.",Legally Blonde

Her character's entire outlook at life makes this movie one of the funniest I've seen.I would recommend this movie for women who want to see a good 'girly' movie that truly shows the meaning of 'blonde'.

I guess a blonde gets dumped by her boyfriend every day and then follows him to whatever college he's going to and takes up the same major as him hoping that she'll find a way to get him back in the process of solving a major court case that has a fellow blonde on trial and of course you gals click automatically because you know each other from excercise class. And, of course, I couldn't forget that you crack the case because of your extensive knowledge of the rules of getting a perm, you find that you don't need the loser that dumped you anymore because you'd rather stay with the guy who guided you on the path to self discovery.

I like movies about trails because they are exciting and thrilling. The second reason why it is interesting is that it is also a story about an America Unuversity. This movie tells us a lot about American college life, And I realize a lot of differences from that in Japan. For example, American students have a lot of reading assignments while Japanese students don't. And I'm surprised at a group study at a library. Japanese students seldom do a group study at a library. But I also noticed some similarities. For example, Harvard students attend classes with PCs. In Jpan, PCs are widely used in classroom.

I would like to tell you why. First of all, the director of this movie knows girl feelings well. I think that every girl hopes to be cute and charming. Its heroin, Elle Woods is very very lovely. She is an idol of every girl. So I become happy just by watching her. Second, this movie makes us cheerful and courageous. Elle Wood is not only funny but also respectable. She often fails and she is sometimes treated harshly by her Law school classmates.However, she doesn't give up her goal. she produces a new idea and finds a unique solution. Surely she has strong spirit. I respect her. Her success which is brought by her strong mind gives us power, I think.

The characters are OK, and it gives a transition for Reese from her previous roles, this one really made her one as a great actress. OK she did a great job here, she justified her role but the totality of the movie is so cliché!!...nothing's new, sad to say, it is. Very stereotyped, the plot is very predictable! The mere fact that she cannot accept that her boyfriend dumped her to achieve his ambitions and she's just nothing compared to his dreams are so used as a theme for god sake! OK, she's projecting some kind of girl power here like the girl rules and the boy drools but there's something about the ending of this movie that made me hate this movie. As if by making the happy ending of this movie really sucks! the way it narrates about the destinies of the other characters are really traditional.Gonna rate this movie 4/10.

398,Lizzie_lefev,"My favorite film- and excellent, hilarious, inspiring story for all young women.",9,17 January 2007,"I am absolutely in love with this film. It is a quintessential feel-good, inspirational underdog story. Elle Woods (Witherspoon) is a uber-positive, peppy California blonde who is suddenly jilted by her ""perfect"" boyfriend, Warner Huntington III who claims he needs a ""Jackie not a Marilyn"". Elle is completely convinced that she and Warner are made for each other, so she applies to Harvard Law school to follow him and is accepted. She arrives in a completely different world where gray is the primary color and studious is every one's middle name. She is continuously needled by her professors and fellow students. One of these new enemies is Vivian Kensington, who we find out is Warner's fiancé and the reason for the breakup. But among the the doubt she finds Emmett Richmond (Wilson) who seems to be the only person she has thus encountered that has looked at her like she was a smart human being, not a stupid freak. And in true comedy fashion and romantic relationship develops. Elle also befriends and ditzy manicurist Paulette (Coolidge), who becomes her best friend and confidant. After a last draw of an insult from her former boyfriend she is thrust into full determination mode to prove her infinite worth and intelligence. No longer will she be the laughing stock.She soon gains the attention of Professor Callahan who picks her for an internship during a criminal trial case he is defending. Again, we meet Emmett who is the only person who thinks she really has the power to do what she wants. Callahan, we find out is a son of a bitch who hits on her and only even chose for his internship because she was beautiful. Again down in the dumps, the defendent, Brooke Windham (Larter), who has gained Elle's trust replaces Callahan with Elle and OF COURSE, Elle wins the case by doing what she does best- knowing everything about beauty care.Elle Woods is an excellent role model and this is a movie that deserves to be watched by all young women. It proves that if you are put in a place that people don't think you belong in-you can still succeed without compromising who you are, you style or what you believe in. Elle Woods embodies that completely.I recommend this movie whole-heartedly. This is definitely a movie I will show to my younger cousins and my kids someday.",Legally Blonde

Trying to get her man back she goes to major lengths - even leaving her serority Delta Nu to join his law school. The film was so well planned out that it was as if you were part of the many situations with Elle Woods! It also shows that any one can make it anywhere no matter what their appearance is or their first impression is like - discrimination is totally forgotten in Legally Blonde!

401,Haroonrajah238,Legally Blonde,9,21 April 2006,"For anyone that wants to laugh till they have no more tears to cry this is what you're looking for. Not only is this an ingenious piece of comedy cinema, it also stars Hollywood babes such as Reese Witherspoon and Selma Blair, which I'm sure no one is complaining about. Reese Witherspoon always a treat to a persons eyes looks even more lovely and radiant than ever in this film, or to put it bluntly she looks damned fine throughout the film. With hilarious jokes and comedy pieces such as one occasion when Elle Woods, Reese Witherspoon's character, goes to a party but the bitchy Vivienne Kensington, played by Selma Blair, has told her its a costume party. Needless to say she turns up in a very comical outfit, the result: unstoppable laughter.For a basic overview the film is about a blonde bimbo who gets dumped by her boyfriend, because he wants to marry a smart lawyer or other such girl, because thats what his upper class family of serious law types expect. The lovely and naive Elle Woods(Witherspoon) will not be left behind that easily however and decides to follow her boyfriend,leaving her sorority home filled with other bimbo types for the somewhat more serious Harvard Law School. With muchcramming, and the help of her two sexy best friends in her interview video she manages to get accepted into Harvard, proving from the onset that she's more than a pretty face.Once at Harvard, however she realises that though she came to Harvard for a man she has discovered a new passion, the law, and excels in her studies. Harvard is where she encounters other obstacles and hidden evils such as a corrupt college professor and Vivienne Kensington(Blair) and co who are less than amused by her cheerful naivety and surprising intelligence. Elle also finds good friends like Emmet Richmond played by Luke Wilson and Paulette Bonafonte played by the very funny and very sexy Jennifer Coolidge.However she manages to overcome these obstacles, and also finds that her knowledge of beauty and makeup etc is more than helpful in her college studies and in her court cases. Eventually she also realises that shes too good for the loser who dumped her, and finally lets go of her past and with it her ex boyfriend, instead she looks forward and fills the gap in her heart with a new handsome man. In the end she graduates from Harvard and starts the bright journey ahead of her. In short, it's a bit girlie, but also compulsory viewing and often quite serious and touching. You'll be laughing and crying alternately, but emerge with a warm happy feeling as you see Elle overcome hate and corruption to become truly, Legally Blonde.A great feel good, laugh out loud movie.",Legally Blonde

But it's a great movie, and it's one that I would recommend to any girl, although I'm sure that every girl has seen it by now. I'd never seen Reese Witherspoon much before this movie, but since seeing this movie she has become one of my favorite actresses.

Other than the lead, you can't identify with anyone. Some characters, like Vivian Kensington, completely change without warning.

And while I really like the concept, ""Legally Blonde"" did not pull it off. Instead of wittily written, satirical characters, all this movie provided was annoying caricatures and irritating stereotypes.Everything in this movie was completely predictable. There was nothing new to it. It followed every convention and formula that Hollywood has to offer. If you've seen any movie that has ever been made, you'll know what happens next. Keep in mind, I can appreciate movies in this genre from time to time. Hell, I loved ""Dude, Where's My Car?""

(Substitute law school for boxing.) The heroine bravely overcomes improbable odds through hard work and dedication. And she does it with style.

There are some exaggerated sides to the movie that are charmingly pushed to a sweet extreme making the movie seem a bit unreal from time to time yet keeping it marvelously entertaining.I would recommend this movie to anybody who is in need of a good time and some good laughs.To those who have already seen it: I hope you agree that Reese Witherspoon is one brilliant blonde!",Legally Blonde

Reese did her best to make something out of it but it was an uphill battle since the rest of the cast were forced to play stereotypes magnified by hyperbole. I kept hoping it would get better and, time after time, the movie just said, in effect: ""If you believed that, take a look at this improbability."" By the time, Elle's California chums showed up at the trial, I was almost in tears of sadness at the wasted film and the wasted talents of everyone from Anthony Perkins' son to a perfectly charming dog who - you could tell - was ashamed to be seen in this film. I love movies and I rarely disparage one but I was so sadly disappointed in this movie.

420,little_princess_of_charm,Legally blonde - best film Eva,10,17 July 2006,"￼""Don't judge a book by its cover."" Yet again an extraordinary humorous performance bought to us by Reese Witherspoon which makes Legally Blonde a true winner. The film was released on the Thirteenth July 2001 and produced by Mark Platts. It was directed by Australian director Robert Luketic, who made his name directing the award winning short film Titsiana Booberini in 1997. Legally Blondewas Luketic's first mainstream Hollywood film, it took the world by storm being nominated for two golden globes and winning six awards. The screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith is inspired by the book Legally Blonde written by Amanda Brown. The Legally Blonde soundtrack is very girlie and if you listen to the lyrics it's also very strengthening. It is full of songs telling girls that they don't need a guy to tell them they're pretty, to make them beautiful and that they can be a 'one girl revolution,' this is the second song featured on the soundtrack and is sung by a group called Superchick. This soundtrack is a very feminist CD and any girl would love it. Elle Woods, a Hawaiian tropic girl, played by Reese Witherspoon comes across as a stereotypical ""dumb blonde."" She is president of her sorority Delta Nu and has everything any girl would want, including the hottest boyfriend, on campus and dreams of being Mrs. Warner Huntington III. She is Miss June in her sorority calendar, and all above she is a natural blonde. She grew up across the street from Aaron Spelling in LA and this emphasises on how moneyed a background she comes from. Elle is a fashion major, which is so obvious from the beginning but she makes it emphasises on the point even more when she says ""And last week I saw Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal, and I talked her out of buying this truly heinous angora sweater. Whoever said orange was the new pink was seriously disturbed."" She absolutely loves shopping and getting pampered, she cares about her looks and her boyfriend a lot and is shocked when he dumps her. Elle has a pet Chihuahua called Bruiser who is also pampered just like Elle and goes everywhere with her, she even throws him birthday parties, and in my opinion this dog lives Elle's life. In Elle's live friends, (including bruiser of course) family and beauty are the three main things and no matter what they always will be. Reese Witherspoon had to prepare for her role as Elle Woods by spending two weeks studying the behaviour of real life sorority girls, as she was concerned that she may portray Elle as a stereotypical airhead. In the DVD commentary Reese points out on how polite and kind these girls actually were and she says she really enjoyed the experience. To emphasise on Elle's blondness Reese Witherspoon went through an amazing forty different hairstyles throughout the duration of the film. In this film Elle wore some absolutely stunning outfits which most girls would dream of and luckily for her, as agreed on the contract she got to keep every single one of them. Witherspoon's acting within this film is a hallmark for her career, and she is still known for it today Warner Huntington III is played by the very much admired actor Matthew Davis. Warner grew up in an east coast blue blood family, and much like Elle is surprisingly rich and spoilt. In his life his parents expect him to go to Harvard Law School to become a future Senator. The only problem is that Warner doesn't think Elle will be smart enough, this shows how shallow his personality is.",Legally Blonde
421,think1066,"I found it funny (which is fine), but nothing more",1,23 September 2001,"If you are searching for a lightweight comedy with some clever acting (especially Reese Witherspoon) then I can recommend this movie. If you are searching for a film with any insight about overcoming stereotypes (even the usual banal Hollywood offering), then look elsewhere. Although the plot was predictable, there were some funny moments that I enjoyed. Reese Witherspoon is a talented actress (both comedic and dramatic) and I look forward to seeing her in future roles. But, beyond the level of a predictable comedy, no one should look for any depth in this movie. SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW. For those of you (and apparently there are a few) who feel a desire to find a message in this movie, I need point out only one fundamentally flawed character (amongst many possible choices) for whom we are apparently supposed to feel compassion (because she is being stereotyped), but who is in fact detestable -- Brooke Taylor-Windham (played by Ali Larter). A woman who marries an older man (apparently because she likes the sex) but feels no compassion for the man's daughter (who is seemingly distraught about having a step-mother of about the same age as she). A woman who deceives her clients in order to make money. A woman who demeans her employees (she makes the pool man wear a thong because she likes the way he looks when he bends over). And yet we are supposed to cheer when she fires her lawyer (played by Victor Garber) because he is a creep (which he is). Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. The movie itself contains so many stereotypes (e.g., Dorky Dave, who can't get a date without Elle's noble intervention, while she herself only dates good-looking guys) that there is no reason to look beyond the comedic element for something deeper (it doesn't exist). Enjoy it for what it is, nothing more.",Legally Blonde

And that's fine.  But every film has a message, like it or not.  This film stereotypes many groups, obviously striking first at the affluent caucasian sorority women that open the film.Comic art, and some would say all art, depends at least to an extent on stereotypes and 'archetypes'.  But the film's depiction of gay men goes from embarrassingly ignorant at first, to almost hateful, as the film's plot comes to its climax.  That aside -- and it's a strong point in my opinion; I'd like to know what others think after seeing the movie -- the plot is far too simplistic, even for silly fun.  I felt at times as though I was watching a Saturday morning cartoon. (Not Bugs Bunny, mind you; something like Scooby Doo or Josie and the Pussycats.)  Characters speak their subtext: ""Girls like us don't go out with guys like you.""

435,haruru-2,Funny and pretty girl's movie!!,8,27 November 2006,"""Legally Blonde"" is one of my favorite movies.The first reason is that it is a funny and witty movie.Elle Woods(Reese Witherspoon) is a heroine of the story.She has a beautiful blonde who is always wearing something pink.One day,she was dumped by her boyfriend,Warner.Because she is so blonde and seems to be shallow-minded.After that,she decided to be a serious girl who will be loved by Warner.So,she got into Harvard Law School to study with him.She experienced a lot of troubles at the Law School and at a law firm such as sexual harassment.None the less,she got over them cheerfully with her self-confidence.Some time,she is a little crazy.Butit is also cute and fun and I feel her strength.Secodly,why I like this movie is Elle's fashion.Every day,she wears sweet clothes and accessories.Girls and women will certainly have interest in her lovely fashion.And I'm sure that you will love this film.I hope you enjoy it.I rate this movie at 8 out of 10!!",Legally Blonde

Reese Witherspoon did an excellent job, as usual. The supporting cast wasn't up to her level, but the were definitely quite competent. Elle was at least not as completely shallow as we were led to believe in the beginning and she seemed to honestly have a good heart.I'll definitely recommend it to others.",Legally Blonde

(never done that before). Reese Witherspoon is so appropriate for this leading role Elle Woods. Her acting surely is outstanding and leaves people feel - wow!!!! Her lovely facial expressions, her eyes, her lips, body movements are so appropriately  well in bringing out a kind-hearted, trust-worthy, some how naive but strong and faithful Elle Woods and her transforms to success without giving up her faith. She simply just acts alive Elle, whom is such a lovable character.And Reese is so well spoken and firm and nice pronunciation in English (I am a non native English speaker, I just love Reese's way of speaking)that makes her a very plausible lawyer. I guess Director Robert Luketic has good eyes picking Reese. And it is a pleasure to see her acts very naturally that does feel like she is acting at all (sometimes you feel it with Gwyneth Paltrow - personal opinion, no offense) Reese surly is talented and you would just start to love her too!!",Legally Blonde

443,okamychichi,An Experience Of Mine,7,14 June 2007,"My first impression to Elle Woods is ""She spent a lot of time on dressing up herself."" AS a young girl, I used to wear my mom's clothes secretly just wanted to be graceful and elegant. Therefore, when I grew older I started to wear my mom's clothes whenever I want to(Of course, with my mom's permission first) and I spent more time on my hairstyle and fingernails, too. Sometimes, I even put on some cosmetics. Aithough this sounds quite stupid and funny(because I was only ten years old), I just want to be more attractive. Thus, I started to fall behind the class. My parents were worried about me, but I just answered them coldly ""Whatever!"" After months went by, I a little girl fell in love with a boy in our class. This was a real turning point in my life. Because the boy who I like has always been the first place, that didn't made me felt frustrated, instead it awoke me from my beautiful dream. I told myself""If I don't study hard, he will never notice me even if I dress up like a super model."" In the end , I didn't express the feeling in my deep heart,though,I thanked him for leading me to the road of success. Hence, when I saw this movie ""Legally Blonde"" I saw a little bit of myself in it unexpectedly. So if you haven't woke up from your dearest dream. Do,now!

The key to watching this movie, like ""Charlie's Angels,"" is not to take it to seriously and just enjoy it.  In fact, I thought the story was interesting and the characters well developed.The plot, of course, is predictable. We know Elle is going to win in the end.  I think that is part of the fun, however, and leads to some very touching and funny moments.  Maybe if this was an art-house movie, Elle would have been crushed and defeated.  But it isn't and so the plot has to be obvious.  I had fun rooting for Elle and genuinely enjoyed seeing her come out on top.The sad part is that for every well made fun movie like Legally Blonde, Hollywood releases 50 crappy ones in the same genre.  Don't be fooled, however.  This movie is very good.I think those who didn't like Legally Blonde see too much of themselves in the snobby, pretentious, and prejudiced intellectuals the film so accurately portrays.  As a famous Clint Eastwood character said, ""It is what people know about themselves inside that makes them afraid.""",Legally Blonde

The plot, characters, and the acting was all a bunch of clichés, with a predictability worse than all of Jean-Claude Van Damme's movies together. One of the elements that could have kept this movie on a higher level was the humor, but then again - there was none of it!!! Compared with other movies in the genre, a movie like ""Clueless"" was a lot better - at least there was something to laugh about!!My advice - Don't watch it, if you like a little bit of quality!",Legally Blonde

I would like to see a third movie introduced to the public. I believe that another title for this would be Elle Woods:Attorney at Law.

450,makeev01,Legally Blonde,7,24 March 2008,"ATTENTION ALL GUYS! If you are in the doghouse, this could be the movie that gets you out. If you take your girlfriend/wife to see this film, she will forget the reason she was mad. This film is the perfect girl film and she will love it. Legally Blonde shows that first impressions are not always the best. In the film, Elle (Reese Whitherspoon) is the typical sorority girl that everyone loves and admires. Just when everything seems to be going her way, her boyfriend Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis) breaks up with her because her intelligence level is not up to par with what his family expects him to be with. This makes Elle furious and she sets out to prove him wrong by enrolling at Harvard Law School. When she arrives at Harvard, she finds out that Warner is engaged to Vivian Kensignton (Selma Blair). This gives Elle another mission that needs to be accomplished while she is attending Harvard. She needs to break up Warner and Vivian and win Warner back. Although her goals start with winning Warner back, her college experience opens many new opportunities in her life.The director, Robert Luketic, supports this theme by using a long establishing shot. In the scene where Elle is in the hall going to her first class at Harvard Law School she ends up passing Warner in the hallway. Knowing what he thinks of her, she passes him until he stops her and then she replies with one of the famous quotes from the film, ""I totally forgot you go here"". By Warner knowing that Elle got into Harvard Law School was not enough to change his mind about her. They have a brief conversion and then they both go on their own way. This long establishing shot of Elle walking down the hallway presents that Elle is confident and that she will prove everyone that portrays her as the typical blonde will be wrong.Legally Blonde has numerous references to The Paper Chase, directed by James Bridges. Both films take place at Harvard Law School. The scene where Elle is in the library looking for a study group she approaches Warner's study group. She asks to join the study group with the line, ""I brought you sustenance"". In The Paper Chase, the main character complains to his girlfriend that she failed to bring sustenance. Another reference that is made is Elle is a sister of the Delt Nu sorority and the Delta Gamma is the sorority that is mentioned in The Paper Chase.Legally Blonde is the ultimate girl movie. This film presents a good moral standard that first impression are not always the best, so we must not judge someone on the first impression but get to know them first. Although the theme is presented through comedy, it gets the point across to the audiences and will affect the audiences that watch it.",Legally Blonde

This movie is a great pick -me - up for anyone who loves non-blonde or fashion humor.",Legally Blonde
456,CyraEm,The Best Role Model,10,15 August 2010,"It seems that this movie gets a bad reputation as being airheaded and ridiculous. Frankly, I think that's a judgement hastily made. Elle Woods is a perfect role model, and a great person, and her journey to learn to expect more from herself than aesthetic acheivements is meaningful and familiar to anyone who has ever lost opportunities because of the first impression that their appearance conveys. Nobody expects anything from Elle, because she is blonde and dresses a certain way, and so she expects nothing from herself, content to be the wife of a lawyer and nothing more. But, as she grows throughout the film, she realizes what more can be had from seeking a fulfilling and challenging education and career.She is intelligent from the beginning, and very strong. She has a 4.0, top honors, graduates as Valedictorian. She works hard, and is a kind, genuine person. She's everything that we all want to be, and should be. Driven, hard-working, groomed, smart and sweet. She's everything you could ever want to be.Beginning the movie with her eyes on marriage and nothing else, Elle Woods is set to be yet another trophy wife. Her aspirations are curtailed, however, when the 'love of her life', Warner, leaves her on the pretense of needing someone more serious. A senator's wife.Feeling desperate to win him back, Elle works tirelessly over the summer to get into Harvard Law School, the school Warner will be attending, to prove that she can be serious. this is the first time in the film that we are shown her real talents.It would seem that there is more to Elle than meets the eye. While beautiful and cheery, as we've come to expect from upper-class daughters, she is also incredibly intelligent and fiercely ambitious. Up until this point in her life, she has drifted through fashion majors and sorority events, perfectly content, but now, with her eye on this lofty goal, she charges ahead, full speed.After getting into Harvard, she charges straight into a brick wall, as she is teased and taunted and treated horribly by everyone around her, not least of which is Warner's new fiancé, Vivian. Realizing, after some time, that nothing she ever does will be good enough for her ex, she becomes determined to prove her worth to those who are quick to judge her on her appearance. She is soon top of every class, a favorite among professors, and is chosen, among others, to be an intern to a professor as he argues the defense on a murder case.This is where Elle really shines. She knows the accused, from her sorority, and is able to work to win the case. But, I should stop before I give away anything too important.I love this movie, and I love its main character.",Legally Blonde

It truly has stood the test of time. At first sight, it is an extremely hilarious movie that makes you laugh and laugh even harder. But, when you look deeper, it contains so many thoughtful, useful and applicable messages and themes.

I enjoyed it thoroughly, and felt it had a positive message, dealt with it's plot and characters very respectfully, and ultimately did what a good comedy should, which is make me laugh. I enjoyed it more as a movie than I did as a comedy though. I would say it's a A- movie overall, but only a B in terms of the comedy.

459,allisoncarolinelayton,Anti-feminism at it's best!,5,12 December 2013,"While Legally Blonde was, and is a great film even today, it is an extremely sexist movie full of anti-feminism. For those who need a reminder, Elle Woods was a stereotypical ""dumb blonde"" who had the dream life and dream boyfriend. When her boyfriend went to Harvard, Elle was determined to get him back, and used all her resources to get into Harvard, later becoming the top of her class and a very successful lawyer. Legally Blonde proved to be very derogatory, and negative towards women. Nevertheless, this film is very anti-feministic as it displayed the woman as the inferior and the man as her superior. There is no reason why girls are considered less capable than men. Elle's boyfriend was placed on a pedestal, as if Elle was and never would be as good as him. However, she grew way beyond him and passed him both in academics and her career with flying colors. Another point, is that women in general are expected to dress in conservative male-style suit attire, but Elle expressed her femininity and style through her wardrobe both in and out of court by wearing ""feminine"" colors as well as some provocative clothing. Overall, Elle overcame the traditional, anti-feministic stereotype of being a blonde female, and transformed herself into an extremely intelligent, independent young woman.",Legally Blonde
460,Nick110714,very problematic film,5,5 April 2005,"Robert Luketic's Legally Blonde (2001) problematically depicts women as socially and intellectually inferior. During the opening sequence, the camera travels through a sorority house, depicting the members of this social organization participating in social rituals such as putting on make-up, exercising, cheer leading, etc. Immediately, the film suggests that women have nothing better to do all day than to spend time making themselves look beautiful and rehearsing social patterns of behavior. Not only does the film fail to show women participating in meaningful intellectual, financial, or social interactions, the girls seem to gain a perverse sense of pleasure from enhancing their appearance and expecting the desire of their male suitors. When the camera finally arrives at the room of the film's main character, Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), the viewer can see a package of hair products, featuring a woman smiling, suggesting that in order for a woman to be happy, she must improve her appearance. These ideas culminate when Elle's friends help her spend the entire day preparing for the highly-anticipated proposal of marriage from her boyfriend, as if her existence is dependent upon her male lover's acceptance of her as a suitable companion. When he does not propose to her, and she tries to walk home by herself, he convinces her to let him drive her home because she doesn't want to ruin her shoes. Her expensive high-heels symbolize her literal and figurative immobility as a woman, crippled by the expectations of her gender to equate her self-worth with her ability to please men visually and socially. Just like the little dog kept in her handbag, Elle is trapped in a world of social assumptions that will prevent her from obtaining meaningful success intellectually or financially.Elle does not attend Harvard for the purpose of improving herself intellectually or building a foundation for a professional career, she applies because she wants to impress her ex-boyfriend. These goals suggest that the only way she can improve herself is by gaining the favor of a male suitor; the only career she is capable of managing is marriage. The film represents Harvard, although most likely accurately, but also problematically, as an ultra-conservative, male-dominated sphere that would only accept Elle on a fluke. When she submits a resume for an internship, she hands in a pink sheet of paper scented with perfume. When the professor asks why she would handed in a resume with these unnecessary features, she responds, ""To give it something extra,"" implying that her resume is not good enough on its own; as a woman she has to add superficial elements in order to prove her worth.Another problematic sequence is the relationship she develops with the overweight, lazy woman, who works at the nail salon. Elle meets this woman only because she performed poorly in class and can only comfort herself by enhancing her appearance, not by improving her understanding of the course material as the other students have done. Elle convinces this woman to get her dog back from her ex-husband, but she can only accomplish this goal by fooling the husband by regurgitating legal jargon she does not understand. Elle does not prioritize this woman's emotional stability, horrible work ethic, or pathetic self-respect; this poor woman has attached her self-worth to the possession of a domestic animal. Elle later teaches all of the women in the salon to ""bend and snap"" to show off their bodies for men, implying that in order to get the attention of a male, they have to purposefully make a mistake and drop something so that they can display their physical attractiveness.Elle eventually wins her case in the trial, not because of her knowledge of the legal system, but only because she has an extensive understanding of female hair products that happen to help her prove her argument. The film does not realistically represent how she will fair in the legal world when she will not be able to rely on her knowledge of beauty products to win cases. She only had the opportunity to participate in the internship because the professor was trying to seduce her in the first place. Other women are problematically represented as well, including the celebrity woman who would rather go to jail than to have the media learn that she had liposuction; her identity is constructed upon the attractiveness of her physical body, which she medically manipulated to meet the impossible standards of the male gaze. A woman who identifies as a lesbian is demonized throughout the film. The only socially-enlightened character, ironically, appears to be un-insightful, judgmental, and prejudiced.",Legally Blonde

462,linboshark,little self-consciousness,4,22 June 2005,"The way I see this film is quite different from others. Though we are impressed by the passion and kindness of Elle Wood, she didn't have her own idea about her future. Even though every time there was a big frustration, it turned out to be a better change in her life, bringing big success and honor, she never really knew the things she really wanted. I will give further explanation on this point. For instance, in order to get so-called her love of life back, she took all the pains to get to Harvard law school. Then what happened? She dumped Warner. I think Elle's choice is right, but why didn't she get to know him well enough before she thought Warner deserved her love and decided to waste her time to earn him back? I think it is because she didn't have life planning. She was used to approach problems and make decisions with heart rather than brain, which lead to easy give-up in front of unexpected frustrations. She always said Law school was a mistake and she wished she had never gone to Harvard after so much work and efforts.It is what I'd like to call little self-consciousness.",Legally Blonde

What I really like about the movie is that Elle Woods never changes her personality or her being: she is the same person and adapts herself to every problem she has so it can be solve in her way: classy and chic. It makes girls look powerful not for being girls, for the power in the decisions. It make look like a silly movie, but it's not. Totally recommended for when you are down and want some inspiration.

It was fun to see a beautiful woman use her brain and intellectually kick the living daylights out of the idiot men around her. It was also a good lesson proving that just because you are beautiful or cute, you do not need to be a snob or cruel to others around you. She was nice to EVERYONE no matter what station in life and that defines a true lady. I liked this lead character a lot and thought she set a good example for today's kids.

Actor Reese Witherspoon plays college student Elle Woods, a charming, bubbly, and kind heart-ed Los Angeles sorority girl who positively impacts the lives of everyone she encounters. After being dumped by Warner, her Harvard Law-bound boyfriend, Elle is heartbroken. He expressed to Elle that he is obligated to marry, ""a Jackie not a Marylyn."" Not taking no for an answer, Elle decides to follow her heart and leave her sorority and attend Harvard Law in order to win him back. Reese's excellent acting, production elements, and the overall message of the film will leave you wanting more. With her bleach blonde hair and designer clothing, she is seen as a Barbie doll, or a ""dumb blonde"", before being credited for her intelligence and positive influence on others. Reese portrays Elle perfectly, in an extremely comical way yet still particularly believable. Her tone of voice can change drastically based on her mood, and her humor is contagious. She carries a great deal of confidence and charisma with her, and speaks with such positive's to everyone which is special to watch. Elle encourages others to do their best which makes being the viewer inspirational because you feel like you are able to take the motivation and positive's that Elle shows in the film, and use in it your own personal life. Elle's life is a roller-coaster of excitement, which means sororities, men, crazy friendships, and lots of fun and glamour which is a treat in itself to watch. The camera work is pleasing to the eyes, and the soundtrack is agreeable to the ears. In the beginning of the movie when the sorority was first introduced, the camera frame perfectly captured the essence of what the common audience would picture a sorority to look like: the women were working out, putting on make-up, and doing their hair while upbeat music played in the background, which effectively set the scene and gave the audience the knowledge of where Elle Woods comes from. Sure, that could be boring to watch if you are not interested in stereotypical ""chick-flicks."" However, the sarcasm and humor that the characters use appeal to anyone and everyone. Elle's life can make anyone envious and the camera work, and the soundtrack only add to the pleasure. Every song fits the emotional state of Elle Woods, which can range from heart break, to over the moon with joy. Overall this movie will make you laugh until you cry, and just plain ole' cry from the emotional connection you feel from the characters in Elle's life. This movie can boost your spirits by making you feel that anything is possible. Following Elle's relationship and life journey is an experience that will keep you guessing and laughing all the way through the film. Whether you just got out of a relationship, need a little motivation or are just looking for a good laugh this light heart-ed movie will appeal to any of your needs.",Legally Blonde

472,yamato-51763,This funny comedy gives you encouragement!,8,22 February 2017,"Legally Blonde is a romantic comedy. It is a very famous movie in America, and it has two sequels. This movie is the first story of the series, and it was nominated for 2 Golden Globes. It stars Reese Witherspoon, and is directed by Robert Luketic. The story is about a blonde girl Elle Woods. She is so pretty and a queen of the lady's social club, and she has a smart and cool boyfriend. However, she is dumped by him because she is not smart. She decides to follow him to school(Harvard Law School) and studies very hard. Finally, she can enroll in the school and after the enrollment, she notices she has more legal ability than her past boyfriend. At the end of the story, she becomes a lawyer and gets a new boyfriend who is more intelligent and cooler than her old boyfriend! The story is funny but it can give you a lot of encouragement and motivation to do something. Moreover, one of my favorite messages is not to judge people only by appearance. In this movie, Elle Woods is considered not smart because of her hair and colorful clothes, but she can work harder than anyone. The story has many other messages. If you haven't watched it yet, you should check it out!",Legally Blonde

474,sannekrol-31778,The movie is about a girl who tries to get in to Harvard Law school to get her ex-boyfriend back. But when she arrives everything changes...,9,24 September 2017,"Have you ever heard about the movie Legally Blonde? Well, I have certainly heard about it, but I just never watched it. That changed last night. I was a kind of tired and it didn't seem like a hard to watch movie. So I decided to put on Legally Blonde.In the beginning you just get to know the character (Elle Woods) a little more. Everything is going wrong (of course), because her boyfriend wants to break up. He thinks Elle is too immature for him, if he ever wants to be a successful lawyer. She wants to prove the opposite to him and decides to go to Harvard Law School all of a sudden. You can imagine that not everything is going as planned for Elle, but will she make up for it?In my opinion this movie is a feelgood movie. You don't really have to think during the movie, you can just sit back. Some scenes in the movie are too crazy to imagine that something like that will ever happen to you, but I think this makes it really fun to watch. Moreover, because you can sit back and relax, you will feel compassion for the main character during the movie. On the other hand you can predict most of the movie, because most of the events you've seen in dozen of the movies. There is not really an element of surprise in the film and I think that's a pity. Overall I really liked watching this movie and I would recommend it, because it will really gives you a happy feeling and it is quite funny.",Legally Blonde

476,charmed_goddess_123,The best film ever!,10,14 June 2006,"I think that this film has to be one of Reese's best, she is so ace and funny its unbelievable! I love the part when she discovers who murdered Brooke's step daughter killed her dad. Especially when we see that the cleaner is gay that is great! My favourite quote has to be when Elle says to Vivian: You Too. Except when I dress up as a frigid bitch, I try not to look so constipated. Also did you know that Selma Blair who plays Vivian also stars in Cruel Intentions alongside Reese? Also with Reese's husband Ryan Phillipe and Sarah Michelle Gellar? I love Legally blonde first and second! I also would like to say who agrees that Luke Wilson (Emmet) is quite cute? Even though he is a bit old still i think he is really gorgeous for his age! Love Carly xx",Legally Blonde
