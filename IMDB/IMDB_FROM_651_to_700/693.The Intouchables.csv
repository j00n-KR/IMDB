0,MartinHafer,Very nice acting.,8,17 March 2013,"According to IMDb, ""The Intouchables"" set all sorts of box office records--the second most successful French film in history in France as well as the number one film for 2012 in Germany. So, because of this very impressive pedigree I was perhaps expecting a little more. Now this is NOT to say it's a bad film--it's wonderful. It just didn't seem quite THAT wonderful. But it IS well worth seeing.As for the plot, this movie is a true-life account of a quadriplegic man (François Cluzet) in search of a new aide. However, all the folks who apply for the job seem the same--boring and sterile. On an odd lark, he chooses an unqualified man who doesn't seem interested in the job at all (Omar Sy). And, oddly, they form a friendship that seems to reinforce the old adage that opposites attract.While the plot is amazingly thin and seems to be missing chunks of the story, the film is masterful in several ways. The acting (particularly by Sy) is just terrific. But even more terrific is the artistry of the film itself. It takes a somewhat ordinary story and injects it with class--including some wonderful cinematography and one of the nicest soundtracks I have ever heard. It is a lovely film.",The Intouchables
1,SnoopyStyle,8.5 Rating? Really?,6,6 September 2013,"This is a feel-good French movie full of all the stereotypes based on a true story. I won't rate the real story. But how does it stand as a movie? Philippe is an aristocratic quadriplegic white millionaire living in Paris, and he's interviewing for a personal carer. Driss is an arrogant African who is only interviewing to get a signature for his social assistance form.The characters are truly stereotypes. On top of it all, I don't particularly like either characters. Philippe is uptight but his paralysis really restrict his acting. Driss is Arrogant Without Reason. Add a stereotypical large immigrant family, and you've got the standard street hustler.When Driss draws a painting, everybody is surprised. Why? I didn't know black people can't draw. Are the French really that racist and ignorant? The actual man this character is based on is a Muslim. That would have been a fascinating in-depth character rather than this simplistic caricature. There was one possible great moment. Driss stole a Fabergé egg from Philippe. When Philippe brings it up, there were many different ways it could have gone. The film chooses one of the least interesting. That's indicative of the whole movie. I don't hate the movie. I'm just ambivalent. Definitely no more than 6/10. It's insane that this is a 10 in anybody's rating.",The Intouchables
2,Prismark10,Chasing the clouds away,6,9 June 2019,"I was surprised by Untouchable. I did not think that a French film about a wealthy quadriplegic and his black working class carer would be a comedy. Instead I thought the film would be bogged down with race, cultural and class issues.Francois Cluzet who looks a lot like former F1 world champion Nigel Mansell plays Phillipe. A wealthy widowed aristocrat living in a fabulous Parisian mansion paralyzed from the neck down in a paragliding accident. He needs round the clock care and none of them last long.Philippe meets Driss (Omar Sy) who is of Senegalese origin. He only attends the job interview to get a signature so he can get his unemployment benefits. Despite being a small time criminal, Philippe likes his irreverence and verve and employs him.Driss is physically strong but he also brings Philippe to life as he drives him around in one of Philippe's fast cars rather than his adapted disabled friendly van. Driss's lack of stuffiness is exactly what Philippe needed.Untouchable is a feel good buddy comedy of two men from different tracks of life who bond. It is really a simple story based on true facts, although the real life carer was a French Arab. It is an engaging enough film despite its stereotypes. There is a scene where Driss steals a Faberge egg that was given to Phillipe by his late wife.The film decided to go for the funk feel of Earth, Wind and Fire. It helps that both stars have an easy chemistry together.",The Intouchables
3,claudio_carvalho,Beautiful and Uplifting Story of Friendship,9,10 January 2013,"In Paris, the aristocratic and intellectual Philippe (François Cluzet) is a quadriplegic millionaire that is interviewing candidates for the position of his caretaker with his red-haired secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot). Out of the blue, the rude African Driss (Omar Sy) cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks to Phillipe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position to receive his unemployment insurance.Philippe challenges Driss and offers a period of adaptation of one week to him to gain experience helping him. Then Driss would decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the bet and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Phillipe and his employees. ""Intouchables"" is a beautiful and uplifting story of friendship based on a true story. My daughter had watched this movie a couple of months ago when she was traveling on vacation and recommended it a lot to me and yesterday I saw it on DVD.The screenplay is excellent and the directors and writers Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have a magnificent work. This theme in the hands of a weak director could transform the uplifting story into a corny or melodramatic movie. But they succeeded making a funny and touching comedy.The cast is also fantastic, and the chemistry between François Cluzet and Omar Sy is amazing. Anne Le Ny is also wonderful and Audrey Fleurot is a very beautiful woman and excellent actress in her ambiguous role luring Driss. In the end, I went to bed late but feeling good. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Intocáveis (""Untouchables"")",The Intouchables
4,kosmasp,Best friends,9,3 April 2012,"A comedy like that is tough to master. Balancing the funny and the dramatic stuff and still keep enough character development inside. And while I wouldn't say that both characters really redeem themselves (wholly), it gives them nice touches. Touches that include quite a lot of non-PC behavior (be alert and do not watch, if you are sensible to that sort of thing).It is a french comedy with heart. And it was a sleeper hit in Germany. Word of mouth made this a big success. A bit of credit has to go to the people who dubbed it I guess (I watched the original version with subtitles), because they must have done a phenomenal job. It is not perfect, but that fact makes it even weirder and more adorable",The Intouchables
5,classicsoncall,"""Hope keeps us going.""",8,9 August 2014,"I didn't know what to expect with the odd sounding title, and I still don't know if it has any application to what occurs in the picture. However the story is a genuinely inspiring one of two individuals from widely disparate backgrounds who decide to give each other a chance. As the movie unfolds, one's own preconceived notions about having a handicap as severe as Philippe's (Francois Cluzet) are challenged. I found it fascinating when he explained that his real handicap was living without a wife rather than being a quadriplegic. I really had to stop and think about that. Omar Sy provides the film's energy with his indomitable spirit; his birthday party dance to Earth, Wind and Fire's 'Boogie Wonderland' was a trip and did a wonderful job of further breaking down barriers between himself and the upper crust acquaintances of Philippe. Had this not been based on a true story, I would have found it hard to believe coming from some writer's creative imagination. Which only further suggests that sometimes reality is truly stranger and more wonderful than fiction.",The Intouchables
6,gavin6942,A French Look At Race And Class,7,11 November 2014,"After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident, an aristocrat (François Cluzet) hires a young man from the projects (Omar Sy) to be his caretaker.The Independent called it a ""a third-rate buddy movie that hardly understands its own condescension....Why has the world flipped for this movie? Maybe it's the fantasy it spins on racial/social/cultural mores, much as Driving Miss Daisy did 20-odd years ago – uptight rich white employer learns to love through black employee's life-force. That was set in the segregationist America of the 1940s. What's this film's excuse?"" While ""the Independent"" is right to call out the film's unrealistic portrayals of race and class, perhaps it somewhat misses the point. This film is obviously humorous, clearly not based on reality, and is probably not meant to be taken seriously. The movie has very much the same spirit as ""The Birdcage"" (at least the American version, if not the French one).Now, this means the film also happens to be overrated, currently (November 2014) sitting high on IMDb's Top 250. A good comedy, yes, but not a film that offers any sort of deeper meaning or one that will remain important over the long term. While popular and a box office record holder, this is not a title one expects to be considered a ""classic"" later on.",The Intouchables
7,lee_eisenberg,modern France,10,5 January 2015,"Olivier Nakache's and Éric Toledano's ""Intouchables"" looks at the friendship between people of dissimilar backgrounds. Philippe (François Cluzet) is a paraplegic tycoon who hires African immigrant Driss (Omar Sy) to be his caretaker. That paragliding scene made me want to go paragliding.Beyond the obvious plot, I see the movie as a look at France's - and much of Europe's - growing diversity. Even if a person in France or Germany doesn't like immigrants, he's still bound to have exposure to them (much like how racist southerners in the US are going to have exposure to blacks whether they want it or not). Of course, most important is the different backgrounds that the men have: Philippe is a modern aristocrat, while Driss is from the ghetto. Both have something to teach each other.Anyway, it's a really good movie. I recommend it.",The Intouchables
8,Quinoa1984,"it's hearts in the right place and never bad, it's just too... safe for me",6,5 November 2015,"I don't doubt the reasons that people have given for liking very much/loving this film to the point where it became one of France's biggest hits in years and then, not surprising in the least, became a Weinstein Company release in the USA. The Intouchables is the epitome of a ""feel-good"" buddy movie, the kind of movie starring a big black dude that you can show your 90 year old grandmother and she'll take a liking to it as well (unless they have an aversion to, say, pot or Faberge eggs). It's the case of a movie with the kindest, inherently liberal message there is: a man from the projects lucks into a job (via Earth, Wind & Fire and Kool and the Gang as his 'references' at a brief interview), and it's taking care of a very rich man who is a quadriplegic. Over the course of this story they'll grow and become best friends and while the rich white guy can learn to relax a little more, smoke some weed (no, really) and listen to that Kool & the Gang, the dude from the projects gets some Vivaldi, makes an abstract painting that sells for 11 grand, and goes paragliding.Other stuff happens as well, but suffice it to say there's no surprises in this movie. That may not be an issue for most out there. For me, as the movie went along, it was just a little too... safe. That may be a word that doesn't really give much critical credence to what's here, and to be fair the actors really help to ground it in a number of scenes. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy keep things at a good, even keel as far as making the material work for their equal levels of charm and (sometimes) dismay. Sy especially shows that he can take what could have been a super-typical ""magical negro"" stereotype and not let us forget he's from a slightly less educated background (and a little rougher - see his comments about the rich man's adopted daughter when she mouths off). So on the acting front it's perfectly fine and in the first half I was interested in where this would be going.When I say 'safe' I mean to say that nothing really dramatic is left out there for any of the characters. Any possible conflicts get swept up and resolved even before the third act begins (it almost seem,s like Driss gets some time off working just so he can resolve his small conflicts, or those with his sorta-brother, and then come back). Even with the overriding emotional beat of Philippe's correspondent-love-interest, I never felt any sense that these people would not be together by the end; there's one little bump in this road, maybe two, though it's only with the sense that 'hey, I'm quadriplegic, can't let her see that'. I get that it's something to make us feel for him, that he needs to overcome his fears. But I think a big part of it is an overall 'light' touch; yes, Driss may have a criminal background, and yes he has a big family to support in the projects (not that we see much of them, which seems like an odd choice that they just accept this), and sure Philippe has seemingly all the money in the world (where does he get it from, who knows, rich family, they never say).So in other words, there are stakes here, but given that this man can't walk or move, or that Driss has an upward climb in life, it all comes back to just... silly jokes in a lot of scenes, playful flirting between Driss and a woman in the main house not having it, life lessons learned in montage. It's a movie that has a heart in a good place, I can't question that, and being that it's based on a true story (and boy does the ending remind you!) it's hard to say this wasn't credible in the sense of it coming from real life in a certain way. It may be a certain feeling like it's running through things I could see in a lessor TV movie, the beats of conflicts that one might see on a sitcom even (again the teenage girl plot, where she never feels like a character, just a thing that gets used from time to time to move little events forward). Even the moment where the third act gets into gear, a little conflict as Driss has to go away to fix some things and they call it quits, it's just... OK.If you love this movie, I'm happy for you. For me, it just didn't win me over completely - not so much manipulation or pulling at the heartstrings (though it tries at times), just an overall feeling like it's missing some things that could make it FEEL more important, more substantive.",The Intouchables
9,sunwarrior13,An Odd Friendship,10,20 October 2012,"The Intouchables is a French film that is about an irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility.A rich quadriplegic, living in a mansion in Paris, requires a live-in carer. A young offender turns up for an interview, but he is not really looking to get the job. However, to his surprise, he is hired. The two men then develop a close friendship.It features François Cluzet and Omar Sy; and it was directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano. There are countless magical moments worth recounting - many with humor and involving the clash of the classes - it is not surprising that the film has been a runaway hit in France and elsewhere in Europe.Capturing the unspoken shorthand, the adventurousness and the humor essential to enduring friendships makes the The Intouchables must see as it handles its potentially prickly subject matter with kid gloves.Added to that, it gets by thanks to its strong cast and some remarkably sensitive direction.",The Intouchables
10,writers_reign,A Touch Of The Poet,9,21 September 2012,"Unlike their counterparts in the rest of the world critics in the UK - where it opened today, months after its initial release last year - have been giving this movie a hard time. I would have thought that people who spend their working lives watching one violent film after the other punctuated by mindless horror, teenage pap and worse would find a film like Untouchable a pleasant antidote but that doesn't seem to be the case and the fact that it's all true - we learn in end captions that both men remain close - appears irrelevant. So much for hacks; the International public have already embraced it and it's more than likely the UK will follow. For many non-French audiences Francois Cluzet appeared on their radar first only six or seven years ago when Tell No One was an International hit. Jazz buffs had registered him as far back as 1986 when he co-starred with Dexter Gordon in 'Round Midnight' (coincidentally another 'true' story based on an unlikely friendship between American Jazz pianist Bud Powell and a young French fan). I personally have yet to see him give even a mediocre performance let alone a bad one; as for Omar Sy this is the first time I've heard his name. There are, of course, precedents for unlikely male bondings in fact Francis Weber, the French writer-director, specialized in the genre in such titles as Le Chevre, Les Compreres, Tais-Toi etc, Daniel Auteuil has also joined in at least twice (Mon meilleur ami, Apres Vous) and so on but despite it being well-worn Untouchables applies a new lick of paint to the genre and delivers a feel good title to remember.",The Intouchables
11,grantss,Great - funny and moving,8,26 September 2016,"Great movie - funny and moving. Engaging and emotive, with some hilarious scenes. Takes a while to get going, but once it does, it moves along at a brisk pace.Great performances by Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy in the lead roles. Good supporting cast too.Historic movie too. The first funny, non-dull and unpretentious French movie. Also the first French movie to not be all about people contemplating the meaning of life for 90+ minutes and then at least one of them committing suicide at the end (spoiler alert).",The Intouchables
12,Boba_Fett1138,This is how a genre movie should be done!,9,31 May 2012,"This movie so easily could had become a forced and melodramatic one but luckily it's one that got made with lots of tact and skill, making this one fine drama, with a comical touch to it as well.Guess that I really like contrasts in movies. The two main characters are complete opposites of each other, in about every way imaginable. Driss is poor, Philippe is rich. Driss is vibrant, Philippe is a quadriplegic. Driss is black, Philippe is white, etcetera. They are a complete mismatch on paper but yet they become best friends, which forms the central point of this movie and works out so well because it gets made believable.They don't just become good friends, they also learn from each other and I believe that they also become better persons because of that. This is were the movie its warmth and soul comes from, in my opinion.It doesn't ever dwell on it that Philippe is bound to a wheelchair and can only move his head, or that Driss is poor and also has a poor relationship with this family. If anything, this movie is a celebration of life, rather than than a movie that will bring you down. The effect of these sort of movies often is that it actually strengthens its drama because you feel far more involved with it, also since the movie doesn't shoves its drama down your throat constantly.There are some small side-plots in the movie but the good news about them is that they don't distract from the main theme and storyline of the movie and the movie never puts its emphasis too much on any of the side-plots or its secondary characters. It keeps a great and effective focus on its main subject, throughout pretty much the entire film.It's a great movie, in every way. It has a good look to it, that isn't cheap or rushed. It's a respectful and professionally made movie, which all paid off for it.Also the acting is just great. Everybody seems perfectly cast in their roles and know how to handle their characters and manage to fit within the style and tone of the overall movie. Of course François Cluzet and Omar Sy carry most of the movie and they did a more than great job with this.It's just a movie I can't say anything bad or negative about. It's well made and effective, which makes this one of the better genre movies out there!9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Intouchables

14,ferguson-6,Let's Dance,8,4 June 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes acting elevates material to a level far beyond what a film might have otherwise deserved. Such is the case with this based-on-a-true-story effort from co-writers and co-directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. Despite the elements of truth, the core material here is a sentimental tale that we have seen before. Francois Cluzet (Tell No One) as Philippe and Omar Sy as Driss turn it into an extremely entertaining story with characters we quickly connect with.Philippe is a wealthy quadriplegic widower who is interviewing candidates for a caregiver. Driss is a recently released from jail street hustler who is just trying to qualify for state benefits by going on the required interviews. Philippe is struck by Driss' direct approach and energy level, and chooses Driss over the room full of more qualified types.The rest of the movie is really a buddy flick where the polar opposites bring much to the other. Philippe slyly gets Driss to use his sharp mind a bit more effectively, and Driss taps into Philippe's hidden lust for life. Though the supporting cast is fine, the film's best scenes are those featuring Philippe and Driss.This is a film from France and much as been made of the filmmakers' decision to change the caregiver from the real life Arab to a more cinema-friendly Black man. The Earth, Wind & Fire dance may be a bit too much, but I choose to believe the casting of Omar Sy was the deciding factor, not his race. He lights up the screen and draws us right into his world and his choices - some of which are better than others.The film shares much with The Sea Inside, Scent of a Woman, and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, but this one has much more humor and bonding than any of those. It doesn't shy away from the melodramatic moments and isn't above trying to generate tears in viewers. There will be a US re-make of this one, but the two lead actors here (especially Mr. Sy) make this one worth seeing.",The Intouchables
15,morrison-dylan-fan,The Untouchables,9,5 November 2017,"Despite hearing about the film for years,the chance to see it has somehow always slipped out of my fingers. Taking a look on BBC iPlayer to see what they had replaced their recent run of rare RKO titles with,I was thrilled to see the movie on the site,which led to me finally getting in touch with a viewing.The plot:A widow quadriplegic called Philippe asks his assistant Magalie to interview candidates for the job of being his care giver. Believing that he will never successfully re-apply for a job again, Driss goes for an interview with Magalie and Philippe,and asks if they can just sign a paper,so that he can claim benefits for attending an interview. Finding his abrupt manner refreshing,Philippe decides to take a gamble and offer Driss the job. Accepting the job,Philippe and Driss soon get in touch with a new chapter in their lives.View on the film:Looking like they have been friends for years, François Cluzet and Omar Sy give utterly superb performances as Philippe and Driss. Appearing in almost every scene together, Sy and Cluzet make the fast bond the appears between them to feel completely natural,with the comedic playful side Sy brings out of the worn-down Driss, perfectly complimenting Cluzet bringing Philippe out of his self- imposed shell.Placing Driss and Philippe on different sides of the wealth/class divide,the screenplay by co-writers/co-directors Olivier Nakache & Eric Toledano unearth the common ground that binds them, as the delicate brush strokes used in Driss getting Philippe to look for love with a new optimism,are used in Philippe guiding Driss to express himself in art. Closing with footage of the real Driss and Philippe,the co-directors and cinematographer Mathieu Vadepied draw their friendship with excellent close-ups that focus on the changes they bring out in each other,as Philippe and Driss become the intouchables.",The Intouchables
16,gradyharp,'Art is the only trace we leave behind.',10,7 March 2013,"Films such as THE INTOUCHABLES come around far too seldom and when they do the public should somehow be advised that here is a cup of magic that could alter the manner in which we relate to each other and to the world tainted by schisms of societal errors. Written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano the film was inspired by the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caregiver Abdel Sellou, discovered by the directors in 'A la vie, à la mort', a documentary film. Of note, the book version of the film's story was written and released after the film enjoyed great success. Written by Abdel Sellou the book 'You Saved My Life' tells the extraordinary true story of the charming Algerian con-man' friendship with a disabled French aristocrat. Sellou's book shows the real man behind Sellou/Driss's smiling face. The book takes us from his childhood spent stealing candy from the local grocery store, to his career as a pickpocket and scam artist, to his unexpected employment as a companion for a quadriplegic. Sellou has never before divulged the details of his past. In many interviews and documentaries, he has evaded or shrugged off the question of his childhood and his stay in prison, until now. He tells his story with a stunning amount of talent, with humor, style, and--though he denies that he has any--humility. Abdel Sellou now lives in Algeria with his wife and three children, where he runs a chicken farm. He remains close to Philippe Pozzo di Borgo, who lives in Morocco with his second wife and two children.The cinematic version of this relationship is an irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility. After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident the aristocratic intellectual Parisian millionaire Philippe (François Cluzet) is interviewing candidates for the position of his caretaker with his secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot). Out of the blue, the rude ex-con African Driss (Omar Sy) cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks to Philippe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position to receive his unemployment insurance. Philippe, impressed that Driss is the only candidate who does not look at him with pity, challenges Driss and offers a period of adaptation of one week to him to gain experience helping him. Then Driss would decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the bet and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Philippe and his employees, especially under the watchful and compassionate eye of the head of the house staff Yvonne (Anne Le Ny). As Driss reluctantly learns to move, feed, and clean Philippe, the two men discover a blunt but vital humor that not only bridges the cultural and class divide between them, but gives Philippe a renewed joy in life - and a chance to turn his passionate epistolary relationship with one Eleanore whom he has never seen into a chance at a second go at life.The only aspect of this film that is somewhat distracting is that the film opens with a car adventure involving both Philippe and Dris which is terrific film making and very funny but does make the film's beginning (after the credits) seem less surprising. A very minor point, especially when the film ends with the same activity but this time drives it to an incredibly touching completion. Highly recommended on every level: both François Cluzet and Omar Sy are brilliant! Grady Harp",The Intouchables
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Intouchables,10,23 December 2012,"Just as how Jack Neo's Ah Boys to Men Part 1 finally took over the box office crown held by Money No Enough more than a decade ago, so did Intouchables take over the French box office equivalent from the quirky comedy Amelie, which was the champ over about the last decade. As the French entry for the Oscar's Best Foreign Film picture next year, I was glad I held out against watching this while on a flight, patiently waiting for it to make its big screen bow here, which it finally did outside of the 2nd Rendezvous of French Cinema earlier this month.There were many moments that made it so easy for me to identify with the movie, especially coming from caregiving, which is never an easy thing to do. Those who have never done it, I'm talking about full time, real time, on the job alertness, and doing everything you can to make things comfortable for the other party. There's no Off button you can use, and anyone in this for full time employment, gets my utmost respect. And watching how the characters here go about their routine, bring back memories that are forever dear to me, and needless to say, these routines and close contact interaction, bring about a new level in relationships.Lifting someone up from bed in back-breaking fashion, it brings new meaning to ""He ain't Heavy, He's my Father"". Tucking someone into bed. Did that too. The gloves for the toilet visit, nothing new, gross that it may be at first. Wheeling someone out to soak in sights and sounds outside of one's home, well, it may be the most inconvenient, but seeing someone's face light up for the rare trip out, is priceless. And these life-affirming, relationship building events may seem to stem from mundane tasks, and tasks we take for granted, such as bathing or just sheer presence to interact without distraction, but to the physically infirm, it means the world.And this is what The Intouchables is about, the story of two men thrown together by fate in what would be an employer-employee relationship that develops into firm friendship, a bromance even if you'd like. Inspired by a true story, Francois Cluzet plays the rich aristocrat Philippe, who is quadriplegic from the neck down from a paragliding accident, and has to rely on an army of helpers and assistances to get through every day. But his primary caregiver never lasts more than a week, given his rather stiff (pardon the pun) ways, until Driss (Omar Sy), a young man with not the most polished resume - he responded to the ad just to chalk up mileage to get welfare - gets hired despite verbally crossing swords during the interview, and soon, a bet turns into what's life-changing for them both, bringing out the best in each other.You can half expect writer-directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano's story to contain the usual clash of cultures and background, with one refined in the arts and the other being quite the rough and gruff, obviously no time to enjoy the finer things in life when one has to worry about bringing home the bacon for an extended family, with trouble brewing when members trying to stay in line with the law. But their story is tinged with so much sensitivity and truth, that it's hard to quibble with the loads of humanity on display, going by the adage that one shouldn't judge a book by its cover, or by one's background or resume. One may be rich, but getting someone else to wait on you, even if providing him or her with a comfortable life, is a different ballgame altogether, especially when one is not kin or kith.But throughout the story, one cannot deny that life can still go on quite comfortably in a material way, with wealth on display, and if there's a minor grouse about this, is how old money gets flaunted around, with Meseratis and private jets being part of the arsenal to enjoy life. Then again, this is part of the true tale, so it's not debatable. Not forgetting the extended ensemble cast of assistants in the form of Yvonne (Anne Le Ny) and Magalie (Audrey Fleurot) amongst others who pepper the scenery, the former serving to fill in the blanks for Driss as he tries to gather background, while the latter coming in as an object for Driss' romance, with a little surprise up in store.There's no qualms The Intouchables is a delight to sit through, being a story of hope and friendship. And in some ways, even for the most able amongst us, this is a tale that reminds us of the importance of humour, which is medicine enough to get us through some of the toughest situations we'll encounter from time to time. Both Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy put in amazing performances, and their delivery of their characters, screen charisma and banter, are more than reasons enough to catch this. A definite recommendation!",The Intouchables
18,siderite,Emotional tale of true friendship,8,28 December 2012,"If you are looking for a feel good movie that has also deep meaning and true characters, look no further: Intouchables is for you. It is the story of the friendship between a very rich white paraplegic and his low class dark skinned caretaker. Best of all, it is based on a true story, something that brings an extra bit of authenticity to the film, not that the excellent play of the actors needed more.Now, at times it seems too idealistic and probably it is, with the ""lord"" giving a chance to the ""peasant"" and then becoming friends when intimate enough to learn about each other; a bit like a fairy tale. And I am sure some of the film is just invented. But it doesn't matter. The idea is true, the acting is true and the characters bring a lot of humour and compassion into it.All in all a very nice movie, one that can bring a little joy in an all too serious and dark world.",The Intouchables

The film begins by showing the man's assistant, interviewing candidates for the job of being the man's hands and legs, but as the man sits close behind her, he becomes increasingly unsatisfied with the candidates due to their lack of motivation or their mundane nature.The man, named Philippe, played by François Cluzet, is brought to a smile when he is acquainted with Driss (Omar Sy), a man who has been through relentless struggles with money and social-status, but still manages to push through it with a smile. Driss is only looking for a signature on his unemployment checks so he can continue receiving welfare benefits and has absolutely no ambition to get this job.The next day, he is called up to begin the trial period as the role of Philippe's caretaker, and while Driss is clearly unqualified for a job of this nature, Philippe casually accepts him because he finds the man to be charming and good-natured. While both men come from the Parisian-area, Philippe lives in a heavenly mansion, while Driss inhabits the lowest end of the slums. Despite this setback, the men have an incredibly easy-going friendship, with deep, touching talks of inspiration and motivation throughout the picture. Subplots involve Driss demanding that Philippe maintain better control of his only daughter, Elisa, and trying to get the man back on his dating game with a digital lover.I'm aware the story sounds like cliché-after-cliché, but the film perfectly abides by my law of films with a seemingly cliché premise. The Intouchables knows its story functions with moments of incredulity and utter sappiness, but it doesn't try to overcompensate and milk those moments for more than they're worth. It also does more than give us contrivance, but inflates its moments of sentiment with wit, charm, attitude, style, and poignancy, making this for a very emotional experience on every level. Sometimes, we are greeted with a film we know is relatively simple, cliché, and unassuming, yet we are mesmerized unconditionally up until the final frame.The film became a colossal hit in France, selling over nineteen million tickets and is currently the second highest grossing film of all time, in France. Due to its very minimal promotion in the US, I could see some people going into this film expecting a somber, relatively monotone film depicting the life of a tetraplegic tragically and with a numbing aftertaste. The Intouchables has a talent much like the Alexander Payne film, The Descendants, which is depicting a relaxing environment, which includes making a character out of the setting, handling tragedy with a sustainable amount of poignancy, and providing touches of extremely funny comedy throughout its entire runtime.As of now, French cinema is one of the strongest cinemas in the world, as it has been for decades now. Rather than try to recreate the New Wave it experienced many years ago, try out a gimmicky, self-indulgent style, or even worse, replicate Hollywood formulas, it is at a stage now where it can take even the most basic storyline and rework it into a magnificent portrayal with humanity and lavishness subtly and majestically. The Intouchables is a beauty that will definitely be taken for granted.Starring: François Cluzet and Omar Sy. Directed by: Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano.",The Intouchables
20,lasttimeisaw,The Intouchables,8,3 June 2012,"Recently I have been caught in the web of Marilyn fever, after MY WEEK WITH MARILYN (2011) and the season finale of SMASH (even Uma Thurman could pull off a slender doppelgänger Marilyn), I decide watch this musical/burlesque to quench my thirst and hope to know more about her, the mysterious actress whose shallowness is rather not compatible with our requirement of an eternal icon (after her two more prominent flicks, SOME LIKE IT HOT 1959 and THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH 1957).The film pairs a soft kitten Marilyn with a pointed Jane Russell, to counterpart not only the hair color, also conceive two precious opposite temperaments between them, and they're indeed BFFs to each other (at least in the film they claim to be). In this Howard Hawk's vaudeville, with the help of Russell, the showgirl comfort zone is the haven for Monroe to perform right on her own track and never mitigates its plain entertaining function, given that one could forget about the tacky script (one unexplained plot hole, how the detective fathom the whereabouts of the tiara?).The film has been officially crowned as the most successful film in French domestic market (French's much appreciated axiom preferring attendance over grosses), overthrew the 14-year reign of TITANIC (1997). An astonishing victory diametrically wins over the overpowering Hollywood tyranny which prevails in the world elsewhere.Unlike another sensational but more provincial box-office mammoth victor WELCOME TO THE LAND OF SHTIS (2008), THE INTOUCHABLES nudges a more international vantage point, which may suggest a more wide acceptance than the former's parochial stature. We are living in an imperfect world where people are classified as different classes by money, power and social status, the gaps are the invisible barriers deter the evolution of a more equalized and stable society, the film may not possess the magic spell to solve this conundrum, but it has its heartfelt innovation to allow any individual to witness a sincere friendship ignited between a pair with the least possibility.Due to the language hurdle, there are plenty inside jokes which is difficult to comprehend for an outsider, but François Cluzet and Omar Sy are both equally recommendable, although Sy has an edge over since he dominates the most joyful parts and steadfastly handles the more poignant segment as well. Directors-writers Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano show no rookie mistakes, and sufficiently exercise this true story to distill until its most theatrical fodder being left (although some antics are overdone, the lesbian deployment? There is no need to add gay element in every film), and embroider it with a slickly potent cast which reflects a concise judgment towards the kennel - we should treat each other unbiasedly as a human being, without any prejudice of differentiation of any sort. Ludovico Einaudi's piano score plays a significant role in the film as well, providing this enthralling journey with a passionate catharsis! PS: The film and Omar Sy both end in my top 10 list of 2011!",The Intouchables
21,Hellmant,"The type of movie Eddie Murphy might have starred in in the 80s, perhaps with Dustin Hoffman.",7,17 January 2013,"'THE INTOUCHABLES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A French comedy-drama film that has become the third biggest foreign film and biggest foreign language film of all time. It's also received rave reviews and a great deal of award recognition, but no 2012 Academy Award nomination (due to the fact that the foreign language division was afraid it would win). The film is beloved the world over but perhaps just a little over-hyped. It's a good movie but it is clichéd and somewhat simple and unoriginal. It's been criticized for being another tale that revolves around rich white people being enlightened and finding happiness through poor black people. It does seem like the type of movie Eddie Murphy might have starred in in the 80s, perhaps with Dustin Hoffman (because the lead white actor in the film bares a striking resemblance to Dustin Hoffman).The film stars Francois Cluzet as an aristocrat, named Philippe, who was paralyzed in a paragliding accident. He's somewhat depressed and has lost most communication with his adopted daughter Elisa (Alba Gaia Kraghede Bellugi). He also has phantom pains which keep him up at night and still mourns the death of his wife greatly, who died before they could have any kids of their own. He maintains romantic relationships with women only through written letters and fears actually meeting or speaking with them. One day he's looking for a new caretaker and a man named Driss (Omar Sy) enters his home just looking for a signature so he can continue to collect welfare checks. Driss lives with his large family in a small flat in a Parisian suburb. So when Philippe actually does offer him a job as well as a room in his mansion, that has it's own large bathtub in it, it's quite a culture shock for him. Of course Philippe is inspired by Driss and both men's lives are forever changed.The film was written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. It is nicely directed and looks beautiful. It also has a nice combination of both comedy and drama and both elements are done well. It's just that the film isn't that funny or that emotionally moving. The performances are fine, it has some good laughs and it's a good well intentioned story but it's nothing we haven't seen before and far from anything spectacular. It's enormous success does puzzle me a little but I'd much rather see a movie like this do really well than something like 'TWILIGHT'. So it's definitely a decent crowd-pleasing film, just not a great one.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcoZRlVFMzA",The Intouchables
22,Robert_duder,Lovely comedy drama whose heart and soul lies in the lead characters,9,5 March 2013,"The Intouchables took the world by storm especially for a ""foreign"" film. I anxiously waited to see it and I'm so glad I got to. Not only is it one of the best movies I've seen in quite some time but it was deep and touching and funny! It was certainly the best foreign film I have seen in quite some time. It was one of those movies that I think lucked out in the magic department and everything just worked perfectly to create that uncontrollable chemistry that draws people in. The story isn't incredibly unique, we've certainly seen the two people from different worlds forging a friendship before. We've also seen the fish out of water tale of a person from a different social and economic circle thrust into upper class. What makes this beautiful and simply and touching is the absolutely palpable chemistry between Driss and Phillipe played brilliantly by the two lead actors. Whomever made this film completely lucked out finding two actors who are polar opposites physically and have them work so incredibly well together in this movie. I didn't want the movie to end. I wanted to watch their friendship continue and watch more adventures with them, they captured me that much.This year at the Oscars I thought they REALLY struggled to pick quality performances. There were a few truly outstanding nominations that I agreed with but most were barely supporting actors and still got nominated (Amy Adams, Alan Arkin etc) but they sincerely and unequivocally overlooked both of the stars of this film. François Cluzet is mind blowing as Philippe. The man is completely paralysed and creations emotions, empathy, sadness, happiness, laughter, love, fear, social anxiety...all with his facial expression and his eyes. He gives an incredible performance just in his eyes alone. You feel every single thing he does simply because he absolutely nails this performance. Omar Sy looks and acts the polar opposite of Philippe and yet their chemistry is unbelievable. Sy is hilarious, fast talking, street wise, rough around the edges and emotional. He captures your heart as quickly as he does for Philippe. You understand both of them and watch this incredible bizarre and perfect relationship unfold. Audrey Fleurot and Anne Le Ny were excellent as supporting characters to Philippe and Driss. I wanted to see more from both of their characters and more between them and Driss because they both had very unique relationships to him.They would have screwed this up but this would have made one incredible TV Series. There was so much content and so much emotion that it could have been an amazing, long running series. But we have this film and it is just incredible. Perhaps my single only critique is that they added some elements of story that got in the way because they never truly get wrapped up or taken care of properly. Philippe's daughter was a very interesting idea but the film is simply too short to deal with that whole relationship so it feels rushed and awkward including Driss' threatening her ex-boyfriend to be nice to her. But that is a very small issue when you look at the big picture. Co-directors and writers Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have solidified their directorial and writing careers with this film. They will be monstrously huge now and be able to do anything they want. Their direction is terrific and their story is even better but they truly lucked out with Cluzet and Sy because they took this story and created something magical. I don't often talk about the music in a film but the truly lovely and haunting melody from this film sets the tone of the movie and will almost certainly bring tears to your eyes. Whether you love foreign films or are just not jumping into them...this is a reason to because it is amazing. 9/10",The Intouchables
23,ElMaruecan82,Touché ...,10,17 January 2012,"In less than two months, ""Untouchable"" became the second most successful French film by number of spectators, such an event by itself that people went then to see it, not because they thought it was good but to see what was so good in it: that's the virtual circle of success. My biggest disappointment in 2011 was with ""The Tree of Life"", a movie I sincerely wanted to love but couldn't, and I left the theater before it ended with a bitter taste of frustration. Proportionally, my greatest positive surprise came with ""Untouchable"" because it was the opposite expectation: I was sure I would dislike it, figuring the movie manipulated viewers through the overused device of the improbable friendship. Why such preconceived negativity? Well, when a young black guy from French suburbs, darkly depicted in Mathieu Kassovitz 'Hate' and infamous for its occasional riots, befriends a rich quadriplegic, I immediately think of 'good feelings', 'mainstream populism'  unaware that I apply to myself a cynical judgment that can undermine my very way to enjoy not just this film, but any film. After all, why getting ready for hatred when it's so relieving to give the benefit of the doubt and get ready for appreciation? Especially since more than 15 millions of French people, from different ages and backgrounds liked it. So, I saw it  and loved it.The story of ""Untouchable"" is the kind of unintentional masterpiece that only movies can provide every once in a while, it has no other pretension than to depict a magnificent and inspiring friendship story starting as a simple job. A young man with a Senegalese background, Omar Sy as Driss, only needs a signature to prove that he attended an interview for a live-in carer job. For some strange reason, Paul, the rich man, played by a wonderful François Cluzet, gives him the job, with a one-month trial period. The reason of this choice is smoothly handled by the script: the film starts with all the job applicants, every one of them unnaturally posing and getting mixed in prepared answers. Then, Driss casually enters, without waiting for his turn or knocking on the door, he's got enough problems to deal with, unemployment, an experience in jail, being a pariah for society, and undesirable even in his own family, especially her adoptive aunt. Driss' attitude pleases Paul, because after his paragliding accident, he can't feel his body from neck to toes, and needs caring almost 24 hours per days and 7 days per week, so he really doesn't have time for bullshit either. And this is a remarkable aspect in the script written by the two directors Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache: it doesn't waste time cementing the friendship, the two leads rapidly get fond of each other, a feeling illustrated in the poster with both posing with natural smiles. The film shows Omar's struggle to learn how 'needy' Paul is, which provides some priceless comedic moments, but ""Untouchable"" goes immediately to the core, an eye-opening message about the life endured by a handicapped person, making all the wealth in the world pointless and the richness of heart and mind, priceless. Through Driss and Paul's interaction, the film explores the real needs of people in life, respect and understanding, acceptance and love. Maybe if it was handled by other directors, it would have been predictable but in ""Untouchable"", the complicity between the two heroes feels absolutely real. There's one scene when Driss shave the bushy beard of Paul, well, I won't spoil it for you, but the part was a clever mix of realism and comedy because anyone would have done what Driss did at one moment, and that's the secret of the film: it feels real.Some movies can work with a good story but they need good performances, in ""Untouchable"", it's almost impossible to determine who carried the film, both Cluzet and Sy were great. And I don't get the complaints: why they didn't respect the original story where the carer was an Arab, or how they 'sugarcoated' the handicap? I even heard that in America, they were accusing the film of racism because Driss was portrayed as a sort of (I quote) 'helper monkey'? Seriously, this is getting old The way handicap is approached never flirts with an exaggerated pathos, nor the opposite, which is the most intelligent achievement. There's a sort of heart's intelligence in the way Omar teases Cluzet with his own handicap, and the film provides the extraordinary message that pleasure and thrills have unlimited media, whether they come from pot, an ear-massage or even paragliding. Many of Paul's friends criticizes the presence of Driss in Paul's life, but Paul doesn't care: Omar is a man full of life, big, tall and strong, and when he uses violence to teach a man the respect of a parking sign, Paul admits this is the right method. Both are in the same wavelength. I wondered if the title ""Untouchable"" referred to the lowest caste in India, echoing the two men's conditions, both outcasts physically and socially, but I guess, their relationship evolves into a friendship precisely because they're both strong-minded, and together, they become even stronger, until getting untouchables ... in the noblest meaning of the word.There are real people in ""Untouchable"", nothing works as plot devices even if some situations are so cinematically appealing: Omar inviting everybody to dance during Paul's birthday, his learning of the aristocratic world, the art of abstract painting, and the way he breaks the conventions with an unconventional charisma reaches a level of energetic comedy that reminds of the greatest days of Eddie Murphy, with Cluzet as a perfect straight-man not deprived from a sense of humor. ""Untouchable"" is simply an inspiring story of friendship with whatever defines this beautiful virtue. And yes, it's one of the best French films ever, and certainly one of the best of 2011.",The Intouchables
24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"A feel-good, life-affirming picture that does its job and does it well.",7,19 April 2018,"'Untouchable (2011)' is a feel-good, life-affirming picture that does its job and does it well, delivering on its early promise of a touching central relationship that really does warm the heart. I can honestly say that I had a genuine smile on my face for most of the run-time, thanks mainly to Omar Sy's endearing and energetic performance. It also helps that the picture is legitimately funny and has a realistic edge that prevents it from slipping too far into sentimentality. Even though, at its core, the story is bare-bones and familiar, there's enough fun to be had that the fairly basic concept can be overlooked and the pure joy of two friends laughing together, despite their many differences, can really shine through. 7/10",The Intouchables
25,dromasca,"about bridging the differences, but in the easy register",7,2 June 2012,"In the year when The Artist dominated the Oscars and achieved international success and recognition, it was a very different kind of a film that dominated the French box office. This film is 'Intouchables' and the one of good reasons of its success is that it deals with a problem that seems to be universally actual but especially painful nowadays in Europe and France specifically – the relation between the 'native' Europeans and the immigrants who migrate to the Old Continent in search of its freedom and chances of finding here prosperity and escaping the hardships and in many cases the prosecution at home. This encounter is an encounter of cultures and styles of life, which puts to prove everybody's capability to accept the differences and to live aside or even create stronger relationships despite the differences.The two principal characters of the film have each a strong handicap but also other strong points. Philippe (the excellent Francois Cluzet) is quadriplegic condemned to life in a wheelchair following an accident, but he has a wide culture and especially a lot of money which allow him to afford not only treatments, people to serve him at ease, living in a palace in the center of Paris, and flying on private jets to any place in the world at any time. Driss (Omar Sy) posses nothing and lives a life of a semi-criminal and semi-homeless, but he is young, strong, and has a natural goodness and common sense of the street. The two meet and complement each other, help each other with what the other is missing or has lost, but this is possible because the two share also the will to live, the taste of the extreme, and especially humor. The two directors of 'Intouchables' Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano made of this film a feel-good story that tries to pass in a comic and easy way a strong message that the differences can be bridged when and where we can look at the people near us, find their strong and good parts and offer ours to them to overcome the lower moments in life.The film is inspired by true people and by a true story, and here is where I feel a little bit cheated. I feel cheated because if this fact was not so visibly emphasized I would have criticized the film for being to idealistic, its characters too good to each other, differences and situations solved too easily, in other words I would have said that this looks too much like an idealized Hollywood story. Should I risk to do it now? Say that for example if Philippe was not so extremely rich to buy his entourage and way out of any situation by taking another fine meal or private jet flight this maybe would not be the same story. Or say that the final story with the anonymous girlfriend brought up at the exact place by the sea (Normandie?) where the two end to run seems too much like a movie-style 'deux-ex-machina' exercise? Or ask practical questions like who help Philippe take food or drinks to his mouth at that encounter? I would be ridiculous, as this is inspired from real life and characters, and all or some may be true. So I will just take the risk of saying that the approach to a very serious problem seems to be a little too idealized, but that overall that is a good feeling movie worth being seen, as there is nothing wrong to feel good even at films dealing with serious subjects.",The Intouchables
26,ThomasDrufke,A Feel Good Film For the Ages,9,7 October 2014,"Normally when I'm watching a foreign film with subtitles, it can be distracting. With The Intouchables, you never once even realize it has subtitles. It's by far one of the most charming films I have ever seen. The chemistry between Cluzet and Sy is incredible. It is hard to even come up with an issue with the film from top to bottom.It tells the story of an ex-con upbeat young man who is hired by a quadriplegic to be his caretaker and the bond they build over time. They both learn life lessons from each other but most of all they both enjoy life for what it is. Cluzet brings so much joy to a character who is in an unbearable situation. Sy learns to love the little things in life while developing a special bond with Cluzet and the rest of his aristocratic family. I do wish they showed a bit about how Sy rekindled his own family relationship or just stayed true to the real life story. I don't know exactly to what extent this film is fiction but that seemed to be the big complaint among critics.For me, it doesn't need to be a history lesson. A film is suppose to move you emotionally. Whether it's a comedy, thriller, or drama a film is to entertain. So I enjoyed the film for what it is, and that's a feel good film. The performances, music, and directing are all great and it's just a well made film.

Through their relationship, which becomes a friendship and more, they each gain so much. Especially Philippe who, due to his immobility, has limited power to control his day to day activities.This can be called a comedy because of the light-hearted banter and jokes that are in it.

30,ironhorse_iv,"This French film, about unlikely friendship, is amour with its viewers! It can't be touch!",9,24 March 2015,"While the movie isn't that high in Avant-garde art, it's still hold Avoirdupois with its audience. Inspired by a 2004's documentary film entitled 'A la vie, a la mort', that tells the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his French-Algerian caregiver Abdel Sellou. The movie directed & written by Olivier Nakache & Eric Toledano, tells the story of a young trouble Senegal man from the Paris projects named Driss (Omar Sy). While, he has no ambitions to get a job, he finds himself in a job interview. The reasons why is because for him to continue to receive welfare benefits, he has to apply to, at least, one job and get rejected. Instead of being rejected by the employer; wealthy quadriplegic, Philippe (François Cluzet), hires Driss as a caretaker. The reasons why, is because, Phillippe believes that Driss is the only person, that treat him like a normal person. That, and Phillippe feels that Driss just conning the welfare system that he helps pay for. While, Driss, at first uninterested in the job and his lack of professional experience shows, Driss does well, overtime, caring for Philippe, even if his methods are unconventional. Soon an unlikely friendships grows as both men, help each other with their trouble lives. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the movie is both very charming and moving. It's a feel good movie. Maybe, a little too, feel good. The reasons why, I say this, is because the film, feels like its missing deeper drama that should have been tackle in the film. In my opinion, the movie doesn't really dig too deep into the complexity of their friendship. The socio-economic divisions that separate Philippe and Driss aren't substantively explored, enough. Yes, the movie show the different between both men, in the fields of art, music, and social activities, but it never goes any deeper. Call it, nitpicky, but I really wanted them to tackle, the issues of wealth, race and physical abilities, more. Another fault of the film is how predictable, it is. It's so predictable, that you knew that third act, break-up was going to happen. You know, that they were going to make up and find themselves, as friends, again. There isn't anything really new that makes this film stand out. I saw this premise, in other films before, like 2009's Blind Side, 2009's Soloist, and others. It's basically the French version of the 'White savior' & 'Magic Negro' narrative in one film. Despite, all those little complains, this movie is way higher than any of those films, I listed. This movie offers valuable reminders about how you can't assume anything about anyone regardless of their wealth, race, or physical abilities. The movie is shot, very well. A good example of this was the interview sequence. When the camera pans over the men waiting for the job interview, it goes for their shoes. All highly polished, combined with ironed trousers and then it reaches a pair of worn out shoes, in which Driss is shown in establishing shot. With this simple trick audience knows how much he doesn't fit there. Very clever. The movie pacing is in good hands. I never really got bored, watching it. It doesn't go too long, or too short. The movie is fantastically acted. Both actors were great in their roles. As an American that knows little to no French; I found the French to be easy to listen to. The French dialogue is pretty clever. You don't need to know, much about the country, to get into the film. Also, the French doesn't sound rude, or uber romantic. It doesn't go, too fast that you can get lost. The subtitles are nearly in the same pace and really helps if you do. Despite, the language barrier, the movie is surprisingly a very funny film. I have to say, the whole cop chase, and the cutting of the beard, were the highlights of the film, because how laugh out funny, it was. The movie also have a great choice of music. I love the use of classical music, R&B, and others. It's nice to hear the band, Earth, Wind, and the Fire, again. It's no wonder why France selected the feel-good movie as its 2012 submission to the Academy Awards for best foreign language film, but I was deeply surprise, it didn't make the list. It's weird in a way, since the film was the most acclaimed movie of that year from Europe. The Weinstein Company, which distributed the film in the US was unhappy with the results. They note, the failure, came because, how unfamiliar the film was, to US audience and how people might mistake the film for being racist, due to the concept, of a poor black caretaker taking care of a rich white man. While, some American critics see a modern-day version of a black domestic and his white master, I see it as a movie about friendship. Like many French people, I don't find this movie offensive. I really hope, other Americans don't think so as well. While, the film has begun to receive more American attention with it having a prominent place on Netflix's Foreign Movies list. It's still clear, that more Americans need to see this film. If not, Weinstein Company might end up making an Americanized remake of this film. As of this writing, it's up in the air, if that remake is going to be good or not. I hope it is. If you like this movie, also check out, the memoirs, ""You Changed My Life"" & ""A Second Wind"". Overall: This movie is a witty and sweet. It's must-watch. I do recommended. You will have a lot of fun, watching it.",The Intouchables

Adding huge ounces of principles, love, friendship & emotions into a bucket of life story is something so splendid the filmmakers have succeeded in doing, that not only will The Intouchables touch you, but also will stay with you for decades.I say it because the story is not new to our cinematic brains. It has been sampled before (check out Guzaarish (a Bollywood debacle), Jab We Met (theme), etc.). But, the freshness & adrenaline pumping sequences are high above the reach of typical non-standard plots & SFX or CGI. Without making use of cheap-stakes, surrounding itself with pure blessings of wonderful music, budding cast, performances & screenplay is what makes it a beautiful drama. The comedy will stay with you with lots of improvisation in the slapstick. While the character depth is astronomical, what works for The Intouchables is that it is genuine. From its core.A good 8.7/10 for a wonderful experience. A wonderful story talking about human relations, notwithstanding the stereotypes, flashing the happier (& the dull) side of humanity & its nature, topped with a perfect climax.

Driss and Philippe both fall into and eschew traditional stereotypes, with one being a crude suburbian and the other a sophisticated elite, yet never failing to relate to one another on a more human level. The comedic moments in this film feel true to life with wonderful character traits and emotions. The disability in this film is a core part of Philippe's life but it never overwhelms his identity nor does it consign him to a sob story, which is a portrayal to be commended.",The Intouchables
34,filipemanuelneto,One of the best European films of recent years.,9,27 April 2017,"When I watched this movie in the theater I did it almost by chance, for the film that I really wanted to see has already left that theater. She did not know anything about him or read any of them. It was a shot in the dark. And I'm glad I did it. I loved the movie when I saw it and now, reviewing it at home, I continued to feel happy about the time I gave to this work. It is a film based on real facts that occurred from the relationship between a rich French aristocrat and his trusted servant, an Algerian who lived in the suburbs. Here, however, the African origin of the servant is reinforced by the intentional choice of a black actor, Omar Sy, while the other role was given to veteran François Cluzet. Both actors were capable of exceptional chemistry and look fantastic when they split the screen. Sy's jokes, in his character, are laughing to tears. The cinematography and the scenery are very good and the soundtrack, Ludovico Einaudi's responsibility, is simply a masterpiece of ""contemporary"" classical music. It is certainly the best French film I have seen in many years, and one of the best films that European cinema has given us during this decade, until now.",The Intouchables

The sensitive matter of the disabilities is projected through humor and human warmth. The lines are quite clever, funny and entertaining. The story line simple, as it should be for this kind of film. Good music too, gives an up lifting note to the film, along with the comical atmosphere. But, the performances are the thing that out stand the most.

36,leonblackwood,Brilliant movie! 8/10,8,5 July 2014,"Review: What a brilliant movie. The storyline is excellent and the acting was spot on. I didn't know what to expect from this movie, as I'm not one that follows foreign cinema that much, but after hearing excellent reviews from fellow movie goers, I thought that I would give it a chance and man, am I glad that I did. The director brought these 2 complete different worlds together brilliantly and the mixture of humour and drama kept the film interesting throughout. I don't know how close this movie is to the real story about these 2 extraordinary men is, but it's amazing that such a rich man was prepared to give a down and out benefit claimer, a chance of a lifetime and boy, didn't he handle it well. It's been a long time since I have enjoyed a movie so much and judging by its takings at the box office, I'm not the only one. A Great Watch!Round-Up: Since the release of this movie, Omar Sy, the helper, has starred in the new X Men and has been casted for the new Jurassic Park which isn't bad for someone who was completely unknown. I mist hope that he keeps all of his good qualities and that he doesn't get brainwashed by Hollywood. As for Francois Cluzet, the guy in the wheelchair, it doesn't look like he is going to crossover anytime soon, but he was brilliant in this movie. Anyway, I'm sure that Hollywood will be taking this concept and making there own version soon, but this is one of those movies that shouldn't be touched because your never going to get the same chemistry as the director captured. Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $430million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into there deep comedic dramas about a man from the hood looking after a wealthy quadriplegic. 8/10",The Intouchables
37,howard.schumann,Honest emotion and humane message,8,21 July 2012,"If you are looking for an alternative to blockbuster superhero movies or Hollywood cookie-cutter romantic comedies, you can do no better than Oliver Nakache and Eric Toledano's film, The Intouchables. Though it has aspects that are familiar and even formulaic, the film redeems itself with its honest emotion and humane message of how vastly different people can learn from each other. Hugely popular in France where it earned $280 million (the second highest grossing film in their history) and was nominated for nine Cesar Awards, The Intouchables can make you forget, however briefly, the day's headlines, and feel good once more about people and the world they inhabit.Omar Sy, César Best Actor Award winner, is Driss, a poor Senegalese man from the ghettos who is hired to take care of multimillionaire Philippe (Francois Cluzet), a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident. Based on a true story adapted from the memoir ""You Changed My Life"" by Abdel Sellou, Driss is an ex-con who served six months in prison for his part in a robbery and applied for the job in order to be eligible to receive government benefits after he was turned down. Surprisingly, Philippe hires Driss to be his caretaker, telling him that he likes people who ""tell it like it is"" without overt displays of pity or compassion.The film begins with Driss driving Phillipe's Maserati at dangerous speeds with Philippe next to him on the passenger seat. Stopped by the police, Driss tells the officers that his paralyzed friend must be taken to the hospital immediately as Philippe pretends to have a stroke. Exhilarated by their experience, the two men drive to the seashore to watch the waves in contemplative silence. The events leading up to the incident are then told in flashback. As Philippe's recently hired caretaker, Driss moves into the aristocrat's opulent Paris apartment and learns the job quickly. Before long, he is carrying Philippe from his bed to a chair, carefully dressing him, and even flirting with his assistant Magalie (Audrey Fleurot), but he does draw the line on some activities.As a result of Driss' high energy, Philippe begins to renew his enthusiasm for life and the two are drawn together by their love of music of diverse types, fast cars, and off-color humor. There are a few sub-plots including Philippe's snarky teenage daughter (Alba Gaïa Kraghede Bellugi) and her problems with her mop-haired boyfriend, and that of Driss' younger brother Adama (Cyril Mendy) and his fears of being the victim in a drug deal but they do not distract from what is essentially a two-character story. There is a lot of warmth and humor in the growing relationship. Driss introduces the staid Philippe to the music of Earth, Wind, and Fire to which Driss dances flamboyantly at Philippe's birthday party, the young caretaker becomes Philippe's barber, showing him some different and not too flattering mustaches, and they enjoy a hang gliding adventure in the French countryside.While some aspects of culture are ridiculed, the film shows respect for the arts in a way most Hollywood films never would. We actually listen to classical music, view paintings in a museum, and hear Philippe's impassioned poetic letters to Eleonore, who lives in Dunkirk, a woman he's never met. Driss also takes up painting and sells his first work for 11,000 Euros. Also, unlike mainstream American films that seem to exist in a vacuum, there are even references to real life contemporary figures such as Obama, Bush, and Nixon.While the opportunity is certainly present for mawkish sentimentality, Nakache and Toledano steer clear of that pitfall and opt instead for a genuineness and sincerity that allows us to truly care about each character. Though The Intouchables does have aspects of racial stereotyping, it can be enjoyed simply as a charming, warm-hearted, and funny depiction of friendship between two very different people who are willing to learn from each other about how to celebrate life. While happiness in their lives may still be elusive, in the words of existential psychiatrist Rollo May, ""Joy, rather than happiness, is the goal of life, for joy isbased on the experience of one's identity as a being of worth and dignity.""",The Intouchables
38,TheMovieDiorama,"Untouchable (or Intouchables) is one of the most heartwarming, pleasant comedies I've seen in a long time.",8,2 March 2018,"Damn, this has put me in a really happy mood...which is rare, trust me. One of the highest rated French films currently, Untouchable is the true story of a rich handicapped man employing the assistance of a benefit scrounging man where the two make for an unlikely friendship. Whilst this does follow the ever so popular formula of ""poor man temporarily lives in rich lifestyle that now changes him for the better"", it is somewhat different in which simultaneously the millionaire is also touched by the lifestyle of the ex-con caretaker. It is this balance of these glimpses into each lifestyle that makes these characters relatable and likeable. They are down to earth, they are just like you or me and I really admire that approach. It's a story of opportunities. Being able to give someone a job that they may not usually receive that, not only brings them plenty of money, but changes their way of life. Their way of thinking. A story like this is the definition of a crowd pleaser. I can say, with certain, that everyone will enjoy this. What assists with my certainty, is the outstanding performances by Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet. Sy was phenomenal. A very grounded and understated performance and you can see he is having fun which really elevates the optimistic mood that the film conveys. Cluzet's performance is rooted with honesty and a hint of sarcasm that makes the dialogue refreshing. There were many moments where I laughed which again is a rare accomplishment in itself. It's does try to tug on your emotional strings a little too much and personally I don't think it achieved this. It does enhance the character development but you can see that it does not quite reach those heights. Didn't feel like a natural progression in the story, like the writers just had to throw some emotional conflict for the sake of it. Formulaic? Yes, but this is one of the most uplifting comedies I've seen in a long time. Definitely recommended.",The Intouchables
39,SAMTHEBESTEST,This French cinema sensation is too easy to predict but the true story factor still makes it work..,7,29 May 2020,"The Intouchables (2011) :
Brief Review -This French cinema sensation is too easy to predict but the true story factor still makes it work. The Intouchables is based on a true story of an quadriplegic rich man who finds a true friend in one of his hired reckless caretaker. The film is a big story but definitely it is time consuming as the narrative is strictly modified within 112 minutes. There is fun, there is love, there is life, there are problems and then there is a friendship bond and humanity values. I won't deny the fact that the story isn't overwhelming at all, of course it is predictable and too simple. But sometimes simple things works. The problem i have with the film is the hype creted by audience about it. When i am watching a film with IMDb Rating of 8.5/10 and also the Rank 44 film in IMDb Top Rated Films WW i expect something sensational or outstanding and this predictable tale is surely underwhelming by far. Critics didn't admire this film as much as audience and i would like to go with critics for this film (I always don't agree with Critics) at least. The Intouchables lacks the attractive elements but it is Highly entertaining flick by all means. It has laughters on consistent basis. Some of them are vulgar, some are organic and some are outdated but that all keeps it engaging. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy put up fine performances and lovable chemistry. The background score works pleasantly while Cinematography is okay. Olivier Nakace and Eric Toodano has made a very good film but looking at all the acclaim it recieved globally it is certainly below my expectations. Maybe attending the biographical story didn't let them use cinematic Liberty upto the course but i have seen so many Biographicals being one of the greatest films of all time, haven't you? There is definitely something less in the film but if you can neglect that then there's lot to enjoy in The Untouchables for sure.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",The Intouchables
40,Vartiainen,"Funny, touching, a bit bland",6,13 February 2018,"The masterpiece of directors Olivier Nakache & Éric Toledano. A story of a ghetto black man (Omar Sy), who ends up getting a job as the life-in caregiver for a wealthy quadriplegic aristocrat (François Cluzet). And what do you know, the black man ends up teaching the aristocrat some fantastic new things about life. Think Driving Miss Daisy in modern day Paris.This film feels and looks nice. The cinematography, all the technical aspects really, look, sound and feel great. It's definitely a professionally made film. I also have to praise the performance of the two main leads. Cluzet's character is a very reserved, very stoic gentleman, which means that he doesn't have quite as much room to really let loose acting-wise, but even still he gives a praiseworthy performance. But it's Sy who's the star of the movie, with his boundless energy, his ever-ending optimism and his streetwise manners that give none and expect none.All that being said, the story is clichéd. Based on a true story, sure, but the fact still remains that daytime TV is filled with films just like this one. This is no doubt better directed, better filmed and better acted than any of those fluff films, but you still end up feeling like you're being pandered towards.Still, it just might be that I'm biased towards these kinds of stories. It is a well-crafted film, after all. If the premise interests you, by all means, give it a watch.",The Intouchables
41,jtindahouse,Another great French film,8,8 September 2019,"My goodness the French are great at making films. They have this way of keeping everything so simple, and yet being endlessly complex and powerful at the same time. 'The Intouchables' is no exception. I've been meaning to see this film for a long time but just never got around to it. Finally it was playing on my flight to Bali the other day and I decided now was the time. I'm very glad I took the time to see it because it is a very fine film.The chemistry between the two leads (and to a lesser extent the rest of the cast as well who also did an excellent job) is what makes this film so special. Unfortunately the fact that the real life version of Driss wasn't black is a little distasteful. I think it is disrespectful to the real life person. If it were the other way around there would be hell to pay. This is one of the very few negatives I can aim at this film.The story is funny, charming, heart-breaking and joyous all at once. It is a great watch. I see that the American's have made a remake with Bryan Cranston (great casting) and Kevin Hart (not great casting - but hey, prove me wrong Kevin). I'm sceptical about seeing it but curiosity may get the better of me. 99 times out 100 though I would suggest people are better off just watching the original even if they're not a fan of subtitles.",The Intouchables
42,billcr12,Poetic and Touching,9,19 May 2012,"Philippe is paralyzed as the result of an accident while paragliding. The opening scene of the film shows him as a passenger in a Maserati moving along at high speeds, driven by a black man. The police pull over the car and immediately assume the worst. As he is being patted down, he tells the cops to look in the back at the wheelchair, used by the man he is driving to a hospital for an emergency. After they leave, we see that this was all a ruse by the two men.A flashback at a beautiful residence where a row of people are waiting to be interviewed for the job of caretaker for Philippe, and Driss, the driver from the beginning is interviewed by the patient and an assistant. He asks for his application to be signed so that he can continue to collect unemployment. Instead he is hired and learns how to do physical therapy and other tasks.At first he is reluctant to do what he is asked, but in time the odd couple become friends. Driss learns about Philippes life, including the death of his wife. The rich man's lawyer warns him that his new assistant has a criminal record and was in jail for six months. Driss hears Philippe dictating a letter to woman and when he finds out that he has been having a pen pal relationship with the lady, convinces him to call her to set up a real date. After exchanging pictures, they arrange a meeting at a restaurant, but he leaves before she shows up. To get away, they take a private jet and later go paragliding, while strapped to others. Family troubles force Driss to leave to take care of several relatives and Philippe despises his new helper. He grows a scraggly beard and Driss visits and ridicules his ugly facial hair. They drive to a beach front restaurant where Driss has a surprise waiting. The Intouchables is somewhat overly sentimental, but Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy are so good as the two men from different worlds who connect, it can be overlooked in this beautiful and poetic real life story.",The Intouchables
43,BeneCumb,"Great sad comedy, with giftedly combined contrasts",8,18 September 2012,"Although the plot is based on real events, it must be very difficult to balance sorrow and joy, wealth and poverty, constrained disability and (hyper)activity in such a way that the result is not rude and/or embarrassing. In spite of several teases and jokes related to disability, they are included in a logical and realistic way into Driss 's character (splendidly played by Omar Sy). No wonder that the film has received so much warm welcome and has become one of the biggest French successes all over the world. Opposites, even antipodes have several things in common, but there are a few occasions triggering the events to understand them. The film could be recommended even to those who have disabled persons closely around. Perhaps it is then possible to find new angles to deal with them and bring more joy and variety into their lives.And last but not least: I hope no Hollywood remake is made, although Eddie Murphy and Dustin Hoffman (just my guess due to their looks and similarity) could be tempted to go for it...",The Intouchables

In the past, it was a device used by film journalists to define films made by directors namely Gérard Oury, Georges Lautner, Claude Zidi etc. In recent times, one sees a new breed of directors especially Dany Boon, Michel Munz, Thomas Gilou etc whose films have had tremendous commercial success. The team of Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache is a new entrant to this group. Their film ""The Intouchables"" can be classified as a 'feel good' film with elements of 'popular cinema'. It sacrifices its elements of realism to portray an imperfect world of ""the haves"" and the ""haves not"" through the depiction of how black people are somewhat forced to live in suburbs whereas their friends live in expensive areas of Paris. As a character study of people from different areas, it shows why only a handful of black people are able to mingle with white people.

45,estebangonzalez10,Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy shine in this French feel good movie,9,5 June 2012,"¨Sometimes you have to reach into someone else's world to find out what's missing in your own.¨ Intouchables is a remarkable ¨feel good¨ French film mostly about friendship, but there is a little bit of drama and a love story included as well. This film with relatively unknown directors and actors has managed to make some big noise in Europe, and especially in France where it has become the second highest grossing French film of all time. The key to the success of Intouchables relies on the great chemistry and performances from Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy. They are just absolutely great in this film and their friendship felt authentic and real. The movie mixes the drama with the comedy really well and it works better than most films have in the past when combining two different and sometimes opposite characters together. Sy and Cluzet play totally different characters who come from very different backgrounds, and although we've seen this play out in hundreds of films in the past it works really well here thanks to their terrific performance and a great script from the directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. Cluzet has a sort of a Dustin Huffman vibe and he says so much with his expressions without having to say anything at times, while Sy plays a more outgoing character who isn't afraid to speak his mind. This odd pairing reminded me a lot of another film which I really loved, Goodbye Solo which follows a similar premise at times. Intouchables is a feel good movie, but it transcends the term at times and becomes much more. An absolute must see, especially if you've ever had to work or live with a handicapped person.Philippe (Francois Cluzet) is a very rich quadriplegic who lives in his mansion with several servants and his teenage daughter. He is hiring a live-in carer once again (since most only last a couple of days with him). Driss (Omar Sy) happens to be applying for the job, but actually just wants to get rejected so he can live on welfare without having to work. He's been in prison for the last 6 months and away from home, but Philippe decides to actually hire Driss for the job considering he is someone different who doesn't look at him with empathy and actually treats him like a normal person. Driss and Philippe come from very different backgrounds, but they seem to complement each other very well. Philippe is a millionaire who's interested in art and classical music; while Driss comes from a poor African background, who's interested in pop culture mostly and in bands such as Earth, Wind, and Fire. Driss is really outgoing and becomes really close friends with Philippe. Together they share various stories about their past and end up helping each other solving some present conflicts. There are some other secondary characters whose names I don't even remember because they are not very important to the story, but mostly revolving around other house servants.Intouchables is actually loosely based on a true story involving a quadriplegic and his Arab carer who ends up befriending him. The directors actually came across a documentary about these two men and decided to film a movie about it. One of the greatest things about the film beside the inspiring story was the casting. Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet were really the perfect match and they had me laughing real hard at times and at the border of tears during others. It is truly an emotional and powerful film, a story that will stick with you long after the film ends, and by the time the credits role you will have a smile on your face. It is a feel good movie, but never feels cursi or anything like that. I was really surprised with Omar Sy and hope he gets many more roles. This is really a great French film, very different from Le Prophet but just as good. I had a really good time watching this movie and recommend it to everyone.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",The Intouchables

The subject matter sounds depressing. A moneyed man who is disabled and seems very much alone in the world. A carer who seems not to care. A feral, street savvy, young black man, who the world has taught to look after number one. What blossoms between these unlikeliest of companions is a friendship that touches on the best of human emotions. Kindness, compassion, mutual care and above all a wry sense of humour in the face of adversity. Indeed, this is surprisingly, a comedy. Both of the lead characters are, at their core, a pair of rascals who enjoy having a good time. And what a time they have!I do not remember smiling or laughing so much in a very long time. Or, for that matter, being so honestly touched by this thoroughly unpretentious film. The acting is superb. The chemistry between the leads is amazing. I can not recommend this film enough.

Where Phillipe is at a point in his life where he is ready to give up, Driss comes up with an alternative point of view, and it is his resolution not to wallow in self pity or treat others any differently that attracts Phillipe. Soon, Phillipe is enjoying life again, and he tries to correspond and do something for Driss, and the results will make your spirits soar.The film is rich with emotion, and Phillipe's party and Driss' treat scene are formidable cinema pieces where everything comes together, as the screen fills with music, song, dance, and some striking visuals.This film is a winner.",The Intouchables

54,RainDogJr,dancing in September,8,6 October 2012,"I knew that THE INTOUCHABLES was playing in more cinemas than the ones a European picture usually gets to in Mexico City. It's still playing actually (and will continue to, at least, till next Thursday), which means that the film has survived in cinemas more than a month – a real achievement since this is a city where not even the films of a modern American auteur like Wes Anderson remain in theaters more than a week or two. I watched the trailer of THE INTOUCHABLES (its Mexican title is AMIGOS, which means ""FRIENDS"") once and it seemed all right, but really nothing that attracted me enough to rush to the cinema. Then I realized it was part of IMDb's always-controversial top 250 – I knew I had to check it out as soon as possible, for mere movie geek curiosity. First, I will have to answer to that obvious question regarding the top 250: no, I don't think it's one of the greatest films of all-time, much less the seventieth. In fact, I wasn't impressed but then again, I'm not really part of the kind of audience that love or will love it – I mean, one can easily see why this film is a success with audiences all around the world. It's definitely a good one and I got it and enjoyed the good of it. Is there something bad about it then? Well, not really – the film tried to be both funny and meaningful and it was. One can argue about the underdevelopment of some interesting issues (like the whole background story of one of the two main characters; the one played by Omar Sy), but that would be just unimportant. My girlfriend watched it with me and she enjoyed it a whole lot; in fact, she would watch it again, while I wouldn't. Is clear to me that most women will adore it, so yeah, you should take your special one to see it. To finish this brief commentary, I'm listing some other thoughts on the film:1) The music is very tasty; the American band Earth, Wind & Fire plays an important role here. We have a nice and memorable title sequence inside a car set to one of their songs (""September""); for me it will be very difficult from now on to hear that famous song and not think in Omar Sy's character Driss. And I heard some other good tunes, so I'm definitely getting the full soundtrack (although the band is mentioned by Driss, there aren't Kool & the Gang songs, by the way). 2) A joke on how the art world works reminded of Banksy's EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP. You know, it shows that sometimes art is all about freakin' hype. 3) Omar Sy shines. It was my introduction to this French actor and his character was definitely my favorite element of the film. It's classic stuff really, with a young and crazy-pot-smoking dude who's just f' hilarious – I imagine that the controversial Italian footballer Mario Balotelli is just like Driss (I hope that makes sense to you). 4) The film has the classic ""clash of different worlds"" thing. You know the storyline already, right? The young and crazy dude, from the ghetto, gets a job as the carer of a quadriplegic and wealthy man. It's obvious material, but not really in a bad way – for instance, there's a scene in which Driss is shaving his pal Philippe (the wealthy man; played by François Cluzet, who sort-of looks like Robert De Niro) and I could see the Hitler mustache joke coming a mile away. And just like the joke was still all right, the whole film feels like that no matter of the obvious issues it offers. *Watched it on 23 September, 2012",The Intouchables

It's one of those films built on unconventional friendship and culture clash (also a true story and people it's based on appear in the end credits, similar to 127 Hours), but the difference is that the quadriplegic, Philippe, and the caretaker, Driss, have minimal conflict and bond right away as soon as they adjust to each other. Rather than disapprove or be irritated by Driss interfering or being a nuisance during things Philippe likes, he immediately finds it amusing and refreshing. It's nice to see, but it hinders growth of character, which instead they reach effortlessly by sharing the experience of music, hookers, drugs and paragliding. It is quite entertaining and sometimes moving, but there's not really a story or strong narrative here besides two people improving each others lives through a few light situations.Unfortunately the film doesn't have a particular style or it tries things which feel jarring - such as the montage split screen music video style opening credits after a very strong thriller theme. The cinematography is nothing special and the editing is quite distracting with some scenes with time jump cuts that really didn't do it for me. It does focus on its strongest aspects which are the eccentric and charismatic performances, writing and soundtrack (a mix of R'n'B and classical to fit the characters). All the situations are things we've seen before and it's never dealt in a way we haven't seen before (such as Philippe having a long distance lover that Driss pushes him towards), it is the chemistry of the central friendship that makes the film. It is very pleasant. But those pleasant ideas only work for the 2nd act, after an awkward 1st and 3rd that doesn't really satisfy or close itself. It trades potential for genuine conflict or dilemma for directionless despair due to crisis of confidence and ultimately renders the film not making much of an impression. Granted, as a buddy film, it's pretty damn good and it certainly has its strong feel-good moments.7/10",The Intouchables
58,stensson,Paris in both ways,7,4 November 2012,"It's Pygmalion again. This ex-convict from the dangerous suburbs of Paris gets a job as assistant to a paralyzed millionaire, Philippe. Of course they make friends. Of course they learn from each other's backgrounds. Perhaps they are both Higgins and Eliza at the same time.Could be a rather banal story if it wasn't for this Omar Sy, who has a vitality which lightens both the screen and high brow Paris. It's often funny, seldom touching and quite French.Most certainly this script will be adopted by Hollywood, but I doubt they can find such a Queens or Watts assistant like this Omar Sy. Although the class conflict can be found there too.",The Intouchables

60,intelearts,513th Review: One of the Front Runners For the 2013 Oscars,10,20 October 2012,"Hilarious and moving, Intouchables is simply one of the best films of 2012. Based on a true story the unlikely pairing of an immensely wealthy quadriplegic with an African immigrant carer produces line after line and scene after scene that are genuinely funny (and I mean really funny not just a gentle smirk) and also wonderfully acted.It's a hard film to fault - it isn't over-sentimental or maudlin, but it makes us care - the drama could have been deeper and more dramatic but I, for one, like that it is a genuine odd couple, buddy comedy - it is simply a pleasure to watch - I have seen it twice and enjoyed it more the second time around.It is also, significantly, one of the most affirming film about disability to date - this is not a film looking for your sympathy or tears - but neither does it gloss over or veer away from disability - but it shouts that disability is not inability or shaming - it is certainly a very strong contender for Best Foreign Film and expect to see an American version (Dustin Hoffman would be great - they are almost twins) soon....",The Intouchables

Driss claims the quadriplegic Philippe must be urgently driven to the emergency room; Philippe pretends to have a seizure and the fooled police officers escort them to the hospital.The story of the friendship between the two men is then told as a flashback: Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic who owns a luxurious hôtel particulier, and his assistant Magalie, are interviewing candidates to be his live-in caregiver. Driss, a candidate, has no ambitions to get hired. He is just there to get a signature showing he was interviewed and rejected in order to continue receiving his welfare benefits.

There are lots of films about improbable friendships, so what makes this one so good?A comedy about a serious subject often has to walk a thin line between being too sentimental (the jokes are too decent) and being indelicate (the jokes are too rude).

64,ketgup83,"So many reasons to watch this film - Nice Storyline , strong direction , fantastic performances and above all superb background score",9,15 July 2012,"The Intouchables had cult status written all over it. It is definitely worth watching thanks to the stupendous performances by Omar Sy and François Cluzet, superb direction and astounding background score.Philippe becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident and is in search of a care-taker to look after him. Driss turns up for the interview , not to get the job though but to get a signature for the welfare trust. Impressed with his attitude, Philippe hires him as his care-take. Over a period of time , a rich white mid-age, filthy rich quadriplegic and an unemployed,poor,care-free black guy become good friend and earn mutual respect for each other. As the story progress, we see how two different people from different background becomes close friends and develops a strong bond.Directed by duo Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, The Intouchables, based on true story, is a classic comedy blended with high- octane drama and brave performances. The introductory scene is itself is so impressive that you get engrossed in the film right from the beginning. Hats off to the director to develop the each character effectively which blemishes with film scenario. The script is so tight that you would not feel bore for even a single second in the film. Couple of scenes are hilarious in the movie. The scene where Driss dances to his own tune on Philippe birthday party , the scene where Driss warns Bastein to stay away from Philippe's daughter are just like icing on the cake. Even the emotional scenes have shot so well coupled with beautiful background score. Coming to the performances , I was totally floored by Omar Sy's gallant performance. He makes the film alive the moment he steps in the scene. His care-free , straight from the heart , funny-loving character will stay with you even after leaving the theater for sometime. François Cluzet puts in powerhouse performance as Philippe. It takes guts to sit on chair through the entire film and still act well with just the expressions. Brilliant !!!I kept on hearing about this film for long time and am glad I took the decision to watch the film. There are so many reasons to watch this film - Nice Storyline , strong direction , fantastic performances and above all superb background score that gels with mood of the film !!! Highly recommended : 4/5",The Intouchables
65,proud_luddite,Over-rated,5,9 October 2020,"This film is based on a true story: in Paris, a poor Senegalese immigrant (Driss) becomes the live-in personal caretaker of a very wealthy man who is quadriplegic (Philippe). Despite their differences, they connect well (predictably).Occasionally, the film does well with that winning premise: the snobs against the slobs. Some moments are pleasant and mildly moving though not as hilarious as they could be. Still, it was difficult to be taken into this film mainly because of the characterization of Driss. Frequently, he's rude, overbearing, arrogant, and bullying. The film goes too far when Driss is disciplining others who seem spoiled when he himself seems to need the most discipline. Nonetheless, actor Omar Sy does a fine job in the role.The viewer hardly knows about Philippe's character and why he would take so well to Driss although scenes of upper-class stuffiness around Philippe might give some hints. Knowing more about Philippe might have helped.Apparently, this movie is a phenomenon in France . This must be one of those rare times I miss out on French culture which I often admire.",The Intouchables
66,sharky_55,No Pity,8,12 June 2015,"Intouchables opens with a non-linear introduction of the two central characters, Philippe (François Cluzet), and Driss (Omar Sy). It's a remarkable direction to go with because it so easily and gently presents the strong bond of the pair in just a few minutes. We later come back to this scene and it slips into the narrative quite comfortably. The important thing about their on-screen relationship is that it doesn't lean on the handicap which defines the difference between them. You get a genuine sense of connection and attachment with only a few lines and that's before the wheelchair or the disability is revealed. Such is the chemistry and performance of the pair that they shine in every single scene of the film. The whole disadvantaged person comes into contact with a higher class and changes his whole life and perspective is not the most original story of course. It's an slightly altered version of the white saviour narrative; a more modern Driving Miss Daisy if you will. It's not so much a race issue; Driss' real life counterpart was not black. But it's still quite easy to distinguish the difference in class. There's a nice piece of cinematography after the open where we dolly across a row of applicants for the role of carer, seeing a blurred pallet of pant suits and leather shoes until we reach the sweatpants and worn sneakers of Driss. It doesn't get much more explicit; for most of the film his background isn't referred to that often. A hint of criminal activity there, a few insights into the cramped apartment he shares with his extended family. The hand-held cam gets whipped out for the seldom times when Driss is actually among similar demographic, but there's not much really happening. It's never even made clear why Driss has to leave and help out his family other than some sort of street-fight. Some may deride this approach as shallow. We see the extraordinary good side of Driss and not the bad side. Those criticisms have some merit but for once it is refreshing to kick back and just be entertained instead of expecting a thorough investigation into the race- relations and poverty scene of modern day France. Driss is one of the most likable characters of recent times because there are no real repercussions for his story. The screenplay does not aim to provide a start-to-end standard plot but leans heavily on their characterisation and chemistry. It's a very simply premise which we've all come to expect. Driss isn't even Tsundere from the beginning. He shows no real aspirations in life and aimslessly bounces from place to place, living on the benefit. And so Philippe makes a wager; for the person who has lived on assistance his whole life to try his own hand at assisting others. The opening scene is a very obvious endpoint of the relationship but that does not derail the set up. Omar Sy's performance is one of great laughter and passion. It doesn't take long before he warms to the whole scenario and the chemistry between him and Cluzet is palpable from the very beginning. Much of that is derived from humour; the pair manages to turn most scenes into comedic ones and their relationship is so authentic and heart- warming that their laughter becomes contagious. There's more serious conversations as well; these are fair and few between and don't overstep their boundary. There's of course a mid-film montage as Driss gets more settled in, but that comes after a large stretch of discourse time where we familiarise ourselves with him. His character is pretty distinct amongst all the other candidates (perhaps a little too distinct as evident by the horrible job the replacements do). His larger than life reactions to the high class living conditions, his amusement at every little thing, his childish attitude and caring nature. One of the most thematically important quotes of the film comes from Phillipe: ""That's exactly what I want. No pity."" It encapsulates their entire relationship as transcending the disability; Driss sees him as a friend, as an equal. It strengthens their bond so much more. There's a moment when they attend a 4 hour theatre play. The first act begins and an absurdly dressed man walks on stage, playing a tree, and starts to shriek in German. Driss takes one look at this and bursts out laughing, while moments later Phillipe starts to hold back chuckles as well, apparently recognising the ridiculousness of it all. It's so easy as a viewer to slip into either of those mindsets. Intouchables, like many other films based on true events, doesn't attempt to give any true ending or sense of closure. There's the love plot of Phillipe's epistolary relationship which attempts to once again give him that happy ending but is overshadowed quite easily by that of Driss'. It's a very authentic and genuine friendship which evolves slowly but surely, not driven by plot but a pure and deep connection. Omar Sy's captivating performance is enough to stamp out any minor flaws in the film (the painting storyline being one of them). Even recognising them, it's a very hard film to dislike.",The Intouchables

It offers a wonderfully candid study of an unlikely human relationship between a handicapped white aristocrat and an uneducated and unsophisticated black caregiver. Their chemistry is improbable magic. There are many messages here. But the basic one is that people are people. Not only is the story warm and human, the cinematography is superb...inspiring camera work! There is so much that Hollywood can learn from Europe about creating rather than manufacturing movies.

Outstanding use of music that is melded into the story.At times the sub-titles blend into the background and are hard to read. The movie is a tad too long. There is a lack of father daughter relationship in the movie that already seems to have been left on the cutting room floor.It not the kind of story that draws a wide audience.

But watching the film, what was an unexpected surprise was the outstanding performance of Omar Sy, he just absolutely steals the movie. It's one of the best performances and films you'll see anytime this year (any year). It was no fluke it became the second highest grossing box office French film of all time, and Sy receiving the César Award for Best Actor for his role.

71,itamarscomix,Sweet and Funny,8,19 May 2012,"It's not hard to see how Intouchables become a hit. It's a crowd pleaser in the true sense of the word; a movie that works to appeal to every sector of the audience, and uses a familiar formula that's been seen many times before. Interestingly, though, it doesn't resort to the lowest common denominator. Nakache and Toledano were clearly aware of the fact that they're not offering any new revelations, and instead focused on making the movie as entertaining, touching and effective as possible, and it works, loath as I am to admit it. The movie is fast-paced, fantastically edited, always entertaining, sitting squarely on the border between comedy and drama; the two leads, François Cluzet and Omar Sy, have perfect chemistry and make even the crudest jokes work. More impressively, they make even the most cynical viewer forget that they heard it all before.Intouchables is, in fact, one of those precious few films I can label as 'almost perfect', in that it's impossible to point out any particular flaws. The biggest flaw, and the only reason I gave it a less than perfect rating, is simply how predictable it is. It's very easy to ignore while you're watching, but Intouchables is, in fact, a formula movie, which doesn't really have anything that new or interesting to say, and doesn't do anything that wasn't done before. That doesn't detract anything, though, from the fact that it's an excellent movie and practically impossible not to enjoy, if only because the two leads are so incredibly likable and so much fun to spend 90 minutes with.",The Intouchables

How many will succeed, one per cent? This film focuses on a aristocrat who hires a poor African from the suburbs of Paris. How often that happens in the real life? Not that often.Plot is, well OK, but not that realistic, and that is what I hate.

Almost every phase, and every point in this movie is so conventional and unoriginal. However, this movie is very remarkable! That's because it surpasses all the feel-good movies of its kind.Needless to mention the high-class direction from Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano that made this movie exceptional. Thanks to this superb direction, The Intouchables delivers broad laughs and tugs at the heartstrings without delving too deep, or present anything new. Sometimes the movie becomes so hilarious, and other times you couldn't help shedding some tears, often, of joy! The best thing about this movie that it kept its lighter tone throughout its runtime. The tonal shift when the movie moves from its second to its third act wasn't smooth, though. That being said, you will never find any movie of this kind that has half its magical moments.The friendship between Philippe and Driss is simply unparalleled. That's, of course, due to the insanely magnetic chemistry between Omar Sy and François Cluzet. I bet you can find such chemistry in any other movie of the same kind.The soundtrack is perfectly utilized to match the movie's bright tone. And the cinematography is beautiful, but what I think made the movie looks spectacular is its fancy production design.The third act is definitely a bit rushed but I feel like the ending more than makes up for it. This ending could be the sweetest and most charming ending ever. You couldn't decide if you should cry or laugh, but don't worry because you would do both.(8/10)",The Intouchables

Central to the films success are the two leads Francois Cluzet ( looking remarkably like Dustin Hoffman) and Omar Sy. Both are likable and bring real depth to their roles making you root for both of them. The supporting cast are excellent and there isn't a false performance throughout. The films pacing is excellent and although it was nearly 2 hours long you really just want it to continue. A lot of films are let down by the ending but this one really delivers on the emotional front. There is nothing that lets this film down, it's that good.

76,skepticskeptical,"Interracial, Interclass Brom-Com Buddy Flick",5,25 May 2020,"I had to watch Intouchables because I am on a mission to see all of the imdb top 250. Turns out that this list tells much more about the viewers than the films.Intouchables is a case in point. First off, despite being a rom-com (more specifically, a bromance buddy flick), it ranks, nearly a decade after its launch, #44. Must be a masterpiece, something so unique and original that it has never been done in romcom before, right? Wrong.I regret to report that all of the comedy of this brom-com revolves around the defeat or support of deeply entrenched stereotypes of black people. If you invite them to the opera or a classical music concert, they will disrupt it. The quality of women of most importance to Africans in Paris is white booty. They eat Nutella with spoons out of a jar. They have never seen a full-sized bathtub. They live in HLM (Habitations à Loyer Modéré, aka housing projects) with literally neighborhoods of siblings, all being cared for by a stressed-out single mother, as all of the fathers have disappeared. Black males resolve problems through resort to violence. But they love to dance (to Earth, Wind & Fire!) and are always up for a good ho-op. Please just put them behind the wheel of a Maserati Quattroporte, pass the doobie, and let the fun begin!But, hey, it's all good: because one of these guys proves to the rich white world that a person corresponding to the above stereotype can also be a Mensch!My guess is that most of the 10 ratings of this flick were given by people who have as friends no persons of color. These inflated ratings reflect the viewers' own pleasant surprise at how nice (and clean!) black people can be.",The Intouchables
77,Imdbidia,Excellent film,9,24 April 2017,"The Intouchables, despite the title, really touches viewers' heart without being corny, pitiful or tearful. This a comedy that does keep your mouth on the silly-smile mode from beginning to end, because it's funny, it makes you laugh, but is not vulgar, cheesy or cookie-cutter made. The directors and scriptwriters juggled all the dramatic and comedic elements beautifully, and nothing is too much, too less, or so-so. The dialogues and situations are brilliant at times, very candid frequently, and really genuine at times. I found myself totally absorbed by the story and by the interaction of the two main characters.This movie would have been different if the cast was not as good and credible as they are, from the supporting roles of the troubled kids, to the upper-nose relatives of Philippe. Yet, François Cluzet & Omar Sy carry the weight of the story, and they are brilliant. Not even for a second I saw them as actors playing a role, but as Philippe and Driss. Besides, they have an amazing chemistry on camera and on this resides, for the most part, the charm of the film.The movie is beautifully filmed, with lovely indoors and outdoors scenes, and a wonderful lighting. It captures well the real Paris: the wonderful elegant areas of central Paris where the bourgeoisie lives, but also the very poor and marginalized banlieus of the periphery where most immigrants live. However, the aim of the film is not that of showing those dramatic differences but, on the contrary, to show how human connection is possible no matter your origin, it can be possible and magical despite, a priori, thinking that would never happen. It does not matter your social class, your gender, your past, your culture, your family or your ethnic background. The score is beautifully poetic and quintessential Ludovico Einaudi. If you have ever listened to any of his musical pieces, you will immediately recognize the music in those progressive repetitive a-la-Philip Glass soft wanderings of the piano. Just wonderful.My only criticism to the film is that we get to know Phillipe's character quite well by the end of the film, but not so much or as much that of Driss. We know that he comes from a troubled impoverished immigrant family living in a poor suburb, but we don't know much about him, the person, the man, what his dreams, fears, longings are, or what he was doing before the story began.The Intouchables is a mesmerizing, heart-warming and very funny film.

79,asda-man,Very touchable!,9,4 April 2013,"Prepare yourselves for one of the most touching relationships ever brought to screen! Forget Fred and Ginger, forget Humphrey and Ingrid, because now it's all about Phillipe and Driss. Most French films I watch are nasty (but brilliant) shockers like Inside and Martyrs. Of course I've seen the odd gentler one like, I've Loved You So Long but even that's depressing. The funniest French films I've seen are Jean-Pierre Jeunet's, Amelie and Micmacs, but Untouchable just about betters both of them. It's not just one of the most funny and touching French films I've seen, but just films in general. Only a seriously bitter and cynical person could hate Untouchable.The film opens with wit and energy as we see Phillipe and Driss trying to out-run and out-smart the police for speeding. It's a funny and clever sequence and just a taste for the even more amusing shenanigans to follow. But of course we can't just jump into the middle of the film! We need what Midge calls, ""a flash-back"" so we can see how they got there. What Untouchable does so well is build up its characters so we can care about them. Driss comes from a working-class background, living in a tiny and over-crowded flat. He's also a thief and his Mum has kicked him out, and although Driss is a thief we can still care about him, especially as the film goes on and we see just how funny he is.Phillipe is the opposite. He's a hugely rich invalid with silly money to spend on paintings that look like ""a nosebleed"" as Driss puts it. But like magnets opposites attract. Driss is obviously attracted to his lavish quarters, already bigger than the whole flat he used to live in! The film takes time building up their relationships, as we see them bond through some very funny and touching moments. The directors make the audience feel as though we're bonding with them, so in a sense it's a three-way relationship and becomes all the more personal. Untouchable is also a comedy, there are some hilarious moments which I won't spoil, but it had me and the audience laughing pretty much all the way through.The directing is really well done, and I also really liked the music which made some touching scenes even more touching! It's no wonder that Untouchable was a huge hit in France, because it's such a light-hearted and entertaining film, yet is also quite memorable too, thanks to the wonderful performances, witty screenplay and classy directing. Untouchable is a sort of rom-com but Jennifer Anniston is no where in sight! It's one of those 'buddy movies' which shows a touching kind of platonic love similar to that of Rain Man. It's a relationship we can all relate to and care about the couple involved.Untouchable is a French classic and one I hope to watching in years to come. I defy anyone to watch and not to become involved in Phillipe and Driss' wonderful relationship. An endlessly funny and moving film which those with a sense of humour can enjoy. It's a wonderful feel-good film!",The Intouchables

I vow myself to complete that list soon. When I watched the trailer it was reminiscent of another film ""The Bucket List"", so that set the expectation. Yet, when I watched the whole film, I was happier, more involved and I felt it was more realistic. Omar Sy, the actor who played the role of Driss did an amazing job. After many films, I was left awestruck by such a realistic and easy performance. He lived it, just did not play the part is what I felt.The screenplay was terrific, it was straight and without any complications. The film just flew by in 1 hour 52 minutes of running time, thus, I owe the credit to editing which was apt.Directors were faithful I believe to the original story which was two real persons. I thank the writers and directors for being unsympathetic and yet very realistic with the film.One word that I can echo with the film is ""Pragmatic"".

Which means it's in FRENCH. Which means there are subtitles!!! Arrrggghhh.For the readers who actually have a brain, Intouchables (Untouchable for those who can't work it out) will almost certainly end the year as one of the most tender, beautiful films of 2012. Yes, it was released in France last year but this is no place for such pedantry.Intouchables is the true story of Phillipe (François Cluzet), a wealthy, aristocratic quadriplegic and his relationship with his caretaker-cum-care assistant, the reluctant, defiant Driss (Omar Sy). When Driss turns up for an interview at Phillipe's home it is with the sole intention of failing in order to qualify for unemployment benefit. Phillipe, however, sees in him a man who will challenge and inspire him and, much to the annoyance of Magalie (Spiral's Audrey Fleurot), hires him on the spot.And so begins a clash of culture, class and conduct from which both parties will surely emerge richer, softer and sharper.There are no surprises in the broad story; if a true-life tale is worthy of the big screen treatment, there's a very good chance it sticks to the formula, although don't dismiss Intouchables as merely formulaic. The surprise here is how effortlessly engaging, inspiring and downright funny it is. No, it isn't specifically a comedy but I laughed out loud more often and with less control than I have in any films billed as such this year so far.There's no great villain, no huge love story, no major tragedy, just a simple story of friendship where two men, though apparently diametrically opposed in every aspect, are absolutely meant to share their lives and have more in common and so much more to give each other then either could have considered.Cluzet, in a welcome return to British screens after last year's superb Little White Lies, is huggably dour as Phillipe with an outer crust and a rod up his backside that are begging to be shattered. Sy meanwhile, in his most prominent film for English-speaking audiences (other than a supporting turn in Micmacs), storms into frame with a demeanour that would make most of us back away and cover our throats. But though we get the measure of both men fairly quickly and there are no road-to-Damascus conversions, each of them evolves and when the inevitable tug at the heartstrings arrives, it brings a hollowness that you'll hope desperately can be filled. Soon.I really want to award Intouchables another couple of stars but it misses out on perfection for being too swift and not allowing itself the time to unveil the arcs of a couple of supporting characters that could have added greater depth to the film. Although we meet members of Diss' family at various points, there is another plot line with them that is never fully explored and there is more that occurs in Phillipe's household than we are allowed to fully enjoy.But these are minor quibbles. See it. See it before it disappears from your local screen. See it if The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel left you hankering after India, see it if The Chorus made your heart skip, see it if Oh, just go and see it. It's beautiful, warm and very, very funny.",The Intouchables

84,diane-34,Omar Sy makes the movie his own; see it for his performance!,10,10 November 2012,"Diane and I saw this remarkable movie two days ago and we both laughed and cried and wondered at the first-rate performances particularly by Omar Sy who masterfully played the Senegalese guy who became Francois Cluzet's carer.The story, superficially, is a simple one of a quadriplegic guy who hires a new carer to do everything for him because he has no movement from his neck down. The guy he chooses to be his new carer (he is extremely rich also) is a Senegalese migrant who needs the work but has absolutely no training. The movie, and it's very funny, revolves around this strange relationship between the white guy who can do so little for himself and the black guy who can do everything for both of therm. The episodes this African guy gets the white guy into constitute the bulk of the movie and I would put it on your list of can't miss films.The Intouchables explores the strange blocks that are put in the way of people trying to make a life with a severe handicap: Cluzet's character must overcome his physical disability and Sy's character must overcome his race in a city that prides itself on being proper which means having no colour. They use each other's handicap to their own advantage with wonderful movie delights for the viewer.I was taken by how Driss, Sy's character, used his remarkable force of character to over awe all the people that he needed to do something different: his relations, people going about there daily business or virtually anyone in which he came into contat.",The Intouchables

86,willcundallreview,Wonderful French cinema,9,25 March 2015,"Rating-9/10The Intouchables is a sweet French comedy drama all about a disabled man and his carer. It is a tale of not only happiness but life affirming thoughts and actions and one film you mustn't miss. It is sweet and very emotional, but can then change into a kind of vicious emotion, attacking your very emotion but by the end you come out thinking nice thoughts and you really do feel something for all involved.Now it isn't that this is something completely new, a revolutionary new thought process in film, we have seen films like this before. The thing is that this movie is hilarious as well as interesting and all together it just breathes brilliance and fun. The funniest character has to be Driss(brilliantly played by Omar Sy) who is not only hilariously funny, also holds a deep side which can really draw you into him.In general the movie is all round acted well, Not only Omar Sy puts in a good performance, Francois Cluzet is great as the disabled character Phillipe and members such as Anne Le Ny and Audrey Fleurot add to the beautiful portrayals. I think as I said before, you can really connect with the people in this and they feel like real people(it is to be fair based on a true story), but they really feel similar even if stinking rich some of them.The direction is beautifully done by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano who both seem to skilfully deal with the matter and make it feel so normal and also of course humorous. Along with the direction, the cinematography is done well too and the shots used are not only perfect but add to the atmosphere the scenes are trying to get across.The true gem of this movie and the true heart and soul is the script, written by the two directors, Nakache and Toledano seem to bring in a lovely thought process and make this a movie containing loud laughs and then down to maybe even near tears. The script is the best thing about this and I felt that more nominations could have been given to it for that, maybe even international awards that weren't just for foreign film.All that saying it can be said, this has been done before. Now I explained what I thought but some may feel this is too similar to the kind of feel sorry for them story this really does have. Another point is the partly cringe thing that is, a white millionaire and his poor black carer, it just feels too much like ""oh hey lets make it like the poor guy can change and so can the rich guy, and lets make them different races"", it kind of annoyed me and although it works well in the end, it could have just been anyone and still been interesting.This movie really does represent French cinema at it's best and I dare say it makes you want to see more. With it's quick wit and well time and length(112 minutes) this is really a movie I couldn't recommend more, to those who feel maybe they need to see film that really talks about true life, this is one, and although most of us will not experience anything in this, you still feel like your in the characters skins anyway. Overall I felt it was brilliant just gloriously wonderful, not perfect by a little way but still a movie all should see.",The Intouchables

89,david-meldrum,"Funny and touching, but not all it could or should be.",6,30 December 2014,"A French-language based on a true story drama, The Intouchables is ... touching ... but not as good as it likes to think it is. In the mind of its creators it seems to be a comic drama of immense human significance; in reality it is powerful and affecting and funny at different times. It's also clichéd, patronising and predictable. It's the story of a rich, privileged quadriplegic man who needs to hire a new carer. He picks a young man with no qualifications and no experience from the Paris housing projects. What follows is a predictable but still effective clash of cultures and expectations, with mutual learning taking place on both sides of the divide. The films seems at pains to not offend with its sensitive subject matter, the overall effect seeming to be at times patronising to the poor and the disabled alike. All poor people like hip-hop, it seems; all the rich, classical music. The quadriplegic man struggles to feel, you see. Yes, really. All a bit trite at times. At others is affecting though. It chimed with me at points; it encourages an engaging, counter- cultural lack of safety and wisdom the better to actually build meaningful lives and relationships, to break artificial barriers and self-limitations. It's encourages a kind of holy recklessness on its viewers, that you suspect will get lost amidst the worthiness for many. If only the film itself had shown a little more danger and a little less safety, we could have had something more special and less crowd-pleasing.",The Intouchables

91,Marc_Israel_365,Unconventional friendship for hire!,8,14 March 2017,"I wanted to like this film before watching it. Is that a bad thing? I read the basic story line and believed the movie would deliver an experience worth its time. I only knew Omar Sy (Driss) from director Jean Pierre Juneauts' ""Micmacs"" where his knack was a proliferation of clichés that trailed off topic, but ended in that contagious smile and accompanying laugh. Not much to work with.... Not so here. From the opening scene, we know the unconventional inertia of Driss, as childlike stating the elephant in the room and his street smarts, but without Francois Cluzets' portrayal of Phillipe the paraplegic, we would have an immature caretaker with a drooling invalid with no heart or purpose. We couldn't be laughing at our own self imposed limitations. Yes, without Phillipe being rich beyond belief, we'd have no action. Much like the brilliant ""The Diving Bell and The Butterfly"", this story takes us away from our spoiled selves, not just cinematically but spiritually. Here it is filled with its own Hollywood clichés of dance scene, car chase and feel goodness, but that doesn't distract from the plot as much as it could have in a s""sell out"" studio requirement. There is personal acceptance over stereotypical forced growth experiences and makes for a good film.",The Intouchables
92,WhimsicalVonia,"A portrayal of an unlikely friendship, so resolute as to be ""Untouchable""",10,20 November 2013,"It's been a while since I have had such a good laugh, quickly followed by tears when watching a film. The last one was probably 50/50. The Intouchables, however, I found to be a much more emotionally evocative and explored difficult topics (i.e. racism, socioeconomic strata, gangs, disability, sex, parenting, loyalty, and acceptance) with eloquence. Not to mention the soundtrack, which was diverse, including both classical/piano solos and R &B, but exceptional. Omar Sy, a little known actor, showed impressive acting talent on par with Francois Cluzet; The two had wonderful on screen chemistry. Any lesser performance of Drisser could have easily made him a hateful character. Somehow, despite the harsh things Driss says and his seemingly unempathetic actions (brazenly making his way into the interview and demanding a signature; refusing to compromise for his gracious employer or any of his coworkers; aggressively pursuing Magalie, making almost offensive passes; pouring hot water over & over, fascinated to see that Philippe cannot feel it, always acting like the tough guy and refusing to show any kindness or weakness; his carelessness almost causing serious harm to Philippe a few times), Omar Sy manages to make Driss quite the opposite. Of course, we soon learn that despite the act he tries to put on, he has a very kind heart. This is exemplified in so many indescribable gestures, allowances, and gestures throughout the latter part of the film, my favorite being the final scene of course, where he has set up a date for Philippe to meet Eleanor. Philippe and Eleonore had been carrying on with an epistolary relationship for over six months, but Philippe had, to that point, been understandably too afraid of rejection to reveal his true physical state and situation. The other more minor characters are almost all played wonderfully as well, Yvonne the awkward co-worker, Magalie, Philippe's secretary and Driss's love interest, Driss's mother/aunt, and his other family members. Even Philippe's brother and the caretaker who replaces Driss. The impressive thing is that this film manages to not only be funny, but witty. And there is a significant difference. References to popular culture, art, music, and current events (Obama, Hitler, Bieber, Michelangelo (The Turtle), Goya, Dali, Opera, Mozart, Schubert, Earth Wind, & Fire, etc.) are welcomed and educated, usually given in the context of witty banter. The cinematography, especially on the weekend paragliding adventure and the closing scene by the Cabourg seaside, is extraordinary. The use of angles and mise en scene is great throughout, even in the opening scene of the car chase in the Maserati. In the end, the title really says it all. It should really be named ""The Untouchables"", as ""intouchable"" is French for ""untouchable"". This is a story about disability, racism, and all those other difficult-to- discuss topics. But on a deeper level, it is about friendship, love, and loyalty. Throughout most of the film, nobody understands why Philippe has hired such an unqualified individual, seeing Driss as a true outsider. The two of them, however, in their own way, don't give a damn about what anyone else thinks. Through their friendship, they teach each other things, learning and enriching each others' lives, bringing out the best in each other. Like any great friendship, they have many inside things nobody else would really understand, illustrated in numerous favorite scenes, like the erogenous zones of the ear, Driss's comments regarding the audacity of The Opera, Driss's initial lack of appreciation for art but then creating a masterpiece of sorts, ""Nice knowing you!"" (Philippe giving Driss a difficult time during their flight), ""Where can you find a tetraplegic? Where you left him!"", the endearing way in which Driss dances to Earth, Wind, & Fire and encourages other guests to do the same, turning Philippe's usually sad affair of a birthday party into a fun one, etc. etc. etc. In this way, their unlikely friendship is untouchable. Individually, of course, they are also separately untouchable, Driss with his blunt, hardened approach to life and others, and Philippe quite literally, being a quadriplegic. (Notably, in regards to his birthday party, he mentions how everyone acts like they care, but the sincerity is questionable.) For these reasons, sadly, most of society treats them as ""untouchable""; individuals of a lower class. That this film is based on a true story makes it that much more extraordinary. I realize some of the facts were misrepresented, but that is why it is ""based on"" and not a true biography. I intend to locate a copy of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo's ""A Second Wind"" and/or Abdel Sellou's (Driss) ""You Changed My Life"" when I can. For me, the idea that this film was predictable means nothing. The art of great cinema is taking a story, predictable or not, and illustrating it in such a way that viewers fall in love with the characters and walk away feeling differently than when they began; inspired to think differently, act differently. The Intouchables did this, without a doubt.",The Intouchables
93,HelenMary,warm uplifting story of two different characters forging a friendship,7,27 May 2013,"Amusing heartwarming drama about a quadriplegic millionaire who looks for a carer, but all the ""professional"" applicants are condescending, unfeeling and all about their paper qualifications and academic knowledge reducing Philippe (Francois Cluzet) to an object. Driss (Omar Sy) is at the interview just to get Benefits but his irreverence and dismissive laissez faire attitude actually meant that he treated Philippe like a person. A heartwarming relationship grows with it's ups and downs, bringing in more about each of their pasts and hopes for the future.The film is simply filmed, with a witty and gripping script (subtitled into English), which isn't lost in translation. The actors Cluzet and Sy were brilliant in their respective roles with Cluzet brilliantly portraying quadriplegic, only able to move his head and face, but his acting is a commitment to trust in that he has to remain still and inflexible. Sy was exuberant, fun and wild but also showing sensitivity and well-portrayed comic-stupidity. There's music, art and dancing, love and sexuality, fast cars, adrenalin sports, laughs a-plenty but also desperation, struggle and prejudice.It's well acted but whilst the plot is based on a true story, and has something for everyone in true 'underdog makes good' or 'Rainman-esque' style, the screenplay is lacking something. I'm not sure what it is, I think perhaps it's that there are holes in the characters, and in the plot and you are left with questions; you feel it's going to go a certain way... I expected more with Philippe's daughter 'Uncle Buck' style but liked how Driss lightened the mood of the house and brought joy and friendship to the story but ultimately there was something unfulfilled with his character, there wasn't enough depth and finish. I felt that use of Driss played to stereotypes, especially finding out that the original carer wasn't from Senegal but North Africa/Morocco and I wonder whether the story was exaggerated for the screenplay.I liked this film a lot, highly watchable and enjoyable and a very good cinematic experience. I can see why this was lauded but it's not particularly original and did play to stereotypes and didn't feel exactly finished. I was glad I saw it though, and it is apparently France's second most successful film after Welcome to the Sticks. A wonderful soundtrack, the Chamber Orchestra scene was great.",The Intouchables

95,OttoVonB,One of the Most Unique and Beautiful Friendships ever Committed to Film,10,27 November 2011,"Do not look at this through the prism of ""Foreign Films"". You'd be wasting your time and miss something far too important.Hollywood does scale like nobody else, leaving the competition gasping in its wake. France does intimacy, and brutality. Nothing is sacred. And rather than try to revive the New Wave or emulate Hollywood like most widely seen French films of late, ""Intouchables"" harnesses its core strengths - ease with intimacy, willingness to ridicule anything and brutal honesty - and delivers one of the funniest, most honest and touching films I have ever seen.Sy is a failed robber, going through the motions and playing the stereotypical jobless émigré. Cluzet is a romantic and melancholy mind trapped in a useless body. The circumstances that bring them together are too funny to spoil here, but meet they do, and an awkward relationship quickly blossoms as they bring out the best in each other.The film's simplicity is delightfully misleading: the script is a masterpiece of comedy writing, and however good the rest of the cast is, the central duo is magical. Sy's comic timing will have you in stitches, but it is his honesty and vulnerability that make you fall in love with the character. Cluzet isn't your typical sad-sack, instead, much of the finest pleasures in the film consist in watching him use his keen mind to mess with the world around him (a subplot about an abstract painting really takes the biscuit, you'll know it when you see it).This is one of the most unique, beautiful and honest friendships ever committed to film.

First of all, there are countless humorous and funny humor of Driss and Philip.Driss is low-interest, low-educated, loves pornography, and likes to use violence to solve problems. But this does not hinder his innate self-confidence, the whole person is full of tension and vitality.In contrast, Philip, who was born and lived in a high-level crowd, showed that he was different from Driss, but he was very eager.They redeemed each other, helped each other, stumbled and walked through each other's most difficult time.Everyone will get sick sometimes, and philippe will choose Driss at first because he thinks he has chosen a relatively irresponsible person who can ignore his life indifferently. As a result, in the process of getting along with him during the day, he found that the passionate, sunny, and informal boy was changing him.For most people, a person who has been in and out of prison all year round cannot gain the respect of others, but he regards Driss as a confidant and takes care of his enthusiasm carefully.As a wealthy man who loses his mobility, he will not feel inferior in his heart. When facing a girl who has a good impression on him, even if he is gentleman, funny, rich and connotative, he will still feel confident in the straightforward words of others drop. Since then, the line of defense in my heart has completely disintegratedHe forced Driss away and lost the friend who made him optimistic, as if life had become boring. So in the end Driss came back to make him smile again and hope for life.So many times, when disasters and sufferings come, we have no choice but to face optimism. Don't give up hope of survival.It turns out that people are destined to become more lonely and get smaller in the circle of living, because noisy people are tired of coping, and a few like-minded people are enough.Love is like friendship. There are more people who have heard and fewer people. But in fact, the emotional world is often fair.

Le fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain is the top French movie (for me)! I think that the movie has to thank its high score to the brilliant and utterly convincing acting of Omar. His acting and presence really are believable and you feel connection to him and to the millionaire through him. Of course, the story itself has the universal appeal of compassion, understanding, struggle and faith.I liked the part that touches on art. 40.000 euros for a painting with a red dot on canvas?!

Funny and touching at the same time, the picture evolves with simplicity but strong pathos, with the merit of avoiding every pathetic or melodramatic attitude: there's brutal honesty in representing the real condition of Philippe, as well as Driss's initial uncompassionate attitude. There are touching moments, there are true amusing moments, both accompanied by a forceful soundtrack. Acting proves brilliant, to say the least, and the pairing between Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy sparkles and captures the viewer's attention.

Its a traditional story of a rich guy meets a poor guy and the two become friends. The rich guy likes classical music, the poor guy likes pop music. The rich guy likes art, the poor guy, prostitutes.

To his surprise (and initial disappointment), he gets the job and then -- things change for both him and his new employer.This is a marvelous, inspirational, feel good ""fairy tale"" of how two men, each very handicapped in different ways, can transform each other. Based loosely on the lives of two actual people, the writers-directors have taken abundant liberties and created a comedy much appreciated in Europe and sure also to be around the globe. They condensed the action from 10 years to 1, changed many outcomes, invented many scenes. No matter--these actors, Omar Sy & Francois Cluzet, are SO great, they make us believe.My ratings: 9.5 of 10 stars as an entertaining movie (-- but 3.5 of 10 as quasi-realistic biographies).The principal characters of this movie have each written books which give FAR more realistic views than this movie of their lives and actions before and after meeting (they're still friends). If interested, read Phillipe Pozzo di Borgo's ""A Second Wind"" (a very remarkable man & humanitarian) and Abdel Sellous's ""You Changed My Life"". Both are good reads in different ways.

Sure, it sounds cheesy, but I have to say, the more foreign films I see, the more I find that I truly enjoy.The Intouchables, written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, is a total wild card, and it works in ways that are completely indescribable. The sense of purity and genuinity is evident throughout the film, and is wholeheartedly embraced by the audience. The Intouchables is based on the true-life events of Philippe (François Cluzet), a wealthy quadriplegic, and Driss (Omar Sy), a young man with a troubled background, who Philippe hires as his caretaker. The film follows the interesting relationship that develops between these two men - one of mutual respect and true friendship.While the foreign reception of this movie has been overwhelmingly successful, the stateside opinions of this movie have been fairly varied, most of which find this movie to be racist, demeaning, or otherwise offensive. I feel as though these opinions are somewhat ridiculous, as the movie itself doesn't ever make race an issue; unless you are trying to read into the fact that the white man is rich and the black man is poor, these men are more peers that initially meets the eye. The unexpected companionship of these two men results in fantastic comedic opportunities, and not only are they hilarious, but they are touching and emotionally raw.The true magic in this film shines through by way of the incredible acting talent, and their obvious fervor for their craft. It is no surprise that both actors were awarded the honor of Best Actor at the 2011 Tokyo International Film Festival; additionally, Omar Sy's performance as Driss helped him to edge out Jean Dujardin (The Artist) for the César Award for Best Actor. It is rare to find two individuals that have the connection that Sy and Cluzet share on screen, and their interaction is wholly refreshing.This and the remaining components of the movie all seamlessly work together to provide a satisfying backdrop for the heartwarming story. At one point, Philippe's lawyer displays concern over the choice of Driss as Philippe's caretaker, due to his questionable background. Philippe indicated that such was of no concern, and he was merely grateful to be treated as a person, not as someone with a disability.While I understand that many American viewers will maintain a perception that this movie is offensive on some level, I feel as though the way we as Americans view race is severely different from those in other countries. While I don't consider myself an expert or ""advocate"" for awareness of racial discrimination, I find that the perpetuation of such through the media is unacceptable. Still, I think that this movie warrants an open mind, as it ventures beyond the obvious issues, and touches on a level of humanity that surpasses the pulling of the racism card.To be quite honest, this movie was probably one of the best movies I have seen all year. From a fantastic cast to an emotionally touching story that doesn't get lost or muddled in translation, The Intouchables has leaped its way to the top of my list for possible Oscar nominations (which isn't a far stretch of the imagination). I would definitely recommend this as a movie to put on your ""must see"" list - I don't think you will be disappointed.",The Intouchables
111,supermaggie,Hypocritical justification of inaction and complacency for the healthy ones,3,27 June 2016,"I know I am pretty much alone with my opinion, but I will not be allayed, this is no encouraging film, but hypocritical justification of inaction, this film does not encourage affected people, on the contrary, it means that the healthy ones cleanse away their guilt and responsibility and that they underestimate the torment of severe disabilities / diseases and can be made to believe that it is not so bad if one has such a fate, it is nevertheless still funny, yippee !! So it is only the healthy, which can free themselves in part of the fear of a severe disability - and much more important: of the guilt of being healthy and consequently also of the responsibility to deal with the disabled and with prophylaxis. The right thing would be to finally allow and promote stem cell research on a broad scale, so that such diseases can be HEALED - because ONLY THEN can severely handicapped people really lead a happy, normal life again, not if people simply provide a funny nurse for them - which is like a band-aid for a severed head, nonsensical AND it prevents that the real problems are tackled/the real solutions can be addressed !!",The Intouchables
112,CineCritic2517,Unfunny debacle,4,6 February 2012,A film about a wealthy paraplegic and his less than obvious choice for a physical aide. The aide is some guy from 'the hood' who gets the job because he shows no pity for the condition of the paralyzed man. From the premise up we get treated to a repetition of the same joke with the paraplegic at the center. I can't remember the last time I saw such an array of unfunny clichés posing as a film. Omar Sy does well as the French version of Will Smith and other actors perform on par. The film's impact just relies too much on the obvious humor excavated from situations involving a man who due to an accident can only move his head. Would perhaps have been funny as an episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Quite a trial to sit through.,The Intouchables
113,harrylosborne,The ultimate feel-good film,8,15 March 2021,"As uplifting, smile-inducing semi-comedies go, you would be hard pressed to do better than this slice of French life.If you manage to avoid the Bryan Cranston/Kevin Hart massacred remake, The Intouchables is a heartfelt true story, charting the journey of a millionaire quadriplegic (François Cluzet,) as he is cared for by his projects-raised caregiver (Omar Sy).Both are well-cast, but Sy steals the show, a cheeky, rough and caring man who begins to see how he can change others' lives.The story does one crucial thing that so many feel-goods fail to do: it doesn't bring you down just to boost you back up. Without making you sad or remorseful, The Intouchables paints this story's highs and lows - no mean feat when tackling disability and poverty in the same strokes.Familiar musical tunes appear throughout, and the settings are fairly diverse, given the base of Paris and the money the main character has to play with. I don't think this is a tear-jerker per se, but this movie will leave you happier than when you went in, and any film that does that should be lauded to some degree.",The Intouchables
114,krational66,Don't kill in the name of good.,8,8 April 2020,"A skydiving millionaire who was paralyzed from the neck down in an accident hired a full-time caregiver for a high salary. People around him don't understand, and his answer is: he always forgets the fact that I'm paralyzed, and that's what I want, no mercy, no special treatment, no discrimination.Two people from very different backgrounds, masters and servants, get along surprisingly well. In the middle of the night, when he was sick, he pushed him out to share a cigarette in the street. Bet together, trick the police into leading the way for speeding. Hide from all the people to go skydiving in the mountains, enjoy the conquest of looking down from the sky. He helped him break the paralysis of the inferiority complex, successfully hold the beauty back.The true story was later made into a movie that became the number one film at the French box office. Such a stereotypical story is made interesting, true, natural and touching. I thought that if the story had been set in this country, it might have been so: ill-dressed service, self-sacrifice, patient tolerance of all bad habits and bad temper. Our dictionary of the moving, is often defined in this way, into a kind of beyond human nature, the secular fearless.In this movie, however, life and death are no longer tears to be used as gimmicks. In the limited time of life, would rather the heart with my move presumptuous, also do not want to always like a dying like to ask for help to others, this is a kind of respect for life and respect. It has nothing to do with being moved, although it makes the viewer feel warmth all the time.In the second half of the movie, the millionaire doesn't want him to spend the rest of his life with a patient, so he switches to another nurse. The professional carer who was always cautious and always explained to others that he was ""sick"" when there was a problem made his heart grow old every day and more and more miss the friend who played with him, accompanied him crazy and even joked about the paralytic.In this story, the glory of human nature does not lie in who made greater sacrifice for whom, but only in that you gave me the peace and dignity I wanted, and I gave you the recognition and support I wanted. Their knowledge, status and status are very different, but there is an unprecedented agreement on this point: don't use what you think of as kindness, to make the other person grateful.Every adult has a world that strangers can't easily touch, whether it's the healthy or the severely ill. It is only when they meet one another that they release a kindness mixed with joy. This kind of kindness is not kindness in the traditional sense, but to believe in and value each other's energy, to express ourselves honestly, and not to impose what we think is good on each other.Don't do evil in the name of good. That may be something too many people fail to understand. You think she needs reassurance when all she really wants is to walk through the night alone. You think he should choose the better one, so try to dissuade him, but do not know that some roads can only go on their own, some choices may be wrong but it is the heart.Our parents, our friends, there is no doubt that they are people who really care about us. But why, really to the difficult place, but to them difficult to say, even want to escape from them. Between people, only because of the good and evil view of the agreement, can be connected. Others think good, often in their own more like a burden. Others think of evil, but you think of freedom in the high.Why can they transcend the class to become the soul mate, and even after they have their own lives, still often come and go. Because they read the good in each other. More because, they see each other first as a free person with an independent personality, then as a friend. Any with affection as chip, want to control the other side personality freedom, the final outcome is bound to destroy that affection.",The Intouchables
115,manendra-lodhi,"""Charming.""",10,14 November 2012,"The film does not tell anything new, but the refreshing feel that it gives you after watching is something you will cherish forever. The credit basically goes to the acting by the lead cast. The storyline is pretty simple. Oh and the music is the backbone in this film. It is one of those few films which manipulate your feelings extensively with the help of sounds. The story of a quadriplegic man helped by another man for day to day work and living the beautiful moments of life is sure to impress you.PROS: The thought that fascinated me most was the demand of Philippe from people not to be sympathetic to him. That is so true and original. People met with accident want a normal life again and do not want sympathies which eventually look like forced upon. Omar Sy as Driss has definitely stolen the show. The main story revolves around what the two do all day, but it also gives fair judgment to the personal life of Driss. He has been shown as a realistic character that is kind hearted but on the other side, is not able to live properly with his family. The film, its characters, its locations, music, cinematography and almost everything else is soothing.MESSAGE: ""We all need equal treatment."" VERDICT: ""Most recommended.""",The Intouchables

European cinematography is different when it comes to making Drama and comedies as it enriches movies with a soul and not just superficial emotions. This movie has been no exception.The Intouchables is incredible from the first minutes up until the closing scenes. It displays the aspects of drama by showing a connection between the two worlds that the main characters live in and when the two worlds merge together, the story manages to keep you smiling throughout the duration of the film. The beauty of the film is that it does not force the jokes and humor, the moments kind of happen on their on thanks to the brilliant play of the main characters who have good chemistry. Last but not least, when I rate movies I tend to give 9/10 and usually that last 10th star depends on the music and job that the composers have done.

119,patryk-czekaj,A touching and laughable French hit,8,15 June 2012,"Intouchables is probably one of the best French movies of the last few decades. It's not hard to see why it raised such a tremendous furor in Europe, and now it's creating an even bigger fan base for itself in the United States. It's so utterly pleasurable and heart-warming. Don't look at it as a foreign feature, though, or you will miss ale the excitement. It's a movie simply made for the viewers to love and remember. Films like this one don't come out too often these days, so just sit back and enjoy it while it's still out on the big screen.Intouchables presents a truly touching story about an unlikely friendship between an older, extremely rich, but severely paralyzed white man and a black man, who just got out of prison. Philippe is in need of a caretaker and as soon as Omar steps into his house he realizes that he might be the right person for this specific role. The plot doesn't concentrate too much on the way that those two guys connect over time, but quickly shows how they got so fond of each other. It was as if they were meant to work together and, in the process, become 'intouchable', in a very profound meaning of the word, and inseparable by any outer force. It's fantastic to see how people from completely different backgrounds are able to form such a strong bond and spend so many wonderful days and nights together. Even though at first it might seem that Omar may be overly vulgar, disrespectful, ignorant, and simply inadequate for this hard job, Philippe is still eager to give him a chance. What's more, many of Philippe closest friends don't approve of his new companion, but that doesn't discourage him.It is simply remarkable, how Omar is able to bring warmth, enthusiasm, and so much fun into Philippe's life. They actually operate on the same wavelength, as it might seem, sharing the same views and opinions on various topics. Through Omar Philippe understands that sometimes all it takes to achieve pure happiness is to let go and do what one feels like doing, as if nothing really mattered, even if you are attached to a wheelchair.And with that moving tale the movie creates a very powerful message, showing that all the wealth and money isn't capable of making a man truly happy, when he doesn't have someone to share it with. It's the richness in heart and mind that really matters, not the abilities of a body blessed with fortune and power.Through his brilliant, funny, and very real performance, Omar Sy will probably give his career a fantastic jump start. He is able to show the transition that his character goes through, from a cold man living on the streets, to a deeply compassionate and art-loving protector, in the most convincing manner.The amount of clever, laughable, and sometimes insulting (but timed very adequately) jokes is simply overwhelming. Also, notice the amazing mix of classic music and 60's soul and the way it enhances the visualization of this very peculiar friendship between the characters.I don't think that if someone would've come to me with a script and said: 'Listen, I got a story about a young black guy who makes fun of a handicapped man and gives him weed to smoke just to make him feel more relaxed' I would've bought it.It's a simple exaggeration, but through that straight statement I want to show that the movie has yet so much more to offer, making the marvelous Intouchables a true stand-out movie of the last few years. Highly recommended.",The Intouchables

122,Jonathon_Natsis,Touches the heart and busts the gut.,8,24 November 2012,"Feel-good French film The Intouchables tells the true story of the burgeoning friendship between an old, aristocratic invalid and his young, impoverished caretaker. Sounds pretty lame, doesn't it? It sounds like the kind of film that, at some point, seems destined to travel down one of two paths, descending either into a lecture on the class differences between certain socioeconomic groups or a comparison between the relative hardships of near-poverty and living with a severe disability. And therein lies the excellence of this film. Not only does it avoid both topics and, in so doing, keeps itself from becoming overly melodramatic, but it actually subverts audience expectations by persistently looking, as those Monty Python boys suggested, on the bright side of life. A big part of the film's charm is the effortless interplay between Omar Sy (caretaker Driss) and Francois Cluzet (Philippe), who clearly have a lot of fun with their roles while concurrently displaying total immersion in their characters. If managed poorly by directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, Driss's avalanche of one-liners and practical jokes at the expense of his handicapped friend could've come off as misplaced and in poor taste. However, the acting pair's wit and comic timing turns virtually all hit-or-miss jokes into gold and contributes greatly to making The Intouchables...well...just plain funny.In the same way that 'fun for the whole family' has comes to be interpreted as 'a living hell for anyone over six' by contemporary viewers, the classification of a 'dramedy' has come to imply a meagre handful of humour, quickly pushed aside to make room for a sob story. The Intouchables gets the formula right, injecting varied forms of comedy in between a genuine, emotionally investing subplot involving the lovelorn Philippe's pen pal Eleonore (Dorothee Briere). A toe-tapping soundtrack brimming with disco classics serves as the icing on the cake for this potentially Oscar-winning delight.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

The scriptwriting is absolutely remarkable as the development of their friendship is at its best without taking unnecessary screen time. The friends and well-wishers of Philippe contradict with his decision to accompany Driss and Philippe has decided that he will not listen to anyone and his decision is firm. The moments between Driss and Magalie (Audrey Fleurot) are hilarious.

129,dharmendrasingh,Next Year's 'Best Foreign Film' Oscar Winner,8,4 October 2012,"After missing last year's 'The Help' on principle (the principle being: black people have moved on; why can't Hollywood?), I couldn't help but approach 'Untouchable' with similar trepidation. My preconception was a misconception: It is one of the best films I've seen all year, and is by far the best foreign one. It's about platonic love between polar opposites. It's about hope and happiness. Set in Paris, Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano's heart-warming film stars François Cluzet (a dead ringer for Dustin Hoffman) as Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic widower and Omar Sy as Driss, a brutish ex-offender from a Parisian project. Looking for someone who will not pity him, Philippe hires Driss as his carer. Driss almost leaves until he sees his lavish quarters – and Magalie, Philippe's sexy auburn-haired secretary, who Driss makes it his mission to bed. Driss does pity Philippe, but never makes the mistake of showing it. Instead, the two make jokes at each other's expense and a bond very quickly (and believably) develops. They introduce each other to their worlds. One is replete with operas, art and literature; the other with girls, spliffs and street knowledge. By the end of the film they are inseparable. This could easily have been a tale of race, like 'The Help' was, but that is inconsequential in this film. It is purely coincidental that Philippe is white and Driss is black. When Philippe's personnel look disapprovingly at Driss, they do so because of his rough manner, not his colour. One of the film's strengths is that it doesn't mention this detail, which is after all as irrelevant as it being set in France. One thing that ought to be mentioned is that Omar Sy is not just the help in this film; he's the star, commanding the screen with confidence, charm and credibility. What cautions me from classing this as a perfect film is the few but prominent clichés. Philippe has a daughter who's so much the stereotypical spoiled little girl, and Driss's own family hates him. Also, the setups are overly familiar. Driss scoffs at Philippe's love for classical music and abstract art, but then learns to love Vivaldi and Bach, and then, astonishingly, creates a painting of his own which sells for 11,000 euros! This film is based on real people (Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his carer Abdel Sellou), so these things may be accurate, but this isn't a documentary of their actual lives. However, I can easily forgive these clichés because they are outnumbered by the many wonderful laugh-out-loud moments. Returning from a hiatus, Driss insists on shaving an unkempt Philippe. He snips away leaving Philippe looking more absurd upon each stroke, leaving him with a hitlerian moustache! Already 'Untouchable' has achieved a phenomenal level of success. It is making and breaking records across the globe, and is beating such films as 'The Artist' to awards. It has rightly been entered as France's entry for next year's Oscars. It is sure to win. www.moseleyb13.com",The Intouchables

""After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident, an aristocrat hires a young man from the projects to be his caretaker"" (via IMDb). This is not the first or last movie to talk about the true story of a paraplegic and his caretaker, or a rich and poor person that come together to form a relationship and change each other's lives. But it is definitely better than most films that you could associate with it.The Intouchables follows the story of Driss, a poor and wandering ex-criminal from the projects that takes an interview at the home of Philippe, the wealthy paraplegic. We find out quickly that Driss is very aware he won't be getting the job, as he barges into the interview room and asks Philippe to just sign his sheet to document that he is trying to get a job. Driss is trying to keep his unemployment active and needs signatures from job interviews to do so.What Driss wasn't expecting was that Philippe would want him for the job. With dozens of more qualified applicants (more qualified albeit a bit too professional and less human), Driss was beyond the long shot. But Philippe sees something in Driss. He believes he is the right choice for him, not just because he is capable of taking care of him, but he is a person that will treat him right.Even after ample warnings from the other people that take care of Philippe and his other family members, Philippe believes in his decision, and with great reason. This isn't some helping another human and making him a better person story or seeing the good inside a troubled man. Philippe explains that Driss treats him real. He doesn't pity his situation, but rather jokes about it and forgets when he tries doing things like handing Philippe a phone.And this is part of the joy of this film. The relationship between Philippe and Driss is full of jokes, often at the expense of the other person, but with a human quality. And while this may seem like an old story, it is played out brilliantly by the writing and, especially, by the acting of Omar Sy (Driss) and Francois Cluzet. Sy is absolutely brilliant and hilarious as Driss, but has an underlying tone of compassion. The life he brings to the screen is unquestionably the strongest aspect of this film, and is the reason an American remake is already being talked about with actors like Jamie Foxx and Idris Elba rumored to play the lead role.To read the rest of the review (IMDb thread too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/the- intouchables/",The Intouchables

There is a ""super ordinary"" friendship between the two heroes, that is, transcending race, class, and normal people.They were adopted, grew up in black neighbourhoods, grew up loitering all day long, relying on unemployment benefits, and even trafficking and robbery to survive. One was a black man who, despite having a high price, suffered many lost children and eventually Painless white man who lost his lover and was paralyzed. Of course, they also have some similarities: one is a person who does not want to be looked down upon, and one is a person who does not want to be sympathized with. It can be said that both of them have failed lives. At first Philip was unable to face life independently because of his physical disability. He was unwilling to contact outsiders.

Relatives, he chose to ignore it, leaving the luxury car ""dare"" to ride, but reluctant to stay away from his favorite skydiving (he was disabled because of skydiving); and Derris, just released from prison, would rather take unemployment benefits also Unwilling to work, his adoptive mother drove him out of the house because he was disappointed in him. Therefore, they are at least psychologically linked to the disease. Such two seemingly indifferent people have gradually established a deep, special friendship that is hard for others to touch. In the time when they get along, they affect each other, and they all grow up again. Disorders in life can't be eliminated, but as long as we change our attitude to life, we can still change ourselves and make life happy.",The Intouchables

But it turns out that had little to do with why I liked this movie so much.The relationship between Philippe and Driss is rare, funny, touching, wonderful, and enduring. Two characters, that couldn't be more dissimilar and from different worlds, cross paths and form a bond as if each one was 1/2 of the whole person of the combination.François Cluzet was perfectly cast and acted superbly. Omar Sy, the other half of perfect casting, had the energy needed to make his part shine. I doubt if this movie could have been as good with any two other actors.The music, settings, cinematography, script, and direction came together behind the actors to fill out a truly rich experience.Even better that I learned this was based on a true story.",The Intouchables
136,annuskavdpol,A movie filled with real feeling,8,26 December 2013,"This movie was the best I have seen in 2013. It was so good because it was real, versus fake. Within the field of psychiatry (the act of giving medications to a seriously mentally ill individual) there is usually little room for psychotic behaviour / symptoms. For example in the film the care-giver takes a certain number of risks, that to me borders on psychotic behavior, namely, driving down highways at high speed zigzagging in and out of cars at high speed, experimenting on his patient and stealing. All of these symptoms could also be experienced as criminal through the lens of a police officer - but this movie was more then it's details. It was a movie about a connection, pure and simple. These two grown men connected with each other one way or another. It was real bond that they formed, and this bond was unconditional. No matter what the other one would do, it would be forgiven. The filmmaker could bring to the screen, a feeling that is deep and pure. That is what makes his film so special.",The Intouchables
137,Koundinya,A biography of a quadriplegic and his live-in caretaker.,10,15 May 2012,"One of the best movies of the present day. The movie brings to the silver screen an unusual camaraderie between a wealthy man and his live-in caretaker. I simply love the way the movie begins with an ethereal background score and ends in a similar fashion; the background music is an integral part of the movie. The movie is a perfect mixture of everything you can expect in a good movie. Philippe and Driss share a bond over the years that is enviable. Driss is a responsible brother, a wonderful caretaker and a happy-go-lucky man who mixes humor with his quotidian. Never does he make Phillipe feel bad about his disability and is always there to cheer him up. The scene in which Driss tries different styles of beard on Phillipe is surely the best scene in the movie.We get to know at the end of the movie that the movie is based on a real-life story. The humor is sensible and timely, expletives are totally absent and the story is simple.

Most people are lost in different types of circles, and the people in the circles have a common framework. There are many more rules in life that need to be paid attention to all the time, and breaking the rules requires great courage and even pays some price.
Since we ourselves do not have the courage and ability to break through these circles, we try to let the ""catfish"" enter our circles and try to do different things ourselves.

In support of the great acting and screenplay there is a wonderful score by Ludovico Einaudi that is really memorable.

142,TheNabOwnzz,Inconsistent,6,7 May 2018,"Ofcourse the entire premise of The Intouchables is a bit of a cliché these days with the strong black man helping the weak white man, yet it is not a film of irrelevant political propaganda and steers clears of this subject quite well.The better parts of the film is primarily that it has some great shots, an incredible piece of piano notes music by Ludovico Einaudi & some great acting by especially Francois Cluzet ( Phillipe ) as the invalid aristocrat. Unfortunately however, the bonding of the two cultures of the main characters make little sense. Driss ( Omar Sy ) does not seem like a particularly nice guy and even his family isn't all too keen on him for reasons that he has caused on his own. Somehow for reasons unknown this eventually changes causing Driss to seemingly even care and freak out about things in Philippe's life that seem to be a bit out of character for him. Yet even though their relationship seems far fetched, it does still have a certain charm to it which makes it convincing enough as a piece of entertainment. The acting is mostly good, especially by Francois as stated before, who does a great job of facial acting too. Omar Sy is a bit inconsistent as Driss due to some weird outbursts & a couple of cringy scenes ( the dancing or the consistent flirting with the secretary becomes quite a cringe to watch ) featuring him which kind of makes me think he is the French Chris Tucker. The film isn't as emotionally powerful as it would like to be. The music by Ludovico Einaudi is a splendid emotional piece, so that is not the problem. The problem seems the movie feels a bit too much like a 'feelgood' movie due to the buddy relationship that the mixes between emotion and light hearted feelgood scenes are hard to make. However, a couple of scenes especially near the end do manage to succeed in this aspect, helped by Einaudi's score and some excellent facial acting by Francois Cluzet.The movie is mostly quite grey and not very pretty, and a lot of shots follow Driss closely from over the shoulder resulting in quite an ugly bouncing camera kind of shots. However, there are a couple of shots where the cinematography really shines. Most of these shots come from the position of the camera behind the two men, with Driss left and Phillipe right, which is a pose used many times during the film. Especially the one right before the parachuting scene is a beautiful one, yet this is followed with quite a weird shot in the parachuting scene itself from some kind of onboard camera like it is a documentary, which is unfortunate since there truly are many great shots in the film, but also a lot of uglier ones.It is a film with some great acting and some lesser acting, some great emotional scenes and some cringy scenes, and some beautiful shots and some ugly ones. While overcoming its cliché concept of a story on a splendid manner, it is not quite as great as it wanted to be.",The Intouchables

144,Kicino,Extreme lightness of heavy being,8,7 September 2012,"What a heartwarming comedy on a serious subject for a long time! What's more important is that it is a true story. That makes you feel more positive and hopeful about life.Both Philippe (Francois Cluzet) and Driss (Omar Sy) are like the untouchables whom no one wants to have anything to do with: Driss, came from Senegal to live with his aunt, is strong and big and black. He is just released from prison after a six-month term but he is not wanted even in his own home in the projects; Phillip is a white, rich and widowed aristocrat who is paralyzed from the neck down from a paragliding accident. His love for loud opera and demand for tedious care turns off many carers. Both of them have reached the bottom of their lives. When they finally meet, the opposite attracts: they finally see a way out as both of them offer each other a completely different perspective on life which turn both of their lives around.Philip introduces a world of opera, classical music, art, paragliding, lost love, flowery language and repressed emotion. He does not want pity and feels helpless about his condition. He is good at being thoughtful and offers ultimate material comfort. Driss, almost illiterate, is rich in kindheartedness and has a simple outlook of life while respecting others. He questions the value of art, ridicules opera and makes fun of classical music. He introduces rap music and dance, direct confrontation, threatening by little violence, direct expression of love, pot and massage. He is great at making the best of what he has. The link between them was respect, genuine care and a wide open mind. Even though they come from totally different worlds, they learn from each other with a very open mind and eventually forge a strong and supportive friendship.The fact that the film is based on a true story makes it even more darling and heart-warming because in real life, without the genuine open-mindedness, respect and sincere care for others, this wonderful friendship and support would never have happened. This is a perfect production on all counts: acting, script, direction, music and editing. The lines are beautifully crafted and comically delivered by both excellent actors. While Sy can use his whole body to show his extrovert and outgoing personality, Cluzet mainly uses his face and eyes to act. Yet both are magnificent and the sparks between them really dazzle. The score is simple but powerful. The monotonous piano solo reminds me of the scores from ""Tree of Life"", but here it sounds a little sad and a little repetitive like the monotony in life. It also shows the gradual change in real life: everything, be they good or bad in life, will phase out and all we have to do is to enjoy every moment while we can. Being wheelchair-bound and unable to move/feel from the neck down can be heavy and depressing. But if we can take it easy like Driss does, life is full of nice surprises and fun. Highly recommended.",The Intouchables

Unlike so many difficult-to-watch and hard-to-love dramas dealing the subject of physical disability, 'Untouchable' handles the subject with a belligerent acceptance that is far more relatable than the worthy wringing of hands that seems to be the standard technique. The direction of the film's writers Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano is assured, with hardly a missed step, and they explore many interesting and novel ways to cast light on the protagonist Cluzet's difficult situation. Sy is a revelation, a fireball of energy and charm, and both are impossible not to root for straight from the gripping opening sequence.

I came to this unusually for me, through the trailer, coz it seemed to be such potentially feel- good 'based on a true story' inspiration: and perhaps it was: but for me the ultimate betrayal was to see in the final credit sequence the two it was truly based on, the one who the real hero was  (da, da, da credits plot spoiler alert) NOT BLACK!! He was white and of mid Europe descent: Apparently, the directors just preferred the black actor; nothing to argue with there (if he's good - and he is) but, beware, that particularly relevant factor then, is NOT BASED ON THE TRUTH. The original inspiration has been marginalised/ 'white'washed outta da movie public's knowledge/appreciation/enjoyment.Then - as several have here also well noted - the (French?!) attitude portrayed towards women is positively neanderthal! Did they mean that? Or is that automatic to French storytelling? Even to excuse one women's (sensible) brush off of the black helper's unsophisticated bathroom overtures, in the end they make it all alright she declined him, by inferring the only reason she would turn him down is coz .. (da, da, daa) she's lesbian! NOT because she thought he was immature arrogant chauvinist As in spreading the fact that it was 'based on truth', then certainly as uplifting as the Omar Sy character is shown doing for his paraplegic saviour (he's saved from a downtrodden marginalised poor life by his 'service'): otherwise, 'based on' bordering a travesty of the truth.",The Intouchables

Last time I felt such a beautiful feeling was after watching Green Book. You are right. The Avengers do not move me, the DC does not allure me . To me a good movie is just like 'the only trace of our passage on earth' just what Phillipe had said in the movie about arts. The movie was so poignant yet so much filled with joy just like the way it tells about the disabled- they do not need your pity, they need your company. The fact that it is based on a true story makes you feel even more positive about the people around, about the hues of life, shades of grief.

I rarely find the luxury of time praising a well crafted movie that doesn't give a damn of any social issues. And it's totally rare for me to have the lucky chance finding a foreign movie that doesn't need to tell its masterpiece beauty. First of all, all the time I was watching the movie I thought I was staring at Dustin Hoffman playing well a disabled nobleman being taken care of by a straight-thinking commoner. I know the overreacted dire issues this movie is being pestered, but I don't really care what other people say how the movie should have been. It's an obvious sign already that this movie topped 111 (and may still elevate) in IMDb top 250 movies that a lot of sensible reviewers appreciated its simplicity. The reason indeed probably why the crew casted a black man instead of Arabian to portray the character because maybe simply Omar Sy just had the skill to fit in to the character's delicate vessel. Why so locked with the racism issue? Other may had been suggestive but it's not an extreme case to horribly condemn the movie of its simple choice. I just don't understand people who can't keep their bloody mind open. Well either way the movie had its story straightforwardly rendered and its worth approving rather than condemning. I even laughed so hard when Driss (Omar) just naturally cackled all over the man dressed like a tree singing at the top of his voice, man that was really a humorous punch.

He interviews many qualified individuals to be his new caretaker, but then interviews Driss (Omar Sy) who is an ex-con, who is only interested in having Philippe sign a paper so he can receive public assistance. Philippe challenges Driss to work for him for a month, and then he will sign his assistance papers. Driss has never seen such opulence, he lives in a slum with his mother and many brothers and sisters. Driss decides to take the job, and performs admirably, he finds out that Philippe has a pen pal and encourages him to call her. Philippe in turn introduces Driss to fine art and classical music, everything is going along fine until Philippe notices that one of his prized Faberge eggs is missing, he accuses Driss of stealing it. Driss sets out to find the egg, does he find it? Does Philippe meet his mystery pen pal? I really enjoyed the first few scenes of the Intouchables, they were intelligent and funny. Unfortunately, things go straight downhill after that. This movie engages in some of the most pernicious stereotyping of any recent movie I've seen, black people are lazy, they steal, they only want public assistance, they smoke dope, they live in ghettos, and so on. I don't accept those stereotypes from American movies, why should I accept them from a French art-house movie? I find the whole attitude of this movie condescending and patronizing towards Driss, as if he can only learn about the finer things in life through the aid of a wealthy white benefactor. Driss is in literary terms a ""noble savage"" a 19th century term to describe a man from another culture who can only be inculcated into ""civilized"" society by someone else.This movie doesn't seem to realize that it's the 21st century. In the movie, Driss can't learn about the finer things in society by himself, that's too tall an order for this movie. Social mobility, don't even think about it. This movie manages to be chauvinistic as well, women are prostitutes and subservient playthings for both men. There is only one scene where Driss mother stands up to his aimless attitude, the other women are around simply for both men to seek pleasure. The writers take a subtle shot at gays too, and this is supposed to be a feel good movie? Are you feeling good yet? The movie is also very slow and has a syrupy sweet ending. The actors do what they can, but the writers sabotage this movie almost from the beginning.

My only real complaint would be that our two leads are a bit one dimensional. Why are rich people always stereotyped as loving classical music and listening to nothing else?

169,dipesh-parmar,Directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have struck comedy gold.,8,5 November 2012,"Based on a true story, 'Untouchable' is a comedy about the unlikely friendship between Philippe (François Cluzet) and Driss (Omar Sy). Philippe is a wealthy man, paralysed from the neck down due to a paragliding accident. Tired of the sycophancy and pitying care given to him due to his condition and his wealth, Philippe takes a gamble and hires the brutally frank Driss who only applied for the job to keep the benefits office happy.Philippe gets far more than he bargained for with the charisma whirlwind that is Driss, a young man who is never afraid to say what he thinks or lower the tone and is guaranteed to keep everybody smiling. Theirs is a cross-cultural friendship, drawn together by their mutual honesty and sense of humour. 'Untouchable' is an unashamed crowd-pleaser, the friendship between Philippe and Driss is undeniable and the jokes bounce along at a merry pace. A lot of the humour is based on the clash with cultural stereotypes, the film often lacks subtlety but Sy and Cluzet pull it all off handsomely. There is a lot of playfulness and mischief from both Philippe and Driss, the hilarious opening sequence of Driss speeding through Paris traffic and betting with Philippe that he could get away from the police is priceless.'Untouchable' is an irreverent take on disability, Driss is hardly subtle with Philippe's condition but his forcefulness and boyish enthusiasm energises Philippe. The film works because Philippe is in on the jokes, it would be too easy for him to be the butt of all the jokes. Philippe is aware of the stuffy bourgeois hypocrisy that he inhabits and perpetuates, and thanks to Driss's anarchic influence plays a great trick on his art dealer. To the films credit there is a lack of sentimentality, nothing is glossed over but its evident what each of their many disadvantages are. Some people may frown at the often patronising stereotyping and the treatment of a character with a disability, but the films heart is in the right place.Mismatched friendships and cultural clashes are nothing new and 'Untouchable' is often predictable, but when Cluzet and Sy click they're an irresistible double-act to burn through any cynicism you may have left. Directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have struck comedy gold.",The Intouchables
170,jwb001,Philippe and Driss don't take life seriously - why should you?,9,27 January 2016,"Before writing my review, I read through reviews by critics. Let me deal with the bleeding-heart liberals first. They fault the film for everything from racism to ""too light a treatment"" of the ""wider implications"". Sheez--chill out. Here's a joke for you...Q: What's a critic who gave this movie a bad review? A: A critic who is too sanctimonious to simply write, ""Very enjoyable film"".I've watched the movie twice now, once with my wife before I started to write user reviews on IMDb and two days ago with my younger son, during which I didn't log critiques or interesting quotes as I would while watching a movie by myself. Very enjoyable film !!!Only two minor criticisms:* Lame title (no pun intended). ""Intouchables"" is too close to ""Untouchables"". Somebody really could have devised a better title.* When I first watched the movie, I didn't empathize with Driss' departure to look after his ""brother"", Adama. This portion of the film needs sharper lines through more specific events and dialog.",The Intouchables
171,jvdesuit1,"A magnificent, sensitive movie",10,11 December 2011,"It's not because I'm French that I appreciated this movie which I've seen twice. Too give the really infamous appreciation of the reader from Toronto to the French public, qualifying us of a segregationist country is difficult to gulp especially coming from north America which has not a very glorious past on the matter even in recent years. Perhaps the commentator should see the movie ""The help"" to refresh his memory... But what I'd like to say here apart of praising the fabulous interpretation of both leading actors is to remind that this is a true story, it did not come out from the directors and scriptwriter heads.Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo born in 51, got a dramatic para-glider accident in the French Alps in 1993 being totally deprived of movements from the base of his neck to the tip of his feet. 3 Years later his wife died and he was helped out of his depression by Abdel Sellou his life-aid assistant. He published his terrible story in 2001 under the title ""the second breath"" (in French ""Le second soufflé""). The directors have had the compliments of Di Borgo for the way they adapted his story. If in any way this was biased he would never had accepted the film to be left in that state. The Di Borgo family is a very old and wealthy family whose origins goes far back in the history of France, and their residence in Paris is considered to be one the jewels of the capital at the same level as The Hotel de Sully in Paris. What is shown in the film is exactly what happens everywhere in the world as far as handicapped are concerned: tendency to overwhelm them with pity which is more diminishing them as if their fate is not enough for them to swallow every minute or second each day. The way the racial problem is viewed is properly demonstrated. The police behaves in different ways depending of the color of your skin or your country's origin and sorry to say North America is a very good example of this so perhaps is not a proper judge on this matter.The authors had the courage to state this straightforwardly. The film shows on the contrary how a man with a very limited education at the beginning, a former convict, is capable progressively to change his views, and find in himself at the same time the good Samaritan aspects and help with humor and punch, his handicapped boss to find a new belief in his shattered life at 42! At the same time the boss demonstrates an open-mindedness which was not obvious to get not only because of his handicap but because of his origins and his wealth at first. Let's not illusion ourselves on the matter, everywhere in the world few wealthy people would accept to have as an aid an ex convict whichever color his skin should be! It's a fantastic lesson of tolerance, and friendship. For just those reason this movie would deserve an Oscar or Golden Globe awards.09/07/2013 : I've just seen that under ""Crazy credits"" is mentioned that 5% of the revenues of the film will go to an institutions caring for disabled persons. I just don't see what's crazy about that! I find this kind of remark particularly shocking and insulting both for the producers and the actors especially in this case where the story told is a true one.I suggest the administrator to delete that remark or change its qualification.",The Intouchables

173,dbogosian-1,A French gem,9,15 August 2013,"This is easily the best and most memorable movie I've seen in a very long time. Its formula is simple: the juxtaposition of two people from two radically different backgrounds who, with time, become the best of friends. And oddly enough, there isn't the initial suspicion or antagonism; they hit it off right away. But the relationship grows and deepens until they become inseparable.The real strength of the film lies in the characters and the men who play them. One is a sophisticated, literate, older white man who is paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair; the other a young, lanky, street-savvy black man with naught but the clothes on his back. They have such charisma, such chemistry, it is a tour de force from beginning to end. Particularly the younger man, whose infectious smile and boisterous humour keeps the mood light even in the darker moments.It's set in France, and you do have to endure subtitles (which are not well done; occasionally the punch line of a joke comes up too soon), but it's well worth it nonetheless. This is the first time I've seen a French film that didn't leave me depressed and suicidal by the end. I hope many more like it will follow.",The Intouchables

Phillipe is looking for someone who won't pity him and what he gets is a person who gives Phillipe a perspective that makes the both of them grow to become better people. The film is funny, sad, and above all else extremely well made. The story which is superbly written flies by. The cinematography and the editing contribute to the film's smooth style.

I understand why he chose Driss among them. For the disability he suffers, the hardest challenge, more than pain or inconvenience, would be boredom.Even though Philippe is a rich and important man, Driss doesn't care at all. Philippe seems to feel comfortable because Driss shows no pity that would embarrass him. In Philippe's slight smile, we see how he is amused by Driss's behavior. Driss is a brisk and responsive man. Philippe has fun with Driss's blunt remarks on things, like painting, opera, and classical music. They enjoy their witty exchange.Being completely opposite at first glance, they in fact share some kind of recklessness. They feel they have nothing to lose because Philippe has lost her wife, and Driss is in low life. But their friendship gradually encourages each other to overcome that.The tempo is well controlled. Emotional scenes are slow and comical scenes are quick. It is like a piece of pleasant music. The indoor and outdoor scenes make a good contrast. Philippe sometimes feels suffocated in his palace and wants Driss to take him outside for fresh air. The shot where the two men run on the wheelchair is very exhilarating.You might expect the film to deal with social issues, like disability or race, but it does not really. The film is about friendship and how it helps you overcome difficulties in your life. And it is truly heartwarming.",The Intouchables

179,judemcrobbie,Heartwarming and Funny,10,23 February 2021,"The opening scene is so funny. The suspense created from the arrogance Driss (Omar Sy) gets you truly fearful but then they change it up from impending doom to a punchline.
Omar Sy has this infectious like-ability that not only rubs off on the people around him, but you the viewer as well. He deserved an Oscar nomination for this. He also has this incredible ability to show one character but with so many different sides to him. He has this almost a parental side of raising his younger siblings and then the fun Driss that is shown through the movie.
The whole way through the movie it preaches the 'see the man, not the chair' so well that by the end of the movie you completely forget the wheelchair, which is the first thing we get led towards at the start of the movie.
One of the funniest movies ever made as well. This is quite a brave call to make a comedy on such a touchy subject. They manage to do it both tastefully and hilariously at the same time.
This might just be one of, if not, my favourite comedy of all time. It's both heart wrenching and heartwarming at the same time, terribly and balls to the wall bold as well.
The score is magical and just captivating. It's pretty much all piano, reflecting the class and Phillipe's (Francois Cluzet) music choice, except the on-screen songs making a down to earth feel. Compare these to the on screen songs, which are pretty much all Driss' choice, which are stark contrasts to the off screen (This shows how Driss is an injection of fun in Phillipe's life, almost in a Romeo and Juliet or lady and the tramp feel) shows the imbalance in everyone's lives.
Francois Cluzet did not quite stand out like Sy but nonetheless he did a great job in his role. Managing to portray emotion and everything through just the head must. Be incredibly difficult and he does this up to 11.
Everything in this Movie ales it a must watch, and the end brought me to tears.",The Intouchables
180,amit_imt2002,An inspiring and uplifting film.,6,8 January 2013,"A rich aristocratic Frenchman Philippe played by Francois Clouzet, who is quadriplegic is perpetually looking for a caregiver.He is a tough cookie and taking care of his fragile health and erratic temperament mean that most don't last more than a week.We see interviews happening.There is a train of inept candidates even we know won't last long.They already see Philippe as a dead man. In the middle of all this, in walks a giant of a black man.He is well built and full of raw energy.He does not want the job, just a signature attesting that he tried to find a job so he can qualify for social security.He is out on parole, a stock character from the Paris housing projects, the grim underbelly of which has been superbly documented in La Haine.We know immediately he will be hired.Its an immutable law of films, even if the posters and trailer have not given it away already.What follows are a set of adventures the two embark upon turning conventional wisdom on its head. Driss played by the gregarious Omar Sy, has immense physical energy and a love of life that is infectious, he has a mind of his own and is not cowed by the splendor of the mansion in which he finds himself in.Of course he tests the springiness of the mattress and practices his bathroom singing in a luxurious gold rimmed bathtub but those are not too important for him. Philippe indulges him, despite the protests of his friends, he trusts his instincts, probably his last act of rebellion against life which has suddenly been so unfair. The two are polar opposites but begin to share a bond.Phillip likes the fact that Driss does not treat him like a vegetable but a real human being even to the extent of making fun of his disability.If all this sounds like a series of clichés from many other films you are right.But then, cinema thrives on telling the same story again and again because our lives too follow predictable patterns, no matter how hard we try to assert our individuality.What ultimately matters is whether cinema is able to sweep us away in its arc and its joy of telling that story and makes us forget our own dull life. This is what this film does, takes an old premise and infuses raw energy in the narrative.Sy dominates the screen like a giant, his love of life and his refusal to become a part of the vicious cycle of the Parisian immigrant suburban housing estates which are a sad model of exclusion and ghettoisation, sets him apart.Driss shows Philippe a good time.",The Intouchables

188,willwoodmill,"A cheap, manipulative, film that seeks to exploit its audience",2,19 April 2016,"One of the most wonderful things about the art of filmmaking is that it is incredibly good at getting an emotional response from the people that consume it. Now that was a really pretentious way of saying that films are great because they can make use feel happy, sad, scared, etc. I know for me personally that a lot of my favorite films are the ones that are able to make me cry. And I think that we can all agree that it is truly a wonderful thing when a film is made with such devotion and passion that it is able to make its audience shed tears over fictional characters and events.Unfortunately filmmakers know that audiences love when a film makes them cry, and some filmmakers will try and take advantage of that fact. They will make films that are filled with overdone clichés and over dramatized acting/dialogue in hopes of making the audience cry, because if you can get someone to cry at your film it's very unlikely that they will forget it, and they will probably like it. This is exactly the sort of film the Intouchables is, a cheap, insincere, artificial cluster of scenes that will do whatever is necessary to make the audience get emotional. These cheap films that target and exploit sensitive topics just so they can receive acclaim and attention, are in my opinion some of the worst films out there. They represent all of the worst aspects in filmmaking, and deserve to be called out for what they are, and they are detestable piles of complete s***. I'm entering my third paragraph and I haven't even mentioned the acting, plot, cinematography or really any of the actual specifics of the film yet, and that's because regardless of whether you've seen it or not you can already predict everything that happens in the entire film. The plot is so structured and formulaic that it feels like it was copied and pasted from a text-book. The cinematography is at best dull, and at other times so bad I actually can not believe it was in a film with a 9.5 million euro budget. (which comes out to roughly 10.8 million dollars.) All of the actors give exactly what you'd expect from a movie like The Intouchables, and honestly I can't even remember a thing about any of there performances. Which is a compliment for a movie like The Intouchables. The Intouchables received mixed reviews from critics, and was nominated for best foreign language films by the Golden Globes. Even though critics were split on the films quality, general audiences loved it. At the time of writing this review it is the 38th highest rated movie on IMDb, coming ahead of films like Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Seventh Seal, Ikiru, Vertigo, and even Citizen Kane. And I won't lie this upsets me, at least more than it should. The idea of a film as terrible as The Intouchables coming ahead films like the ones previously mentioned, (not to mention the dozens of other better ones in the top 250, and hundreds out of it.) just really destroys my faith in the film industry. I can not recommend that anyone watch this film ever. But even though I've been basically calling this film an indefensible offense on cinema. There are things out there that are much worse than it, so I won't give it the lowest rating possible.2.1/10",The Intouchables

The part were the man is talking on the phone with the woman he says ''don't forget to ask her about her weight'', was that supposed to be funny? Literally nothing in this movie was funny, there were just the same old repeated unfunny conventional jokes. And I know that a rating below 5 is something bad, a 6-7 is good, and something over 8 is excellent(most of the time), so one may think this is next level, but it wasn't, just from seeing the poster I knew how this was going to be, and I hoped I was wrong, but I wasn't.

190,faterson,"Cheerful, Snappy Movie Marred by Glitzy Milieu",6,2 March 2013,"This has to be one of the least-demanding movies on the viewer -- aside from sexual allusions, a 6-year-old would likely be able to understand what the movie is all about. The two lead actors (especially Omar Sy) give nice performances, but nothing really surprising is happening in the course of the movie, and it is only moderately funny. The finest thing about the movie is its ending: despite being entirely predictable, it manages to be genuinely moving. The second-best thing about the movie is its visual splendor: not just Paris in all its (aristocratic) glory, but the countryside, the mountains and woodlands (and spectacularly paragliding over them), the sea and the beach. There is something worrisome and kitschy about the plot, however: it stars an immensely wealthy quadriplegic. I admit I'm not really interested in watching movies about quadriplegics, including those who are not well-to-do, but for the entire duration of the movie, I couldn't get that question out of my mind: ""Why make a movie about a quadriplegic, but make him immensely rich as well? Why not make a *poor* quadriplegic, or a quadriplegic of ordinary means, the star of the movie? Would there be anyone to take care of *him*?"" In this sense, one might detect a measure of cruelty about the movie -- in that in portraying the life of a quadriplegic, it picked one who definitely will not represent the typical quadriplegics from around the world. The movie's ""love angle"" can, for the same reason, be perceived as cynical, too: would a perfectly attractive and young-looking woman be taking an interest in a middle-aged quadriplegic, meeting him for a romantic rendezvous at the seaside, had he not been as rich as he is? One of the movie's ironies is that the character played by Omar Sy actually says this out loud (and *really* loud) when the two friends are sitting in the opera house: that women aren't looking for charming, handsome men as much as for those men who are wealthy and able to provide security for them. Well, that certainly lends a sour aftertaste to the love story -- but perhaps this was intended by the story's authors, and they are poking fun at themselves in this way.

I had seen half of this one before and now I had enough time to watch Intouchables until end. In my opinion the story tells about two people from different worlds. Philippe is wealthy paralytic man who lives in a huge house in Paris. Driss is poor ex-prisoner from suburb. Philippe is bored with frequent variation of his caregivers and Driss reluctantly starts as Philippe's caregiver. Surprisingly they make friends. Other characters are in small roles though these have their own important place.Intouchables is almost magical film because it contains many glad little situations and different types of humour without forgetting drama and failures.

195,evandewangga97,Comedy of Modern Human Stratification,10,23 December 2014,"""The Intouchables"", so let's start from the packaging of this movie. It is very simple yet humble. You can easily divide this movie into two parts. First, the story part, it is my own term to call the conversation scene, usually without music background or sound effect. And this movie utilizes this part perfectly, I mean it can make the audiences feel the melancholic sense of this movie. The conversation story also delivered in a very natural way, actually with some humble jokes too. And the other part is the catchy part, it is my own term too. This part is when the soundtrack takes place in the scene, very dynamic shot, comedic scene, or attractive act. You know, this part makes the boredom of audiences vanish, and start to laugh as well. Also, this is a kind of stimulant to make audiences keep watching the whole movie. ""The Intouchables"" mixes those two part with great sequence that makes synergy from each part.The second point is, this film combines two extreme paradigm of how we see the world. Philippe represents the upper-class people, who admires art strictly, enjoys expensive sport, also follows the rich- man ritualism. The only weakness of this class is the lack of true love, everything is blur with so many luxurious things that he has. He can feel the beauty of painting and music, but doesn't feel the art of life itself. Even after the tragic tragedy of his life, he still in search in true love. What I mean isn't a love from a man to woman, more than that it is compassion and conscience from every human. Again, even rich-people has a human-side, when he feels cold in his plush property. The other perspective is from Driss, an easy- going man, works as the caretaker of Philippe. Of course, such as a shameless and past-criminal-man mustn't be the keeper of quadriplegic millionaire. This the very point of the movie. The upper-class touch the low- class in a very dynamic interaction. Both Philippe and Driss, learn each other's paradigm of how he sees life. Although Driss has a dark- track record, he is a pragmatic and funny character. It makes Philippe conscious with all the ritualism he had done. Melancholic, that's who Philippe is, learn the way of compassion throughout Driss comical character. So it's just like a motivation show or inspiring talk show, about a batch of social stratification. But, wrapped in a interesting comedy movie.Another view is, this movie actually a satire movie, an elegant satire I think. Let's say how can the upper-class buy an expensive yet simple paintings, in the same time there are so many hungry people throughout their city. What is the meaning of life for the lucky person such as millionaire. Is it just a place and time for them to throw away the money by temporal things. Their compassion is simply blur with all those things. Real human instinct of love is died by the greed. Yes, a deep message one. The feeling of full-life as human, that's what we all the human seek. And unfortunately, usually the low-class-human found out it in spite of the others. Just like what Bibles said.So that's all the implicit contents of this authentic work of art in cinema. Maybe the director, writer, or cast isn't to important. But since the great idea of humanity is the main theme, there is no way to say it's a bad cinema. Simply wonderful.",The Intouchables

So here I was sitting in the theatre wondering what I was doing at the press screening of the French film 'The Intouchables'. Never having heard of it, one glimpse at the trailer had me convinced that irrespective of my initial hesitation, this was going to be fun even with the subtitles. To my surprise, it was dubbed in English. Hurray to that!Based on a true story, the film is about Philippe (François Cluzet), paralysed by a paragliding accident and his unconventional, unqualified, newly acquired caretaker Driss (Omar Sy), a street thug trying to live off governmental benefits. Being tired of a life of pity, Philippe finds happiness in Driss's rogue behavior. They both help each other find peace from their past, permitting them to face an uncertain future filled with new opportunities.'The Intouchables' is a heartwarming story that makes you laugh at every turn even though it's handling a sensitive topic. The on screen chemistry shared by the two protagonists is delightful. It reminds you of the basic needs of life (love and understanding) through their honest friendship while delving into their complexities with authenticity.Omar Sy's comic-timing will have you in stitches as you fall in love with his character's dependence and morality. There isn't a dull moment with him on the screen. Cluzet fits in perfectly as Phillipe makes you feel his helplessness and to an extent his futility as a handicap who longs to be treated as an equal. Support in the form of Anne Le Ny, Audrey Fleurot, Clotilde Mollety, Alba Gaïa Kraghede Bellugi and a few others is subtle but interwoven beautifully into the story.Director/writer Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have shown how small, almost innocent things can lead to life-changing events. From shaving to a crazy drive through the city, you connect to everything you see on the screen without the feeling any pity. Music by Ludovico Einaudi adds beautifully to the mood while Dorian Rigal-Ansous's editing paces the film flawlessly based on the emotional curve of the characters.Inspiring! Makes you look forward to life with a little more hope.",The Intouchables
198,ferni-tierni,In a matter of thirty minutes this movie reminded me of the magic and authenticity of the movies of the 90's,10,11 April 2020,"In a matter of thirty minutes this movie reminded me of the magic and authenticity of the movies of the 90's: wholesome, complex, multi-dimensional, moralistic, philosophical, authentic, and humane. All of these adjectives perfectly apply to the invigorating tone and narrative that the ""intouchables"" attempts to conduct and does excellently. Why does it hit a special spot though?The smiles, lighthearted fun, respect, companionship, unity, passion, and dedication are clear eidos showcased incisively to allure us into believing that a poor black man from the suburbs can establish an extraordinary relationship with a white aristocrat. The connection surpasses race, class, education, and ideology. In a time where we are overpoweringly divided by all types of distinctive identities here comes a movie that forgets all of that and shows us that sometimes if you put two people with a desire to connect all of those features seem insignificant.Driss' (Omar Sy) unintentional naiveté and WIDE smile gave a certain energy of happiness and authenticity that broke many of the barriers that Paul (Francois Cluzet) experienced. You truly felt that there was no other ulterior motive that to demonstrate unconventional friendships unfold through the desire to make each other happy and connect. Temperament, sense of humor, energy... were a clear catalyst, but both protagonists had a clear background of need and neglect. Driss adopted by his uncle and aunt was kicked out of his house and had to find some form of income to be able to survive his situation. He also never had a real family, so the prospect of becoming part of Paul's family, even if processed intuitively, was not a dreadful idea. Paul with an obvious need for connection and care was struggling finding a passion and a woman that could eclipse his past tragedies.Paul immediately connected with Driss' crude and inappropriate humor. Maybe he was exasperated with courtesies and niceties of the aristocratic life, or he was looking for people to be real with him. Driss was abrasive, despondent, improper, invasive, and careless, but also authentic; he had no problem confessing he was leeching off the welfare system. Eventually Driss becomes part of his life, literally an extension of him, as he suggests Paul to discipline his daughter or just to keep him company in the tribulations of handicapped life.The movie is seriously uplifting. Using Ludovico Einaudi's beautifully harmonious classical music, it amplifies the viewer's sensibilities to create an experience that gradually immerses you into a world where truly everyone can connect and overcome their struggles.",The Intouchables

Finally, the roles have been reversed! Finally the media is graced with a movie about a miserable Caucasian who is transformed by a sweet, gentle black person from the ghetto. I love to see the underdog maintain a positive outlook, a childlike exuberance, and an optimistic approach that is contagious. Yes, ""The Blind Side"" had a similar theme, but ""The Intouchables"" supersedes it, because a black person from the ghetto does not need to be mentally delayed to have a good heart.

202,onumbersix,Intouchables? Enough already!,5,21 June 2012,"Having resisted long enough all the hype hammering the luster of this jewel of a film, I finally decide to go see for myself. I resisted mainly because it seemed to me that this story had been told so many times before in film. Added the fact that French comedies don't do it for me, with the noted exception of Amélie Poulin. Italian comedies and British black humour manage to reach me more. So these Intouchables? One word : disappointed, but not surprised. The story is predictable and simple, avoiding to bruise sensibilities. Plays to sentimentality. This indecently rich heir to the family fortune, after becoming a paraplegic hires an in-home male nurse straight from the ghetto and they develop a deep friendship. How beautiful! Can you feel my irony ? It is said to be «inspired» by a true story. OK! But what gets me, is ignoring the elephant in the room, that is the meeting between great wealth and hopelessly abject poverty, without a thought that the former cannot exist without the latter. And to think that the French have just voted in the Left with a majority.François Cluzet's acting didn't seem credible to me. His pasted and silly smile, like Dustin Hoffman's Rainman, gives you the impression of great wisdom to be revealed later. But later never comes. He looks stupid and is, in many ways. What makes the film ultimately is Omar Sy's character, this handsome young black man, with the killer smile, who pushes mischief to the limit. This type of character usually amuses polite society.Intouchables? Enough already!",The Intouchables

I had no expectations starting watching this movie on Netflix. It captivated me from the start and I knew I would enjoy it and I did. In fact, today I watched it for the second time. It also came in the right time for me, when I really needed uplifting, a different prospective on life. It shows that joy doesn't come with material possessions, that there are so many things we just take for granted and forget to appreciate ""what is"". The look on Driss's face when he sees ""his"" bathroom worth a thousand words. There is nothing fake in this movie. The other movies that I can compare to this one (in quality) are: Sidewalls(Argentinian 2011), The Hedgehog (French);Biutiful(Mexico); Top of the Lake series (Australian); Last Ride (Australian); The Polish bride (Dutch); The KId with a bike (Belgian);The Return (Russian).",The Intouchables

A simple story about a poor black guy taking care of old paralyze man. It's simple, sweet and at moments very, very funny. The actor who plays Driss makes excellent job by portraying character as street-wise and amusing. It's just a short of person who you would want to hang-out with from the very first second.Some of my favorite parts are the comedy which often take you off-gourd but drama is perfect as well. There where few small moments when movie felt manipulative (playing sad music in a scene that otherwise would be happy moments)but my only honest complain is the fact that the movie Driss doesn't look a thing as the historical one, and the fact that they show the footage of actual Driss during the credits doesn't help much.",The Intouchables

However this guy is down to earth, simple, and fun.It changes his whole world from boring, to living life on the edge, making the most out of things, having loads of fun. He cuts through all the formal rubbish in the disabled mans life to tell him just do it and go for it. This is the case when he writes love letters for 6 months and he finally gets the big push to meet up with the lady and be happy.It is a story of friendship and how people from two opposite ends of life meet up in order for a care job to be done.

And, over a period of two hours, my life, my world view, my sensibilities went, for the lack of a better word, *boom* The performances were not good, they were subtle, understated, deep, and so incroyably French! While most say - and, I agree - the movie rides on Omar Sy's very capable shoulders, the music is the Horse that Omar Sy rides on.Ludovico Einaudi could not have done a better job if he had the invisible hand helping him.If you want a deeply moving movie that makes you laugh out loud, helped along by a background of soulful classical music that gently intertwines with funk, or if you want a movie that pokes fun at art while being deeply reverent of it all at the same time, or if you just want a movie that simply ticks all the boxes and then creates some new ones - this will be it.And to the French sensibilities, I once again take my hat off!",The Intouchables

The film has a lot of humor, some with a nice British edge to them, and everything is so real and cheesy as it would be in real life. And that is the best thing about the humor! I must pay my gratitude to Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet! Both manage to create a realistic and moving friendship on-screen! The thing is that they are two entirely difficult individuals, Philippe (Cluzet) is a wealthy man in a wheelchair, Driss (Sy) is an ordinary, poor guy with a lot of siblings! You follow how a friendship can evolve between these two entirely different persona's, and what their ordinary day would be like, together. Cluzet and Sy gives humanistic and brilliant performances, worthy of an Oscar nom for the both of them! The film is a masterpiece from start to finish, with deep messages, humor and remarkable performances! This movie would be my pic for ""The Best Foreign Language Film"" at the Oscars!

It's a terrible mistake to look at this picture as an unfortunate stereotype of racial relations as some professional critics have done. I wonder what would be said if the black character was cast as Arabic, which was the actual situation on which the story is based. And wouldn't it be peculiar to see an Arab participating in some of the antics that Mr. Sy, the wonderful actor from Senegal performs. His performance is outstanding, and one of the best comedic performances of the year. There is talk of remaking this in English. Please don't do that.",The Intouchables
215,mithilbhoras-103-581296,The Intouchables is a simple heartwarming story of a great friendship... Pure Entertainment,8,18 May 2012,"The Intouchables has broken all the box office records in France and Europe recently and is attracting a lot of audience. Being a fan of French cinema, I decided to be a part of this experience. The Intouchables, based on a true story, tells the tale of a handicap millionaire named Philippe played really brilliantly by Francois Cluzet who appoints Driss (Played by Omar Sy), a broke ex-con, to be his caretaker. Because both of them have somewhat same kind of nature, they develop a deep friendship.I have to say first that the performances were very impressive. Each and every actor was natural in their roles. For example: Driss is supposed to very funny which he is, very much. Even the opening scene was great! Millionaire is shown as a tried old man who's bored of his own luxuries and he appoints Driss just because he sees himself in him: a young exuberant yet a wasted man. Secondly, the relation between the both, their friendship, is the whole point of the film. It was good I guess, I just thought that there were some aspects of it that I had already seen in other films , the same clichés that appear again. But just like I said, the performances were great. So the acting made their friendship more energetic and realistic. Thirdly, it was quite hilarious. One scene where both the leads exchange their taste in music was one of the best. Although there wasn't anything new in it, but their love for each other matters the most in this film. Lastly, the plot is quite simple, no twist or turns. It's a simple but great tale of friendship, in which both the characters learn something from one another and so do we...Though The Intouchables doesn't show us anything new, it's entertaining and a new addition in the French cinema that I would love to discover and rediscover.

I have watched this movie, so many times I even can't keep counting. This is an excellent example of how a strong bond between two people can be and how one's illness can't affect their friendship.

Everything was real in this film and it was so easy to relate the themes expressed within it in my own life. There isn't a minute or two that passes by without genuine chuckles or laughter (and a good hearty laugh at that).

At first, it was not famous to people at all because promotions were not big for the movie. However, as time goes by, Intouchables is getting bigger and bigger. Almost every person who watched the movie tells to friends or writes review on the internet that Untouchables is a amazing film.

222,Searsino,A Smartly Devised Story with Beautiful Imagery,10,18 March 2017,"This was one of the first titles I watched after taking a deep dive into the foreign film market. And as a result, I have never looked back in the endless search for more and more ""foreign hidden gems"".The Intouchables is a movie which comes out of France. A passionate story directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano which ultimately would become one of the most successful French films to ever hit the box office. You may also know there work from another film titled Samba, another hit which also starred Omar Sy (has also played several smaller roles such as Barry in Jurassic World - 2015).The general premise is that Philippe has been a lifelong paraplegic who is searching for an everyday caretaker to help him with menial tasks such as showering, shaving, eating, and any inconveniences that he may encounter on a given day. Driss happens to apply for the job, desperately in need of a new source of income. While many would have tossed aside Driss on his past alone (criminal record and seemingly never ending impatience for people), Philippe wants a person who will look at him as more than a handicapped man. He wants a friend and someone who will treat him like he is just as capable as the next.I quote a line from the film where Philippe is approached by a colleague who is concerned that hiring someone like Driss, a person with a rough background:Colleague: These street guys have no pity. Philippe: That's what I want.Antics ensue.I claim this to be one of my favorite films and gems for several reasons:1) The chemistry between the two leads, Omar Sy and François Cluzet is perfection. You truly believed these two individuals from polar opposite upbringings had becomes the closest of friends having discovered the beauty and benefits had from learning about one another. And quite frankly, chemistry of this magnitude is a rarity in film nowadays.2) The imagery was beautiful. Every scene from the nights at dinner or concerts, visiting private art galleries together, snowball fights (that humor could be drawn from having a snowball fight with a paraplegic speaks volumes), Driss helping Philippe with his everyday health needs, all the way to merely feeling like he's just a normal person who also wants to have fun once in a while.3) The story was told in such a way that keeps us wanting more. Both directors cleverly scatter humor throughout in order to offer the viewer some relief from the dark drama which is drawn out of these two characters with equally different struggles and rough pasts.I think what ultimately made this entertaining for me was thus: in situations where you have a helpless or handicapped lead (in this case a paraplegic), the first thing I wanted was for a physically capable person to stand up for them in situations where the other is not able to do so themselves.For example, early on in the film we are shown a situation where Philippe has a neighbor who constantly parks in the front of his drive way. It clearly bothers him but he can't do anything besides wait for the ignorant guy to move out of the way. Driss is now Philippe's right hand man, and upon recognizing the situation, jumps out of the car and gets in the drivers face, yelling for him to move his car and never park there again. You get a sense of satisfaction from this kind of relationship, as well as the developing friendship these two develop for one another as they learn to depend on each other.I won't ruin the ending for you, but rest assured that it won't disappoint. This is truly a hidden gem for any American, and I cannot recommend this title more highly.----- 10/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----",The Intouchables

224,ben_mister_s,An absolute honor to own this masterpiece!!,10,1 February 2014,"It's a shame I can only rate this movie ten out of ten. This has to be my number 1 movie of the last 10 years.I have to admit, the first time watching it, was kind of lame (nonstop service KLM from Amsterdam to Calgary). I usually don't have the patience for a movie at 30000 feet, flights make me restless. However, this movie did it. I watched it without noticing the stewardess who was inquiring my lunch pick. It's a good thing you can pause movies on board nowadays. Back home, I bought the special edition (Blu-ray, DVD, book, soundtrack, poster, production notes, etc.) and watched it again. I don't know if it was the difference in altitude, seat and screen; wow, what a great movie. The kind of movie that gets better and better. I must have seen it 7 times by now.The chemistry between Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy is fantastic. In a world where people are getting more greedy, biased and impatient, these 2 people manage to bring out the best in each other, despite the different worlds they live in. The scene where Driss shaves Philippe for his date is absolutely hilarious, along with the scene where they give Philippes wheelchair a little ""boost"". Well, actually, there aren't any scenes in this movie NOT worth watching. Hands down the best ""dramedy"" I've ever seen.A worthy movie for everyone. Women, men and children alike.",The Intouchables
225,Mackiatoe,Switches from funny to serious with sublime ability; a brilliant film.,8,28 August 2016,"There are plenty of films that fit right into the stereotypical 'touching' film, but here, we see something different: a film that manages to be touching without being corny, and excels with its innate ability to charm the viewer.I'm not going to pretend that there aren't some minor flaws with Les Intouchables. Perhaps the social divide issue could have been a little better integrated to prevent it becoming too guilt-tripping in nature, maybe the roll of Driss's family could have been improved as the said characters aren't explored enough to be worthwhile, and maybe the pacing could do with some tightening up here and there.But beside this, what you have is a pretty remarkable film. The way it deals with disability is perhaps its greatest strength - not once are wen asked to feel sorry for Philippe. Rather, the issues of his life and the issues the people around him have to deal with are presented in a very down-to-earth and empathetic way. It ensures the theme of disability doesn't become too heavy without treating with the required respect. And, in many ways, it's the driver for Philippe's character development.What really defined the film for me most was its superb ability to switch from outright comedy to dealing with far more serious matters. It shouldn't work, yet its handled with such expert care that it becomes one of the best aspects of the film. For instance when Driss first comes to work for Philippe, and how Driss is introduced to how to handle Philippe in one scene, before it switches to the scene with him pouring hot water on his legs. In any other film, it would seem absurd and almost wrong, but not here. The toning is spot on through out, and it ensures that the film's conclusion is satisfying and rewarding.What's more, the excellent writing ensured that the vast majority of jokes can be understood in English, a rather rare ability for foreign language of films. It's by no means a comedy film, but it's that dash of humour that helps it to stay in control of its tone as mentioned previously. For me, Les Intouchables is most certainly recommended viewing. For a film that deals with the often tricky issue of disability and includes aspect of social divide, it handles it with excellent care and doesn't drag even once. Its combination of light heartedness and serious reality are just sublime, and it makes it such a joy to watch. Charming, eye opening and well written, you really cannot go wrong with this film.",The Intouchables

This film took a true and touching story, and reduced it to a grotesque caricature. The characters are uni-dimensional, stereotypical and predictable. I suppose its caricaturesque qualities is what qualifies the movie for the comedy category - right next to Ferris Buellers Day Off. But I found the style of the movie incompatible with and irreverent to the human story that inspired it.By contrast, take ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" starring Will Smith. That movie tells a similar story of profound transformation of an individual, but it captures the humanity and the struggle in a way that it makes it a great movie; it doesn't attempt to cheapen the story for a few smiles.I was surprised by how many bleeding hearts were blindsided in their reviews by the human story behind the movie.

Now a days the technology enable us to communicate a lot of people and it also has the risk to regard the people as information.
Treating the people as creature who have the dignity is the basic but easy to forget because of the prejudice that we know from many media.
After watching this movie I want to keep treating the person without any prejudice in mind.",The Intouchables
231,Playbahnosh,"Now, I understand the hype...",9,13 July 2012,"Okay, so my first concern why I didn't want to watch The Intouchables was the story itself. Like it was scavenged from a Hollywood studio's thrash can: ""A disgustingly rich quadriplegic guy hires a down-on-his- luck young man from the projects to be his personal aid. The cool dude shows the stuck up old man how to have fun and in return the rich guy teaches him about arts, manners and whatnot. Initially they have a few quarrels that mostly derives from the social, racial and age difference (and that the man is actually paralyzed from the neck down) but in the end they grow close and live happily ever after."" That really sounds like something Hollywood might cook up. Like Scent of a Woman or Flawless.But here's the catch: This movie is based on true events. Not in the sense as Titanic for example, where the only historically accurate fact was that ""the ship sunk"". It really how it happened in real life as depicted in this movie. Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo (the real life billionaire who this movie is about) personally oversaw the making of this movie to make sure it depicted the story of him and Abdel Sellou (his aid) as realistically as possible. Sure, they took a little artistic license here and there, but it's mostly accurate.The thing about cripples and terminally ill patients is that most people don't know how to handle them. Dr. House said it best in the series, that once people know you have cancer, from then on everything will be about cancer. People will feel obligated to feel sorry for you 24/7. They will be overly attentive, overly helpful to the point of annoying and will be really careful about how they talk to you. They will never ever just be themselves around you. Even if you've accepted your condition a long time ago, and sometimes you just wanna forget your debilitating disease, you'll be reminded every single time by these people who cannot NOT see the cripple or the person with the death sentence when they look at you.What this movie offers is a unique insight into a relationship that defies this. Driss is brash, brazen and completely disregards the notion of feeling sorry for Phillip. He acknowledges the fact that he is a quadriplegic, and he slowly learns to take care of him, but he seemingly refuses to be the gloomy oh-I'm-so-sorry kind of hypocrite society wants him to be. Instead, he makes fun of Phillip's condition on many occasions making even Phillip himself laugh. He introduces a fresh and invigorating energy into Phillip's life, which makes him see the world in a new light. Instead of wallowing in the sad and painful past, he starts to look to the future, take chances and make the best of what he can of what he still has.All in all, The Intouchables was a really positive surprise. It's not a perfect movie but it's a perfect story.",The Intouchables
232,fritzgagi,"A very heart-felt, human film. Highly recommendable.",8,5 February 2012,"Intouchables is an unusual buddy movie about two guys who couldn't be more opposite of each other. Driss (Omar Sy) just wants to get a rejection paper from Philippe, a quadriplegic aristocrat, so he can receive unemployment benefits. But Philippe has other plans for him: He is immediately under Driss' charm and decides to hire him as his personal nurse.The two bond more and more and that is when the movie shows its strength: It lives from the contrast between the easy-going, charming underclass prankster and the rich, art-loving lord. The collision of these two worlds offers room for plenty of funny material. When the two sit in the opera in a room full of uptight white men in suits, and on stage a man dressed as a tree starts to sing in German, Driss can't hold his back laughter. Neither can the audience of this film.It's a warm, delightful comedy that hits all the right notes, completely politically incorrect and honest. It has a comedic tone throughout the whole film but allows itself to also show the internal conflicts of the two protagonists without ever being sappy. It's a rare thing to see a handicapped person portrayed without too much pathos.Please see this movie. It's beautifully-shot, well written, heartfelt and heartwarming.",The Intouchables
233,gareth-91,yummy French film,9,8 October 2012,"Full of energy. What really hit me was Driss's energy. He is a young, street wise, survivor. Bursting with testosterone, such a boy. He comes from poverty and walks into luxury: but he's not overwhelmed by it, no tugging the forelock and being intimidated for Driss. He never wavers from being himself. He is unpredictable as he explores the rich world he has walked in to. He might break something, or steal something, or assault someone. If he thinks something is rubbish he says so. He laughs when he feels like it, which can be considered inappropriate - but Phillipe usually agrees with him - he has this way of freeing Phillippe to see things another way.Driss is as big, powerful, energetic man - who is quite happy out in the street sharing a smoke with a bunch of other almost homeless guys like himself. He's like a panther, he could quite easily knife someone if he had to, to survive. He is raw energy. Then here he is placed in a rarified, alien place, learning to put support tights on a bloke!!What I'm trying to get across is this tornado of energy being gentle & compassionate, but never being tamed. He's not a tame panther, not particularly safe, but with Phillippe he is nurturing. He's authentic. No politically correct, spin crap here, if he's irritated he'll tell you to f--k off. Very refreshing - a real person.Philippe is great too, that he sees the potential in Driss and isn't scared off by the idea of Driss, his background and all.It's so refreshing to see a man portrayed as a man and to be so powerful, sexy and loving on his own terms: when he can walk comfortably in completely different worlds without apologising to anyone.",The Intouchables

The script is written beautifully, and it flows very well. It's funny, touching and inspirational. Despite its hard subject, it succeeded in making a good balance between emotional and comic timing. The two leads' performance is spontaneous especially Omar Sy who is really humorous depending not on grabing jokes, but casual comic situations to draw a smile on your face. The only reason I didn't give it 10/10 because there are some jokes, or say scenes that dragged a little bit.

240,fortionat1,A French spin off of Driving Miss Daisy,6,10 January 2013,"I NEVER post a professional review BUT now - - ROGER EBERT reviewed this and said exactly what I felt and wanted to say about this film. Rather than trying to paraphrase his review I am simply posting his original review found on his web page: (since links are not allowed i have put spaces in the link. you need to remove the space to follow the link)http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/ apps/pbcs.dll/ article?AID=/20120530 /REVIEWS /120539995/ 1023It might help to think of ""The Intouchables"" as a French spin off of ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" retitled ""Pushing Monsieur Philippe."" A stuffy rich employer finds his life enriched by a wise black man from the Paris ghettos and takes lessons in funky music and the joys of marijuana. This is a story that has been told time and again in the movies, and sometimes the performances overcome the condescension of the formula.The film was an enormous box-office hit in France, and indeed, it is easy to enjoy. Philippe (Francois Cluzet) is a millionaire who was paralyzed from the neck down in a para-gliding accident. Driss (Omar Sy) is a man out on parole for robbery, who applies for the job of Philippe's caregiver only so he can be rejected and get a signature on his application for unemployment benefits. As Philippe interviews one boring job applicant after another, we begin to understand that he needs not only physical help but someone to cheer him up. Driss' cheeky irreverence is refreshing, and Philippe astonishes him and his own household staff by offering him the job.The movie tells the story of a growing relationship between these two likable men, based on Driss' confidence that Philippe will improve if he escapes his stuck-up lifestyle and samples the greater freedoms of an immigrant from Africa. There may be a certain truth in this, but the education of Philippe proceeds in a series of essentially insulting clichés. Driss, you see, has rhythm and soul, and if only Philippe can absorb some of that, he'll be a happier man. He'll still be a French millionaire surrounded by a protective staff, he'll still be paralyzed, but he'll be happier. How many times have we seen the scene where an uptight square inhales pot for the first time and a smile slowly spreads across his face? ""The Intouchables"" has an element of truth that it never quite recognizes. The role of a good caregiver is hardly limited to lifting, bathing, grooming, dressing, pushing and supplying medicines. The patient is faced with a reality he finds it difficult to accept: he has been deprived of all he once took for granted, such as the simple ability to walk across a room. A caregiver can't provide that, but he can provide something more valuable, companionship. Philippe's wife is dead, his teenage daughter is a snotty brat, and his staff is preoccupied by their salaries and status. Driss comes from a different world.The success of the film, despite its problems, grows directly from its casting. Francois Cluzet, who acts only with his face and voice, communicates great feeling. Omar Sy is enormously friendly and upbeat. He reminded me of the African immigrant played by Souleymane Sy Savane in Ramin Bahrani's ""Goodbye Solo"" — a film that avoided the traps that ""The Intouchables"" falls into.The appeal of a film like this, and it is perfectly legitimate, is that when we begin to feel affection for the characters, what makes them happy make us happy. Caught up in the flow of events, we allow many assumptions to pass unchallenged. The writer-directors, Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, are cheerfully willing to go for broad gags, and their style is ingratiating. But at the end, by looking through the foreground details, what we're being given is a simplistic reduction of racial stereotypes.That was also true of ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" but it was a period picture set in the South in the late 1940s, with older characters who had been shaped by their times. There was a plausibility there. ""The Intouchables"" is more of a soothing fantasy.by Roger Ebert - May 30, 2012",The Intouchables
241,captain_dimpf,too corny for my taste,4,27 March 2016,"Isn't this movie rather racist, seeing that the black guy is portrayed as violent, horny, unsophisticated, rude and criminal. And the guy that this character is based upon wasn't even black to begin with. But of course, being black, he can dance like there is no tomorrow. But what the heck, stereotyped aside, I found this whole venture far too predictable and aiming at easy laughs. Like when he sold the black guy's painting for 11000 Euro or making fun of the Opera. Sure the majority of people have no interest in modern art or opera, but if you want to make fun of those, does it always have to be that straightforward?Also, when Driss starts working at the posh place, he needs only a couple of days to become friends with everyone, a few misunderstandings, but from then on the two oh-so-different people get along so fine, that you might wonder where the drama is. Oh right, it's a comedy. So the black guy threatens the daughter's ex-boyfriend into bringing croissants to the mansion each day. Because obviously, threatening other people is another thing that black people are really good at. So this teenager apparently feels threatened enough to bring croissants to these overly rich people very day. Says the housekeeper one morning: Can you bring some more tomorrow because we're having a brunch? Like, if you dig that kind of humour, you might really enjoy this movie, but if you hated 'Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis' as much as I did, you're in for a big disappointment.",The Intouchables

244,lorene-bar,A great film!,9,4 June 2012,"After having broken box office records in its native France and across Europe, The Intouchables is brought to American screens.It's a story about a white man and a black man. The white man is rich and paralyzed from the neck down; the black man is an ex-con from the projects. The former needs a caretaker; the latter needs someone to turn his job application down, so he'll be eligible for unemployment benefits. They meet. They clash. And, against all odds, they become friends.That's the plot of The Intouchables (based on a true story), and that storyline has prompted many American critics to label the film ""racist."" Maybe it's coming from a misunderstanding of some journalists, or from a cultural difference between USA and France, but race is absolutely not the subject.Indeed, the French title Intouchables which translates literally as untouchable, refers to the 5th Indian caste, these people ostracized by society, as the two characters. Philippe is rich but quadriplegic from a paragliding accident. Opposite, Driss is full of life, but he is poor and comes from the suburbs. His disability is purely social. Using humor to explore the sensitive topics of class inequality, and quality of life for handicapped individuals is a tall order for filmmakers of any country. However, directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano accomplished all of this.An irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility, The Intouchables depicts an unlikely camaraderie rooted in honesty and humor between two individuals who, on the surface, would seem to have nothing in common.

Most Japanese including me are not familiar with French, so French characters speak in this movie is a part of the elements which impress us strong. It sounds like music, and it tells us something which we can understand just because of we don't know French. In addition, actors facial expression is also remarkable thing for me. There are some scenes which have no dialog, only back music. In those scene, characters facial expression tells us a lot of things. And, I think the music in this movie is wonderful.

248,Elder_Yautija,"They found each other by chance, and by chance they decided to... you know... like that other movie!",6,25 June 2012,"There's nothing wrong with the meaning of the story. Nothing wrong in wanting to write and direct a well-meant story with some positive messages in it, as opposed to the gritty, dark and negative themes explored by most film-makers, nowadays. I just think it's such an old fashioned topic, there's so many more movies that explore the same kind of relationship, and better movies at that too, that this one comes across as clichéd, predictable and extremely cheesy. A movie like this would have worked for me when I was 10, not now. In the year 2012 it looks like an outdated commercial for tolerance, which, yes, is a delicate subject, but I just don't need such a childish approach to it so that I can understand it. I knew all about it already. And the film-maker should have known that. Infantilizing the characters to make them more enjoyable wasn't, in my opinion, a move that did the film any good at all, as it detracted from the sheer emotional power that it could have had, had the leads been less clownish. In this light, this movie shares the same fault as another french-spoken movie, ""L'Hutieme Jour"" (The Eighth Day), which also deals with the same kind of subjects (acceptance, tolerance, mutual respect, etc... between people of different backgrounds and different chances), and which also ultimately fails to be 100% convincing because of the goofiness of some scenes, which are put there only for the sake of lighthearted fun.Many people found this movie to be ambiguously dealing with the subject of racial difference. I didn't see that at all. I watched the movie not caring at all about which one of the characters was rich or poor, or what color their skin was, and I still thought the movie wasn't anything special at all. I mean, is there still anyone out there who cares about that? And, even if someone does, how can they say this movie's racist?? It's a collection of clichés which have been taught to us since the beginning of time, it's very formulaic and extremely predictable.In all the technical department, though, this film excels in the true meaning of the word. It has very nice shots throughout, beautiful photography and some amazing dialog, on top of A-list acting from all the main characters. Nevertheless, even though I couldn't exactly predict how the story would end, I had this feeling like I saw it all already. To be honest, halfway through the movie, I predicted that one of the characters would die, making the other very sad. That didn't happen, but all that came before I was able to predict almost to the letter. Scene by scene by scene, I've seen it already. It looked like a movie from the 60's revisited and re-shot to look like it's brand new.It took ages for the movie to catch my full attention, mostly because in the very beginning there's the higher concentration of clichés. Everything looked and sounded like I'd seen it a million times already. In the middle, a lot of nonsense, funny at times, but still nonsense. And in the end, nothing happens. Nothing we didn't know already, at least, 1 hour earlier. The characters don't even develop at all. Actually, they regress quite a bit. They're kinda interesting in the beginning. In their first meeting, I got the idea that their relationship would really cause sparks to fly, which I thought might be a very good idea to make the story interesting. At about 15 minutes into the movie, instead, when Driss starts working at Philippe, he suddenly transforms from streetwise rogue into a clown, while Philippe, amused by his partner's transformation, adds the word ""funny"" to the cynical wise-cracker with a golden heart that he already was. That's about it, and it all happens just like that, no questions asked. They just tolerate each other's ways from second one. Then Driss leaves, Philippe gets sad and grumpy and stops shaving. Nothing gradually changes, which would have been much more intriguing. And that's it!Secondary characters like Yvonne and Philippe's daughter) and her useless ex-boyfriend) are there just to fill the screen, and I doubt anyone would care if they're still there or not in the next 15 minutes, or wonder what happened to them at the end of the movie. Did you? Sure, some of them were funny at times, but who cares if they're funny if they don't help the story at all? Also the motivations of some of these characters aren't explained or explored at all. They're just seen behaving in a certain way because it looks cool in the movie, cause the director can then add another sketch to boost the running time (the redundant scenes with Philippe's daughter and her boyfriend, or the dumb-ass sky-diving sequence, or the pointlessness of the car chase scene), but it's not really clear why they do so, nor is it vital for the viewer to know.The leads are great actors, that's for sure. They do an amazing job and they're both very likable. There's some real funny sketches (the one with Philippe getting his beard shaved by Driss, for example) and some very mean jokes (""Where can you find a quadriplegic?"") which make the movie much more enjoyable. Also the camera-work and direction are flawless: we get some amazing aerial shots and some fine editing work, on top of a stunning photography, a rare thing to find in movies nowadays, in my opinion. All in all, not a bad movie, only criminally overrated and over-hyped and NOWHERE NEAR the true art-house french cinema that real directors/storytellers like Truffaut got us accustomed to.Intouchables: 6\10",The Intouchables

It is not important to question why Paul took an immediate liking to Driss, perhaps it was the unpretentious humour and his obvious unfamiliarity with the protocols in Paul's world. Against the advice of his caretakers he hires Driss for a trial period. The ensuing ""training"" provides funny moments and both men benefit in their own ways.Maybe one could question the risk that Paul takes in trusting such an unknown but he goes on his instincts and lets Driss take him in directions where he would not dare go himself. Both men enjoy the journey and develop along the way. I have some criticism of the unnecessary exaggerations in the script, such as pouring hot water on paraplegic's legs just to emphasize the point or what is the likelihood of a happy end in the final scenes or the interactions with Paul's daughter and her boyfriend but it is not relevant.The movie portrays tolerance, disability and friendship in a humorous way and with great acting.

252,steve_koenig,"A predictable ""feel good"" film from France",3,5 September 2012,"What is the difference between a film ""based on a true story"" and one ""inspired by a true story""? This was inspired by a true story, and at the end gives an update on the real-life characters after which those in the story were patterned, but we really don't know how much of the storyline in the film really took place. I am assuming the writers of the screenplay took certain liberties, especially to evoke the sympathies which they thought (correctly) would lead to a hit.Most of the audience in the theater in which I saw the film (in Brazil) laughed uproariously, I cringed at what seemed to me obvious and unoriginal jokes, and a storyline with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. The rich white guy need an assistant and hires the brash young Senegalese man (Algerian, in real life), who, of course, knows about living life to the fullest, and listening to upbeat music (inexplicably, 30 year-old songs from Earth, Wind & Fire). The black man dances well, of course. Several times he is given a task he feels demeaning and onerous (e.g., wiping the older man's behind), and at first refuses, but inevitably quickly acquiesces.I have to admit I tuned out a few times, waiting for the film to end (I was there with my spouse so didn't walk out), so can't say for sure, but I don't believe the film touched on an obvious question: what if the poor African immigrant had been the disabled one, and the rich, white French businessman had been able-bodied? They probably would never have met, but if they had, what would have been the dynamics? All in all, the film seemed to have more elements of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" than of the also-true story of a disabled French man (and much better-written and acted), ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.""",The Intouchables

In the onset, Driss is driving Philippe's Maserati Quattroporte at high speed. They are chased through the streets by the police and eventually cornered. Driss claims the quadriplegic Philippe must be urgently driven to the emergency room; Philippe pretends to have a seizure and the fooled police officers escort them to the hospital.Finally, this story gave a raise to interaction of invalid and poorly-resourced man,who may seem as a gratuititious couple splendidly completing each other.

There is also a fair amount of excitement and romance thrown in for good measure!Despite appearances, Untouchable is not really about race, disability or class; it's about friendship. The two main characters both feel disconnected from society for various reasons, yet the connection between these two outsiders is so genuine and believable that you are drawn into their relationship. In fact, the performances from Omar Sy and François Cluzet are simply incredible. The massive amount of meaning conveyed in the slightest look between them is acting at its very best. On many occasions, you find yourself laughing with them and the fact that one is a rich white guy in a wheelchair and the other is a poor black guy fresh out of prison ceases to be an issue. One of the most interesting themes for me was the effect that Driss's lack of pity had on Philippe. I understand that the film has been applauded by many disabled groups and I can see why. Pity is a very selfish and unpleasant emotion and I can imagine that the effect of such pity would be quite destructive on a person in Philippe's situation. Driss simply reacts to him in natural and honest way, which is extremely refreshing to see and a lesson for all those who would look down on anybody with pity.The film is not without flaws however. It is a little 'lightweight' in places and there are a few clichés here and there (even though the film manages to avoid most of the more obvious stereotyping). The subtitles are also not brilliant in places and some of the meaning is slightly lost on occasion, but I guess that happens all the time. Overall, I would have said that this was a lovely 8/10 'feelgood movie' but the superb quality of acting easily bumps it up to a 9. Unmissable.",The Intouchables
259,120watts,Strong message wrapped in light-hearted comedy,9,18 April 2021,"This is a film that works very well at the core. It's true that many scenes were crass and felt played up for mass-market appeal. I can see why some film critics gave it a lower rating. That, however, seems to me to be missing the forest for the trees.The acting is superb from both Sy and Cluzet. They deliver force, touch and humour, and have strong chemistry. Although they act out stereotypes frequently, they never become the stereotypes. I think this handling is the correct way both to acknowledge and overcome stereotyping, which is something that is all around us and cannot simply be wished away, but must be overcome through force of character. The leading duo (and for that matter the supporting characters) are both believable and likeable.Intouchables is full of light-hearted humour and adventure. Aside from keeping up the flow and entertainment level, there's also a strong life message within. Life is something to be lived, not passively observed. Themes of curiosity, self-awareness, courage and responsibility come across strongly. In this sense, the film is more than just a buddy drama about a quadriplegic and street guy. If these guys can expand their horizons, find joy and adventure, laugh a little at themselves, and take charge of their life and families, then surely we all can.Finally, there are strong metaphorical elements in the storyline. Old aristocratic France is stuck, and relies on immigrant France to keep it moving (literally), and perhaps to bring some life and liveliness too. The two don't often come into such intimate contact, or invade each other's space. But if they did? Lots to think about.",The Intouchables

It has a fantastic plot, the performances of the actors really make you believe them and in a way want them to succeed. This film comes together as a perfect amalgam of music, storyline, plot and visuals. The comedy that you get all through the movie would not be funny if left in the hands of lesser actors and if done it may even have made some of the jokes offensive. I have to say that it isn't everyday that a movie in french makes a completely full room of close to 200 people laugh, most of whom didn't even speak french.

In such movies, one often sees the impact that the poor person has on rich person's life, but seldom do the filmmakers try to tell the story from the poor person's point of view. The focus is the rich man and his boring life and how it can be turned around by a poor person who sees it in a different light. Towards the end of the movie, the poor person gets little or nothing out of the exchange, but the rich guy walks away with deep insights and a newfound will to live. It's really unfair how such films portray poor people (recurring trope of them being awestruck by bathrooms) and paint them as incapable of doing anything unless aided by the money from the rich person. I think that's because the target audience is rich people who will pay to watch a movie which gives them some hope.",The Intouchables

265,reddevil_42,What a pleasant surprise,10,14 March 2013,"I think that it is wise to not expect much from movies or know a great deal about them before watching them. I did not expect this movie to be great but it was. I usually like movies where the characters express themselves fully and are genuine. The two leads are men which makes it a 'Bro' affair. Omar Sy has put in a strong performance. The movie was a pleasure to watch, moved along steadily addressing the core issue with care yet in a manner that is lighthearted and cheerful. The core issue here being that of a life a quadriplegic lives.From someone who is a lively and an energetic individual, one becomes confined to a wheelchair and with a prospect of never being able to feel the way that he did before. A very scary prospect indeed. The last thing a person would probably want in such a scenario is the notion of excessive pity from everyone else. The movie deals with the same. It is hard to understand that feeling of helplessness without actually experiencing it even the notion of it is painful to bear. It is very important to understand that the disabled people are just rather unfortunate folks who are trying their best to make do with what they have. To act like a pain in the ass for them and be non supportive is probably one of the more ill deeds that one can do. There is some sort of a stigma attached to them in my mind. It has probably to do with the fact that seeing them evokes a painful emotion in me, one that I do not wish to give much thought to or protract. I guess, now that I think about it, I have that with anything even vaguely related to the hospital. Not the most cheerful of places.I was expecting a watershed moment in the movie somewhere after which the drama would take over but thankfully that never came. The movie ended on a cheerful note, which for a change, was nice to watch. The story is not a novel one and based on a true incident but the depiction and the acting in the movie make it a likable affair. Nina Simone's Feeling Good and the whole sequence featuring it was probably the most moving part of the movie, Driss's dance scene being the other one. Ludovico Einaudi's Fly being another brilliant soundtrack, overall, a nice movie.",The Intouchables

Then, every joke is funny. I do not remember when I laughed so hard because of the film. All thanks to great Omar Sy. But the best thing is not acting or humor, but the story.

267,saketkt,The Intouchables- Where was this movie until now?,9,24 January 2016,"Who is the untouchable? Is the sick man or is it Driss? I think both. One has a repulsive sickness and the other is a thug, outcast. It is subjective. You have to watch it to decide. Untouchable is a beautiful movie. I speak English, but i watched it with French subtitle. I don't say this often, but I enjoyed it very much. Where was this movie until now? The starting scene is intense. The camera is close up on two people sitting in a BMW, looking indifferently at the Paris night lights. The driver, Driss, suddenly breaks a traffic signal and violates speed limits. The police is hot on their trail. All this time, the other guy sitting beside Driss, Phillip, is indifferent. Out of the blue, Driss bets Phillip that he can lose the cops. So the chase begins. But Driss gets cutoff by a police car just when he thought he had lost the cars on their trail. Now things starts to get interesting. I had not read any article about this movie. I had no idea what was about to come. Phillip could not walk, but still he helps Driss win the bet. Now the movie goes in flashback where life of Phillip and Driss is revealed and how they came across each other.Philip is leper neck down. Not leper exactly, but he can't feel a thing. He is rich and he is interviewing people for position of a nurse. In this atypical scene, Driss with his hood and a jacket over it stands out. He is not there for the job- he knows he is not getting it. He wants a rejection letter so that he can get benefit. Waiting in queue, Driss loses patience and barges in Philip's cabin requesting him to sign. But, as you will see, Driss and Phillip hit it off. Both are poles apart. But still a spark is there, and it is there throughout. I think the chemistry between them is the soul of the movie. You never want it to end. You are scared that it might end. It is this dual feeling that will keep you on the edge-beautifully balanced. This movie evokes different emotions. For instance, pity- see Philip struggling, love- a different sort between two men; humor- between Driss and secretary, between Driss and Phillip, the shaving scene; frustration- why is Driss leaving Phillip. This is just the tip of the iceberg. I think a very few movie can do such. And emotions transcends all boundaries. Audiences are able to connect, unlike most of the movies. And this connection puts the movie right up there with the best. Another movie that comes in this category is Shawshank.I recommend - A must must watch. A beautiful movie.

269,shoutingagain,Didn't detect even ONE false note.,9,10 April 2019,"I noticed some jaded critics on rotten tomatoes (generally very positive reviews but I wanted to read the critical ones to see WHAT they missed. it's what I do so I can see what makes one tick & their viewpoint) and wanted to address that first.What I think they wanted is to see more sorrow, heartache & troubling nature of being disabled (one mentioned the D/bell & butterfly which yeah, I've seen..I do appreciate but did NOT enjoy that one bit. Still, listen up.... this is NOT going in that direction for a reason!)
You do KNOW some films regarding similar subject matter have varying things to say as it's multifaceted just like our LIVES are.
We can be miserable, full of pity & sorrow one day & full of life & joy another. Thankfully all due to the variety life has to offer. No matter what your condition, physically or mentally.
So I'm clear, they in NO way try to gloss over the harsh reality of paralysis OR poverty.
I got that, think everyone did. But what of Humanity, what of friendship & of the power of hope, kindness? Is this not universal to all?Furthermore, to suggest there can be NO humor, emotion, attachment or soul to experiencing that ....then ALL we do is to shortchange human beings & life itself.
These actors were simply fabulous & I was not only a willing participant to join on both of their journeys but most of all, good to be mindful that this wonderfully touching film is based on a REAL friendship so to address any suggestion of it being maudlin or sentimental (it's neither) makes me wonder what is wrong with YOU.
We witness REAL struggle---even hopelessness. Again, who among us hasn't experienced this at least ONE moment in their life?
In fact, for me watching one of our main protagonists wonderfully celebrate the joys of dance while the paralyzed man's face registers clear unfettered elation.... but can't engage in such himself! (yeah...I love to dance) actually caused me strife when I thought...""...just WOW what if I couldn't dance OR hear music!"" Then next ""what a BLESSING it is I CAN!""
Have I counted my own blessings recently enough? Have any of us?So start counting your blessings & know that life CAN, in all likelihood, be FAR worse. If that's not a good message buried in a great real-life plot--of humanity, friendship, HUMOR, exhilaration of being ALIVE-- well then, apparently I've missed something. But no, really YOU do if this all escaped you. Deeper than it appears.Yes, you should see this. Don't waste your time on the American remake (the upside..I'm American, I saw it. I love Cranston but can't begin to compare! Know that missed the mark.
How happy I was to read these two amazing men are still friends today, so yeah, something we NEED for the times in which we live, affirmation of something that is good.
And maybe all coming from place of serious heartache & damage. Yeah, there's nothing manipulative here, I basically can't stand that sort of film...do not cheapen this one bit to compare it to lesser (someone on RT mentioned ""bucket list"" & I almost puked. Same goes for this critic's writing).
Then lastly, here is from an American that says IF you are going to object on basis of race, you must be one sad, lonely person looking for trouble that is NOT there. This is about 2 men, to me wouldn't matter if they were purple, race has NOTHING To do with it, we are all just people. So the ""real life gent"" wasn't African American? So what? WHO cares? it's a movie, NOT a documentary. I can't imagine anyone in the role of the caretaker than this actor, he imbues the part with his entire being. They both do. Overall, I see no flaw in this production whatsoever. I see why the French embraced it so fully & wonder why America felt remaking it rather than seeing is as I did tonight, the REAL deal, made any sense. I'm sure that part was financial, they wanted to cash in.
Just brilliant. Can't see how this didn't make nomination for every award going (and win it) but assume critics are often a breed most of us fail to understand, much less a snobby academy-award committee who often prefer odd esoteric material that in truth, they likely fail to understand themselves (or it's just plain political).
BRAVO to all involved, from script, direction, acting & final piece of work! I know I will give this a second viewing, maybe more as needed. I believe it's an honest & straightforward powerful elixir, in addition to all else it quite successfully aims to do.",The Intouchables

283,nolandalla-447-695930,A Magnificent Film,8,11 August 2012,"A French movie with English subtitles enters the finicky American movie market with two strikes against it.It's French -- strike one.It has subtitles -- strike two.Which is a crying shame, because one of the year's most enjoyable and uplifting films has pretty much come and vanished from theaters, unable to garner much attention during another summer filled with mindless action adventure ""thrillers"" and sleep-inducing ""comedies."" The Intouchables is a marvelous film. Carried by two outstanding lead performances by Francois Cluzet (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Dustin Hoffman) and Omar Cy (who deserves an Oscar nomination for a movie-stealing performance), this film has wit, candor, humor, sadness, and ultimately great inspiration. The film's credibility is boosted by it being based on a true story.Cluzet plays a quadriplegic, which means he is confined to a wheelchair unable to feel any sensation below his neck. If there's any upside, it's that he's also very wealthy, giving him considerable options that would not otherwise be available to a person of lesser means.Cluzet is utterly bored with his life, not the least of which has anything to do with his physical impairment. One senses that even if he were not parked in a wheelchair, he would still need something more. A great deal more, in fact. What Cluzet needs is stimulation, excitement, and most of all – someone he can call a friend.He finds all of this in the unlikeliest of places.Omar Cy plays the part of unemployed street thug to absolute perfection. He's a Senegalese immigrant languishing in the slums of Paris burdened with typical urban family difficulties -- poverty, drug abuse, lack of hope and opportunity. One can imagine that there are many Omar Cy's living as second-class citizens throughout the modern world. In fact, the city here may be Paris. But it could just as easily be Sao Paulo or Chicago. He meets Cluzet in what can only be described as an unexpected encounter, and the two men begin to engage in an uneasy, but captivating friendship.Everyone can see what's coming next. And that's perfectly okay. Initially indifferent to Cluzet's condition, Cy will ultimately come to care deeply for the man who is not just an employer, but a pathway out of pointlessness. The man in the chair becomes a muse and means of escape, an emotional and spiritual home for a foreigner who instantly resumes the role of ""immigrant"" once he steps back beyond the threshold of Cluzet's luxurious apartment and back onto the streets of Paris.The two men desperately need each other, in completely different ways. Eventually, they engage on a bucket list of activities, bonding in the process, allowing the rest of us to go along for the ride. And what a joyous ride it is.Critics have correctly pointed out this film gives a somewhat sanitized depiction of what being without the use of one's arms and legs must be like. While most of the film focuses on the role of caregiver, we are constantly reminded (or perhaps, I simply could not get it out of my mind) that not every quadriplegic receives such meticulous physical care nor emotional support. It helps to have money, no matter who you are.But I was willing to overlook this and enjoy a film full of energy, comedy, and ultimately of happiness.Admittedly, the conclusion of the film seems all too neat and tidy. But again, I am going to give the filmmakers a pass here for reasons you may understand only if you see the film, which enables audiences to come and appreciate how important people are to other people. After all, we are allowed to enjoy an uplifting film every once in a while. Never mind that it's all somewhat contrived.One of my barometers in judging a film comes with a fundamental question. Namely, do I think about the film the next day, and perhaps the next.I did. I must admit I was moved emotionally by this film. So was everyone else in the audience, from the reactions I saw. I laughed. I teared up. And, I rejoiced in the end.Call me naive, but I wish all life ended just like it does in the movies.

I love that Driss wins over everyone that works in the house and makes everyone laugh. One of my favourite bits is after Driss leaves his job, but comes back to Philippe when he's having a tough time. Straight away he teases him about letting himself go and turns his frown upside down!

It's goofy and feel-good yet touching, all without being a definite genre. I've never seen a French movie before I watched this, and I only watched it because it's so highly rated. Prior to viewing, I was minimally interested in the plot, a little doubtful, and kinda iffy about having to read subtitles. But now I'm so happy I saw this. Just listening to the beautiful piano pieces at the beginning and end of this film fill me with emotion that isn't sad nor happy, just one that gives me that feeling of a long quiet night on the road, silently enjoying the company of a great friend. This film doesn't have huge questions to ponder, and it doesn't have melodramatic characters and subplots, at least not too obviously. This is a caring, charming movie that can calm a restless mind, bring a spark of hope and fun to anyone's life, and make you think about it a lot. I'm glad I didn't give up on this movie just because it's in a foreign language!",The Intouchables
289,patrickbateman-84347,Noone deserves pity.,9,16 January 2021,The Intouchables is film about a quadriplegic millionaire who hires a man who is not suited for the job to take care of him. The film is a masterpiece its funny and really makes you appreciate life more and more. I though if I ever was a quadriplegic I will want Omar Sy to be my assistant definitely. I always think that the worst feeling to have for someone is pity what ever the situation is. The scene most magical scene is at the party of Philippe's birthday - that music by the orchestra was not to dance-to everyone thought that if the music is danceble is going to make Philippe uncomfortable but when Driss decides to dance everyone just started to dance with him and Philippe really was happy despite that he couldn't. The film was based on a true story and ITS A MUST SEE for everyone.,The Intouchables

291,talexander12599,"A Touching, Sensitive, and Funny Film",7,29 July 2015,"The Intouchables is a French comedy/biography from 2011 and stars François Cluzet (Tell No One, Little White Lies, French Kiss) and Omar Sy (X-Men Days of Future Past, Jurassic World, Samba). It was written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano (Samba, Those Happy Days, Tellement proches).This film is about a quadriplegic millionaire named Philippe (François Cluzet) who hires a lower-class man from the projects called Driss(Omar Sy). With help from Driss, Philippe finds humour in his situation and Driss reminds him how to appreciate life again through setting him up on dates, listening to funk music and even giving him a joint.This film is propelled by the performances by François Cluzet and Omar Sy. François gives his performance purely through dialogue and facial movements. Surprisingly he gives a great performance filled with emotion and humour. Omar Sy plays an incredibly likable character who can really make you laugh at points and at others make you feel very compassionate about his issues. Whenever the two are on screen together it is gold. I would compare their chemistry to those of buddy cop movies although this relationship is a lot deeper. Another aspect of this film that I admired was the dialogue. Since there is no real plot other than the story of two men, the film is carried by a lot of good dialogue. For example, when the two are looking at a piece of art, Philippe asks Driss why he thinks people are interested in art, Driss replies with because it's a business when Philippe tells him it's because it's the only thing one leaves behind. This film is basically the French version of Driving Miss Daisy, that is not to say this film is bad. This film's strongest points are writing and acting, but after that it's pretty thin. Directing or cinematography isn't anything special and the piano soundtrack sounds like something that would be added to an amateur short film. Yet this is still a heartwarming film it seems like it is a little overrated.",The Intouchables

294,axb,Hollywood film made in French,5,12 August 2012,"This french film starts with a Dustin Hoffman look-alike actor being driven by a black driver (Omar Sy) who is fond of Earth, Wind and Fire music and has a swagger made popular by many a black Hollywood actors including Eddie Murphy. In the typical Hollywood fashion he comes from the wrong side of tracks (think of Murphy in Trading Places), but ends up living in a Paris mansion (again echoes of Trading Places) taking care of a quadriplegic (François Cluzet). Somehow he learns to take care of his patient and in fact becomes quite an accomplished male nurse. The transition is mildly amusing, and won't bother you if you checked your skepticism at the door before entering the movie theater. If you have any doubts about whether or not this film is in the genre called Hollywood fantasy, you have to see what our tough man with heart of gold does next. He decides to teach his boss how to be a good father and ultimately becomes cupid for his boss. The film plays on the obvious disparities between expectations and attitudes of the privileged and under classes in ways that are funny. If you wish to enjoy this film, please keep your expectations low and ignore the obvious visual and other tricks. One of the early scenes shows a row of shoes and socks of the candidates waiting to be interviewed for the nurse's job. As the camera pans, all candidates are wearing shiny shoes with clean socks, but one pair stand out for being dirty and incongruous. Of course, they belong to Omar Sy's character and he gets the job at this super-rich household. How fuuunny!! I predict that in two to three years there will be a Hollywood clone of this film with Dustin Hoffman and Chris Rock playing the main characters. And it will be a box office hit.",The Intouchables

Of course, the pill is sweetened by balling all this up in humor directed at the white man's tastes, instead; but in the end all of this serves only to reinforce the stereotypes in society. Among all those people sitting at the concert, why is there not a single rich or powerful black man (or even a Chinese or Arab or any other colored person)?High in gimmicks and using actors popular on television, the movie is a recipe for box office success: not surprisingly, such movies are usually also the most pathetic ones.",The Intouchables

Driss (Omar) is just perfection and couldn't have been played by anyone else. His personality shine through and you just want to keep watching him. Once the film is over, you feel like you want to know what happens next, where did they go, what did they become? The closing credits do offer a bit of information but you want to keep watching, regardless. Without giving too much away, the ending makes the film complete. I felt like my heart was going to burst - when I realised what happened. And just how good it makes you feel.

One has his health, he is tall, strong and playful but no money and education what so ever. The other has all the money in the world but everything below his neck is paralyzed, he is reserved in manner. After they meet they quickly connect. It is as if they both find, in each other, the things they have been craving for a long time. The movie was a hit with audiences when it came out but it is not that popular with critics because according to them it is too stereotypical. Well i don't agree with that one bit. I thought the movie handles all the moral issues very correctly. I was also sad to learn that this movie wasn't even nominated for a best foreign language film award, it is such a shame. Anyways, if you haven't seen this movie please do, because it is one of those movies that make you feel good from the very inside.As for the technical stuff, i thought everything was spot on. the movie is put together in a way that makes you wonder if their even is anyone behind the camera which is a good thing because it shows how the actors are so natural in their rolls.",The Intouchables

300,imim123,A Special Movie with Highlightened Sense of Reality,8,25 September 2015,"I can't say it will be a classic film, but it sure will be a special one. Unlike the usual Hollywood films, Since it is based on a true story , it contains less drama thus becomes more realistic. To me, watching the movie feels like listening to a normal but beautiful story about common people.In short, it is a story about a strange but beautiful friendship of two people from complete different worlds. Cruz is an aristocrat who becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident, while Sy is a failed robber and typical jobless young man. Almost by accident, Cruz hired Sy as his personal caregiver. Though before they met they have nothing in common except that they are both sad and depressive, an unexpected but also amazing friendship blossoms between they two. Sooner than they realize, they've become each other's essential spiritual companion and life support. While their relation deepens, they also bring out the best in each other. Cruz teaches Sy to appreciate art and get out of his comfort zone to try something new. In return, Sy persuaded Cruz to open up his heart, be comfortable with himself and enjoy the present. In the end, they both become a better person and regained their hope for life. If there is anything we can learn from this story, it is sometimes you have to reach into someone else's world to find out what's missing in your own.（It's also this movie's slogan）",The Intouchables

We have become so used to the annual 'blockbuster' scenarios that at times we as an audience tend to forget what it is like to actually experience something of great quality.The two main protagonists in this film are Philippe (François Cluzet) a wealthy quadriplegic and a far removed and initially troubled Parisian - Driss (Omar Sy). The chemistry that each has towards one another and the play on Driss' ignorance to Philippe and his disability makes this feature charm you from the very start - along with the contrast in social standings, education and hobbies their lives become dependent on one another over time. Through the use of the extremely well placed quips, jokes and glorious rhetoric it leaves you always wanting more, and it does just that. To actually say this in a review is genuinely rare for me and I hope that this film gets the genuine recognition it deserves by the audience who watch it in the future, for it is a rare masterpiece of cinematic perfection parading values of friendship and humour that you will want to talk about with your friends for quite some time.No words can really describe the true delight this film has brought to my life and those who were with me in the cinema.

I didn't read anything about this movie before or after watching it today. But if someone in the future will tell me - ""From the Director of The Intouchables"", I would go for it. The only thing I found redundant in this movie was the way the story flows - a linear story-line structure would have suited me much better.

311,marosbts,The best movie in a decade,10,2 August 2012,"Going to theaters in the recent years was a pain. Not physical, but emotional, or intellectual. What Hollywood was serving us was either some kind of dumbing down movie or a miserable attempt in creating a prequel or sequel of some old and successful movie. With a few exceptions the recent years have not brought any new epic stories, emotions or acting performances to us. But in years where the dream factory in Hollywood runs out of ideas and serves us movies with a vampire killing Abe Lincoln, you can not really expect great cinema. Yet, you can find it from a very unusual source.French cinema is quite respected in Europe, but mainly for popular movies from the last century, which are still very high on the pedestal of fame. But one can hardly remember any fabulous french movies from the last decade. Intouchables is a movie which for another generation will put french cinema back where it belongs. At first view the plot is full of clichés - rich vs poor, white vs black etc. Americans would depict the movie as not politically correct, racist, but it is actually the absolute opposite. Although Phillipe is rich, white and disabled, he is still only a human. He wants to be treated as such and finds exactly this in the poor, black Driss from the Parisian suburbs. Race or wealth do not play a role in their relationship. Driss delivers a few jokes about Phillipes disability, but they are never meant to hurt or insult, but to make Phillipe laugh and enjoy life as it is. The film builds up an amazingly rich atmosphere around this uneven relationship. Acting is one of the best I have seen in years, both in the funny as well as sad scenes. Francois Cluzet in some of the scenes delivers a performance beyond capabilities of most actors and reminded me of Dustin Hoffmans performance in Rain man. His acting in final scene in which Phillipe meets Eleonore has been brilliant and delivered one of the most powerful movie experiences ever. While the audience has laughed for the biggest part of the movie, no one was able to leave the cinema without tears after this final scene. There is only one thing which is negative about this movie. It is the fact that not enough people, especially in the US will see it in its original form. The reluctance to show non English spoken movies in US theaters will rob you of this gem. However given the success of this movie worldwide I am afraid that Hollywood will sooner or later make a remake of this movie, will make it politically correct and rob it of all the emotions and beauty of the original.",The Intouchables

If there were more films like this, the world would be a better place, and the only problem i have now is that I'm always expecting a similar level of entertainment as this at every subsequent visit to the cinema.

I loved everything what was happening on the screen. Acting play, directing, cinematography and all another movie stuff are excellent.But these things are not really important, because the story of two friends will touch the soul of everyone who will watch this movie. Their friendship is based on true feelings, they are attracted to each other. Phillip as Driss learn something new from each other, they are changed in better way since their first meeting. Their friendship reminded me friendship with my best friend, so this picture left very deep full emotions for me.Also I want to mark best thing in this movie – humor is fascinating.

It's a completely unique film about friendship as it lacks all of the schmaltzy, sickening sentimentality of Hollywood movies of the same genre.

He wrote that the worldwide success of this movie was highly predictable : good feelings, a ""feel good movie"" in a gloomy time of economic crisis, etc, etc...Nonsense. Who could have thought that a french movie about a tetraplegic man on a wheelchair would be seen by 37 millions people in Europe, that is to say more than the US family blockbuster, the last Harry Potter movie ? Please, be serious Mr Murat.Mr Murat too says that this movie is just good feelings, not good acting or good movie direction. Here again, it's completely out of base. the actors are wonderful and have a perfect chemistry between them, the script is perfect.I laughed and I have been ""touched""at the same time. Laugh and emotion at the same time, it's a rare combination in a whole film.But infamy didn't come only from some pedantic french journalists who always denigrate and despise the successful movies (of course, when a movie is liked my many people, they say it's demagogic and bad taste). Some US critics dared to say that this movie was racist because the actor playing the man who helps the rich paralyzed aristocrat is black ! My god. Why some Americans are so obsessed by the skin colours ? As a French, it's not at all something that I noticed ! Who cares if Omar Sy is Black ? They totally missed the point.What is important in this movie, it's precisely the universal message delivered behind a true story wonderfully told by 2 brilliant actors : beyond all of our possibles differences (physical or social disabilities or prejudices), we are human beings after all, who can be friends.Intouchables is not simply a ""buddy movie"" or a ""feel good movie"", it's a movie about humanity, devotion to others, friendship, tolerance.Unfortunately, Mr Murat kept is social prejudices (he thinks that a popular movie is always a bad one), as some US commentators kept their racial prejudices about black men serving white men.Beware : this movie is for open minded people only !

I did not give it much thought at first, but the universal acclaim I have heard convinced me to go see it. I don't over-stating the universality of the acclaim, people of various races, classes, colors & countries told me it was a must see. I had no expectations, and I was floored. Intouchables, directed by Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, starring Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy is possibly the best French movie of the year. This is not because of a lack of worthy contenders, but truly because Intouchables is that profound. It touches on themes of presumptions, social class difference, health, and as naïve as it may sound, the universality of humanity. The story is not as important as is the relationship that is displayed between the two protagonists. Philippe (played by Cluzet) a rich aristocrat that loves adrenaline rushes finds himself a paraplegic after a paragliding incident. Driss (played by Sy) is, in appearance a typical hoodlum from the ghetto. The two are brought together and wonders happen. The audience then sees how the men affect one another as they engage in a truly honest relationship. Driss is charismatic, lighthearted and funny, helping make Philippe's life enjoyable again. In the process the traditionally cold French aristocracy around Philippe warms up and lightens. He is like a hot knife through cold butter. Again, it is not so much the story that is important as is the social commentary. The commentary is not judgmental and is very subtle, revealed only in the contrasts the director chose in the story and its contexts. His method reminded me of a sort of Zen approach to comedy. One example you can catch from the trailer alone is the contrast between the able bodied black Driss and t the crippled white man, etc. The audience is also given wonderful sights of Paris and France as we go through the Pyrenees, Cabourg and the various streets of Paris. On paper the review does not make the movie justice. It is hilarious in a way that is true, honest and by which anyone can relate to. Most importantly it is revealing and comforting in its reminder of the essential in life : love. It's approach is simple, pure and honest and that makes it worthy of the title of ""best movie of the year"". I cannot say more; the film must be experienced. My friends tried, they failed, so I trusted them and I saw it. It floored me. Go and be floored. PS - I heard American studios have purchased the rights for the film. They will need a brilliant director, screenwriters and perfect actors to make the original justice in the way ""The Departed"" did for ""Infernal Affairs"".",The Intouchables

Worth watching the movie, I watched it on the TV. Here Driss is the friend recruited by Philippe who's the intouchable.",The Intouchables
326,Mmpelit,"Good Movie, I don't get the title?",8,1 January 2017,"Firstly I want to say that it was a hearth warming movie, it is possible to get a couple of good cries in there even though I didn't cry because I am a manly man!It tells the story of a rich guy who had a stroke during paragliding accident and a guy from the projects that becomes his care giver. French projects are designed to move the poor out of the city so that they can make trouble elsewhere. Their success is questionable as far as I know.This movie is based on a true story and for some reason, it makes the movie more compelling for me. If in the beginning, it says that it is based on a true story, I correct my posture, clear my throat and give my full attention and don't get me even started with the pictures they show afterwards. I immediately googled them and, like I always do, got amazed by how similar they look. I wonder if the woman who the rich guy married is the women that he was letter pals with.Even though it was a typical unexpected friendship movie, it was fun to watch. The opera scene was classic like the shave scene. I must admit I also do those with my beard. The sad thing is I do it every single time I shave. They could have shown the care-giver's life a bit more I think.",The Intouchables

328,EvelynFilmFan,"Intouchables might have a dramatic storyline, but the amazing chemistry between the main characters makes it also fun to watch",9,3 February 2016,"The French film Intouchables is based on the biographic novel Le Second Soufflé by Philippe Pozzo di Borgo. Philippe is an aristocrat who lives in a gorgeous mansion in the French capital Paris. After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident, he hires a young man from the slums to be his caregiver. At first Driss has no ambitions, he only applies to this job to get his monthly payment. What Driss doesn't know that because of his lack of pity, Philippe finds him the perfect candidate for the job. Because of Driss' attitude towards Philippe and the things they do together, they become best friends.The two lead characters are played by Omar Sy and François Cluzet, who respectively play the roles of Driss and Philippe. Sy recently played a small part in blockbuster films Jurassic World and X-Men: Days of Future Past, and played the title role in Samba. Cluzet is less known to the general public, since he only plays in French films. Despite of the unfamiliarity of the actors, it was a pleasure to watch these two men interact. Without Sy's character the film would be much more dramatic and less enjoyable. Driss is the one who brightens up Philippe's life and actually sees him as a human being, not as sad patient who relies on his caretakers. The two women who also help Philippe are Yvonne (Anne Le Ny) and Magalie (Audrey Fleurot). Yvonne and Magalie are both supporting roles, but also interesting characters. Whenever Driss is in the building, both women seems to be more vivid. So everybody benefits from Driss' precense. And I just loved the interaction between Yvonne and Driss.The contrast between the main characters couldn't be any bigger. Philippe is an aristocrat who has a lot of luxury he can't use and on the other hand there is Driss. Driss' life is complicated. He just got out of jail, comes from a large family, lives in the urban projects of Paris, has no job and he lives on welfare benefits. The only thing he has to do, is apply on jobs. When he applies to become the caretaker of this rich aristocrat Philippe, he never would have thought he would actually get the job. Nevertheless, Driss is a funny guy who respects other people in his own way. He is the worst caretaker ever, but because of his way of dealing with Philippe's situation, Driss is actually the best person Philippe could get.The film starts with a look into the future, so basically the entire film is flashback, and when the film eventually catches up with this moment, it's very clear why this is done. This scene comes after the point when you realise how important Driss was for Philippe. How he excelled in making Philippe's life a bit better, something a professional caretaker couldn't do. Driss takes Philippe out for a ride in one of his luxurious cars and both characters learn from each other. For example in the field of music and art, and Driss teaches Philippe to smoke pod. The combination might be odd at first but as the film progresses we see the emergence of an amazing and remarkable friendship. When you read the film's synopsis, you would probably think of it as drama film, but that's not entirely true. Yes the lives of the main characters have a dramatic vibe, but when these two are together there's a lot of joy. Mostly because of Sy's character. Driss is such a funny guy and his smile alone makes you laugh. He shows Philippe life can be fun with despite of his limitations. Driss also shows he can be very sweet when he arranges a lunch date for Philippe near the end. The facial expressions of both characters and the emotions they represent are amazing. It was the most touching moment of the entire film. Don't forget to listen to the film's soundtrack, composed by Ludovico Einaudi, it is brilliant!",The Intouchables
329,heitor_caramez,Pragmatic ?,9,14 April 2013,"Script-wise the film follows all the rules, but doesn't make an stiff movie, or a collection of predictable clichés, far away from that. All the resources that are used in the movie are used in order to tell a story that it is the core of the movie, the growing and life changing friendship between Philipe (François Cluzet, the French Dustin Hoffman) and Driss (Omar Sy), the second has worked in previous movies of the directors and writers of the movie (Olivier Nakache, Eric Toledano). It is a movie that can blend together perfectly humor and drama in many levels, all the time it plays with that. The spontaneity of Driss is key to explain the force that drives through out the movie, along with the intelligence and sensibility of Philipe. Many of the scenes that we can find it funny and interesting in the movie, it is under this blunt honesty, socially we are under so much scrutiny and so much expectations of behavior of what it is expected, that we can end up drowning in our skin, and probably no one would realize. How can we overcome, our own fears, the weigh of our own lives and really see one another? Friendships can do that. And that it is the story of the movie. Two true friends. ""Brothers"".He laughs at the Opera, which I have been one time in Austria, and I would definitely agree with him, unless you are over 70 year's old, you will might like it though (just don't forget to bring your pants, they won't let you in otherwise). He is able to look at Philipe with no pity and with compassion. They are both able to acknowledge one another and have fun. Movies are made of scenes, of fragments of life. The whole plot can only work, because these emotions and moments come in high level into the movie. True as for what can be recognized by our emotions. - Moments of friendship, it is so easy to see their intimacy. - Moments of teenager joy. (when he gets to drive the car) - Moments of real emotion for the characters. etc...Some truths we think, are so hard to face, that we are not able to admit to ourselves, but only a true friend, can look at it and be able to help us out, to be who we truly are. We usually live with two lives inside our hearts and minds, but things only really start when they become one. And that it the whole story.",The Intouchables

I found myself looking into two greatly contrasting lives.The characters evoke empathy in different ways and for different reasons, even when someone is ""being bad"".The casting is excellent, timing, pace, mood all have been handled with impeccability.Would it have come across differently if it had been presented as pure fiction?

The dynamic of the movie is really interesting and every character is well composed, no one at the end has his story incomplete or anything like that. Was also amazing to see, at the end of the movie, the small video with the real Philippe and Driss. Is amazing just to think about the real story of those people, i can say that i tried to substitute the character i got in my head after have seen the movie with the real person i saw at the end. The story of Driss' family (i was afraid) was going to be used too much to change the character, or just to make him look in a different way through the movie; Luckily it didn't.

Things like art, classical music & opera is boring. Drugs, tobacco and soul is good.

When i say this film is unconventional I mean that it is not a ""character facing a problem/challenge"" plot. I say that because it's not about Philippe overcoming being paralyzed because we don't know how he was before the accident, and it's not about Driss leaving the french criminal world because we don't know what he did in his past.

One needs to watch the full movie to appreciate the beauty of what was done here. Pure friendship. In a matter of 2 hours we get to see two peoples' lives be changed for the better. The fact that it is based on a true story only makes it even more beautiful. Wonderful performances by the leads, François Cluzet and Omar Sy. Worth watching. In the original French.

336,InTheBackdropOfOblivion,Intangible yet monumental,10,6 February 2017,"Review:I sat to write a review for this film as an acknowledgement of the debt I incurred while watching this masterpiece .The plot revolve around a rich quadriplegic Phillipe(Francois Cluzet)and his temporary caregiver Driss(Omar Sy)and the misdemeanors and infractions of the latter while performing his duties assigned and the very sophisticated yet intangibly compassionate understanding of these actions of the earlier(Phillipe).The temperament exhibited by him (Phillipe) against all the brusque, cocky yet humorous attitudes of his caregiver(Driss),with his withdrawn elegance, are perhaps the driving force and the most rare facet of this film, turning this, in my opinion, into a timeless work of art.The central theme is almost intangible, abstract yet of the most emotive genre which will engulf you despite not knowing what's exactly the dimension of this film causing so. There are moments so intense and so impassioned, though of course not obvious, that will make you feel indebted to this film, with their subtle portrayal in a manner which cannot always necessarily be perceived by the senses otherwise. It will take time for you to understand the parallel facets that follow every measure being pursued by the actors. The background music is almost heavenly took me somewhere so unknown.

Omar Sy is a great actor and he deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie. I found Omar Sy's role much more challenging and unusual than Jean Dujardin's... of course, few people make silent films today, but the character itself was incredibly stereotypical. As for The Intouchables, I really liked the film and found it entertaining and thoughtful at the same time .The chemistry between the two leads is wonderful. Not quite as insufferably retro as it sounds, the formulaic film gets a boost from the endearing performances of its leads — particularly Sy, whose ex-con-turned-servant instructs his cultured boss on the pleasures of '70s soul classics and pot-smoking before cleaning up nicely. The racial politics remain as sketchy as the sitcom-style jokes, and Harvey Weinstein smells a hit, having bought both the movie and, alas, the rights to remake.",The Intouchables

343,pagblonk,Intouchables (Untouchables) - you will be touched,9,2 May 2012,"This film is one of those that you will remember, as you want to remember it. The theme itself is very serious (how do people treat handicapped people), but you will definitely laugh your head off when you see in what way a man who is totally dependent on others is treated by his man-servant. It is these actions, the humour and the matter-of- fact style when a reference to the handicap is made (""here is a letter for you, why don't you open it, oh, I forgot, you cannot move your arms""), that lift this film above other films with the same theme / message. The message brought by this film is: I don't need you to pity me, I want you to treat me normally. I think many (handicapped) people will recognise this behaviour immediately. Despite everything you've read so far, I cannot remember how many times I had to laugh, and believe me, sometimes one really does think this film is a screwball comedy, but you wouldn't be further from the truth, as you will be reminded of the deeper level again and again. The film shows many contrasts which would surely be enough for many discussions: black vs white, rich vs poor, upper-class vs lower-class and, last but not least, two totally contrasting worlds come together in a way that is hard to describe, maybe even harder to believe. Luckily, these discussions will not be necessary, as the film focuses on something much more important. The film is based on the real lives of two persons. One being absurdly rich, belonging to one of the oldest aristocratic families of France, living in his own palace. The other a foreign, jobless (former) delinquent living in harsh conditions in some Parisian suburb where criminals rule. Why do these two people get along so well? A very simple answer: they do not judge the other, they simply respect the other and by doing so, they show us how it should be.

344,tom-james-brennan,Near perfect film making and characterisation,10,19 July 2018,"I have just finished watching this movie, and I am floored. I laughed throughout, was thoroughly drawn in to the characters and the wonderful relationship that blossomed between them through the course of the movie.I am not a French speaker at all, yet this did not in any way stop me from my enjoyment of this film. Full credit to François Cluzet for his incredible acting as a paraplegic - this is a very difficult thing to play convincingly when you still have full range of motion, yet I was so convinced by his acting I had to check whether he actually was disabled after the movie finished - literally no movement of anything from the neck down through the whole thing - it is up there with Daniel Day-Lewis in 'My Left Foot' and Eddie Redmayne in 'The Theory of Everything'.Omar Sy stole the show for me - absolutely convincing portrayal of a man who is from the projects and with a deeper, more troubled past than he lets on, yet his comedic timing through subtle expression, and delivery of his dialogue is nothing short of masterful. Very few films leave you feeling so wonderful, so much so that only two spring to mind - The Shawshank Redemption, and It's a Wonderful Life, and to be compared to two such films is very high praise.The relationship of the two central characters is akin to that of Red and Andy Dufresne in Shawshank, but with more humour and a wonderful co-dependency which becomes clearer as the film progresses. 
Supporting cast and characters are a joy to behold, with the roles of Yvonne and Magalie being expertly fleshed out by Anne Le Ny and Audrey Fleurot respectively.This movie is all about heart and humour viewed through the lens of two people from vastly different ends of a cultural spectrum.

355,JMM495,Outstanding,10,10 February 2021,"From the first scene I could tell this was going to be a great film. Driss was instantly likeable and the two clearly had a strong bond.The premise is white paraplegic millionaire hires black criminal who seems grossly unprepared for the job of looking after him - so much so that he didn't even want the role in the first place.
What unfolds on screen is the blossoming of the two's relationship into one of the best and funniest duos I've had the pleasure of watching. Driss was exactly what Philippe needed, a strong, caring, confident person and someone blunt enough to be truthful with him. I don't know if that was by chance or whether Driss knew that Philippe needed pushing in certain ways (with Eleanor, his daughter, etc) either way it was great to watch Driss break him down into doing what was best for his life.
And Philippe was exactly what Driss needed, a good guy who provided him focus and made him rethink his previous crimes - his return of the egg was a great inclusion.
There were so many hilarious scenes, mainly Omar
Extra mention to Driss' relationships with the daughter, Yvonne, Magalie. He won them all over in no time and improved all of their lives in various ways.
There were so many highlights but to name a favourite it would have to be when they went to see the Opera. Driss was unimpressed and was obvious to his surroundings (or just didn't care) and Philippe found it very funny.Omar Sly gave a fantastic performance and the whole cast was excellent.The soundtrack was good fun, from Earth Wind and Fire through to Vivaldi. The piano playing throughout set a perfect tone.I don't know how true to the real story the film is - but I hope it done their friendship justice.Overall a truly great feel-good film and the best foreign language film I've seen.",The Intouchables

Nothing that we have not seen but still the life interactions shown here is a rare phenomenon in our everyday busy life. The movie does not make use of the beautiful Parisian landscape outside of the closed doors, but rather stays inside to explore the warm fuzzy feeling in a marriage between a quadriplegic and caregiver.

There are no action heroes or good-looking women necessary to make this film perfect. It's all about the story and the development of its characters. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy did a great job there. Their performances were memorable and well fitted. The story as in the real life story has been portrayed, in my opinion, brilliantly. Of course we can expect a lot of things to have been added to the entertaining production, but nevertheless a lot morally correct life lessons are included as well. This movie makes you search for humanity within yourself as it illustrates how a guy from the low, social classes in Paris can be a true friend and ally of this rich, handicapped person. Subsequently, the writers and producers have creatively played with this and have 'covered' the seriousness of the movie to seconds while the major events have been coated in a fun and inspiring way. The movie is enjoyable for all ages and backgrounds. So I strongly recommend all of you to watch this movie - try to enjoy the jokes, but also take note of the messages conveyed by the movie.

359,Lucy_Rose84,"Refreshing, entertaining and frank.",9,9 February 2013,"So many movies and TV programmes involving disabled characters are saccharine and patronising in an effort to inspire or hammer home a message of triumph over adversity. Not so the Intouchables. This movie finally gives an honest portrait of disabled man, at once gruesome and humbling, while keeping the focus firmly on his relationship with his carer instead of dwelling on his disability. Indeed this is a story as much about overcoming class divide as it is about overcoming physical disability. Down and out Driss, part of Paris's disenfranchised and unemployed black youth, applies for a position as millionaire quadriplegic Phillipe's carer in order to get a signature for his jobseeker's benefit. Phillipe, appreciating the young man's honesty and frank attitude towards his condition, hires Driss and simultaneously resolves the Driss's poverty and his own boredom.The genius of this film, in spite of its dark subject matter and themes of disability, class and race, is that it is genuinely hilarious.

Well if I were that poor secretary in the movie - I feel it is just about sexual harassment. His attitudes toward fat women or ""ugly women"" are equally crude.Yes, it puts more of a kick into the life of a quadriplegic, but on a crude level for the most part and with adolescent behaviors.Driss laughing at the opera - especially because it is in German - is ruining an experience for the whole theater of people who want to enjoy it. And there is Driss driving the sports car through Paris, speeding, weaving in and out of traffic, making high speed turns - it looks so ""professional"" from the driver's seat, but imagine if you were in that traffic with him - it is incredibly dangerous - forget about Driss - for the other people on the road.

I fell in love with this movie and have watched it multiple times. I laughed out loud, I cried out loud also. It made me have faith in humans. I smile when I think about this film. I had not seen any of the actors in other films and did not know what to expect. I loved the performances and got completely immersed in the film. Even reading the English subtitles I never felt like I missed anything. The director was flawless in making this film. I have seen over 3,200 films from around the world and easily in my top 10. I could watch the two main characters for hours. You can feel the bond and experience the bonding. I could feel and see the depth of each character and th hard work the actors put into to making this movie one of the best I have seen. Highly recommended.",The Intouchables
362,mau-zi,After this film I have to reconsider my other 10/10 ratings,9,6 February 2012,"This was for sure one of the Top5 or Top10 movies I've ever seen. The actors, the ambiente, the story ... simply everything was in a perfect combination. This film is for me in a league with films like ""The Elephant Man"", but for a much wider audience. And as the title say, after this film I really have to consider to reduce my ratings for several films, because it seems a bit unfair to put them on the same level as this film, although I don't have anything to criticize on them at all. All the persons in the film are very authentic played. And both main characters surprised me with a brilliant performance. I would say, that both actors are really what they are playing in the film. If I would see François Cluzet in the street, I would be surprised not seeing him in a wheelchair. The emotions shown in the last sequence of the film are so brilliant.",The Intouchables

Basically, When I first started watching this movie, I was open minded to see what is going to happen. Personally, I was always a big fan of a good laughter, but this movie is so much more than I have expected. I blew my mind, for it was much more than I expected...way more. And when the movie came to an end, all that I could was was curve in a ball and cry. I was happy, yet sad at the same time, and this movie brought the best in me while at the same time reminding me that it is the small things that make life beautiful.

I have rarely laughed so wholeheartedly or with my soul as much as I did when I watched this masterpiece of a movie. There are few characters, and the main focus are on two men, who very obviously come from two different life's and struggles, but develops a friendship I have never seen anything like on a movie screen. I almost have trouble describing what this beautiful story does to you. You feel like you wanna run down to the streets and hug a stranger and let them know that whatever they are facing in life that it's gonna be okey.The reason i LOVE this movie is because of the story and the people portraying the main characters. They have really done an excellent job both on the cast and the script. You can relate to the characters, they suck you in and you have no other option but to listen and laugh(and cry)with them. The story is unique and original, it touches you in ways you didn't think possible. Don't mistake this movie for a sob-story because it's anything but. If you haven't seen it, and think for a second you are not going to either - well then, the jokes on you. Because it doesn't matter where you are, who you are or what kind of situation you are in, it will bring light and love right smack into your little beating bloodbox.",The Intouchables

Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakashe, accompanied by the lead actor Omar Sy were meeting the audience and cheerfully answering questions.The movie is very well written. Although opening on a flash-forward, it is fairly classic comedy about the meeting of two opposite people who were very unlikely to meet. The first one is a paraplegic white middle aged very rich and lonely man, the other one is a young black, poor, unemployed, coming from poor suburbs and a very large family.What makes the quality of the film, beside the humour present in every scene in which Omar Sy appears (actually most of the film), is the emotion you can feel, through increasingly attaching characters.The story is based upon a true story, and real characters.If you want to watch and enjoyable comedy, with very touching moments, this is a must go.There are interesting insights about arts as well (paintings, classical music, and funk music).

369,sindelkovaiva,Miracle,10,1 January 2019,"When I first saw the movie, I had no expectations whatsoever, I hadn ´t heard or read any reviews, the impact on me was, therefore, bigger. I was watching this spectre in awe and with my mouth open. Since then I have seen the movie dozen of times, always with the same impact. Flawless script, unique way of incorporating beginning / towards the end scene. Brilliant actors, great music which sometimes intensified the scenes from behind and in some parts it was cruicial to the actors and, hence, played a partner to leading actors. In 2017 American version was created but I do not have a heart to watch that version. I have already done so with Girl with dragon tattoo and I do not have to repeat that experience. On the other hand, I never say never and there is a possibility, that in a time of weakness I might actually watch American version just for studying purposes. The story has that gradation, moment of surprise and that development of characters I always hope for. In one sentence : It is a bromance, where the leading characters safe one another. Unforgetable scenes like: shaving, birthday celebration, seducing co-worker, Omar´s dancing and mainly his laughter at a theatre. Speaking of Omar´s laughter - for the sake of his voice and his laughter I do recommend to watch that film in original.

They qualify the film as a feel-good fairy tale, which means they completely miss the point that it is a true story. The latter point and the unusual real life story are the reasons behind the huge success. Yes, it was filmed with actors but the real life protagonists vetted every point and the final product was not cooked and edited the ""Hollywood"" way to please audiences as it did not need to be. We are not talking about a recipe- based product here. The lazy American critiques watch too many American commercial romantic comedies and other ""romanticised"" genres to even suspect this was a true story...so, shame on the critiques of this film.You should see this film because the feel-good you come out of seeing it, is not made up.",The Intouchables

I actually work at a video store and a British English teacher i know comes in regularly, he mentioned to me that this is one of the top 10 movies he has ever viewed. He rents out a lot of movies. So i finally gave it a go after putting it off. The only reason i resented this was due to it being subtitled but i'm glad I put that aside. Not many films make me laugh anymore, I feel as if humor in movies is subtly disappearing but in this film, it is present.

380,dii_rajneesh,Fantastic !!!!!!,10,24 July 2012,"My my where do I begin.To start with I did not want the movie to end at all. Its becoming more and more rare for movies as this one to come by. This movie completes the circle, as far as movie going experience goes. The movie has left me with a sort of warm feeling in my heart that cannot be said in words alone. There is something about the way French movies are made, when they get it right they are simply par excellence. Hollywood kisses concrete.Anyway, I feel most of us humans are quadriplegic though not physically but emotionally in someway or other. But what one may agree is that when you cry you cry alone, but when you laugh the whole world laughs with you.If just by the word ""quadriplegic"" you are expecting it to be a dark, heart shattering, emotionally overloaded movie then I would passionately defend against such a prejudiced opinion. One is not the physical form alone. One can have a beautiful body but a black heart and vice-verse.A very well written, full bodied script and an exceptionally well directed movie. Characters cannot become more real than this on the silver screen. Omar Sy in my opinion has done a very good job. He lived his character and not played it. To contrast him we have François Cluzet who kept the sparks flying. Omar Sy's comments on Bach, Vivaldi etc classics had me in splits. And also do not miss out on the singing Human tree, the very mentioning of which is having me in splits.Wow !!! that was some movie.

This question I want to address here and reply deliver .Phillip , heavy Disabled , needs a social worker who goes to him in his everyday life at hand. Driss , pretty broke, needs three unsuccessful interviews to longed to get hold unemployment benefits . A conflict-ridden history is thus created .Driss , who actually want to present only because of a cancellation at Phillip himself , has little sensitivity to the suffering of others . Phillip underestimated this property and provides Driss promptly as a new social worker . Quick note , the two that they differ in many respects. Nevertheless, they become friends and enjoy their time together .So far, so good. Similar stories exist in other films as well . So what is the secret behind the success of ""Pretty Best Friends "" ?Perhaps the most important point - the main characters are authentic. The direct type of Driss , who is played by Omar Sy is so poignant sympathetic that you simply like to have to have him ! The viewer can identify from the first minute with him , not least because you are often able to have the desire , even to say that really what you think straight. Also, Phillip , played by Franzois Cluzet , exerts a fascination on the viewer. Because we are interested in his illness and infects the person behind this . Another factor of success is the juxtaposition of both character types . The funny and easygoing manner of Driss and the rigid view of life by Phillip are so opposite , since it is difficult to the audience not to sympathize .Conclusion:Comedy with level seems to work! Anyone looking for a very unusual French film for a friends evening , is hereby served very well . A credible story with lots of charm and great actors.

The performances are really good and in the case of Omar unexpectedly good given his little experience.There are many humorous scenes in this film but the overall climate is depressing. The reason I give it a 7 is because it isn't deep enough and you don't get to know the characters very well, maybe a little more screenplay time would be for the best.

And the soundtrack perfectly complimented the movie, It was nothing short of blissful and haunting at the same time. Challenges the mastery of Hans Zimmer and some brilliant pieces by Daniel Licht.

392,gabrimelul,One of the best foreign films I have seen to date.,10,1 March 2020,"This review is mainly a critique, not of the movie, but of the American Movie Reviewers.To start off, i'm not from the United States, I'm from Spain. There have been good TV shows and music coming out of spain for years, but films is the one thing we cannot do, due to all films having to be comedies which a part of them are not understandable by international (specially American) audiences due to the politics and very vast culturl differences.You may think that had nothing to do with the critique, but it does more than you think. Just like Spain, France does have a very different culture, being even one of the European countries with most differences to the United States. Most of the critic reviews i've read about this film state things that are true in the states when talking about social class levels, but when it comes to France, it is completley different.This films is very captivating, and incredibly emotional, one of the best foreign fils I've seen in years, comparable to 2019's Parasite (not as good), and 2018's Roma.
Also something that may bias me, it that i have seen this movie religiously, and knowing a basic french understanding helps.If i were to reccomend 3 french films these would be the order:

I suppose I was initially deterred by the subtitles, and then the potential of this movie actually being as cliché as the main image presents. However, the film has your eyeballs glued to the screen within the first minute, regardless of how much your eyes are twitching back and forth to the subtitles.The script, acting, photography, set design, etc; all is realistic and really without any noteworthy flaw. I was captivated from beginning to end, whilst having experienced a whole gamut of emotion, which I think is pretty difficult to come by from any film. I enjoyed this film very much! There's a really decent moral to this story, executed tastefully and in a very delicate manner. I'm quite sure there's a bit of something for everyone in this movie, regardless of whether you're in the market for a bit of grit, action (if briefly!), romance, or drama - a good 'all rounder.'",The Intouchables

This is real story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo. It gives this film charm and special mood. You can have a lot of money, but is it secret of happiness, if you have not health? On the other hand, story of ordinary guy, who has not money, but his style is like fireworks. He is like fireworks.

396,kalmarjerry,Greatness,9,14 November 2017,"For me one of the difficulties of watching a foreign language film is getting the humour. Though laughter is universal it's often the subtext of good comedy that makes it great, and with the separating factors of a foreign language and subtitles the subtext is sometimes lost. On top of this, the pure cultural differences may even mean that definition of humour is different. Luckily Intouchables is one movie that transcends these potential barriers and provides an experience that is not only touching and engaging, but also very funny. The performances of the two leads are engaging and genuine and the jovial script always serves to lighten the potentially heavy mood of the characters' respective plights.

The American version is staring Kevin Hart (a well-known stand-up comedian turned actor) as Dell Scott (the caregiver of Phillip Lacasse), Bryan Cranston (from Breaking Bad fame) as Phillip Lacasse (a paralysed person on a wheelchair), Nicole Kidman as Yvonne Pendleton, (Phillip's devoted personal assistance), Golshifteh Farahani as Maggie (Phillip's attractive physical trainer).Dell and Phillipe have a good relationship between music, women, etcetera. In their relationship a lot of ups and downs happen. Phillipe has a surprise party organized by Yvonne, but Phillipe wanted to have nothing for his birthday. Phillipe ask dell to break things for him because he was mad and uncapable from his quadriplegic condition. I found this scene emotional and heartbreaking. This scene was one of the best improvements to the original French version.Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano are a duo writer. Their 3 other popular film are C'est la vie! (2017), The Specials (2019) and Tellement proches (2009) which they all made together! Intouchables is the most well like by the public. The English version is funnier at times, while the French version is more emotional between the two main characters.The Upside is a comedy. A lot of moment in The Upside has humor. The Intouchables and The Upside has still a lot of differences. In The Intouchables Driss (Dell in The Upside) likes Magalie (Yvone in The Upside) and flirts with here a lot. In The Upside Dell (Driss in The Intouchables) is making a lot of joke but Phillipe is more serious. But in The Intouchables the both are laughing and telling jokes more equally which makes for the stronger bond. It is a touching story, and fun that is based on a real life unlikely friendship like the Green Book.I will rate both 9/10. I recommend them.The Upside

The actors are simply the best, Omar is not only a great comic but also a great actor.The filming has a certain touch that brings to mind ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" in the way the director was able to capture not only the suffering of Phillip but also the joy.Not wanting to spoil the film for others, i highly recommend seeing this in the theaters and with a loved one.It is also a good film for teenagers as it holds a few wonderful life lessons.Enjoy.",The Intouchables

It made me both laugh and cry. Actors are just plain excellent, they are very talented and they show spirit. The script was written magnificently with great conversations and humorous touches. You can really tell a lot of effort was put into this project. I have nothing but words of praise for this movie. And those critic reviews about this movie being racist are completely false. So maybe this movie shows that a black guy smokes pot and lives in a poor family- but why is that racist? Maybe it is a cliché that a black guy is poor. But remember, it's based on a true story. So trust me when I say- go and watch this movie right away!",The Intouchables

Omar Sy is very funny. The movie is a definite must-see.To think that this may have happened in real life gives people a certain optimism especially me. It is suitable for young adults but also for older people as well. The story is told with ease and the two character's complex relationship is shown beautifully, how they get along with one another.

414,karlo_v,"A carefree (yes, carefree) comedy about a quadriplegic",9,2 May 2012,"This movie does not really need another review, but after seeing what Daily Beast's (Marlow Stern) and Variety's (Jay Weissberg) critics have written about it, I feel that one thing needs a serious clarification. It is somewhat disturbing and, at the same time, really telling a lot about USA's culture that American reviewers see this movie as ""race-relations"" feature.I've read all of the 38 reviews written here on IMDb until now and I would suggest to both Stern and Weissberg to do the same. Maybe they could learn something. Most of the reviews here were written by non-Americans and, tellingly, most of them do not even mention race or race relations or anything similar. To me that shows how deep anything to do with a difference in color of skin has been intertwined with USA culture when even in this film - where nobody from, let's say the rest of the world, does not see any racism or anything similar - the only thing USA critics do see is the difference in color of skin. Sad, very sad.I'm, therefore, afraid that, if it shares Stern's and Weissberg's opinions, most of the USA audience will not see the real beauty of this film and will, probably also under the influence of critics' reviews, see the movie as a race-relations feature when that's the only thing it's not.And what it is? It is (I can't believe I'm gonna write this) a carefree comedy about a quadriplegic and his personal aide. The movie does not at any moment come even close to apathy or pathetics which is a success on its own. The movie also has just about the perfect amount of black humor and political incorrectness and does not cross those borders at any time. I think this is the only movie about a disabled human where, after seeing it, you will go out of the theater laughing. And I can't remember any movie which approaches such a difficult theme with such ease.Additionaly, the soundtrack - both Einaudi's score as well as selected tracks - is fantastic.A lot has been written here about cast and I would just like to add that along masterful performances of both Sy and Cluzet, the rest of the actors are equally great, especially Anne Le Ny and Audrey Flerot.",The Intouchables
415,EddardWinterhammer,"Entertaining, but not very insightful.",6,2 April 2012,"When I first saw ""Intouchables"", it hadn't become the French box office hit it is now, in fact I hadn't heard of it or watched a trailer before seeing the film. Members of my family who were there with me were absolutely enchanted when we got out, but I merely shrugged.I remember thinking, early on in the film: ""It seems they sort of know what they're doing"", what with the very expressive visual choices in terms of setting and photography. But as the movie went on, all traces of artistic flair were lost for good.The characters are flat and are only here so that the audience can have a good laugh and be forced to accept the old fallacy that a movie with disabled people can only be good. Then again, I found myself smiling at various points of the movie, but I only think it is sad that the movie abandons its interesting story and social context: by the end, it does not consist of much more than a long thread of random jokes. Francois Cluzet is too distancing in the role of a jaded paraplegic, but Omar Sy makes the most of his (very) limited part. It is only through this character that the film manages to take a stand against prejudices without feeling divorced from reality or from the cinematic necessities of storytelling and character development.Let's sum things up this way: the movie had a great beginning in which it properly introduced the world of the story, Omar Sy's performance is really engaging, and yes, the film is VERY entertaining and beautiful, but it is not realistic enough nor ready to put its many jokes in context.",The Intouchables
416,audis8-299-313639,Wonderful Film,8,5 August 2017,"I have seen this movie tonight at a preview session as the official french national release is set on 2011, November 2nd. Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakashe, accompanied by the lead actor Omar Sy were meeting the audience and cheerfully answering questions.The movie is very well written. Although opening on a flash-forward, it is fairly classic comedy about the meeting of two opposite people who were very unlikely to meet. The first one is a paraplegic white middle aged very rich and lonely man, the other one is a young black, poor, unemployed, coming from poor suburbs and a very large family.What makes the quality of the film, beside the humour present in every scene in which Omar Sy appears (actually most of the film), is the emotion you can feel, through increasingly attaching characters.The story is based upon a true story, and real characters.If you want to watch and enjoyable comedy, with very touching moments, this is a must go.There are interesting insights about arts as well (paintings, classical music, and funk music). What is art? What is its use?",The Intouchables

418,grantwedan,Face of Humanity,9,16 December 2020,"Having read plenty of hype about this film I was preparing myself to be disappointed but, luckily, the film felt engaging from the very beginning and went on to be a wonderfully touching and funny experience. There is also a fair amount of excitement and romance thrown in for good measure!Despite appearances, Untouchable is not really about race, disability or class; it's about friendship. The two main characters both feel disconnected from society for various reasons, yet the connection between these two outsiders is so genuine and believable that you are drawn into their relationship. In fact, the performances from Omar Sy and François Cluzet are simply incredible. The massive amount of meaning conveyed in the slightest look between them is acting at its very best. On many occasions, you find yourself laughing with them and the fact that one is a rich white guy in a wheelchair and the other is a poor black guy fresh out of prison ceases to be an issue.One of the most interesting themes for me was the effect that Driss's lack of pity had on Philippe. I understand that the film has been applauded by many disabled groups and I can see why. Pity is a very selfish and unpleasant emotion and I can imagine that the effect of such pity would be quite destructive on a person in Philippe's situation. Driss simply reacts to him in natural and honest way, which is extremely refreshing to see and a lesson for all those who would look down on anybody with pity.The film is not without flaws however. It is a little 'lightweight' in places and there are a few clichés here and there (even though the film manages to avoid most of the more obvious stereotyping). The subtitles are also not brilliant in places and some of the meaning is slightly lost on occasion, but I guess that happens all the time. Overall, I would have said that this was a lovely 8/10 'feelgood movie' but the superb quality of acting easily bumps it up to a 9. Unmissable.",The Intouchables

The first scene captivates the audience in a way unlike any other, by showing the unlikely, and genuine, relationship between two people who would appear to be, upon first glance, polar opposites. I have read through a handful of negative reviews and it, quite frankly, really bothers me. Not only did I find the movie to be laugh-out-loud funny, but it was also very sentimental, especially more towards the latter portion of the film. This is one of only a few movies that I have ever watched that has had my utmost attention for the entire duration of the film. Not once did I find my mind wandering off, and I most certainly was never bored. However, on a more serious note, I think that the movie also shows how, sometimes, the most unexpected people could become some of the most important people in your life. I would, without a doubt, give this movie a 10/10 and recommend it to everybody. Even though the movie is in French and I found myself reading the subtitles the whole time, I was still able to very easily capture the whole essence of the film. Amazing!",The Intouchables

I felt after watching this movie one of those life affirming moments - a clear summer sky where the clouds are full, loaded with health and the warm light that seems to last forever showing off the land about you typical of summer evenings.This 'glow' is because the principal casts are excellent. I cannot direct a negative to any of the casts, pinpoint a scene where the acting was forced or lacking in motivation. Omar Sy is infectious as a performer. He struts. He dominates with his energy. Whoever cast him deserves praise, as he is the right balance between cock sure attitude and understanding. Francois Cluzet pedigree dates back decades, and his assured but restrained performance is the right level of rebound compared to Sy's exuberance. Trust in a maestro to deliver a seasoned performance. It would be easy - and a major oversight - to read the synopsis about the movie and believe the subject matter depressing. Funny, moving, idiosyncratic, unexpected, real, intimate, soul praisingly positive, and many other adjectives could be used to describe this excellent film.I stumbled upon this movie knowing little of its release or background, and its a gem of a film. One of them films you watch and yell, 'yesssss to life'.The fact that its based on a true story is inspiring in itself.

435,curiousdevansh,The Intouchables: A Humorous Dive into a Sparkling Friendship.,10,5 April 2020,"The Intouchables, originally a French Film, a winner of 38 ""Best Foreign Language Film award"", is the movie based on true events, is an intricately fabricated profound work of art, which surely is a medley of sparkling humor, subtle emotions, and a deep dive into nature of human relationships. It's truly an irresistible delight for the connoisseurs of the finest cinematic experience.The movie revolves around the two main characters - Philippe and Driss.Philippe, played by François Cluzet, is a millionaire, and handsome aristocrat who is deep inside a free-spirited, fast-paced, adventure-loving, energetic and humor seeking person, meets an accident while Paragliding and happens to become a quadriplegic, a person who is paralyzed right from the base of his neck to the last toe on his foot. Philippe's life, now due to the helplessness given by quadriplegia, is limited to mostly the walls of his mansion, the routine care of doctors and caretakers and the pity of the rest of the world. In summary, he is living hell in the midst of his affluence.Due to the consistent exposure of pity, dependence, and helplessness, he happens to devote his life to intellectual activities, arts, music, drama, literary events, and epistolary relationships (distant conversations with a person through letters only). There is a lot of insipidity in his life, his true innate energetic and adventure-loving nature is now lost, which he has now accepted as his fate.He happens to meet and finally hires Driss, Omar Sy, as his caregiver, who is totally opposite of what Phillipe is from the outside. Driss is black west African, he is impulsive, he is uncultured, raw, reckless, violent, free-spirited, fast-paced, humorous and aimless person, who comes from one of Paris's poor, suburban high-rise ghettoes, and is seeking some money. He has also been recent to jail for 6 months for robbing a Jewelry store.In spite of two of them being so different, what binds them together is their total love for honesty, sense of humor and contempt for stuffy hypocrisy. And, most importantly Driss is actually the outward raw and honest manifestation of the true deep character of Phillipe. What Phillipe likes about Driss the most is, he treats him like a normal human being with all his arms and legs, he doesn't pity him, he doesn't make him realize of quadriplegia all the time and rather he makes him feel good, makes him feel lively and makes him laugh again, the laughter which was missing in Phillipe's life since ages. This becomes the greatest binding force in their relation.
Philipe shares that he lost his loving wife the same time he got quadriplegia and his true disability is not having to be in a wheelchair, but it's having to be without his wife.
Driss brings taste in Phillipe's insipid life. They both learn and grow with each other. Phillipe learns to enjoy the daily life mundane things apart from his literary and intense interests and at the same time, Driss gets more responsible and civilized in the journey!Both of them have performed phenomenally. Their every action and expression is praiseworthy. It's an epitome of a true and deep friendship that grips, holds and takes the spectator on an around 2 hours long journey of humor and subtle emotions.An inevitably must watch.",The Intouchables

443,boyofthunder,A film for everyone,8,23 January 2019,"Based on a true story, The Intouchables (Untouchable in English) depicts an unlikely, albeit sweet, friendship between an ex-convict (Driss) and a quadriplegic, wealthy man (Phillipe) whose life was rejuvenated upon meeting and appointing the former as his caretaker. A grounded yet unique experience emphasized by outstanding cinematography is what can be savored after watching this lighthearted feature film.
Two men, coming from contrasting parts of society, accompanied each other, partaking a variety of activities around charming Paris and beyond. The Intouchables could be consider rather straightforward with the main characters eventually found their happiness if not for one small detail that was masterfully executed during its length. Appearing multiple times throughout the film in different forms was the word 'Pragmatic'. Most activities carried out by Driss and Phillipe can be considered practical (apart from some, especially the paragliding scene which bears similarities with the skydiving scene in a similar themed film - The Bucket List) and in reality, would not have changed Phillipe's monotonous life, but perhaps it was Driss, a man from an ever struggling part of society, whose actions and the 'pragmatic' ways he handled these daily activities, that had transformed Phillipe from a sanctimonious, highly educated, self-centered man into a carefree yet thoughtful person.

446,wujun-41909,Hands of reality touch the heart,9,3 March 2020,"There is no emotional ups and downs of great sorrow and joy in (can't touch). There is no big exciting scene except the ending of two sections of racing. However, the seemingly simple plot leaves a lot of room for rumination. Meredith said in (on the concept of drama and the use of comedy spirit) that the important test standard of a country's civilization is to observe the development of its comedy. From this point of view, the slow creation of a warm narrative and lively humorous language in the film also reflects the height of French civilization to some extent.
In fact, the story of the film is about a pair of abnormal master-slave relationship. From the perspective of literary creation, the narrative structure of (master servant) relationship has always occupied a place in Chinese and foreign comedies. Servants are often indispensable figures reflecting the spirit of comedy, and their wisdom and living ability are often higher than those of the upper class, just like the red lady in the story of the west chamber. In this movie, according to the normal thinking, the servant serving Philip should be as respectful as the other interviewers, but Philip saw the servant's disrespect for himself in this kind of inequality constructed by identity difference, just like the helpless heartache when Derris left and his successor casually said (he took the wrong medicine). Therefore, it was quite to his liking that Derris was careless, because he did not have the rules of others. In his eyes, Philip was not a rich patient, but a friend who could eat, drink and play together. Therefore, he would be unbridled to joke, ridicule Philip's arm, and find prostitutes to comfort his ears.
However, how can two people with different cultural backgrounds produce such friendship? Perhaps, this fate stems from the curiosity of the upper class Philip to the heterogeneous culture. His initial interest in dries is a kind of reckless and strong culture he represents. Therefore, with the help of two people who also need to be changed, the creator refers to two cultures that need to break the gap and communicate with each other. Although the film gives two kinds of cultural exchanges with good results, as Bakhtin said, it is difficult to analyze the truly comic (funny) things, because the negative factors and the positive factors are inseparable in comedy, and it is difficult to draw a clear line between them. From time to time, the film still satirizes the hypocrisy and hypocrisy of the upper class by virtue of dries' humor. In his eyes, those seemingly elegant operas, paintings and symphonies are like a pool of nosebleed sprinkled on the drawing paper.",The Intouchables

It is about two men from different background, interest, class, and culture developing a close friendship and lighting up each other's world. It touches your heart, it is not emotional but it takes you on an amazing emotional ride about what it means to be human, dealing with the tragics in life, the things we feel helpless about, anger, fear, passion, love, beauty, intellect, and hope.It leaves you feeling a mixed of emotions and just speechless. It is sooooo real, and using Driss's favourite quote, it is ""pragmatic"" and it is life. It is also entertaining and funny, from the beginning to the end.

Once in a while, a movie comes along that elicits emotions from deep within the heart. You don't know how it's going to end and you are smiling when the movie is over, wishing there was more. I usually don't laugh out loud while watching a movie but found myself doing so because even the jokes in this movie were so genuinely funny without being crass.Both the lead actors did a wonderful job. The chemistry between them can be felt and you really feel as if you are watching the story unfold in front of you and not on the screen. All the characters were well developed in their own roles and there were no loose ends (something most movies neglect to tie up). Watch this movie.

461,Omar_Agius,When Critics Get It Spectacularly Wrong,9,5 October 2014,"What I will write is not a review of the film but rather, my feelings about it. I think that a critic's judgment, although in most cases accurate, is often clouded by ego and limited appreciation towards the human side of the movie and more towards the aesthetic value of it and the notions of motion picture ""art"" and ""science"". So what if it's a modern version of Driving Miss Daisy? That's not the point of the movie. When one lets go of all these distractions and the film works it's magic, the human feeling it exerts on the viewer is incredible. Also, I didn't get the nonsense about the ""racial stereotypes"". In their shallow selves, the critics, especially the American ones, paid too much attention to these alleged signals of race stereotypes. I, for one, didn't think once about it and I was shocked to read that the movie contained racial stereotypes (I like to read reviews after watching a movie to avoid being influenced) Furthermore the instances where the film tackles cultural differences (not the plot of the movie), albeit unfortunately, are not necessarily stereotypes but a reality for many people of different cultures and ethnicity; even in America, as much as American critics hate to admit it. So therefore if you haven't seen this movie yet, let go and immerse yourself in a touching and very human experience and don't be prejudiced about it and you will agree that this is a case where critics get it spectacularly wrong.",The Intouchables

Such friendship honest, true and natural is something to be jealous about in the most positive way. A big surprise, so it needs a lot of very positive comments because you do not want to miss this one. Although you may think this is a dramatic movie, it is actually more a very warm movie loaded with very good humor. The trailers, advertisement and also the Dutch tittle actually first put us of to watch this movie. Then it is also a French movie so normally that comes with a lot of not too positive expectations. This all is easily overwon within just the first few minutes of the movie but gets totally shattered the longer the movie lasts.",The Intouchables

The cast acting is great, the script - despite it's not a movie where actually a looot of different stuff doesn't happen - has no ""blank spots"" so you just can't get bored and the characters - specially the main ones - are really THAT interesting. The relationship between them is just so casual - despite the circumstances - that it's just fun as hell as well as heart touching.

And the movie is well written, and i personally thought that the time flied by when watching it. Usually i'm pretty critical to movie endings, but i didn't have any problems with this one. This is Definitely a movie you can see again without being bored. And i really enjoyed the scene where Driss entered Philippe with the paper for his payment. Very good acting. And one more favorite scene is when François Cluzet and Omar Sy are outside walking and talking about life and smoking. But i can agree with you guys here on IMDb that this movie is not a Comedy, it's a serious movie with some really dramatical scenes. So i can't really say it's a Comedy and compare it to the 'Hangover' movie.I gave this movie 9/10 in ratings.",The Intouchables

I came to like Driss and Philippe as real characters and now at the end of the movie i wonder where did they go. That is the kind of emotion this movie generates. It has everything you could expect from a great movie : story, characters, laughs and cries, tension and so on. You won't regret seeing this movie alone or with someone.

Three minutes into the film, I realised my prejudgement could not be any further from the truth. I have laughed throughout the whole film and I enjoyed every second I was in the movie theatre.

Omar Sy really acts like a boss, kind of in the style of Will Smith in the fresh prince of bell-air.The story it's self is very original and exciting. A poor man from ""the ghetto"" who comes to help the rich man who is paralyzed almost completely. The paralyzed man has the feeling that he is seen as a ""real man"" for the first time since the accident. He threats him different, because he doesn't show any pity, like the rest does.

Scenario has enough of intelligent humor and it is such a refreshment in the ocean of bad comedies. The film has the tragic note but also it shows we should use every moment of our life. The fact that the film was based on real persons and events makes it even more special. I would recommend it for every audience : each person can learn from the film. Its a story of life, love, daily problems, tragedy but it shows that we can change our perspective and experience the maximum. Also, it shows how two totally opposite people can build an amazing relationship. We just need to forget the prejudice we have about each other.

I would say he is a born actor.I don't really watch French-movies but i was pleasantly surprised by this one. It was a my brother who told me to watch it. That is actually the first time you would see love between 2 men(not in gay way nor a best friend) They an unusual but strong bond that will really move you especially because they come from to different world.one is an ex-convict lives in a bad neighborhood(drug,poverty,unemployment) and the other is a rich man with a severe handicap.As you watch it, you will see how the bond create between the two, and its full of funny moments.I will be brief just watch it.I would rate it over 10.",The Intouchables

477,poboscov,One of the best french flicks I've seen to this day,10,14 October 2013,"In one word: amazing!!! Don't let yourself feel biased by the quadriplegic background: this is truly an honest and compelling movie. It's in fact a story about the casual meetings in our lives and the friendships that change them forever.Driss is the typical ghetto wiz, smart but not enough to stay out of trouble and be on the right track with his life. Phillippe is a french aristocrat, bounded not only by his physical condition but also by the lifestyle that he's chosen for himself. When these two meet they're instantly attracted by each others personalities. Driss has this cool way of breeze through life's adversities, while Phillipe, although really tight about his feelings, needs help even to write a love letter. When Driss bursts into his life, not only he starts to open up but also frees himself from his own fears, which in my humble opinion limits him more than his illness. As collateral damage, Driss also changes the whole attitude of the other caretakers and employees that work on Phillipe's mansion.The jokes and gags are funny without being Farrelly-like, and help to ease the burden of telling a history of a man that needs help to do basically everything, which could be very boring (as it must be to quadriplegics in real life). But the movie is so awesome that halfway through it you start to forget about Phillipe not being able to do anything by himself and start to focus on the intricate relationship of this two superb guys.This is a must see as words can't described what you'll feel when you watch it.",The Intouchables

Think Rain Man, I am Sam and so forth. My wife wanted to watch it and I bought it for her as a gift and to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised.First of all...I do not understand French...but I won't watch dubbed films. So we watched it in French with English subtitles. The humour does come across, although I'm sure I missed a bit of it. Referring specifically to some possibly French or Parisian in-jokes.The flow of the movie was good, the translated script funny - even witty at times. The acting was better than what you generally expect from your standard Hollywood movie.What I did like about Driss's character is that he doesn't dance around the fact that his new boss is a paraplegic...at all. The bond that evolves between the Philippe & Driss is brought across genuinely...for the most part. I think a 90 minute movie will have a tough time to bring across the core of the relationship between these two characters, but they actors and the directors do a good job.Overall it's a movie to watch and feel good about yourself, whilst at the same time you are reminded to appreciate the things you have; served with a healthy dose of humour, a dash or two of romance and a smidgen of those earnest, emotional realities of life. A feel-good movie, one can actually feel good about having watched.Cheers, OlivierZ",The Intouchables

Omar Sy was great at his performance, of rude African Dris who came into the mansion and changed his daily life buy also changed the life of quadriplegic millionaire Phillipe, and brought this story to the whole new level.

However, I just couldn't stop watching it after that 20 minutes. It was warm, delightful, and funny from the very beginning. So I watched most of it that night... and finished it the next day.During our French discussion, people started talking about the stereotypical representation of race and class, like how Philippe is a white rich guy who is only fond of high art while Driss is a funky low class dude with a big heart. I found these criticism unnecessary and too political for a comedy film. These representations of the main characters aren't offensive, and the friendship and feelings are real and touching in the movie. It successfully tells a story that relaxes you, moves you, warms you, and most of all, makes you laugh. I think that is the movie's main job and the job is done very well.",The Intouchables

I recommend if you want a fun night with a good film . Omar Sy known to be a comical mix knew his comic talent with that of being serious and a very endearing character . This film based on a true story is touching . The story of a paralyzed man seeking an endearing one to look after him and a man of unemployed city that does not work, but this encounter will change everything .

I really loved the environment and the outstanding performance by Omar Sy and François Cluzet! The second time, I thought it was even better! All the details and the story itself.and the expressions of François Cluzet, is really breathtaking! He deserves an Oscar for his performance!(!!!) and I think the movie itself is worth an Oscar for 'Best film', 'best actor(s)', 'best photo' and 'best director'!

I never would have thought at film about a quadriplegic man, forming a friendship with an unusual caretaker of sorts, would remind me of the beauty of foreign cinema. It is nuanced, witty, unpredictable and true artistic/creative expression. It is also quite humorous, adding lightness and hope to the situation at hand. What the characters seem to lack in terms of life circumstances is certainly made up for, and carefully shown, in a new and inspiring light. It left me thinking about how different we all are, on the inside, and within relative contexts.Absolutely a gem of a film; one of the best I've ever seen.",The Intouchables

I wish I would have seen this movie in theaters, but better late than never. The movie will make you laugh, touch your heart, and remember how beautiful, precious, wonderful, and lucky we are being human. The actors are outstanding. The photography and filming is breathtaking at times. But, for the most part, the message is delivered with perfect timing. I love french new wave filming, and although I saw this in subtitles, the actors magically invoke the essence of ""Intouchables""...the human heart.Strongly recommend watching this movie with the family >>> PG-13",The Intouchables

And I love how 'together' you feel with the characters, its so touching, true to life and honest, not sugarcoating life like other films and I adore the laughs, not too much so that it becomes a stupid comedy film but EXACTLY the right amount to make this movie what it is.

501,karolisjablonskis-26212,Good film,9,4 August 2019,"This movie is a modern day phenemenon. Spawning multiple remakes in a very short amount of time. Just last year The Upside hit theaters. It is interesting because I don't really think this film is anything super special. Its competent and enjoyable, but nothing that truly impresses.The two lead characters of the film, played by François Cluzet and Omar Sy have a interesting chemistry between them and it is well acted, but the film suffers from having a mega rich person as the lead character. There are tons of people who have terribly crippling physical ailments that are also poor, that don't have the resources to have anything in the world they wish, that would be much more interesting stories. The only poverty and struggling we see through the film is Sy's character, but it is grossly underused, instead having him live the high life for the majority of the film.The film also tends to shy away from the hard hitting depression that afflicts physically disabled people. Even looking at the real life person the film was based off of would show that he attempted suicide by wrapping and oxygen tube around his neck. I feel like it is important to illustrate these emotions and feelings more effectively in films like these.Despite all this there are some really funny moments and a real genuine charm from the leads to be found. Sy has a better performance than anyome else in the film, but I would say all parties do a good job. The dancing scene later on in the film is incredibly endearing and the soundtrack of the film is a blast.",The Intouchables
502,gribanisrine,Total difference can wholeness !!,9,26 January 2019,""" Intouchables "" is one of the few French movies that have gone international. Although it have been 8 years (2011) after it was published, this legend is still getting popular since then.This movie was an adaptation of the autobiographic tale of one of the writers; "" Le second souffle "" of Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo. It was promoted under the quote: ' Sometimes you have to reach into someone's else's world to find what's missing in your own', it gives a good introduction.François CLUZET's and Omar SY's performance was a huge plus, it had a stellar cast that's best way to describe it. François played the role of a man who had a paragliding accident and become a quadriplegic, who hires a young man -Omar- to be his caregiver.Most biography movies are documentaries while Untouchable is a drama-comedy movie. Despite the large amount of goofs in it and it poor production creativity, the film has such great scenario including tiny details about the characters life and background, as well as acts reflecting their personalities. All the previous, makes this film have a balanced features to be an amazing movie.Personally, I believe this is a master piece that must be watched. It will make you laugh and also cry, but more importantly is the moral it will give you. One thing that I am sure about is: you would not have any regrets watching it.",The Intouchables

507,costounet2-1,Simply amazing,10,12 May 2012,"I'm 21 and have lived in France nearly all my life. My cousin recommended this film to me and when I saw that Omar Sy was one of the main actors, I just laughed. For those of you who don't know, Omar Sy is one half of a famous Canal + sketch comedy show called Omar & Fred. To sum it up, it is very light hearted, even silly, comedy. However, to see him perform at this level and with such ease simply amazed me. The relationship & chemistry created between the two characters in the film would make you believe that Omar & François Cluzet were best friends in real life.François Cluzet is also excellent in this film. To a certain extent, his performance reminds me a bit of Dustin Hoffman's in Rain Man. This role shows how versatile he is as an actor. The last film I saw him in was ""Ne Le Dis à Personne"" (Tell No One) and his role in that is, literally, the complete opposite, yet he pulls off both wonderfully.I have seen my fair share of ""touching"" movies but this completely blew me away.

I am really happy that I decided to watch it again this way. Actors are amazing (Driss my favorite), the film made me smiling almost all the time until the end. But the original voice of the actors gives you the greatest impressions!
The Intouchables is a gorgeous film, that's shows really great story of good friends. When I was waching it my emotions were absolutely different: from laughing to crying, and that why I love that movie.

522,gamine462000,racism may lay in the eye of the beholder,9,11 December 2011,"First of all, excuse my French. But kind of bull***t are North American viewers seeing when they see that movie?Sorry to disappoint the people who think that movie offensive to Black people, but French people are far from dumb and racist. Are you saying that all these people with all kind of origins who laughed out loud at the screening are wrong? So are the Japanese jury who gave it 2 awards.Yes, The original guy was Arabic and Omar is black. But the directors knew him and wanted to work with him again (his show on the Canal + channel is quite hilarious), maybe they shouldn't have. Yes, they should have taken a white guy, so Omar wouldn't have played the part because of the colour of his skin and American viewers wouldn't be shocked what do you think? From the NA reviews I've read, the fact that the Black guy serves the white one is shocking. From what I saw a lot of white people didn't feel the the position to be demeaning. As for me I didn't see a Black guy but a guy from the poor suburbs of Paris. The clichés are unfortunately true, in Paris suburb 10% of the population are living in overcrowded accommodations. Life can be pretty hard when you have nothing to look forward to. So yes, Driss enjoys the fact that he's got his own bathtub, he likes playing the tough guy, and so on. He won't become a fan of classical music and ballet. It's real life, not Disneyland!! I think this is the way the American remake will be (can't wait not to see it!)Personally when I watched the movie, I just wanted a laugh and I did!!

The Intouchables, based on true story, is a classic comedy blended with high- octane drama and brave performances. The introductory scene is itself is so impressive that you get engrossed in the film right from the beginning. Hats off to the director to develop the each character effectively which blemishes with film scenario. The script is so tight that you would not feel bore for even a single second in the film. Couple of scenes are hilarious in the movie. The scene where Driss dances to his own tune on Philippe birthday party , the scene where Driss warns Bastein to stay away from Philippe's daughter are just like icing on the cake. Even the emotional scenes have shot so well coupled with beautiful background score. Coming to the performances , I was totally floored by Omar Sy's gallant performance. He makes the film alive the moment he steps in the scene. His care-free , straight from the heart , funny-loving character will stay with you even after leaving the theater for sometime. François Cluzet puts in powerhouse performance as Philippe. It takes guts to sit on chair through the entire film and still act well with just the expressions. Brilliant !!!",The Intouchables

Driss (Omar Sy) is a man out on parole for robbery, who applies for the job of Philippe's caregiver only so he can be rejected and get a signature on his application for unemployment benefits. As Philippe interviews one boring job applicant after another, we begin to understand that he needs not only physical help but someone to cheer him up.

However, the overall feeling I'm having after having watched this rather lengthy masterpiece; is a calm and thoughtfulness that I haven't felt since I watched the almost six hour long Italian film, La meglio gioventù.One would think that the main two characters, Philippe and Driss, had been living together for 20 years before the recording of this movie. The chemistry between the two of them is something extraordinary. Something intouchable.Together, they complement each other in a way that is unusual in today's films. Driss, who embodies a ""'pragmatic'"" African french youth with lots of temperament and a great deal of emotional luggage. Philippe, being in the state that he is, can't use his body language the way that Driss can. He has to rely on his facial expressions. Something he is mastering very well.I didn't want the film to end. I wanted it to continue as a TV series, one can come home to and watch after a stressful day at work.I don't want to say anything more about this lovely 112 minute long touching movie without spoiling the experience for the ones that still haven't seen it.But, who could not love this one?

I love movies that are based on true stories, they always remind me of the reality that is beyond my reach. This movie has a very unique story and a magnificent moral of it. The back stories are very interesting and the intersecting of all of them is very well done. I've always been a fan of good soundtracks and this is one of them. The soundtrack has a very important role in the movie and it follows and emphasizes the emotions that actors bring to the screen.

533,RoodBlackmail,A moving story that make you laugh & cry - Du rire aux larmes,10,13 November 2011,"When I went to see Intouchables I am expecting to see a good movie because the buzz in France about it right now is pretty unbelievable, to the point that a 10:30am screening was full (10 days after the release), I left the theater happy because I didn't see a good movie but the best movie I have ever seen. I loved Nakache & Toledano previous movies, for me they represent what French cinema does the best these kinds of comedies that always put you on the verge of tears while laughing at jokes that feel so real. With Intouchables they put that characteristic even further; the movie is FULL of jokes and it also treat one of the most serious subject. François Cluzet is at the top of his art, the best (French) actor of his generation for sure. Omar Sy delivers a spot on performance, I particularly enjoyed his melancholic look, you can just see the emotions in his eyes. Their on-screen friendship is probably one of the best I have seen and we can summarize it with these words from the movie ""These guys they have no pity"" a friend of Philippe-talking about Driss- to which Philippe answers ""You know sometimes he hands me the phone because he forgot"". Driss forget that Philippe can't move his legs, his arms, can't feel anything that is under is neck and this is priceless for Philippe. In a world where everybody looks at him like an handicapped, Driss' behavior is more that a fresh air, it's a reason to live for, to think that maybe there are others people like him, that can see further that his wheelchair. The music is also spot on, just enough to make you feel the emotion without being too much. I really hope it's going to win lots of Césars. It's really going to be a tie this year for the best actor performance between Omar Sy, François Cluzet and Jean Dujardin (The Artist). I predict an American remake in a few years, you know Hollywood...",The Intouchables

I do feel compelled however to comment on the film simply because I have not enjoyed a movie as much as this in a long time, especially a foreign language film which is very much a minority in my viewing history. It's a wonderful heartwarming story of two people from polar opposite walks of life who form the strongest of bonds living in each other's pockets and it is also at times hilarious and I have not laughed so much for as long as I can remember.

I have read that they want to remake this movie in America, however, I don't see why they should do such a thing. It is perfect exactly the way it is. Nothing about the movie needs to be changed one bit. Absolutely Oscar-worthy - saddens me that it was made in 2011 and this is the first I had heard of it.

The movie showcases the turmoil, a quadriplegic faces in his life and shows how little things in his life bring about great joy. It also stresses on the point that how the small things we generally ignore, provide with relief n happiness in times of adversity when focused upon. The acting in the movie is brilliant. Francois Cluzet has given an outstanding performance as the quadriplegic. As far as Omar Sy is considered, I couldn't say he was acting at all. It was as though I was actually seeing things happen in real life as they unfold.

541,sam-parry,Realistic Grandeur,9,7 July 2012,"The Intouchables begins with the disoriented action of an elderly white aristocrat being driven at thrilling pace through Paris in a Maserati by a strikingly tall (Omar Sy), as they devilishly evade arrest following a high-speed police pursuit. The narrative then returns in time to establish this relationship, which cleverly exploits the 'Unlikely friendship' cliché which would otherwise be presumed by the audience as tired before commencement.The acting of both Francis and Omar combines to carry the realism and humanity upon which this magnificent film is grounded in. The incredibly dynamic portrayal of a mutual sense of humour, which acted as the primary catalyst between Philippe and Driss is testament to the level of artistry deserving of all awards they received for their performance.Ludovico Einaudi has done a magnificent job at creating a score that not only sounds realistic itself, but brings classical profundity and a very French grandeur in to contrast with the very down-to-earth themes of friendship and raw human nature. Cinematically flawless, the urban landscape of Driss' hometown becomes equally visually appealing as the aristocratic parties and over-decorated sweeping hallways of Philippe's mansion. Long-lens portraiture on wet Paris streets with dancing Bokeh consistently delivers as cinematography explores both the romance and cold edginess of the city's colour palate. While The Intouchables delivers in all sections of production and narrative value, the story lacked legitimacy and depth when delving into the life of Driss, and at times felt slightly tokenistic and perhaps too evidently conceived from high-budget production. Despite the lack of a grungy social representation that maybe I wrongly expected, I vote this film as just short of absolute brilliance.",The Intouchables

543,the_coolest_girl_in_town,"This movie is a problem, let me tell you why.",2,19 June 2013,"I'm not saying that every movie has to be a political melting pot or a petri dish for ideological views and discussions, but ""The Inouchables"" had a great potential. It missed it's promising but most of all IMPORTANT role to be one of those movies. We have Philippe (François Cluzet), the white, older, sophisticated man with this ridiculously large (inherited) wealth, who's hurt from previous bumps in the road of life. Nothing wrong with a rich, wounded, and above all crippled man. We all have our problems. And we have Driss (Omar Sy), the black ghetto man-boy who didn't really want the job as Philippe's assistant in the first place, but just wanted to enjoy himself being out of jail. The stereotypical pot-smoking negro from the slums, without a care for the civilized society, the arts or manners. So the uncivilized black man teaches the sad old man how to live, all with a cheeky smile on his little face. They get high, he almost beats up the neighbor, he laughs at the paintings in the art gallery and how expensive they are, he consistently hits on a woman clearly not interested, and hires some happy, happy prostitutes. Nothing wrong at all. Before you get though the first half of the film, you have been given examples of the three pillars of french culture; prostitution, colonialism and insane wealth. As a movie, it's half decent. Good actors, some cliché but witty lines, and that's about it. The story is flat, the directing is nothing to admire, but the real problem is it's political blindness. The Omar's character is from the beginning a strong contrast to the order and dignity of Philippe's life, but in such a savage way it's borderline racist. I have three major issues I'd like to bring up. ""Work? I din't know you had humour"" is an example of the negative stereotype this movie projects upon Driss, as a lazy welfare tic. He enjoys weed and hookers, his family is harsh and riddled with kids and bastards, and all the people in the suburb he's from are never seen without a joint. It's simply a bit too racist. But of course, he eventually changes a bit and becomes like, well almost a (white) human being! Problem number two. Never have I seen such contrast in two character's background and wealth, never have I seen such a clash in classes, and never have I seen the issue of class diversity being so vastly ignored as in this movie. Never once is the question of injustice borough up. How can one man have so much money, estate and freedom simply by being born, and how can one man have so little that he, and his obnoxious twelve-or-so-year old brother, turned to criminal activities? To give the story some depth, they tried to arrange a complex scenario where Driss have to save his brother from going wrong, but they handled it clumsily, and without actual dialog. It's like it doesn't even matter that poverty roars around Driss, it's fine and dandy now as he's in his private suite and walks around being tactless in the high society. Here, smoke another joint, make a painting and sell it, but don't use the money it to help your starving family. It's a couple of too many loose ends not being tied to his roots, and the REAL problem; that society and social diversity has formed working class suburbs mostly populated by minimum-wage immigrants. Problem number three is the rotten view on women throughout these 110 insufferable minutes . First of all, it doesn't pass the Bechdel test more than it has two or three named female character. There are many examples to show the complete lack of respect for women, eg how Driss consists of hitting on a woman clearly not interested in him, using disgusting and cheesy pick up lines. Womens looks are very centered, the daughter is portrayed as a spoiled bitch (although her behaviour does not differentiate so much from Driss'), all other women are portrayed only as caretakers, and most deranged of all, the two protagonists use prostitutes excessively. When you watch this movie, have common sense and the right perspective. Don't get fooled by the immoderate hype around this movie, don't get charmed by the fact that it's ""based on a true story"", in fact you should realize that makes it even more insufferable to watch. I had to fight the urge to stop watching all the way through, fighting the urge to scream at Driss and Philippe that they need to take some academic courses in sociology, social economics, gender studies, colonization history and intersectionalism. Usually, I don't demand such political fairness in the movies I watch, but this here is a perfect example of how the racism, sexism and upper class mentality can survive in the 21st century. We don't need this movie. The Swedish title for this movie can be roughly translated to "" An unexpected friendship"", and I find it to be a lie. Hugely expected and predictable, this movie blows life to outdated values and dusty clichés o tell a story. Think about it for another round, and make something better while I try to reassemble my now shattered respect for french movies and culture.",The Intouchables

The beginning really got me into it and I just wanted to see what would happen later in the movie. It did not take long before I actually felt that I was in their lives. From start to the end I was just stunned by all emotions this movie gave out.I had never thought that I was both going to laugh and cry at the same time, just to mention I am not that guy who easily get affected by a movie. This was something really impressing! To all out there who not have seen this movie, I really recommend doing it. You may be thinking this is a another boring drama, but after seeing it I can tell it is more than drama.

This is the best movie I have seen in years and it made me laugh, it made me sad, it made simply a better person I can say. I will say I was little skeptic at the beginning because I usually watch American/English movies mostly and I usually don't like non-English movies, I found them almost every time boring and I lose interest very soon, but this one kept me watching without a brake. Its just a WONDERFUL story about friendship and courage of two men that came from totally different backgrounds, but they fit together in this movie PERFECTLY. I gotta say Omar Sy performance was Oscar worthy, he was just great, he made me laugh through the whole movie and he was incredible, and François Cluzet, what can I say about him, he was just great, playing such hard role, I think no one would have done better job then him. Two of them together carried the whole movie and made it PERFECT. The story was based on true events and I believe that fact made the movie even better because it has one thing that most other movies don't have and that is REALITY. When I think about this movie and these two guys and I realize somewhere in the world they exist it makes so happy I just want to be a better person, better friend, better man...

Phillipe is paralyzed and needs help to do everything, but everyone that works for him only gives him pity, when he decides to hire Driss he knows that he won't get pity. Driss treats him like he would treat any other person, and that's the start of a very good friendship.This is one of my absolute favorites of all time, and on my top 10 list of greatest movies ever.

This is a wonderful film about the relation between two persons who you never could think would be friends. Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet is the perfect choice of actors. What really touched me was the sort of honesty their relation proceeded in and that its not always the conventional way who is the best way to go, you always have to understand that all people are and should be treated as who they are and not by a manual.The change in Omar Sy,s character is wonderful to watch and he, well deserved, won a Cesar for hes performance.All the characters in the film are very likable and i strongly recommend this movie for all ages, this is a feel-good movie with a ll the right stuff in it!",The Intouchables

It's a crowd- pleaser, very funny at times, and a rousing testament to the transformative power a single friendship.

This completely blew me away. A novel and incredible story which was presented in a compelling way. Had me crying with laughter and sadness in equal measure. Brilliant. The characters are rich and deep, benefiting from there being so few of them and tell a fantastic and emotional story. The acting is sublime, with both characters experiencing ecstasy to misery in equal measure. The plot is not particularly deep or fast paced, but with characters and a story as powerful as this, it needn't be. There is no doubt I will be exploring more of what foreign language has to offer, and have lately explored and been impressed by 'Dans La Maison' - although not anywhere near the standard of this film.

559,Mahrynn,It will leave you with a smile on your face and tears in your eyes.,8,29 January 2012,"This movie is a beautiful story about friendship and everything it can bring you. It is about appreciating each other's differences. It is about how wonderful life is.When Philippe, a rich, middle aged quadriplegic is looking for a new person to assist him, he meets Driss,a young man from the Parisian suburbs, who is there only to get a paper signed. Philippe finds himself amused by him, who seems like he couldn't care less about anything, and decides, as a joke, to hire him for a month, betting that he won't even hold the position for two weeks. But Philippe, finally experiencing being treated like a normal being again after is paragliding accident as Driss takes care of him, quite clumsily in the beginning (which will lead to a few funny scenes), will find Driss becoming his best friend and making him enjoy life again.As for the comments on this movie stating it's racist; which I've seen here and on other websites, I really don't understand them. Yes, Driss is black and he is assisting a white person; that's as far as it goes. Yes, I think he is portrayed realistically. A lot of people living in the Parisian suburbs are of foreign descent, most of them dislike classical music, a lot have troubles paying their bills, a lot don't understand the world in which the character of Philippe is living in. That's just the way it is. The movie is far from criticizing that. The whole point of the movie is about mixing up two different worlds, take the best out of the two, and make two men better. Driss will become less violent, more mature; Philippe will learn to enjoy the simple pleasures of life and to let go...My rating of 8 on 10 is because the movie sometimes gets a little cheesy, but overall it is a very good movie. Funny, sometimes sad, and ends on a really touching note that brought a tear in my eye. The whole cast was great, Omar Sy that I had never seen in a movie before does great and François Cluzet is very touching.",The Intouchables

The jokes are ""to the point"" and hilarious and that's what makes this film stand out from others with similar drama subjects.

I don't think the color of the actor should be taken as a main fact, this film is about mutual exchange, not stereotypes on the color.I would recommend it since the story is well developed, and although it can be a little long sometimes you go out of the theater thinking ...

And this film teaches the viewers more than that: to have hope, to be free of your inhibitions (physical, mental, economic). I can appreciate that more since it is very rare in Indian cinema, we love being tragic and our films excel in creating pity for people who are suffering. Oh, but this film.... it touches you deeply and that too without bringing tears in our eyes, but a wide smile on your face. And it's not just about helping an invalid to carry on with life, it is much deeper. Both of the central characters see each other as one, where Driss sees Philippe as a rich invalid but doesn't treat him as one; he has no pity for Philippe, which is exactly something a person fed up of being an invalid needs. Philippe knows that Driss is an invalid too, socially and economically, but he doesn't lecture him on virtues. Both of them try to push each other in doing something they will never do by themselves.

You have to be careful, however, as once you've watched the movie for the first time you will not be able to keep your mind off it and the beautiful music makes it even more difficult...

580,teo-454-985173,Total positive energy,8,20 August 2012,"Ι never expected that I would like so much a ""French"" film. But from the first minutes it got my total attention. What really surprised me is that for a drama, the story goes really fast. To be honest this is because of Omar Sy. Wherever he appears, you really want to absorb his energy.I really believe that the whole meaning of the film is exactly Sy's energy. We can see how someone with positive energy can totally change your life even if you are in the worst position like a quadriplegic person.Of course the film does not reflect the majority of quadriplegics (don't think they are that rich), so we cannot really see the difficulties that these people are going through. But the fact that it is a true story gives hope to everyone for sure.I really think everyone should watch it.",The Intouchables

The dialogue is excellent, with many unexpected responses, especially in the beginning. The characters are exceptional, especially in their social contrast--but when the inevitable social comparisons are made, they are either handled with genuine surprize, or else expertly buffooned. Some of the obvious exchanges are handled so well, and so unexpectedly that there are guffaws from the audience. The story is wonderfully touching, without any syrup. That it is a true story makes it even more surprizing and appealing. I don't know which other contemporary movie I would rate a perfect 10. Well done.",The Intouchables

The action is well contoured and it has a great storyline. I can just imagine how hard it is for Francois to perform in such role, a role that makes you at the first sight to think that it is an easy role to play because it do not requires the body acting so much, but exactly for this reason, Cluzet must to focus on the other cards that he must play in this movie. Omar Sy leads to the driving scene, where happens a beautiful part of the movie, a part which is accompanied by Ludovico Einaudi's track.

So I was pretty much astonished to find myself watching a truly marvellous and entertaining movie.It's a unique storyline which is apparently based on true life. The two guys at the centre of the plot keep bouncing jokes off each other leaving you in fits of laughter. But it's not just a comedy; there's a lot of sad, moving and beautiful stuff in there as well.Script, direction, filming and acting are all of the highest standard.This is a very sensitive treatment of human relationships; sad, funny and involving.

Its intimate and some of the jokes are close to the bone, however this is what makes this film so great, and it is what you would expect the lives in this film to be like.The acting is outstanding, the jokes extremely funny and the story is truly heart warming.

A wonderful and emotional story about Philippe, a rich quadriplegic who requires a live-in caregiver. One the plus side, the movie is funny and sensitive at the same time. In this role Omar keeps his trademark hilarious attitude. He gets the job to work for Philippe, played by 'Francois Cluzet'.Philippe loves Cedric's behaviour and attitude (Omar Sy) because he treats him like a normal person without mercy or sympathetic. In this movie you will discover a story of love and close friendship. Moreover, this movie is taken from a true story which make the plot even more real and attractive. Go and see this film. You won't be disappointed.",The Intouchables

The actors play a splendid role to depict the life of the real paralysed man and real carer.I only watched this last night and i watched the original - in french. It is a very recent film filmed in Paris and i find this film suits any watcher for the reason that it contains both high-up, posh lifestyles compared to ""chavs"" smoking and speeding Maserati's.

I liked how the ""helper"" changed his life so much, made him laugh and enjoy so many things! It was really touching how they mad one-another a better man, and added quality to their lives! It's one of the stories mad out from real life, which, for me, is the best material to construct such a good movie. I will definitely watch for similar movies from the European scene like this one!

The soundtrack is solid with dance-able tunes from Earth, Wind and Fire (one of Driss' favorite bands) as well as classical music from Bach and Mozart (Philippe's preference).

As one go deeper into the movie, it gives an understanding of how life truly is and how people sometimes are not what they really seem. 'The Intouchable' is truly a fun, entertaining and meaningful movie.The actors are great and unlike other movies I have watched recently, there is no over acting on their part. Every character adds to the colorfulness of the movie and the movie obviously was sure how the plot would go from beginning to end like most great novels. Since it is based on a true story, it makes you wonder how two people from two totally different world find a friend in such condition. I do not know how much this movie achieved, award wise but I am positive, it is a movie for all people who watch movies for all reasons.

598,anavic_carrillo,the adventure of friendship,10,6 June 2013,"The French movie, the intouchables, is a comedy about a disabled aristocrat named Phillip and his encounter with Driss, who is a young man who comes from the outsides of Paris and is fresh out of jail. Phillipe decides to hire Driss as his helper even though Driss does not have any education or experience. Together, they go on an adventure that will make them find the value of friendship even though they are totally different characters, they learn to live and see life from a different perspective and at the same time complement each other perfectly. The directors of this marvelous story are: Eric Toledano, who is forty to years old and Oliver Nakache who is 40 years old. Both of them, who have known each other since the beginning of the 1990's, were born in France and did their first their first short film in 1995. The directors were inspired to do this movie in 2003, after watching a documentary about the life of Phillippe Pozzo di Brogo. Eight years later, they decided to adapt this story and create the movie named ""The Intouchables"" I will now analyze several cinematic aspects of the movie and whether they succeed or fail in these within the movie. The title of the movie is suitable and adapts perfectly to the movie because thee friends are inseparable even though they are absolutely different. When they meet, they find happiness and become comfortable with themselves. Hey complement each other because Phillip does not like a person that have pity on him, which makes them the perfect duo due to the fact that Driss treats him like any other person. Phillipe, after a long time of not doing so, laughs and smiles thanks to Driss's personality. On the other hand, Driss finds another way to live; he learns to be honorable and to work hard, to earn things for himself without stealing others' objects. When they are together, they are unstoppable, intouchable. At the same time that the title adapts to the movie, the cast is totally adequate. Omar Sy interprets Driss, a tall and big man who is funny and always smiling. This creates contrast with Francois Cluzet, who interprets Phillipe as a serious and elegant man. The clothing is another success of the cast from the movie. These reveal the different characterizations of each character. When the movie starts, Driss's clothing are scarce and in bad state but as the movie goes one, his appears to have more clothes and also more sense of fashion thanks to his new job and new lifestyle. Phillipe's clothing is elegant all throughout the movie due to the fact that people that know him expect to see him dressed that way because of his social status. He also dresses according to his age and gender. Phillipe's maids have an elegant uniform to work with, and his daughter has a tendency to dressing inappropriately for her age. Driss's family dress with dark, loose and old clothes, which reflects the type of life they have thanks to the society they live in. The script is simple, clear and adequate. Each character has its own way to talk and express themselves according to their characterization. For example: Driss has a more informal way to talk than Phillipe. Music is not a central point or focus of the movie, but when there is music, it is wonderful and helps create the perfect environment for the movie. When Driss and Phillipe are paragliding, the music is harmonious but moving at the same time, it gives a sense of happiness and adventure, which is the exact situation they are going through. Another moment in which the movie is important is in Phillipe's birthday party. The band is professional and present famous songs that make the audience feel identified with the movie. It makes us remember why music is so important in peoples' lives. The sound was low and high according to the situation the character where experiencing. On Phillipe's birthday, the music is loud, as if it were the one talking, instead of the characters. On the other hand, when Driss is leaving Phillipe's house, it is low and what is loud is actually the rain. The scenography, along with the photography is excellent. It is different in each place including Paris, houses of different characters, mountains, etc. The different environments are perfectly portrayed. The photography is simple. The framing is usually from the hips to the top of the actor or the whole actor. One can rarely see the characters and their whole surroundings, which creates emphasis on the characters and the situation they are in. The movie achieves teaching us, through infortune and humor, that everyone is different and we need to help one another because not everyone has the same privileges or problems. Also, that we need to enjoy life to the fullest because you only live once. We have to be happy with what he have and not with what we do not have. I recommend this movie to everyone out there. It is entertaining for people of all ages and genres. It maintains everyone entertained and interested every second and at the same it teaches a great lesson to the public. There is romance, suspense, friendships and a lot more.",The Intouchables

It shows you how life can change at any moment, and that we should value our lives because that's the most important thing we have. At one moment we can live on streets and barely survive, be addicted to drugs, just because we think that we are worth nothing and that we can't possibly help anyone else. But there is always at least one person that needs our help, no matter how much we think there's not. That one person can change us and make us better. And we can do that same thing to that person just by being there for them and helping them live their lives. Just by making someone else happy, that can make us happy too. And this movie is the proof of it, at one moment it made me cry as a baby, and at the other moment it made me smile like I never smiled before, and it made me happy.

Both actors were great and especially Omar Sy who was just delightful to watch. But in my opinion it was just a nice, sweet movie nothing more. I think that is very easy to make audience 'emotionally attached' to a film that has to do with a quadriplegic and his life and this is why I believe that it was a safe path for the production and there were not something new, something different, something that can make you wonder and admire the creativity of director or writer.",The Intouchables

608,matanelrox,A feel-good Hollywood movie disguised as a french movie,7,3 April 2016,"Let me start off by mentioning what I liked about this movie. The casting was great, and both Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet did outstanding jobs, and the relationship between them seems natural. It was also a very funny movie- though watching with subtitles, i couldn't help but fall for Dris's charm and laugh out loud. Unfortunately, the above-mentioned just isn't enough to qualify this movie for being considered great. I expected a sensitive, understated French film- what i witnessed was nothing but a feel-good Hollywood movie with little to no substance. Where was the point of conflict? Philip and Dris's relationship, which was- I believe- the point of the movie, suffered no breaking points, no hardship. There were a few points of conflict in Dris's life, which never really resolved themselves. In addition, the frequent use of jump cuts and short takes, while useful for comedic effect, blocked this movie from being anything but a group of amusing anecdotes about the relationship between invalid and reluctant caretaker and finally between two friends. There was very little substantial storyline, replaced by various amusing scenes. I mentioned before that this was a feel-good Hollywood movie, and that in my opinion is the worst part. The film was full of unrealistic scenarios and characters, a sort of la la land where very little struggle is revealed to us. Look, I did enjoy Intouchables. But I don't think it deserves to be in the IMDb top 100, and I believe it was a wasted opportunity.",The Intouchables

This is the type of movie that you don't want to end. The humor, the compassion and relationship are a perfect fit. It's a bummer that the majority of people in the US don't like movies with subtitles. They are missing out. While the writers add characters outside of the two leads, they keep the focus on the plot and keep it fun and serious at the same time. I watched it again tonight. The movies I watch more than once are far and few between. This movie will be on my shelf one day soon. I liked everything about it. I am just trying to write enough to post it.

France has a valuable stories and author and producers can use them to make a good films.however we can see this in many movies like Les Miserables and ... . but i wish french use them to make movies in future.

Such an inspiring story that teaches you that enjoying life is the best thing we can do.

Because of his old caretaker has left, he is searching for a new one. A lot of experienced men introduce oneself, but he decided to adjust Driss (Omar Sy), a black nonworker from a suburb whitout any experience in taking care of somebody, who only wanted a denial for the employment bureau. Nobody can understand, why Philippe chose Driss. But in the course of time there is a very special relationship between them. This movie has everything, what a great movie has to have in my opinion: humor, emotionality, cut to the quick, is based on a true story and last but not least there are very great actors. Omar Sy and François Cluzet deliver a fantastic performance. In addition I like black people. All these points makes the movie to my favorite movie.

Along this unexpected journey they are able to build a friendship that is different from many others but with a bond that is stronger than most.The film was officially released in France on November 11, 2011 and has grossed $166 million in France and $447 million worldwide, which made it the second biggest box office hit in France. It has also won many awards for Best Foreign Film, Best Actor (Omar Sy), Best European Film, Outstanding International Motion Picture, and Best Foreign-Language film. ""The Intouchables"" is one of the most beautiful films I have seen not because of the crazy computer graphics, insane effects, or intense editing, but because of the simplicity and deeper meaning behind it. The directors/writers, Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, are able to capture the hearts of the audience with each choice they made in this movie. In the script, the dialogues of both Philippe and Driss were typical but not predictable. Philippe's dialogue was stereotypical to a wealthy white man who lives an over the top luxurious lifestyle, but rather than seeming spoiled and selfish, his character came across as very sincere and passionate. Driss' dialogue was stereotypical to a poor tough guy from the ghetto, but on top of that, his character came across as very loving and caring. The dialogue made it very apparent about the two worlds that Philippe and Driss were from, but it also created a bond between the two. Toledano and Nakache were able to stereotype these characters and yet still defy these stereotypes, making the characters very unique and memorable.The dialogue was not the only thing that showed the invisible line that separated Philippe and Driss' world. With the help of the cinematographers, Nakache and Toledano were able to make creative choices that displayed the two separate worlds that Philippe and Driss lived in. The low- key lighting in Driss' territory showed that even though he is fully functioning and healthy, he is still trapped by his past and background. The high-key lighting in Philippe's home showed that he has all the freedom in the world because of his wealth, yet his disability keeps him prisoner of his own freedom. Even the costuming showed how their two worlds were separated with Driss always wearing a hoodie and a pair of jeans and Philippe always wears a nice suit or knitted sweater. Little details like lighting and costuming that Toledano and Nakache added were simple yet genius. It was the little things that made this film very beautiful but still relatable with the audience. Although we feel this separation that Philippe and Driss have, they are still able to have this strong connection with each other that the audience is able to feel as well. When they are together high-key lighting consumes them showing that when they are together they can truly be free. The dialogues of the two, although they seemed to be polar opposites, were meshed together in such a natural way that made the whole movie flow and carry the story along. The chemistry between the actors also made each scene very emotional and brought the whole story to life. It was as if the actors weren't playing characters but were really living their roles and had the same bond that the characters had with each other. The small intimate scenes that showed this bond really touched me and overwhelmed me with emotions that I cannot explain.This film is able to defy all stereotypes and crush all thoughts we might have about movies under the genre of drama. It was not your typical sappy love story one would think of as a drama, but more of a refreshing take that was both comical yet meaningful. It really touched my heart and is a movie that really needs no other words to describe it other than awesome! There is nothing more I can say other than to just watch this movie and experience its entirety as a true work of art.",The Intouchables
615,craig-reilly-999-324925,An absolute gem of a film,10,12 May 2014,"Initially I turned my nose up at the thought of watching a film with subtitles, but my ignorant logic has been changed forever.For me this has to be one of the greatest feel good movies there has ever been. The acting and chemistry between François Cluzet and Omar Sy is supreme, and you feel it right from the moment the film begins.The direction of Eric Toledano is masterful, showing both men's backgrounds in such a way (subtle comedy, gripping drama, heart warming moments) you learn so much about them as individuals and how their feelings develop gradually for each other and their own families.With some real laugh out load moments, romance and action too, you really get everything with this movie.You would be foolish (like I was) to pass this off as just another foreign film with subtitles. An amazing film that has become my most recommended movie for others to see. 10 out of 10",The Intouchables
616,drivenmattgarcia,Thought-Provoking,9,26 May 2014,"This film is incredibly thought-provoking. The story features two very different human beings from very different environments that cross paths and discover a treasured relationship in the making. Philippe and Driss have two very different lifestyles - one a healthy, young man, the other a tetraplegic, aging man. Through the story-telling of these two soul-mates, the film studies the nature of human relationships and how this particular relationship brings two opposite personalities together to make each other happier as they learn about one another. The Intouchables made me think about my life from a broader perspective as far as my own environment(s), strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. I highly recommend this. Omar Sy's character is golden and he performs it with top quality.",The Intouchables
617,joelbearzerr,"""Pas d'bras, pas d'chocolate!""",9,13 June 2014,"I went into this film not really knowing what to see and was delighted. Its subtle humor and honesty are refreshing amid overly-cheesy movies, This is because it's actually based on a true story. Two men find friendship when everything in their respective cultures says otherwise. It showcases the vast socioeconomic differences between Driss and Philippe and how these barriers are overcome. When we think of Paris and France in general, we do not think of the slums outside the major cities, the poverty, and brokenness housed just outside the ""city of love."" This movie runs the gamut of emotions. The moments of tenderness and truth speckled between scenes of laughter and, sometimes tears. Overall, I thought this movie was eye opening, touching, funny, and thought provoking. Give this title a shot!",The Intouchables

I loved the character development throughout the movie, and thought the two main actors played their roles beautifully. See this movie. I do not think you will not be disappointed.I enjoyed the music as well. The dynamic way the characters changed and adapted to one another was portrayed with ease and flow. The actors seemed very comfortable in their roles, almost made you forget you were watching a movie.All in all, this is one of my top favorite films ever. So much emotion and so much to talk about afterward. It's simply beauty in simplicity.",The Intouchables

This was such an heart warming and real movie. A friend who watched it with me said that he forgot it was French (which is usually a language barrier not being French). It was an excellent portrayal of the impact kindness which is true and honest can have on a persons life. I loved the humor in the movie, it was so elegant. There are some moments that will stay with me forever. I loved the character development and how the characters preserve and increase each other's dignity. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys drama. But the humor in it made the very dramatic story light and sweet at times.",The Intouchables
621,d-matlock-1996,Breath of Fresh Air,10,14 August 2014,"Someone asked me to describe this masterpiece and I was at a loss of words and could only depict it as, ""a breath of fresh air."" As someone who does not speak French and had to read the movie in subtitles, this movie is still one of my top 10 favorite of all time. This film is truly amazing; I loved watching every second of the dynamic between these two characters. Some of the best on screen chemistry I've ever witnessed in a movie with truly heartfelt and hilarious moments. I love seeing how these two characters played off one another gave each other something. I could go on and on about how great everything in this movie is. It is difficult for me to comprehend how someone could dislike this movie, it has something for everyone. Yes, I understand it may not be entirely accurate to the real story of what happened, but at least for me I go into a film expecting liberties to be taken to enhance the quality of the film. Watching this movie in subtitles made it difficult for me to evaluate the performance these actors gave; however, it does not detract from this movie one bit as the relationship between these two characters is one that is exceeded by few, if none. For anyone who has not seen this movie, it is without a doubt one you cannot pass up! It remains one of all time favorites and it is considered a foreign film relative to me. I could ramble on forever and describe to you how I was smiling throughout almost this entire movie, or the feelings of happiness it brought upon me, but I leave you dear reader saying this; this work was a breath of fresh air. I adored it.",The Intouchables
622,diaradaisy,Short Review,7,27 April 2017,"Foreign Films are often disregarded when choosing a film to watch. Foreign Films can also be associated with 'black and white films' which tends to have a negative stigma with young people.On a lazy Sunday afternoon when I would be scrolling through the net looking for a flick I myself would ignore the foreign sector as I would want something light and that wouldn't require too much effort.I then came across 'The Untouchables' I started to watch and the first few minutes in I knew it was going to be a lifelong favourite of mine so I went downstairs and got a drink and snack and snuggled up in bed ready to enjoy now one of my favourite films.If anybody is wanting to get into foreign films this is one that will defiantly let you ease into the genre, I guarantee you'll enjoy it.

You just don't want it to ever end, it's amazing how it keeps making you think about your life and all the different worlds and visions around you! It's amazing to know it is based on a true story, what makes you feel that some of the characters could be your friends, your neighbors. You learn together with Driss, the simplest kind of guy, how to treat anybody as a normal person and appreciate the simple things of life. On the other hand Philippe shows you what it means being treated as an invalid, and also how to respect people regardless their appearance, habits or background.I would definitely regret if I died without having watched this masterpiece!

626,annazeng11,Untouchable,8,21 October 2014,"The French dramatic comedy, 'The Intouchables,' is the story of a wealthy quadriplegic male who hires a negligible criminal to be his caretaker. The story follows the development of their unconventional relationship and includes meaningful lessons pertaining to the social, yet superficial differences that continue to divide people of different status. This light-hearted and extremely sentimental film will engage and capture hearts of people of all ages.Directed by Oliver Nakache and Eric Toledano, natives of France, whose resume includes a series of French films such as Samba (2014), Tellement proches (2009), and Those Happy Days (2006). While these films are more than likely unheard of by most Americans, 'The Intouchables' managed to creep into American film society and was nominated for a Golden Globe in the category ""Best Foreign Language Film."" Furthermore, the film has earned $340 million, an all-time record for a foreign-language movie not made in the United States.The film sets itself apart from other European hits and is not based on a famous novel, such as The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Based on a real-life friendship, the directors tailored the film for wide appeal. And while the film does not mimic the same origin or approach as its counterparts, it proves to be a rare commodity: a film that almost everyone sees and enjoys.The film boasts no big-name actors, yet the duo proves to be nothing short of captivating. The opening scene in which Francois Cluzet's character, Phillippe, and Omar Sy's character, Driss, are involved in a late night pursuit by law enforcement is gripping and unpredictable—a clever hook that piques the audience interest in a seemingly unconventional pairing. However, the chemistry between the actors is the riveting personification of the mentor and the initiate.The story of the middle-aged widower, permanently injured in a paragliding accident, who chooses Driss, and ex-con, over better qualified candidates for the job as his caretaker—allowing the antics and pulling of the heart strings to commence.The film does its fair share of alternating between comedic and tear-jerking moments. Told he must help Phillippe void his bowels, he erupts, ""I'm not emptying the ass of a guy I don't know. Or even of a guy I do know. I don't empty anyone's ass, on principle."" Driss's initial attitude in the beginning of the film sets up what seems to be a predictable situation in which an individual of the lower class must care for and provide service to an individual of more aristocratic class. However, this seemingly predictable relationship is shattered as the film progresses and the development of the duo's relationship is mesmerizing. While it seems that Driss must overcome the bounds of his socioeconomic status and criminal past, it is Phillippe who has a great deal to learn from Driss.The film's evident exploitation of stereotypes adds to its remarks on social and moral commentary. The height at which the film touches on social commentary would not be as effective if it were not for the cultural clash between Phillippe and Driss. For example, Driss deems first-class art as laughable and opera and classical music tired at best. This divide between cultural opposites comes to a head when Driss show's uptight white folks how shed the rigid confines of top-tier mannerisms and get down to Earth, Wind, and Fire. While it is understandable why some critics would regard this as a racist film, I think it would be more appropriate to state that it is full of clichés about the unyielding haves versus the free-spirited have-nots.Also, the development of the duo's relationship is accompanied by subplots such as Driss's family dynamics and Phillippe's love interest, which he has not yet met. While these subplots were plausibly unnecessary, they support the situational maturation of Driss and Phillippe's friendship. While these subplots were small aids in the development of the individual characters, they could be expanded or cut from the film altogether. In my opinion, these minor distractions did very little to minimize my engagement with the film.While the film may not have dominated American film society, it is sure to be a smash hit in the box offices that are our homes. Blatantly manipulated stereotypes gear its audience for a telltale story of hope and friendship in the most unlikely of places. The film is chalk-full of surprises that are sure to make you giggle and smile. The film should not fall victim to the crime committed by opponents of foreign films—failing to watch because they refuse to be annoyed with subtitles. And there is speculation that the film will be remade in the U.S., the lesson of possibilities, regardless of trivial limitations, bear repeating in any language. While some may argue that a predictable plot plagues the film, its impact and lasting impression will be made by its use of comedic relief among situations that may otherwise be considered as non-thought provoking and daunting. The film has a funny way of capturing the hearts of its viewers and should not be overlooked for its French roots.",The Intouchables
627,fede-celli,A movie you'll love !!!,9,24 October 2014,"I really enjoyed watching this movie because in my opinion it covers a very original theme. Included in the theme, I found multiple aspects from the movie which encourage you and make you want to watch it twice again. To begin with, we have here a French comedy-drama which alternates between the miserable life of a quadriplegic man and the friendship he builds up with his assistant. Another aspect that I'm sure that you all will love from this movie is the amount of funny dialogues and moments.

The two men are from different social backgrounds. The disabledman is rich and the black guy come from the suburb. At thebeginning they are not really friends because they don't come from the same "" world"" so they have a lot of difficulties to get on.

629,evelyne-arits162,Intouchable film review,10,27 October 2014,"Intouchables is a french dramatic comedy, this film is one of the non-English movies which is the most seen in the world ! The very high score of ""Intouchable"" is truly deserved ! The plot is based on the true happened story of  Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and Abdel Yasmin Sellou. In the film, the story is about Philippe, a rich quadriplegic man who tries to find a carer to help him in his daily life. He meets Driss, an black unemployed immigrant. Driss has no competence to take care of Philippe but nevertheless he accepts the job. While the context is very serious (immigrants, unemployment, handicap,...) the atmosphere is decontracted. Driss's tactless manners procures us a very good moment. You can't stop watching and you can't stop laughing ! Even if you've seen it a lot of times ! The main actors Omar Sy and François Cluzet plays their role perfectly ! You get attached on the characters and on the story ! I will not reveal too much but if you haven't seen it yet (and I doubt there are many) then I warmly recommend it to all of you !",The Intouchables

I tried to get my family who is NOT a fan of foreign films to watch this flick and finally they gave in. They enjoyed it as much as I did the first time. This movie is brilliant. I've watched other foreign films and I can't say I am too pleased. However this film combines classic comedy that all generations will enjoy along with the feel good part of a drama we all long for.

This was quite refreshingly real (not free of all of those happy- clappy-heartbreak-things, but still). I actually went twice to the cinema to watch this one. No need to explain all the details, its deep, its fun, its somewhat new (from what I know). Sadly I don't speak french that fluently to completely understand all of it but if you can, watch it in original tone. From what I heard (comparing french and German that is) it adds a lot more to the ""connection"" between the casts. This is the case in almost every movie of course but I have been told that here it is even more different. Wont say much about the movie, there are more and better reviewers out there to do that.

It was heart warming to see a young guy take such interest and care on an older person, spending quality time with him, both enjoying themselves with their friendship. However, it was really sad to watch Philippe die.

649,jezzamcfezza,A brilliant heart-warming true story that makes me laugh and cry with every view.,8,4 October 2015,"As an enthusiast for film in every aspect, I truly believe this French drama to be a masterpiece. Beginning with the incredibly well suited score by Ludovico Einaudi which captures the essence of the film I was initially unsure what to expect. The opening scene was majestic and beautifully filmed with dramatic cinematography and introduced the clever comedy throughout the picture. The true story that the script is based off may not at first glance seem relevant to many people, however I realised that actually this film notes a lot on differences in culture and creates a character for Driss, the protagonist who is low in the socio-economic scale, that expresses a lot of ideas that we might not realise and shows that the ways of the wealthy are not only largely different on the surface but deep beneath are much like that of any class. What really made this film get the rating I have given it is the heart that it has, Driss and his friend Philippe have masterfully scripted conversations which have a beautiful mixture of melancholy and satire which gives the film a very natural sense and elevates the fluency of the pacing. Many scenes I found myself bursting with laughter as if i were having a laugh with close friends, the film feels very personal because of this and the accompaniment of Einaudi's soft yet tenacious performance generates a homely atmosphere throughout. the beautiful cinematography carefully mimics that of a persons sight, with artistic blurring and intriguing angles. These angles and camera effects bring you deep into the character of Philippe, whom is paralysed beneath his neck, as it feels much like his view. Philippe's character tends to stare out into the distance and the filming resembles this aspect. Finally this incredible film is accompanied by acting which feels very real and each actors style worked perfectly with the character that they played. the film as an entirety felt natural and real and the superb acting was the heart of the greatness.",The Intouchables
650,paulhill-98436,Awesome movie,10,17 November 2015,"The film goes to the bone and masterfully portrays stereotypes of people's attitude towards the handicapped and those with criminal records. The greatest aspect of this movie lies in the interaction between the main actors where every sentence feels like exchanged respect, understanding, love and acceptance in a really brilliantly written mix of comedy and realism. The scenes are in good quality, and the actors, especially the main duo, completely spectacular. Omar Sy is fantastic in his role, as evidenced by three awards at various festivals. Their chemistry on screen is great; it is hard to believe that these two men are not the best friends in real life. ""Intouchables"" is a very touching and beautiful story of an unusual friendship.",The Intouchables

When you read the title its a little bit a secret. Because you wanna know what the title means you wanna look at the movie! On the cover of the movie you see 2 mans 1 is white and the other man is tinted. When I saw the cover I want to see the movie because i tought that is had a beautiful story line. So the next day I bought the movie and I saw the movie that day. Now I can review the movie on my opinion. My opinion is that the movie is based on a relationship of two people and they are very different about each other. That makes the movie very interesting because you didn't expect that the relationship about them become so beautiful. It's a movie which you had tot see because it's a beautiful story and the movie has very good acting people in the cast. So the movie likes very real.",The Intouchables

In my opinion this film would have been a 10 if they used better camera angles during the film. The ones used in the film were very plain and commonly used. But overall the actor were absolutely amazing in their roles! The plot of the story was also great. I highly recommend this film for everyone to watch. The comedy in this film is complementary with the plot of the story and the drama. One thing that kinda bothered me would have to be the begging scene, it really has no purpose in the rest of the movie. It kinda just is there putting the wrong image of the movie in the watchers head. Other that that this film would be a 9/10, and a super amazing and funny film.",The Intouchables
653,jorgevallz,Watch this movie!,8,26 July 2019,"Intouchables is a movie than introduces an african-european guy with a particular way of being to the lonely life of a french rich disabled old man. In my opinion Driss represents the innocence and humility that every human being have when feels that somebody needs real help, not just physical. The whole movie surround a friendly mood and never loses the attitude. And the most happens the most you want to see the interactions between Driss and Philippe. You always can take a minute to have your thoughts on the scenes, for example when you watch the social environment of our both main protagonists. The highest point of the movie is without a doubt our hero Driss.",The Intouchables

It makes you feel comfortable and gives warmth to your heart while watching. There are many lessons to get from this movie. The relationship between these two different generation, life-style, economical difference, culture is shown professionally. The movie is a reminder for all of us to cross these boundaries and build up strong humanitarian relationships with each other. The lessons you may get from this movie are priceless. Especially when you watch it before your 30s it might change the way you look at life and your social network. It might actually help you to overcome stereotypes and see the real world. The movie shows us that socio economical class, race, culture, background does not mean much when you can trust the person next to you. So give it a shot.",The Intouchables

Loved both of the main characters and there were many funny, serious, and heartwarming parts all throughout the movie, each of them done amazingly. The soundtrack for this movie was beautifully. The last scene was just so moving, the smile on Driss was just the most genuine and pure thing I've seen while they share their final moment together and both move on to better things. I still have the ending song playing and it just makes me think of so many beautiful things in life, I've changed how I look on life because of this movie, appreciating so many things like art, classical music, nature, etc... things that I normally don't really look into but now I just have utmost respect for them.

I think it's the best comedy ever and I think even 8.6 from IMDb is underrated for this movie. The fact that the movie was based on true story and real people made it great. The actors and all cast & crew worked very well even brilliant so I can watch this movie again and again. This is one of most unique, beautiful and honest friendship ever committed to film. Oscar-worthy movie and it's the most disappointment of the year that movie didn't get it. I think Hollywood should learn how to make movies like that.",The Intouchables

It doesn't matter how many times I watch ""The Intouchables"", it still makes me laugh of funny jokes and the way Omar Sy and François Cluzet and Audrey Fleurot were playing their roles.

I first saw this movie just last night and I had to ask myself 'Maybe it was so good because of the two glasses of wine that I just had.' but no liquor can do what this movie did. To summarize, imagine sitting on a bench in a park and watching as two people grow to be friends. Nothing is forced onto them, nothing is disrupting them, and sure, they have their differences, even coming from two separate worlds entirely; but you have the chance to watch what true friendship is based upon without even realizing this is a movie. It's like sneaking in a theater and watching a ballet dancer exercising with no public. I say that I hate this movie for what it made me feel; at first it was happiness, even melancholy, seeing the characters growing to like each other; but then it was jealousy because something like this doesn't happen too often.

Without wishing to give too much away, what I can reveal is that the chemistry between the carer and the patient is beautiful to watch as the calibre of acting is so great. It is simply superb from start to finish with an incredible soundtrack too. Not only is the acting superb, the soundtrack well chosen and directing brilliant too but the plot and story line has substance which is what many films are lacking at the moment.

I haven't met yet a person that didn't like it. I cried and laughed at the same time. This movie really touched me and it is definitely one of the best movies I have ever watched. Actors did pretty good job like the whole film crew. Althoug it is a French movie and most of us are used to those in English or our maternal language while I was watching it I totally forgot that so if maybe that is the reason why you still considering it just stop!

Although no art form is perfect, this film is a masterpiece and deserves every 10 stars I have given here. It hits the mark in every area.

Great plot, storyline, script, score and characters! Never have I laughed so hard in a Film. The character of Driss was superb in provoking laughter. And Philippe was so poignant in his words and expression! You got every emotion. It's not only hilarious but also heartwarming and special and conveys a brilliant message that everyone can learn from. Then, to my delight, to find out the end that this was inspired by a True Story! That was the nail on the head! It all made sense.This is honestly up there as one of my all time favourites.

Of course, there are some sad things in it, but this movie teaches us to appreciate life and don't be afraid to live. There is always a way out from any life situation. You just need to smile. And the solution of your problem will be found immediately. I always revisit this film when I have some doubts or problems in my life. It helps me to understand that there isn't any problem or it's not so big, I can do everything, and everything is going to be OK in my life. I'm very grateful to the creator of this film. And I would like to say my special gratitude to the wonderful, brilliant actors. They are really amazing! And one more reason to love this movie is the wonderful music of Ludovico Einaudi. His exciting and at the same time pacifying music perfectly supplements the film. So I highly recommend to watch this movie!",The Intouchables
673,andre_eai,This movie is pure art!,10,18 November 2017,"The ""Intouchables"" is a French movie that includes both comedy and drama. I can't describe it in words so I highly recommend you to watch this work of art which shows us that there are still people with a wonderful soul nowadays. The plot is inspired by a real story. Francois Cluzet plays the role of Philippe, a rich man who paralyzed after an accident. Philippe hires a young African man named Driss, played by Omar Sy, who only wanted a signature, not a job, so he can receive his unemployment benefit. Philippe offered to the young man a period to gain experience helping him. After that Driss can decide if he wanted to stay with Philippe or not. I'll let you discover what decision Driss took but I can say that their lives have changed completely. The movie, directed by Oliver Nakache and Eric Toledano, has an impressive soundtrack, made by Ludovico Einaudi, which fits perfectly with the action and the scenes. To be honest, I didn't expect to like it. But now I think it's the kind of movie that goes right to your soul, full of humanity and emotion. I enjoyed every minute of this even if the real story isn't the happiest. I was also impressed by the friendship between two people from different ""worlds"", countries, who have totally different behavior. It is like an antidote against sadness and negative feelings of our lives. I found on the Internet(IMDb) that 5% of the profits from the movie were donated to an association which creates living spaces for disabled people. This left me speechless. In the end, I want to mention that the most important thing is to enjoy your life and to be happy for all the little things. It's all that matters! Thank you!",The Intouchables

The untouchables is a gorgeous story that breaks cultural barriers and shows the human side of relations. I liked the movie for its honesty as it was ""pragmatic"". The cinematography is beautiful and the acting is outstanding. The story follows a quadriplegic aristocrat who is looked after by someone who comes from a deprived background, but knows what really matters. The characters of both Philippe and Driss perfectly complement each other although they come from different worlds. Their relationship is strengthened as the film progresses in a poetic way filled with humour. Totally recommended!",The Intouchables
676,ColinFenwickUK,My go-to movie to showcase foreign film.,10,7 August 2015,"If I am ever in need of a film to showcase the beauty and intelligence of French cinema, this is the title I dig out for people. There is a lot to be said for Hollywood and big budget productions but this film is the epitome of modern French cinema. Subtle, delicate and masterful, the build up and pacing of the film is very well managed and not once drags or feels boring, the characters are simply perfect and no single character feels forced or out of place, each one playing an integral part in the story. The acting is overwhelmingly real and as with a majority of modern foreign cinema the suspension of disbelief is never once broken dragging you emphatically into this beautiful at times; otherwise grainy and staunch Parisian reality. The mise en scène is stunningly portrayed and carefully picked by an experienced cinematographer Mathieu Vadepied who really comes into his own here. Simply put, this film is a must see for this generation and should be regarded as one of the most magnificent pieces of cinema to come out of France since Amelie, and certainly one of the great works of modern cinema regardless of language barriers.10/10",The Intouchables
