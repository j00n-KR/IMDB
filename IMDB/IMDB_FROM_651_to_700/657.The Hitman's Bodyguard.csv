0,Leofwine_draca,Comedy thriller lifted by superb action scenes,7,6 April 2018,"I'll admit to the start that I'm not a fan of Ryan Reynolds and his own brand of sarcastic comedy, although I did enjoy DEADPOOL for what its worth. I'd heard a lot about the swearing in this tag-team action comedy featuring Reynolds as a bodyguard teaming up with a hitman (played by a typically wise-cracking Samuel L. Jackson) who needs to get to the ICC but who has an army of mercenary killers waiting to get rid of him. I was expecting the worst, but I really enjoyed this film. Sure, there's a lot of swearing, but no more so than in a usual gangster picture. Reynolds plays it straight which I appreciated and Jackson is quite likeable. The story is familiar and Gary Oldman saddled with one of the most underwritten roles ever, but where this excels is the action; it rocks. It's fast, vivid, and incredibly violent, with numerous henchmen being constantly offed in violent and novel ways. There's a stand-out car chase in the tight canalside streets of Amsterdam which is worth the admission price alone, along with lots of stunts, explosions, and violent gags. I love action, the more realistic the better, so it's a pleasure to see a Hollywood film that doesn't go down the same old CGI-laden superhero route. The likes of THE RAID feel like an inspiration for the gritty choreography here. A shame that modern audiences don't seem to appreciate this kind of action.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
1,SnoopyStyle,intriguing pairing,6,3 October 2017,"Former CIA agent Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) has a high class private protection operation. His client gets killed and his business dies. Two years later, he's struggling to regain his reputation. Former president of Belarus Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman) is on trial at the International Criminal Court. The prosecution is in trouble and Interpol offers imprisoned hit-man Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) a deal to testify. He wants his wife Sonia (Salma Hayek) freed. He's being transported to The Hague when they are attacked. Agent Amelia Roussel rescues him and recruits her ex Michael to be the hit-man's bodyguard.Actors Reynolds and Jackson are an irreverent fun action duo. Their chemistry is a little rough at first but eventually they find their way. I wish that Hayek joined them to form a trio. I kinda assumed that from the billing and the trailer. It's a big disappointment. There are some fun action, canal chases, and general mayhem. This has its moments but it could have been better.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
2,Prismark10,The Amsterdam Run,6,26 August 2017,"Tough brutal action comedy, you might think The Hit-man's Bodyguard was written by Shane Black, creator of the Lethal Weapon films.Ryan Reynolds is Michael Bryce, a strictly by the book executive bodyguard for the rich and famous who lost his triple A rating when his wealthy client got killed while he was meant to protect him.Samuel L Jackson is Darius Kincaid, a dangerous contract killer who lives on his wits and luck.Kincaid is due to go to The Hague to be a star witness at the war crimes tribunal against the dictator of Belarus (Gary Oldman) but his Interpol protectors are attacked and Bryce is called in to assist him.Much of action takes place in England and Amsterdam. The language is coarse, Reynolds and Jackson make a good team but this is not a very original film as you think of movies such as Midnight Run and Lethal Weapon. Jackson does his usual MF shtick and Oldman just reprises his villain from Airforce One.Parts of the movie is ridiculously contrived such as Jackson just driving up to the hardware store after Reynolds kills a henchman.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
3,nogodnomasters,I am Harm's Way.,9,2 September 2017,"Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) is a methodical private contractor body guard who has fallen from grace. Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman) is a Belarus butcher on trial in the Hague. The witnesses against him have all died. There is only one man who can testify against him and that is Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) a skilled hit-man. He agrees in exchange for his wife's (Salma Hayek) freedom. Kincaid is escorted by Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung) a former girlfriend of Bryce. (Everything ties together in this film.) She runs into trouble and seeks the help of Bryce to help her out. Bryce and Kincaid have a hate-hate relationship that as one might expect blossoms into a bromance with conversation being expectantly foreboding.The film is a comedy-action film that has over-the-top action which would be a spoof of modern action films if they were not so impossible to begin with. Samuel L. Jackson is his gritty colorful self who I thought was going to quote Ezekiel 25:17, for a moment, but does not. Reynolds contrasts Jackson as a ""boring is always best"" tough guy who does things on cue.The sound track of mostly 80's music added to the film. I howled while they played Lionel Ritchie.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Jackson ""sings."" 4 1/2 stars",The Hitman's Bodyguard
4,kosmasp,Buddy(guard) comedy,8,30 October 2017,"Ryan Reynolds and Sam Jackson ... you hear those names and you just know that this is a good idea. And you also know this won't take itself too serious. Quite the opposite is the case and the question would be if it can sustain the comedy and the action throughout. Also how do the women handle themselves? Or rather do they get enough substance to be interesting in this? All legit questions one may ask and you can mostly say that they work.So if you are ready for light entertainment and some fun (with a lot of action of course), than you watch this and have a good time. It has not many surprises in place (apart from the one-liners I reckon), but that does not take anything away from the movie. Also stick around for an extra bit after the credits ...",The Hitman's Bodyguard
5,classicsoncall,"""So I gotta risk my life protecting this coffin magnet over here?""",7,29 July 2019,"""Deadpool 3"" anyone? That's what it felt like with only the super-hero costume missing on Ryan Reynolds, what with a more than liberal sprinkling of the 'F' word and Samuel L. Jackson lending his talents as an assassin with intriguing views on life and it's limitations. It almost qualifies as a buddy movie too, except that executive protection consultant Michael Bryce (Reynolds) and hit-man Darius Kincaid (Jackson) don't team up as much as they try to evade a squad of killers dispatched by former Belarus President Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman), standing trial for raping and pillaging his homeland. Both are given clever quips and one-liners to play off each other as wise-cracking antagonists, and as Kincaid expertly summarizes near the end of the story - ""You know, when life gives you s__t, you make Kool-Aid"". A noteworthy observation, which Bryce by his very fastidious and exacting nature, attempts to rearticulate using the lemons/lemonade example.If you know these players and have seen them in action before, you pretty much know what to expect. There's plenty of shoot 'em ups and highly imaginative chase scenes for the adrenaline crowd, and unlikely forays into dimensions of romance with Kincaid supplying the interpretations. Selma Hayek and Elodie Yung provide the necessary eye candy as the love interests of Jackson and Reynolds respectively, as the picture races to a countdown challenge that bad guy Dukhovich is determined to take advantage of. It's all played extremely over the top with a lot of collateral damage, but that's what you sign up for with a picture like this. The only question that isn't answered by the time it's over - what's with the fat lady in Sonia Kincaid's prison cell?",The Hitman's Bodyguard
6,paul_haakonsen,Mindless action comedy. Just lean back and enjoy the ride...,6,17 June 2018,"Initially then I didn't have much of any expectations to a movie such as this. Why? Well, take a look at the synopsis and take a look at the cast. So you pretty much know what this will turn out as.And those impressions were very much brought to life on the screen. Because this turned out to be a very, very stereotypical storyline for an action comedy of this sort. No surprises or anything that will impress you the least in any way. Everything here just runs on a carefully laid track, which made it all generic and predictable.With that being said, don't get me fully wrong. Because I was entertained for sure, and for an action comedy of this type it actually was enjoyable enough. But it is the type of movie where you just disconnect your brain and lean back in the seat to enjoy the ride.There is a lot of action throughout the movie, and they managed to choreograph and execute the action sequences quite nicely and that carried the movie quite well.However, what most of this movie actually is was mostly banter between Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds, which does tend to wear a bit thin in the long run.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
7,zardoz-13,Deadpool Meets Nick Fury!!!,9,27 August 2017,"As the summer doldrums descend upon us with the impending change of the seasons, it is reassuring Hollywood has produced a genuinely entertaining action comedy to tide us over until the major Thanksgiving and Christmas releases. Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson make a charismatic combo with no love lost for each other in the fast-paced but formulaic thriller ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" co-starring Gary Oldman and Salma Hayek. ""Expendables 3"" director Patrick Hughes proves not only that he can orchestrate some extraordinary stunts involving vehicular mayhem on a modest $30-million budget, but he also gets inspired performances from his gifted cast. Indeed, you've seen variations of ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" many times before in road pictures about mismatched heroes, such as the two ""48 HRS"" movies, ""The Rundown,"" ""The Rookie,"" the ""Rush Hour"" trilogy, the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, ""The Nice Guys,"" and ""Midnight Run."" This adrenalin-laced saga benefits from catchy dialogue courtesy of ""Fire with Fire"" scenarist Tim O'Connor who gives everybody quotable lines peppered with flavorful profanity as well as a plot sizzling with surprises galore. Of course, you know Ryan Reynolds is going to deliver Samuel L. Jackson as a witness to testify against villainous Gary Oldman before the deadline when the latter can be cleared off all charges against his murderous Eastern European regime. The destination isn't as much a revelation as the roller-coaster ride that everybody takes to arrive there in the nick of time. All too often movies like ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" lose steam somewhere in the middle, but Australian director Patrick Hughes maintains the momentum throughout its 118 minutes. The gauntlet that our bickering heroic pair must negotiate keeps challenging them right up until to the last second. Happily, the gals in this slam-bang, grudge match aren't destitute damsels-in-distress, but babes that can shoot straight, smash testicles with their feet, and rival the guys with their profanity. Clearly, sensitive souls searching for philosophical insights about life's mysteries should shun this implausible but entertaining nonsense.Debonair Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds of ""Deadpool"") is at the top of his game as an elite triple-A bodyguard who will shield any scoundrel who can afford his services. Bryce knows all the tricks of the trade. As ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" unfolds, our clean-shaven, well-dressed, suit and tie executive has escorted a notorious Japanese arms dealer, Kurosawa (Tsuwayuki Saotome of ""London Has Fallen""), to the airport to bid him farewell when a random shot out of the blue obliterates the arms dealer as the latter is peering out the window of his jet at Bryce. Our protagonist is stunned beyond expression and watches as his bodyguard service folds. Initially, Bryce blames his girlfriend, Interpol Agent Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung of ""Gods of Egypt""), for her lack of discretion. Michael believes Amelia leaked word about the Japanese arms dealer's presence. They separate over this breach. Meantime, genocidal Belarusian dictator Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman of ""True Romance""), is on trial at The Hague in the Netherlands for international human rights violations. As the trial winds down to its inevitable conclusion, the prosecution cannot seem to keep its' witnesses alive long enough for them to testify. The last man scheduled to take the stand against Dukhovich is the world's deadliest hit-man, Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson of ""Pulp Fiction""), who refused an offer from him. Simply said, Kincaid doesn't murder innocent women and children. He has irrefutable evidence which will seal Dukhovich's fate. Basically, Kincaid has cut a deal with the prosecutor to talk if she will release his wife, Sonia Kincaid (Salma Hayek of ""Everly""), from an Amsterdam prison. As Kincaid later tells Sonia, he doesn't care if they send him to prison because there isn't a prison secure enough to hold him. Interpol sets out to haul Kincaid from Manchester, England, under a heavily armed guard to The Hague. An informer within the ranks, however, tips off Dukhovich's top assassin, Ivan (Yuri Kolokolnikov of ""Game of Thrones""), about the route. Ivan's trigger-happy henchmen ambush the Interpol van and wipe out everybody but Amelia and Kincaid. Kincaid catches a slug in the leg before Amelia and he elude the killers. She escorts Kincaid to a safehouse where he digs the bullet out of his calf as if he were Sylvester Stallone's John Rambo and bandages himself. Afterward, Kincaid refuses flatly to cooperate with Interpol. Reluctantly, Amelia swallows her pride and resorts to Michael for help. At first, he wants nothing to do with this suicidal kiss of death exercise. Nevertheless, he caves in to his desperate ex-girlfriend's pleas. No sooner have Michael and Kincaid met than they are shoving pistols in each other's faces. ""My job is to keep you out of harm's way,"" Michael reminds Kincaid. ""I am harm's way,"" Jackson retorts defiantly. Since his near miss with death during the ambush, Kincaid has gone to packing a pistol. As it turns out, Michael and Kincaid discover they are old adversaries, and they spend the rest of ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" swapping insults when they aren't whittling down the army of gunmen that outnumbers them. ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" wallows in everything action movie fans crave. Director Patrick Hughes knows better than to let the expository dialogue scenes interfere with the plethora of shooting and killing. The body count escalates into double-digits, and Kincaid himself knocks off almost thirty gunmen. Although our heroes cannot perish, life is hardly a picnic as they dodge one barrage after another. Half of the time, Kincaid and Michael are working against each other. For example, Kincaid stomps the brakes during a careening car chase and a surprised Michael performs a header through the windshield but regains his footing without missing a stride. Ironically, the relationship between them improves as the odds against their survival worsen. Meanwhile, Gary Oldman arouses our wrath as an appropriately despicable villain who kills without a qualm. Villains must be hard-boiled in thrillers. Despite its familiarity, ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" delivers everything that makes an action movie unforgettable!",The Hitman's Bodyguard
8,grantss,"A bit hit and miss, though ends well",6,28 May 2018,"Belarussian dictator Vladislav Dukhovich is standing trial for genocide. The trial is not going well for the prosecution - their witnesses tend to turn up dead. They have one trump card though - hitman Darius Kincaid is willing to testify against Dukhovich. Interpol try to get Kincaid to the trial but after the convoy is ambushed, Interpol agent Amelia Roussel, aware that there is a Dukhovich spy in her own organisation, calls in outside help - professional bodyguard Michael Bryce. One problem - Bryce and Kincaid hate each other.On paper, a movie with potential. Combine the comedic delivery of Ryan Reynolds (as Bryce) and the action-drama antics of Samuel L Jackson (as Kincaid) and you should have a winner, right? Well, sort of. The chalk-and-cheese riffing of Bryce vs Kincaid works fairly well, and Reynolds delivers his wise-cracks with aplomb and precision. However, far too much time is spent on the action side and not enough on the humour. For long stretches the movie feels like just another dime-a-dozen action-thriller.It all comes together well in the end though. Good ending that is more than just action-filled.As mentioned, great work by Ryan Reynolds in his role, a role made for him. Samuel L Jackson plays to his strengths and does well. Gary Oldman, always first choice for a larger-than-life villain, does well as Dukhovich, as does Elodie Yung as Roussel. The disappointment is Salma Hayek as Kincaid's wife. Her character and performance seem forced and too over-the-top.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
9,Calicodreamin,Some funny moment,6,19 September 2021,A fairly lighthearted action movie with a few funny moments and well shot action sequences. The characters were well acted and had good chemistry. Storyline was pretty predictable but a solid execution.,The Hitman's Bodyguard
10,oscaralbert,This flick argues that assassins are the ONLY way to deal with rogue leaders . . .,7,13 September 2017,". . . such as North Korea's Little Kimmie, Russia's Vladimir ""Mad Dog"" Putin, or the latter's White House Sock Puppet, Don Juan Rump. Bringing these murderous miscreants ""to Justice"" in some Netherworld Nation overrun by hookers, prostitutes, and whores--as THE H!TMAN'S BODYGUARD accurately depicts--is a surefire way to accomplish nothing. However, assassin's bullets from Samuel L. Jackson get the job done without any fuss and very little muss. THE H!TMAN'S BODYGUARD shows that someone like Jackson's character can take out a target from a mile or two away, armed with the appropriate sniper rifle. This often saves the cost of a Blackhawk helicopter, one of which Navy SEAL Team Six squandered when they took out Osama bin Laden (and the tab for a Blackhawk runs into the millions!). Or consider the case of Saddam Hussein. America wasted Two Trillion Bucks and counting, not to mention 5,000+ U.S. lives and more than a million Iraqi souls, to string up Hussein, when someone such as Jackson's hit-man could have wasted him for a few thousand clams. It's High Time that we had a World-Wide Reality\Game Show in which the Rotten Eggs in the Basket of Deplorables such as Little Kimmie, ""Mad Dog' Vlad, and Rump can be voted off the island (and dispatched For Real before the following episode by a squad of globe-trotting hit men). That way, when someone says ""You're Fired!"" it will be like the Captain of the Firing Squad yelling ""Fire!""",The Hitman's Bodyguard
11,view_and_review,Action-Comedy-Love Story,9,28 November 2017,"The Hit-man's Bodyguard (not hyphenated but IMDb is forcing it to be) was that rare movie that you think will be good and it was better. I like Ryan Reynolds and I like Samuel Jackson so I figured I'd like the two of them together even though that's not always the case with on-screen talent (ala Grown-Ups).In this case Reynolds and Jackson were a perfect match. They meshed so well together and both of them were funny in a set up where Reynolds played the straight man. The movie was down right hilarious and the story was very well done. It was an action-comedy-love story that was heavy on the action and heavy on the comedy; so-much-so they thoroughly permeated the love story.How does a hit-man come to get or even need a bodyguard? That was actually part of the brilliance of the plot. Did he ""need"" a bodyguard? No, but he was given one nonetheless. And if you ever wondered what the scenario would be when a hit-man is forced to have a bodyguard or when a law abiding bodyguard is forced to protect a hit-man... well just watch.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
12,neil-476,Funny action comedy,9,8 May 2018,"International contract assassin Darius Kincaid, imprisoned in England, is required in The Hague to testify at the trial of Russian war criminal Vladimir Dukhovic (the price of his co-operation is the release of his imprisoned wife Sonia). Protection agent Michael Bryce is tasked by his Interpol ex-girlfriend with ensuring Kincaid arrives safely despite the fact that he has bad history with Kincaid.Welcome to mismatched buddy movie material. Ryan Reynolds is the uptight Bryce, and Samuel L mothereffin Jackson is Kincaid. The hitman clearly loves life despite his occupation and is constantly amused, particularly by Bryce. This, in turn, winds up Bryce even more. There is a lot of action, well-staged - I did find myself wondering just how many automatic weapon-wielding heavies Dukhovic had wandering around Europe - and a script which does its job. It tells a familiar story with a light touch, and has some amusing lines, but it isn't going to win a ""Best Screenplay"" Oscar. So, in many respects, this film is OK but no better.
But what it does have is superb chemistry between Reynolds and Jackson - they turn this film from something fairly routine into a real crowd-pleaser. And I mean that literally. The cinema was quite full, and the audience loved this. There was a LOT of laughter, and it wasn't so much at the dialogue, it was at the way it was delivered. This movie is Entertaining.There is a lot to enjoy here.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
13,phd_travel,Funny in parts and great chase through Amsterdam,7,17 August 2017,There is a lot of action throughout this movie interspersed with humorous banter. The European setting is nice to watch and the chase through Amsterdam is quite something. The humor is a big part of the movie and the banter is partly funny some not so. Liked the explanatory flashbacks for the characters. Maybe a little less Ryan Reynolds talking would have moved things along better. Salma Hayek shines in her few minutes. Samuel L Jackson still has the moves considering he isn't young at all. Elodie Yung is a refreshing change from the usual love interest. She is watchable and fascinating even if not perfectly beautiful. Gary Oldman's accent shifts but he is good as the president of Belarus.Worth a watch.,The Hitman's Bodyguard
14,gradyharp,'You're going to pardon an innocent woman? That's mighty white of you.',5,24 November 2017,"Tom O'Connor wrote this rather silly spoof of action movies and the director is Patrick Hughes. The slight outline of the minimal plot – 'The world's top bodyguard gets a new client, a hit man who must testify at the International Criminal Court. They must put their differences aside and work together to make it to the trial on time.' From there it is all car fires, explosions, innumerable killings and slaughters and noise, and the heart of the film that makes it tolerable is the always welcome presence of Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson.To be more precise, 'The world's top protection agent (Ryan Reynolds) is called upon to guard the life of his mortal enemy, one of the world's most notorious hit men (Samuel L. Jackson). The relentless bodyguard and manipulative assassin have been on the opposite end of the bullet for years, and are thrown together for a wildly outrageous 24 hours. During their raucous and hilarious adventure from England to The Hague, they encounter high-speed car chases, outlandish boat escapades, and a merciless Eastern European dictator (Gary Oldman) who is out for blood. Salma Hayek joins the mayhem as Jackson's equally notorious wife. Other actors who are significant are Elodie Yung as Reynolds' love interest, Rod Hallett, Yuri Kolkolikov, Barry Atsma among others.For two hours the noise level is at high pitch in the form of chaotic killing and explosions and car and boat chases.

Ryan Reynolds is a comedic powerhouse and Samuel L. Jackson, even from his casting hole as a loud black man that swears all the time, is funny as hell when his heart is in it. But the movie was just a predictable buddy not-cop comedy, with little of the possibilities of the two main leads. I mean, just let them improv for two hours off each other and it would have been funnier.The action itself was mediocre as well. A lot of standing in open spaces killing people hidden under cover or car chases where no one other than our guys seem to know how to shoot.All that remains is the story. The bad guy was established, the mole was obvious even before being revealed so crassly and the subtleties that the plot could have brought, considering we are talking about a desperate law man protecting a contract killer, were completely ignored.Bottom line: amusing as designed, formulaic as hell, not a good movie, not very funny, average.

19,sddavis63,Boring Is Not Always Best,4,30 June 2018,"Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) was once a big-timer in the security world, running a private protection agency guarding big-name clients. Unfortunately, one of his clients is assassinated, and Bryce hits rock bottom afterward, desperately trying to rebuild his reputation and his business, reduced to being a personal bodyguard to whoever will pay him. Suddenly appears Darius Kincaid, an imprisoned assassin who's been offered a deal to testify at an international court in The Hague against a former dictator on trial for human rights abuses. Interpol turns out to be compromised and, realizing that they can't safely get Kincaid to The Hague, they hire Bryce to do the job for them. And the story goes on from there.In one sense it's an entirely formulaic action-adventure movie. There's lots of gunfire and car chases and explosions. There are a lot of seedy people following Bryce and Kincaid. From the perspective of that genre, if you've seen one you've seen this. It's also a comedy. As a comedy, it's a little better than it is as an action-adventure. It did manage to raise a couple of chuckles out of me, and the concluding car chase through The Hague is actually a pretty good example of both action-adventure and comedy. In fact, while perhaps a little bit long, it's clearly, to me, the highlight of the entire movie. Of course, we end up in a pretty typical countdown, as Kincaid has to be at the court in The Hague by no later than 5 pm or the dictator goes free. (It's actually pretty hard to believe that a war crimes trial would be brought against a guy when apparently the only hope of convicting him is through the testimony of a professional assassin - but you do have to stretch logic in these kinds of movies.)The performances in this were so-so. Reynolds didn't really stand out to me. Jackson seemed to put a lot of effort into it, but also wasn't a standout. I was most impressed (insert sarcasm emoji here) by the writers, who tried really hard to put the word f$!k (or variation) into a single sentence as many times as possible and as often as possible for Jackson's character of Kincaid.At the beginning of the movie Bryce tells us that his company's motto is ""Boring Is Always Best."" Not really. Frankly, I found much of this movie (up to the car chase in The Hague) to be boring - and it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen. To be honest, it simply wasn't very memorable. The exciting (and sometimes funny) car chase helped out, though. (4/10)",The Hitman's Bodyguard
20,Hellmant,For the most part it's a lot of fun.,8,30 August 2017,"'THE Hit-man'S BODYGUARD': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new action-comedy starring Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson, as a hit-man (Jackson), who's supposed to testify at the International Court of Justice, and his bodyguard (Reynolds). The film costars Elodie Yung, Salma Hayek, Gary Oldman, Joaquim de Almeida and Richard E. Grant. It was directed by Patrick Hughes (who also helmed 'THE EXPENDABLES 3') and it was written by Tom O'Connor (the script was featured on the 2011 Black List). It's received mixed (to negative) reviews from critics, but it is a hit at the Box Office so far. I found it to be a pretty amusing action buddy flick.A sadistic Eastern European dictator, Vladislav Dukhovich (Oldman), is on trial for atrocious crimes against his people, but there's not enough legal evidence to convict him. Notorious hit-man Darius Kincaid (Jackson) makes a deal to testify against Dukhovich, in order to free his incarcerated wife (Hayek). Expert bodyguard Michael Bryce (Reynolds), who's fallen on hard times recently, is tasked with transporting Kincaid from the United Kingdom to the International Court of Justice. The only problem is that the two are mortal enemies, and they also have an army of bloodthirsty assassins (working for Dukhovich) trying to kill them the whole time. They of course bond on their adventurous road trip.The movie is actually a surprisingly cool action flick; which shouldn't be that surprising (I guess), considering it was directed by the guy who did 'THE EXPENDABLES 3' (and I'm a fan of that film as well). The movie also has great chemistry between it's two leading men, and it's quite funny at times as well; Hayek and Yung are also both great in their roles too (and sexy). The movie does get a little long at times, but for the most part it's a lot of fun.

I grew up on the clichéd, magnificent, excessive action films of the 80's and 90's. Catch phrases, Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis, guns, body counts and F bombs. I am thrilled that now they are starting to make these classic popcorn flicks again and it's not all about superheroes and Billion dollar openings. My expectations for The Hit-man's Bodyguard was mediocre just because the trailers were just okay and it seemed like an old formula. I'm happy to say that for me it worked in a big way. The action was fantastic, the one liners were plenty and the comedy was balanced perfectly. Some of the harsher reviews harp on it being formulaic and a recipe that hasn't worked since the 90's but it does still work! It is very formulaic and predictable but it's not trying to earn any Oscars, it's just trying to entertain. The worst part of the film for me was the ridiculous plot holes and having to overlook them (how many mistakes world class assassins make, how bad Reynolds and Jackson were at hiding their tracks, bullets flying with good guys never being hit critically) You absolutely have to shut off your sense and brain and just enjoy it.Samuel L Jackson fans will love this. This is pure Sam L at his finest. He is an expletive spewing, laid back, deadly assassin with a big heart. If you could write a role just for him to appease his fans this is it. I couldn't possibly say it's not a good performance because it fits him like a glove. So if you like him, you'll this and his character. Ryan Reynolds...same idea. Fans have a certain expectation of him and this is it. The adorable, sweet guy with bad-ass moves and some of the best sarcastic comedic timing in the business. A film like this literally lives and breathes by the chemistry between it's ""buddies"" and Reynolds and Jackson are good together! I hesitate to say great because I think about legendary team ups and I don't see this as ""legendary"" but they are good, maybe very good. The film is perhaps too formulaic to ever show the two of them as ""great."" Gary Oldman...legendary actor AND legendary villain. If you're going to make an homage to 90's films you might as well get Lee Harvey Oswald, Dracula, Jean- Baptiste Emanuel Zorg and Ivan Korshunov just name a few. Ivan Korshunov (AirForce One) is one of the best villains in action film history. Oldman is sadly underused as the villain but he is still a formidable presence in the film. His end scene is also perfectly crafted to those 80's/90's films much like the one liners throughout. Elodie Yung and Salma Hayek have small but impactful roles as the leading men's ladies. Hayek is overblown by funny in her scenes and Yung is a great strong character who kicks some serious butt. It's unfortunate in one of the scenes where she gets to take on her nemesis she is saved by Reynolds but otherwise she is a strong female heroine. Joaquim de Almeida who I am a fan of from Fox's 24 years ago, is also good as a sub-villain. Then there is a huge host of nameless/faceless henchman pouring out of every orifice to get butchered.So speaking of Stallone (my idol) Patrick Hughes is probably best known for directing the least of The Expendables series number 3. He made some mistakes with that. So it would lead me to believe that Hughes probably wasn't best for this film but it's still a solid enjoyable flick and the action and fight sequences are phenomenal and no holds barred thanks to the R-Rating. So Hughes clearly has a love for the same genre of action as I do so I'll keep giving him a chance as he seems to be getting better. Many of the action and crazy over the top stunts reminded me of The Kingsman which was an incredible film and instantly one of my favourites. I would love to see sequels to this and the budget was very modest so it's possible. There is nothing a love more than just a flat out good time at the movies and it was that! 8.5/10",The Hitman's Bodyguard
23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"When Jackson and Reynolds verbally spar, this becomes a decently enjoyable romp.",6,12 April 2018,"'The Hitman's Bodyguard (2017)' plays as a broadly comedic version of Reynolds' earlier serviceable 'Safe House (2012)', which is in itself essentially a serious take on the far superior 'Midnight Run (1987)', so it's not a premise that's particularity unique and neither is it one that has anything to set itself apart from every other slickly stylish action-comedy to come in recent years. Aside from, that is, what is unequivocally its greatest asset, Samuel L. Jackson. It's his charisma that allows this to rise above its generic schlocky centre, becoming a decently enjoyable romp once it gets going and its two leads are verbally sparring - their bouncing banter easily provides the feature's best, and only chuckle-worthy, moments - as they try to outrun the cardboard cut-out thugs chasing them. There's some fun sequences and even the occasional exciting action set-piece, too, but if it wasn't for Jackson, it would surely fail spectacularly. 6/10",The Hitman's Bodyguard

25,bowmanblue,"Good, but could have been better",7,18 April 2018,"There are some films that shouldn't work and yet do. And there are those films that have everything going for them and yet don't work. I wouldn't say that 'The Hitman's Bodyguard' falls into the latter, but it certainly should have been better than it was. First of all, I love both Samuel L Jackson and Ryan Reynolds (who doesn't these days?) and, based on my equal love of Marvel movies, couldn't wait to see 'Deadpool' interact with 'Nick Fury.' And interact they do. In fact, the film basically splits between the two of them bickering (yes, in quite a humorous manner) to one chase/action sequence and then 'rinse and repeat.'I just felt that Samuel L Jackson was effectively playing Samuel L Jackson and Ryan Reynolds was effectively playing Ryan Reynolds. Now, I didn't mind that. The action was well done and the jokes land, so you could say' 'What more do you want?' Well, not much I guess - I just felt that if the film had been given something (no, I don't actually know what) extra then it would have raised it from a reasonable action flick so something truly great.Ryan Reynolds plays the 'disgraced' bodyguard who has to look after Samuel L Jackson's hitman and escort him to a trial in order to give evidence on a notorious war criminal (Gary Oldman). Now, if you're thinking back to Gary Oldman's numerous excellent performances and how he can totally hold his own as a villain, don't hold your breath. He's hardly in it. The fact that he's in prison means he doesn't really have the opportunity to interact with our heroes. The other - vaguely notable - characters are the two stars' women, Samuel L Jackson's being Salma Hayek and Ryan Reynolds' being Elodie Yung and - again - they're barely in it. Both parts could have probably been cut from the film and you wouldn't really have noticed. It's also not short. The action scenes come every few minutes and it's one of those films where it probably could have ended a few times before it actually does. Like I say, the action was fun and the dialogue snappy, so if - like me - you're a fan of one or both of the actors you'll definitely get something out of the film. However, as much as I didn't hate it, I couldn't help be leave with the feeling that something was missing and it should/could have been even better than it was.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

I wonder if this film would have been better had the roles of Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson been switched, as it felt like Reynolds' comedy was subdued and Jackson's performance came off a little goofy. I didn't hate it, but I can't really recommend it.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
27,lesleyharris30,"Great Fun, Great Chemistry,",8,2 October 2017,"The Hit-man's Bodyguard is a great movie with a very well written plot and a top notch cast. It is great fun from start to finish, an enjoyable buddy comedy with a bit of a twist. The film is as hilarious as it is action packed, containing both moments that had me in stitches as well as parts that kept me at the edge of my seat, a very impressive mix of both genres that really kept me entertained. The soundtrack is also excellent, featuring countless classics, one of those movies that you will find yourself singing along to and looking up the music afterwards. It was certainly inconsistent on some aspects and was not as great as it could have been, there was definitely potential there for this to be a nine. For one thing, the love plot line fails to take me away, as much as I liked Jackson and Hayak's characters, we never see them in the same scene together and thus do not really care for them to reunite. Gary Oldman's character was also flat as the main antagonist, I had no gripes with this flawless actors performance, but his dialogue was so flat that he was never a real threat to the main characters. The cast itself is stellar, Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson have a beautiful chemistry together and you can tell they got along very well on set. Salma Hayak also has some terrific, clearly improvised scenes that really stand out, and Oldman is stellar as always, showing his versatility. Great, simple fun. While it's nothing flawless, The Hit-man's Bodyguard can be forgiven for how entertaining it truly is, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy.

However, Interpol's plan to betray both brings them together. While the action and the plot of this over-the-top buddy picture are pretty much old hat, the rapid-fire banter between the two archetypal, yet charismatic, leads do make up for the film's numerous shortcomings.Incidentally, as an assassin's bodyguard you get to pat down a lot of high paid therapists.

30,tabuno,A Dramatic Action Thriller with Humor,8,10 January 2019,"20 August 2017. This movie is no comedy action thriller, but rather an action thriller with more dramatic action scenes along with a foul-mouthed repartee full of periodic humor between Ryan Reynold's and Samuel L. Jackson's characters. Salma Hayek with her limber body touches up the movie a little light foul-mouthed humor herself. The difficult balance of grisly murder and dramatic serious cold mayhem and the lighter sense of laughter makes the movie edgy like dancing on hot coals with very cold feet. The action scenes are spectacular for their visceral impact and while the chase scenes almost become too extended and far-fetched all the while remaining captivating. Gary Oldman's character is a nasty one without morals and at times almost seems to almost put a damper on the summer movie entertainment value of the movie, perhaps a role better for the James Bond franchise.Most of the movie plot and inevitable twists are otherwise predictable but it is in the unchallenged knowingness that allows one's brain to take a back seat and just enjoy the physical experience and the verbal playfulness occurring on the screen. The action is on par with Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003) or Salma Hayek's own violent action role in Everly (2014) or Hit-man 47 (2014). The comedy is on par with The Heat (2013) and Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock's laughter fest. While the drama is on part with the darker revisionist James Bond in Casino Royale (2006).Somehow the movie retains is diverse charm and its appeal with all the mix of violence and humor and emotional connectivity going on.

32,The-Sarkologist,Classic Jackson,9,27 August 2017,"Well, with Samuel L Jackson as one of the heroes, and Gary Oldman as the villain, you simply cannot go wrong with this fast paced, no holds barred action movie. Actually, in a way it really felt like it was A Long Kiss Goodnight, but set in Europe instead of the United States. Okay, it was quite different from Long Kiss, but the style of film, that is being an action comedy with Jackson playing one of his signature characters, simply made this film shine. Actually, I remember when I first saw Long Kiss Goodnight I hated it, but that probably had a lot to do with not actually understanding what it was about. This time, watching this film, I was able to go with the flow because it was pretty clear what it was going to be like, particularly when I discovered that Jackson was in it.The film is about the President of Belarus, who happens to be a genocidal maniac, and how he is on trial at in the Hague. The only problem is that they can't actually pin anything on him because all of the witnesses that have been produced can only give testimony that amounts to hearsay. However, back in England, there happens to be a hit-man who could give some good evidence, and the problem is getting him to the Hague to testify, and to get him there in one piece. When it turns out that there is a mole in Interpol, they decide to bring in a security expert to get him there.Basically this is one of those race against time sort of movies, with the protagonists having to reach a certain place by a certain time, while the full resources of a brutal dictatorship have been sent against them. Mind you, sometimes I wonder if it is actually possible for such heavily armed people to be able to get into England, but then again this is Hollywood, and to some extent one needs to suspend their disbelief (and even then with the amount of firepower arrayed against them, it is highly unlikely that in real life that our two heroes could have survived).The thing with this film is that it is one of those odd couple films, in that both of our protagonists are completely the opposite. We have Michael, who is a bodyguard and considers himself to be triple A, that is until one of his targets was killed while sitting on a plane. On the other hand we have Darius Kincaid, the aforementioned hit-man who is needed in the Hague. The thing is that Michael, while being incredibly straight, and by the book, tends to have a moral compass that points towards the most amount of money. Mind you, there is a running joke about the authenticity of his triple A rating, with the suggestion that it really means nothing whatsoever.As for Kincaid, well, despite the fact that he has a lot of kills to his name, he seems to be one of those people that only kills bad people. Well, one can debate whether killing bad people makes you just as bad as the people you are killing, particularly since you are taking the role of judge, jury, and executioner, but that is beside the point where this movie is concerned. The thing with Kincaid, like some of Jackson's other characters, is that while they are shysters, or in this case an assassin, there is something that is quite likable about them. In fact his wife is a similar character, who while being incredibly rough, foul mouthed, and quite scary, also has an incredibly passionate side to her as well.This is a great movie – non-stop action with some great characters, and a dynamic atmosphere. Further more it has one of the masters of villainy in the form of Gary Oldman. In a way it is sad that Rickman has passed on, considering that an action movie with either him, or Oldman, as the antagonist, was going to be a good movie. Honestly, as soon as Oldman's name flashed up on the screen, I knew instantly what role that he was going to be playing, and what type of film it was going to be. Mind you, during to opening credits, I completely missed Jackson's name, so that part of it ended up being quite a pleasant surprise. Mind you, that first scene did leave me a little puzzled, particularly since it took a bit to work out that Michael was actually incredibly straight laced.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
33,Reno-Rangan,Once upon a time two sworn enemies teamed up!,7,4 February 2018,"Maybe the critics are right, but like usual, I don't have to agree with them. This is a nice film, not a great film as a few people lauding. It is entertaining. All the stunts were good, comedies were good enough, but the basic plot itself a cliche. Yes, anybody aged 20+ would surely have seen many similar storied films. It's just in another time with another cast and crew. They had promoted it so well. So the result was incredible. But in reality JUST one time watchable film with not expecting serious laughs.Initially I thought it could be this year's 'The Nice Guys', and they are about to repeat the same magic of Crowe and Gosling duo. But it was different. Too hard hitting, just what Tarantino fans would like to have. Besides, their guy, Samuel L. Jackson is here. Both the leads were good. That does not mean they have saved the film. That's an assumption of fanboys. Luck could be another factor!It was about a hitman in capture decides to give an important testimony in the International Criminal Court against a powerful man. So now the bad guys are after him in his every move from England to Holland. A demoted bodyguard takes the job to safely get him to his destination. Their journey begins where they are going to encounter a series of obstacles and they finally make it where a major twist comes in before the end.As I said, this is no special, except the way they have presented on the screen makes the difference. But again, not all films are lucky in that criteria as this one. It is like one in a 20-25 films. So if your objective is timepass, then this will do just fine. There could be a sequel, probably prequel seems a nice idea. But I'm not sure whether I want it or not. I'll just be happy if they do!7/10",The Hitman's Bodyguard

35,cruise01,Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson team up was a lot of fun and the action is non stop exciting.,8,25 August 2017,"An action buddy comedy film that pairs Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson does bring endless entertainment. For two hours of the movie seeing them nitpick at each other is a lot of fun. Plus there is a lot of action and shoot out sequences that makes the movie exciting. I did not have any expectations with this movie. The trailers made it seemed out to be a forgettable cheap action film with Ryan and Samuel making this film a cash grab. But I was wrong. It lives up to being a fun buddy comedy film and Ryan and Samuel were perfect for the roles. I was surprised with how well the action sequences were shot. With heavy rock composing score and an exciting shoot outs and action. It kept myself engaged to the screen. The director managed to handle a good set up with the action set pieces if it was from car chases, shootouts, or even a fight scene in a hardware store with some painful looking equipment being thrown at each other. The action was plenty and it never slowed down. Ryan Reynolds plays Michael Bryce, a bodyguard who protects some powerful clients. Until one of his clients ends up dead causing him to spiral down in his life. Until, his ex partner Amelia (Elodie Yung) needs his help in protecting Darius (Samuel L. Jackson) and keeping him alive until he testifies against Vladislav (Gary Oldman) a ruthless dictator. Now I will say the plot may not be the strong suit in the movie. As it is predictable and dull as it sets up in the beginning of the movie. Plus there are action movies that have recycled the same idea were a person needs protection to testify and the villain sends all his goons to chase and hunt them down. But just keeping the plot in the background and let Ryan and Samuel do their thing, as they have their own strategies on handling scenarios and situations is endless entertainment. Plus supporting roles like Salma Hayek, who plays Darius love interest was also good. Seeing a flash back of how they met in a bar and ending in bloodshed with her fighting a group of man was funny as Darius was falling in love with her. Elodie Yung was also good but she barely had much to do in the movie.Overall, The Hit-man's Bodyguard is a good action comedy film. Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds nailed the buddy action genre with their humor. It is funny; it did not take itself seriously which it was not suppose too. And it also has a lot of exciting action that makes the movie worth seeing. Even though, the plot was predictable and tedious, but this is one film that your paying more attention to the characters going into each action sequences and nitpicking at each other.

36,Floated2,Constant energy but stalled plot,6,3 April 2018,"The Hitman's Bodyguard is a high octane action comedy starring Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson. The film's comedy comes from the direct chemistry and interactions between both leads as they excels at playing the characters in the film. Seemingly effortless for both actors as they have portrayed these type of characters in many films before, and is the main reason as to why the film is as entertaining as it is.Although the action is there, the plot is somewhat of a background nose effect, and something in which we have seen before. There are many jokes but overall, the film isn't as funny as some critics and fans were claiming. A lot of cursing throughout but as R-rated films goes, this was expected.Somewhat predictable in the end, and there may be questions refolding a sequel, though even with the amount of money the film made back ($176 million of $30 million budget is great), we doubt there will be a sequel.

37,eddie_baggins,The leads and action save this overlong action/comedy,5,31 August 2017,"At a time in its early infancy, The Hit-man's Bodyguard was going to be a serious affair, but with Australian director Patrick Hughes and stars Ryan ""playing the same role yet again"" Reynolds and Samuel L. ""swearing like a trooper"" Jackson on board, Bodyguard has become a moulding of action and comedy, as the mismatched duo of Reynolds and Jackson fight their way through Europe to get to court and send Gary Oldman's OTT Russian baddie Vladislav Dukhovich to jail for his evil deeds.Bodyguard is a loud, brash and seriously over-long movie but after graduating from his impressive Australian film debut Red Hill to the utterly forgettable Expendables 3, Hughes enlivens Bodyguard with some unexpectedly awesome action and energy and any doubts you may've thought you'd have at the start of the film concerning the believability of a near 70 years old Samuel L. Jackson unleashing a can of sassy fury onto a plethora of baddies, will quickly dissipate once the action kicks in, even if the films generic goons must've received a crash course in shooting firearms from the Stormtroopers themselves, so bad is their marksmanship.It's an unexpected win for the film to become such a competent action hybrid but it's the story's long in the tooth nature and tonal unevenness that hurts the films progress as it dwells far too long on certain scenes and tries to get serious when it should've been focussing on the undeniable chemistry between Reynolds protection specialist Michael Bryce and Jackson's deadly hit-man Darius Kincaid, who both bring some wickedly devious charms to roles they could've easily played in their sleep, yet light up the screen together when their allowed to bounce off each other.It must be the dream pairing of some fanboys to see Deadpool and Mace Windu team up and while Reynolds needs to start branching out from his quick-talking and whip-smart Wade Wilson caricature pretty quickly, you can't deny he does this role well and we all know Jackson can play cool and sweary better than the rest of them.The film is at its simplistic best when these two get to share the screen like a couple of modern aged Grumpy Old Men (who just so happen to have a license to kill) and while the action is often great, more comedic focus for the film could've really elevated Bodyguard to a potentially classic comical status, especially with the addition a scene-stealing Salma Hayek as Darius's feisty and imprisoned wife Sonia, whose on brilliant form whenever she's given screen time.Final Say – Sometimes not knowing what it exactly is or not focussing on what it's doing best, The Hit-man's Bodyguard is a fun yet bumpy ride that should've shaved a solid 30 minutes from its runtime and done more to maximise the chemistry of its two leads, but with some above average action and some genuine laughs to be had, The Hit-man's Bodyguard is one of the years more tolerable guilty pleasures.2 ½ scared cellmates out of 5",The Hitman's Bodyguard
38,leonblackwood,Funny and full of action!,7,16 January 2018,"Review:
This movie is full of fun from beginning to end, and the chemistry between Reynolds and Jackson was great. The storyline is a lot like Midnight Run, starring DeNiro and Charles Grodin, we're a bounty hunter has to get someone to court to testify against the mob but in this movie, Ryan Reynolds plays a professional bodyguard, Michael Bryce, who has to get a professional hitman who is jailed for his crimes, Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson), to court so he can testify against a tyrannical Belarusian dictator Vladislav Dukhovich, played by Gary Oldman. The FBI cut a deal with Darius, to release his wife, Sonia (Salma Hayek), from prison for exchange for his testimony but on the way to court Vladislav's hitmen try to kill him. The Interpol agent that was trying to get him to court, Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung), soon realises that she can't trust her fellow agents, so she takes Darius to a safe house, and she calls her ex-boyfriend Michael, to ask him to chaperone Darius to court. Michael used to be a high flyer in the bodyguard business but when one of his important clients get murdered, his business goes downhill, and he is forced to take on minor clients to keep his business going. After picking up his arch nemesis Darius from the safe house, they start there mission to try and get to court on time but they have to fight through Vladislav's henchmen, who go above and beyond to stop them. It's a decent storyline which is full of action from the get go, and the witty humour was well written and entertaining. The movie is quite far fetched in a lot of ways but if you don't take it seriously, you will find it a lot of fun. Salma Hayek's foul mouth cracked me up and Gary Oldman added a touch of class, playing the villain. In all, it's a fun action packed movie, which has intensity, romance and humour throughout, so it definitely gets the thumbs up from me. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Patrick Hughes, who also brought you Red Hill and the Expendables 3, so he's not new to big action movies with A-list stars. The mixture of fun, action & humour, was put together well, and he was lucky to work with such a great cast, who all put in great performances. With so much attention to detail in the action scenes, which were filmed in various locations, I really have to commend this director, especially as it is only his 3rd movie. Compared to most action movies, the budget was quite low but he still managed to make it look amazing, even though the actors must have taken half the budget. Anyway, I would love to see a sequel with Jackson and Hayek telling there love story but with such busy schedules, it's very unlikely. Budget: $30million

39,TheMovieDiorama,"The Hitman's Bodyguard is a fun, entertaining and humorous popcorn film that lacks technical excellence.",6,28 February 2018,"It does exactly what it sets out to do: entertain. Turn your brain off and enjoy what's on screen, no need to whip out a notepad and detail the subtext and metaphors that are nested within. Car chases with explosions, boat chases with explosions, street chases with explosions...it's over the top and it's all the better for it! The main reason why it's going to bring in audiences is to see the hilarious chemistry between Reynolds and Jackson. Needless to say, they both pull off fantastically comedic performances. Although they are pretty much playing themselves, I for one like their personalities so was onboard straight away. The screenplay enables them to have adequate banter that made for some riveting confrontations. There's some crude slapstick humour thrown in for good measure, like a girl farting in the corner of a prison cell accompanied by Salma Hayek. Whilst we're on the subject of Hayek, she was damn hilarious. Personally I wanted to see more of her. The chase sequences are well filmed, the cuts aren't too frequent and does give off some much needed thrills. The problems that arise with the film are with its technical aspects, they just didn't agree with me. The plot was generic beyond description. Also, to have Gary Oldman as the antagonist and underuse him is a criminal offence. His henchman (which might I add looks like a Belarusian Ed Sheeran) had more screen time! Outrageous I say. The hand-to-hand combat scenes suffered from half second jump cuts that made it difficult to concentrate. The stunt doubles were plainly obvious. The natural lighting looked completely off, as if everything in the foreground was blurry. Finally, the film should've ended sooner than it did, quite a few unnecessary scenes were thrown in for the sake of it.

40,imseeg,"Not really funny, no chemistry, no credibility. Only lots of worn out action movie cliches.",3,7 May 2019,"Action comedy. That's what it is called. But it is not really funny. Without good jokes these sort of action movies are just cringeworthy to watch, piling one cliche on top of the other.Can it be enjoyed then as a serious action movie if it is not really a comedy? No way, because the plot is completely laughable. The story has plotholes that are too big and too many in number to be able to ignore them. Believe me I have tried, but I just couldnt bear the stupidity of this story.To make matters worse the producer put in quite a lot of explicitly violent scenes in this movie. That may sound promising to some people who love this violent stuff, but it just doesnt fit in something that supposes to be a comedy.Any good? The acting by Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L Jackson is ok. Most of the actors, even the supporting actors, are A-list material, but they cant save a ridiculous story. It will make pass the time for those who are forced to watch it, but that's about it.The story, if you are still interested, is about a security guard who has to guard a witness to court. Will he get there alive? Yawn...",The Hitman's Bodyguard
41,subxerogravity,A very good time at the movies,8,19 August 2017,"It's a funny movie. Not as laugh out loud as I thought the combo of Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L Jackson would be on the screen, but it was fun watching them interact. It's another Jackson pic that he seems to have done because the title was cool, like Snakes on a Plane. Give the Hit-man's Bodyguard more credit as it does read like a great action comedy. After all, why would a hit man need a body guard? It was fun to find out the answer. The action was pretty good and Jackson and Reynolds seem flawless in it, but honesty never felt the chemistry between the both of them. Sam would feed a line to Ryan and he would hit the ball but at best they got on the score board. No home run. The action in the action comedy was real nice. Whoever coordinated it did so smoothly. I loved it. It was more comedy than action, however. They had some great car chases and fight scenes, but they could have used more.My favorite scenes was anyone in which Salma Heyek was a part of it. Those were the funniest parts. And overall a good popcorn eating flick with the lovely Salmea Heyek in it. Lots of fun, but I was expecting more from this buddy team up. Maybe the body guard parody poster and trailers though me off.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
42,jtindahouse,Exhausting,5,3 September 2017,"When it comes to a film like 'The Hit-man's Bodyguard' there is always going to be one thing that determines how good it is - the chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson. Sadly, it was very much lacking. And while that is far from being the only flaw with the film, it is certainly the biggest one. Reynolds is suited to this kind of role, however his character didn't have the playfulness and relaxed attitude that was required to make it work. Jackson is less suited to this type of film. In fact his comedy skills leave a lot to be desired. In an action film he can deliver some funny lines here and there, but when the entire tone of the film is calling for him to be hilarious it isn't often going to work.The next problem with the film is the pacing of the action. My goodness it is just non-stop and it is exhausting. You barely get a chance to breathe after one action sequence before the next one is kicking off. Does that sound like a good thing? I assure you it isn't. For one it gives no time for the actual funny dialogue to take place and secondly it just makes all the action feel exactly the same. Not one moment from the film is memorable and the whole thing actually just feels like a big blur.A couple of talented actors, in their respective fields, in the lead roles is not enough to save 'The Hit-man's Bodyguard'. The experience quickly becomes tedious and is never any fun. The 2 hour run time feels long and tiresome. I wouldn't recommend watching this film.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Elodie Yung(Elektra, The Defenders) is also good. action scenes are pretty intense, really holds you at the edge of your seat.

46,stevendbeard,Great Action/comedy,8,18 August 2017,"I saw ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"", starring Ryan Reynolds-Deadpool, Green Lantern; Samuel L. Jackson-most of the Marvel movies, The Spirit; Gary Oldman-The Dark Knight movies, the Harry Potter movies; Salma Hayek- Across the Universe, The Faculty and Elodie Yung-Daredevil_tv, G.I.Joe:Retaliation.This is a great action/comedy directed by Patrick Hughes, who also directed The Expendables 3. The story is not that groundbreaking but I like all the actors involved and their execution of the material. Ryan is a AAA bodyguard-his own words-until he looses a client. Then, he is demoted to body-guarding the bottom of the barrel clients. Samuel is a hit-man married to Salma, who is in prison at the moment. Gary is a Russian dictator that has been apprehended and is in the International Court of Justice, facing his crimes, but so far, nobody has lived to testify against him. Samuel gets busted and agrees to testify against Gary, if they will let Salma out of jail-he doesn't care if he himself goes to jail, as long as she goes free. Elodie is the Interpol agent in charge of getting Samuel to court on time-they have a deadline, of course-but there are leaks in the chain of command and attempts on stopping Samuel-and anyone with him-are made. Luckily, Elodie just happens to know someone that is a bodyguard and is outside of the Interpol loop-Ryan, of course-and the rest of the film is non-stop action and laughs. Ryan and Samuel do not like each other but they each have jobs to do. FYI: Since Salma is married to Samuel, she is as much of a cussing bad-ass as he is-she cusses in both English and Spanish and gets into a hellacious bar fight. As the end credits start, there is one outtake shown. It's rated ""R"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes.

The premise of this film sees a top quality bodyguard having to escort a top notch hit-man to testify against a Russian gangster. Ryan Reynolds plays the lead in this film and he is really good in this film. Sure he plays a deadpool like character in this film but he has great comedic timing and oozes charisma, and likability to make you care about his character. Samuel l Jackson plays the hit-man in this film and he is absolutely hilarious. His and Reynolds chemistry is fantastic in this film and Jackson is just great to watch having so much fun in his role and he totally owns it. Elodie young and Selma hayek player smaller roles of love interests and they both did great jobs in there roles to make there strong characters to stand out. Gary oldman plays the main villain in this film and he is pretty bland in this film, his accent fluctuates throughout the movie which is pretty funny and I feel like anybody could have played his role in the film. The story in the film is undoubtedly a lot of fun seeing these two guys going on there road trip while getting into all kinds of troubles is really fun to watch. However, this film's plot is very predictable and there isn't anything in this film that really surprised me in this film and it does hurt the film. The script as mentioned has a lot of really funny dialogue in it as Reynolds and Jackson just bounce off each other trying to outdo each other. But the dramatic dialogue does feel kind of forced to where I didn't really care as much about it. The style of this film has some pretty great action scenes in it that rivals serious action films. But this film has a problem of overstaying its welcome and being a bit too long which does hurt the last act of the film. Overall I liked this film and if you like fun action movies you should see this film.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
49,sauravjoshi85,Ryan and Samuel makes a hilarious pair.,7,27 September 2020,"The Hitman's Bodyguard is an action comedy movie directed by Patrick Hughes and stars Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson, Gary Oldman, Salma Hayek, Elodie Yung and Richard E. Grant.Two of the great actors known for their comedy and action comes together on screen and lights the screen with their hilarious action scenes, blasts, bullets flying everywhere with some high octane car chases with impeccable comic timing. Here comes 'The Hitman's Bodyguard'.The movie indeed has all the necessary ingredients to make a movie funny and entertaining. The best part of the movie is that both the male lead characters has backed and supported each other beautifully and makes a great entertaining duo.Script of the movie is predictable and weak and probably the only negative factor of the movie. Acting is superb by the two male leads but somehow I felt that Gary Oldman is a great talent and somewhat underused and could've been used much better. Screenplay is nice and gripping. Cinematography is good and action scenes are the strongest asset of the movie.Overall a good action comedy movie and with some great acting by Ryan and Samuel with some powerful action scenes will keep you engaged. The movie could've been much entertaining provided director had a good script.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
50,kirbylee70-599-526179,Killer Comedy,9,22 November 2017,"Buddy movies took over the box office for years and then suddenly died off in their frequency. My first big memory of the style was the LETHAL WEAPON films featuring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. They slowly began to lose steam but they were still enjoyable entertainment. Many more movies took on that format and ranged from great to terrible. But they slowly declined.THE Hit-man'S BODYGUARD might change that. It did decent figures at the box office and with its release on DVD this week my guess is word of mouth will have people discovering the film. The film open with Ryan Reynolds as Michael Bryce, one of the best bodyguards working for an elite firm, who has his latest protectee shot before his eyes. Fast forward 2 years and now Bryce is working for a no-level firm handling even less impactful clients. Even his girlfriend Amelia (Elodie Young) has left him as she's moved up working for Interpol.Her latest case involves transporting a high profile witness in the international trial of Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman), the ruthless dictator of Belarus. Dukhovich has been charged but never convicted because witness always seem to be killed. The witness this time around is professional hit-man Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) who agrees to testify in return for the release of his wife Sonia (Salma Hayek) from prison.Things go askew early on as the convoy transporting Kincaid to The Hague to testify is attacked leaving Amelia and Kincaid on the run. Assuming there is a mole and unable to trust anyone at Interpol Amelia calls Bryce to ask for his help, eventually forcing him into his assistance. When they meet and he recognizes Kincaid they begin to fight until Amelia can stop them. Bryce knows Kincaid is the killer behind several clients his firm once handled. Kincaid knows who Bryce is. Not they set aside their issues with one another long enough to get Kincaid to The Hague in the Netherlands.It won't be an easy task as tons of assassins meet them every step of the way in an attempt to take Kincaid out. Sounds like the makings of a hilarious comedy, no? Maybe not but the fact is in the hands of Jackson and Reynolds it is indeed that. And one that is action filled at that.Reynolds has made a career out of playing smart mouthed characters and rode that to fame when he played Deadpool in 2016. Some might even think of the character here as there is plenty of gunplay, car chases and explosions accompanied by Reynold's character cracking wise all the time. And yet he is different here. Bryce's character is troubled by that last incident he blamed on Amelia since she was the only person he shared info with. He plots out every plan in detail before following through. He's flawed, troubled and yet still the best at what he does.Jackson is Jackson. Yes, the F bomb is dropped non-stop by him here. His character is more carefree than that of Bryce. Kincaid takes life as it comes, rarely making plans and taking advantage of everything thrown his way be it a set of handcuff keys or a handgun. He has a chance to make a run for it several times but continues to his destination all because of the love he feels for his wife and his desire to see her freed.The two characters combine like oil and water as they cajole one another while on the run towards The Hague. Both have moments where they save the other and both have skills that are similar but profoundly different in how they handle the violence that comes their way. How anyone could think that they could possibly succeed is beyond the imagination of most viewers. But those of us who have seen a number of movies know the outcome far in advance. Those same people will figure out one of the major plot points as well.It would be easy to believe that a majority of stunt men made tons of money working on this film. The same would hold true for those who handle pyro techniques. There are enough explosions here to make you wonder how it has affected the ozone layer and enough gunplay to make you wonder why the industry trash talks weapons.The end result is a fun movie with plenty of action. It also has enough laughs in it to will require you to keep a finger on the pause button to let you finish a laugh now and then. It's another great example of what Reynolds and Jackson do best and that's a good thing. For me it's a movie I know I'll want to pull out every now and then to watch.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

If you are happy with this recipe then you may like The Hit-man's Bodyguard. In fairness its watchable on a very superficial level but I have to confess I became bored quite quickly. There was nothing really genuinely witty or clever about the narrative or characterisations but then to be fair, yet again, I had not expected much going in.

It doesn't have its sights set on brilliance, so when it doesn't hit that mark it doesn't really feel like a miss.The biggest negative I could throw at it is the ending.

53,AudioFileZ,Stupid Good,7,30 August 2017,"Chemistry...some movies could be great if for it. By the same token some not so good movies become much better, even quite good, when the magic between characters and actors gel. That is exactly what The Hit-man's Bodyguard has...Great chemistry between Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds. Jackson as the uber-hit-man who is imprisoned and will testify against a murdering despot and Ryan Adams as the once mighty, now low-rent, bodyguard who just might be the only chance of getting the hit-man to The Hague in order to testify. The story is about as stupid as it sounds but the two leads are superior in ""plethora"" (refer to movie dialog here) of fantastic ways. Is there any role in which Jackson can't raise the bar? And when Ryan hits a sweet spot of comedy mixed with whatever else he's bringing in a role then that too is special. Put them together firing on all cylinders as here and how can one not be entertained. Especially when there's more than a generous amount of action skillfully thrown in. If you don't get a rise out of this movie you're entirely too serious about your films and you need to get to your nearest art-house cinema as quickly as possible. Selma Hayak is great fun too in her limited screen time. This is one great dumb movie I'd highly recommend as it is such a great pairing of two actors with some truly snappy dialogue and there's a fantastic Amsterdam speedboat chase among others.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

The film is about a professional hit-man who has to deliver his arch nemesis safely to a courtroom to testify against a really bad dude. This film has good action, many laughs but the real reason this film kills it is because of the dynamic between Reynolds and Jackson. They play off each other so well. Good movies are not without their faults. The lady playing Reynold's love interest can't act. She is the same chick who brought down the stock of Netflix's Daredevil. I'm usually ahead of the game on these things; people don't see it now but they will once someone makes the mistake of casting her again in anything. Second, the main bad guy's enforcer was a lame challenge. Weak villains make a difference and can make a film unnecessarily bloated when it isn't. That is how I felt every time I saw the dude.

57,rgkarim,Place Your Guard UP for Fast Action Comedy,7,17 August 2017,"Summer movie season is starting to putter out, but the movie magic continues to trickle to get a buck out of us. This weekend tries to muster up some chuckles in the form of not one, but wo comedies that look to be more of the same. I start my weekend off with The Hit-man's Bodyguard starring the dynamic duo Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson. With dynamic comedy styles and a track list of movies behind them, one can only wonder what these two bring to the big screen this weekend. Fortunately, I have the privilege of providing that information and giving you some insight. Let's get started on another review, shall we?Likes:Soundtrack: Always good to have a soundtrack with quality music and surprisingly Hit-man's Bodyguard kills it on this aspect. Much of the music fits in with the scenes, often used as a comedic ploy to compound on the humor presented in the movie. They even managed to make the action even more exciting with the music, primarily during Black Betty's epic guitar solo. One way or another though, you may find yourself tapping your feet to the soundtrack at hand. Action: When they say action/comedy they mean action comedy alright. Hit-man's Bodyguard has edge packed into its gun happy, pro-violence run and in a variety of styles that help diversify the plot. Jackson and Reynolds, or at least their doubles, are involved in a variety of stunts that mix martial arts, weaponry mastery, and insane driving on their journey to testify. I myself had an adrenaline-fueled blast with the movie, but one fan hollered in approval at the hardcore action contained in this film, despite how illogical, unrealistic, or death defying they were. And as a note, the camera work is quite stable to pull off an approval from yours truly. Comedy: The leading component of this film though, is the comedy loaded in to the firearm that is this film. I found myself laughing for most of the movie at the writing this film had. The screenplay writers had a field day with the dialogue of this film, stretching their minds to deliver lines worthy of cheap laughs to witty gold. I certainly enjoyed the entire spectrum in this movie, but really enjoyed the timing of the jokes and the delivery from the two leading actors, especially Jackson, sold the line for full price. While certainly not the best writing to grace Hollywood, Hit-man's Bodyguard hits some balance that other comedies ignores. Dislikes:Jokes grow stale: Despite all the antics packed into this pistol, many of the potshots are crafted into the same mold and fired so rapidly that they quickly lose their punch. Reynolds' angles are the biggest victim of going stale and becoming more eye rolling/annoying than gut busting. I have to agree with my fellow reviewers in how the movie is relentlessly throwing jokes at you during the film and it gets tiring after a while, especially when interrupting the more serious moments. Gary Oldman's character: Oldman is a master of playing those grittier roles and he didn't shy away from the communist leader role in this film. Sadly, the villains have little bite, reduced to threatening facial gestures (amidst unimpressive makeup), a few grandiose speeches, and oh yes, a running scene. The worst part though has to be the accent and direction Oldman gave the character, which sounded forced, stretched, and uncommitted to the character at hand. This protagonist was boring and outside Oldman's normal range, leaving the flunkies to bring the pain. Had they focused on his lieutenant a little more, we may have had a real ringer. Jackson's catchphrase: I know, you get Jackson, you often get a certain phrase alongside him, and Hit-man's Bodyguard is no exception. This film is relentless with their cursing, focusing on the magical F word and all its iterations as the primary ammunition for comedy. Jackson in particular goes overboard with these words and while funny at times, gets old after a while. Salma Hayek's cameo was a welcome change to the mix, but with the lazy writing and merchandising off this word, I can't get on board with their overuse. To quote the movie, Jackson may be destroying the MF phrase, which is hard to do. The Verdict:I had fun with Hit-man's Bodyguard and enjoying the approach this movie took with comedy and action. It's go simplistic, unoriginal stunts that are predictable, but it is nicely executed keep your heart pumping. In addition, the laughs are nicely integrated into the film to go along with the pace of the movie and not diverging down the slow, unnecessary paths that most do. Still, it's not the most unique movie to grace the theaters and like many films is unable to obtain that balance of using their gimmicks. Throw in the over utilization of the F word and wellyou see where it gets panned on. Still, it is an enjoyable ride for a movie venture, but your money many be better spent elsewhere.

60,Kingslaay,Funny and enjoyable,7,3 September 2017,The Hit-man's Bodyguard was enjoyable and fun to watch. The film never tries too hard to take itself seriously and doesn't expect its viewers to do so either. The very premise of the film indicates this with the ironic and comedic twist of the hit-man needing a bodyguard to put away a corrupt and dangerous politician. Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L Jackson give great performances and their acting seems effortless. The chemistry is evident and works well as the two try to follow their own agendas. The humor was great and delivered well but the film perhaps could have done with more humor as all the ingredients were there. This film is not going to win any major awards but its aim is to entertain its audience and it does just that. 7/10,The Hitman's Bodyguard
61,bkrauser-81-311064,Formulaic and Weak,6,10 August 2017,"If all you're looking for an early August action comedy that's Rush Hour (1998) without the kung fu or Midnight Run (1988) with ten times more uses of the word ""mother**ker,"" then boy is there a movie out there for you; for while The Hit-man's Bodyguard can't exactly be accused for being boring, it can be docked a couple of points for being an unoriginal Hollywood calculation. One where the algebra is wholly dependent on the charisma of its two leads. Story, side characters, pointnothing else really matters so buckle up.Ryan Reynolds is Michael Bryce, a down-on-his luck bodyguard, forced by an ex (Yung) to transport an important court witness. But when he arrives, he discovers that star witness is none other than Darius Kincaid (Jackson) the world's most deadly assassin. Now with half of Eastern Europe hot on their heels, Ryan Reynolds discovers that being the bodyguard of a hit-man turned informant is no easy task. Ryan Reynold is – The Hit-man's Bodyguard.Now if that doesn't sound like a plot cooked up and belched out by the 90's trailer narrator guy then I've got a couple of Jim Belushi movies for you to check out. The movie, its characters, its story beats all feel second rate, and that's despite what feels like a record being set for establishing shots - forcing a European tinge every time our central duo drives here or there. When the weak script does manage to cobble enough for a show-stopping set-piece, what's placed on the screen feels like lost action scenes from This Means War (2012). Something tells me we have Windows Moviemaker to thank for all the car explosions.Of course a lot of this can be forgiven, provided Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds deliver the goods in quips, jabs and one-liners. And while it'd be nice to say these two infinitely charismatic actors knock it out of the park, the plain truth is neither is really playing to their strength. Jackson is pigeonholed as a well-meaning but sloppy assassin whose utilitarian swagger, he argues justifies his questionable actions. His Kincaid is certainly a far cry from Jules in Pulp Fiction (1994) and more akin to Denzel Washington in Safe House (2012) on maximum f**k it (a movie which coincidentally starred Ryan Reynolds protecting a fugitive).Ryan Reynolds on the other hand is, once again, cast as a fussy, beleaguered do-gooder who's in over his head and constantly put upon, but manages to pull through because he tries really, really hard! The results are pretty much the same as R.I.P.D. (2013) and The Proposal (2009) which is to say, near the best part of the movie but NOT his strengths. I don't get it – he's more than proved himself as a roguish leading man, so when the hell are they going to finally let his Van Wilder (2002) freak flag fly? The rest of the cast doesn't fare any better. Gary Oldman is very much slumming it as a genocidal Belarusian President while Salma Hayek is given near nothing to do as Kincaid's incarcerated wife. Elodie Yung's character does have a little more bearing on the plot but her early promise as a capable Interpol agent is set aside so she can be honored with the role of the proverbial last act love prize.As formulaic as The Hit-man's Bodyguard is, at least it doesn't hide its hackneyed plot with a sardonic tone. It's light – perhaps too light for all the blood-splatter involved – but it never purposely insults its audience by say, trying to haphazardly explain why Samuel L. Jackson can take a bullet to the leg then jump a multistory building like it's nothing. It's dumb but it never makes you feel dumb for watching it.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

64,arungeorge13,Another brainless actioner that stays afloat thanks to its charismatic leads! [+50%],5,30 August 2017,"There is very little to brag about in terms of originality when it comes to ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" other than its pairing of Samuel L Jackson as a hit-man who never misses his targets, and Ryan Reynolds as his fortuitous bodyguard.Patrick Hughes, fresh off the sleazy CGI-filled The Expendables 3 repeats his fluidic style of staging one set-piece after another that seems to exhibit diminishing returns when it comes to the ""fun- quotient"". For an action movie, this one peaks when there's no 'action'. Instead, what engrosses is the mostly MF-bomb dropping, no F's given repartee between the two men. The story is basically an excuse for the various set-pieces, and same goes for much of the supporting cast. Gary Oldman's character is a one-note (cardboard) villain who doesn't get to showcase his solid acting chops at all. Hughes inserts flashback sequences that act as speed-breakers in an otherwise fast-paced film which doesn't allow the viewer to think twice. There's a softening glow given to some of the daylight frames. The action is a mix of practical and CGI but it sort of feels like more work has been done on the computer desk than at the sets. Jackson still manages to retain his charismatic self while playing the hit-man Darius Kincaid, while Reynolds is perfect foil. If anything excites you in the movie, it's their unusual camaraderie. But director Hughes is keen to wedge in almost every single cliché associated with films as these, in order to lend a cinematic consistency to the flick that requires its viewers to switch off their brains completely. Certain segments which had the potential of making the audience laugh-out-loud (such as the 'road trip' in the car, the chance encounter with the nuns, and the Amsterdam safe- house sequence) ultimately end up half-baked at best. The womenfolk (Elodie Yung and Salma Hayek) unfortunately have very little to do, other than scream, shout and do a little arse-kicking.Verdict: One time (throw-away) watch.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
65,Screen_Blitz,Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson boasts a solid comedic chemistry that is sadly overshadowed by an overhaul of bombastic action flair,6,30 November 2017,"This buddy action comedy, directed by Patrick Hughes of action thriller 'The Expendables 3', aims for achieve nothing particularly special other than to exhibit a sweet laugh-out-loud chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson as they pick up their guns for an adrenaline-fueled action foray that feels like a throwback to old-fashioned buddy cop flicks. The film is just about everything you can expect from your average buddy action comedy, and the kind that forces you to leave your brain at the door in order to observe the absurdity that transpires on screen. Nonetheless, it is a fairly forgettable one where the action greatly trumps over the laughter uprooted from the comedic flair from its charismatic stars. Ryan Reynolds has boasts comedic talent not too long ago as the merc-of-the-mouth anti-hero 'Deadpool', while Samuel L. Jackson has continued waved around his charisma for the past two decades' but perhaps this film shows him doing one of their least remarkable works. This film follows Michael Bryce (played by Ryan Reynolds), a triple A bodyguard who's career is shunned after an escort of a Japanese client went horribly wrong. Now demoted to a lower-level agent, Bryce is enlisted by his ex-lover and Interpol agent Emelia (played by Elodie Yung) to transport a ruthless assassin Darius Kincaid (played by Samuel L. Jackson) from Manchester, England to the Hague to testify against a sadistic Belarusian mobster (played by Gary Oldman) in court in exchange to free his jailed wife (played by Salma Hayek). The mission quickly turns into a wild barrage of dodging bullets and mowing down the bad guys as the whole ordeal spins dangerously out of control. As formulaic as it is, the film roars with a total blast for anyone who can get past the derivative nature of the plot which proceeds with a wildly inconsistent tone, often alternating between loud and cheery and uncomfortably dark, particularly when Gary Oldman shows up on screen and murders a mother and her child in cold blood. When it comes to engaging in bombastic action sequences, Patrick Hughes executes these pieces in a solidly choreographed methodology that allows viewers to relish in the frenetic atmosphere without suffering an eye-sore from erratic quick-cut editing. Cars flipping, gun firing, bullets riddling bodies to swiss cheese, and vehicles exploding into a fiery fury; just about everything you complete the playbook of action flick chestnuts. The chemistry between Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds is less of a triumph. Hammering in the biggest laughs is Jackson, channeling his usual loud-mouth persona while maintaining a dim-witted personality, while Reynolds resorts is his average everyday character who's blindsided by Jackson's seemingly nonstop antics that threaten to get them both blown away by an endless array of bullets. When pairing these two together, their chemistry only half works, and does little to compete with the overarching number of one-liners that fall flat. Salma Hayek has a few good moments, but their shortage of screen time only leaves you wishing she shared a little more time in the spotlight to compensate for the shallow command that is delivered from Reynolds and Jackson. As funny and charismatic as they try to be, the duo only ends up overstaying their welcome before they reach the third act. The Hit-man's Bodyguard is, at times, funny and exhilarating to relish in, but perhaps far from the actors' most remarkable works, and leaves you only desiring for something much more. This is not a bad movie, but it is not exactly a great on either, especially when consider far more superior action comedies in recent years. Thus, low expectations is best warranted.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

If there was something in this movie that wasn't completely stupid I must have been busy eating or drinking. At least 300 people probably die in the course of this ""comedy action thriller"" although I'd call it a psychopathic orgy of hyper-violence. I always say that if the trailer has more than one explosion the film is a mess. This more than meets that definition of a mess. It just goes from shoot-out to chase scene to fight to another shoot-out and then back around again.

Story 1.25: Direction 1.50: Pace 1.75: Acting 1.00: Enjoyment 1.00
Total 6.50 out of 10.00.Now, this film is your atypical Hollywood blockbuster.The trouble with this is the usual Hollywood laziness comes along with it. And, in this picture, it comes in the form of the cast.The story that Tom O'Connor gives us is a well structured, interesting, and entertaining tale. I loved the idea that a hitman would require a bodyguard. This notion was one of the main draws of the movie. Fortunately, the director doesn't detract from the narrative too much. So the story goes that an incarcerated hitman, Darius Kinkaid, has evidence to put away a war criminal, Vladislav Dukhovich. All he's requesting for his testimony is the safe release of his imprisoned wife. So off goes Darius with his Interpol forces set off to the hearing. Of course, things go very awry and only the head Interpol Agent, Amelia Roussell, and Darius are left standing. She decides to bring in Michael Bryce, a ""Tripple A"" graded protection agent.Will they make it to the court on time... or will Vlad's armed forces win the day... or will they kill each other.For the most part, Patrick Hughes' direction is more than passible. Where he excels the most is in constructing the pace, tension, and excitement in the fight and chase scenes. I say for the most part because there are times where he could have done more. For example, in the segment where Darius tells Michael how he came to meet his wife Hughes' drops the ball. In the scene, Darius watches as Sonia takes care of some frisky barflies. Her fight is ignored for a horrible shot of Darius, all gooey-eyed slurping his cocktail through a straw. I know this is supposed to be humorous but it isn't. It didn't even raise a smile. What would have been better would be to see Sonia really kicking ass, while in the background you have soppy Darius.Another reason this scene fails is the reason why Salma Hayek was chosen for Sonia... Boobs and Bum. Yep, that appears to be the only reason. There is no great depth to this character and she's not on screen for too long. Then when she is all we get is load screaming obscenities. At least Hayek shows her talent at being bilingual.At this point, I have to give respect to the people involved in, and who choreographed, the fight and chase sequences. These are some of the best on-screen.Now the major reason this film starts to fail is, as mentioned with Salma Hayek, the incorrect use of your stars. The casting crew stuck to their stereotyped bibles on how to recruit actors. We need a character to be a hard-drinking, potty-mouthed, bad-ass... I know Samual Jackson. Now we need a self-centred sarcastic wallower... Ryan Reynolds.For one moment use your imagination and make Darius the bodyguard and Michael the hitman and the pair's dynamics change considerably. Reynolds becomes the bad-ass interjecting MF between every other word. While Samuels becomes the whiney self-loathing good guy. This in itself would have been worth watching.It would be nice to see Samuels in a different style of Hollywood role. He can do it. Watch Black Snake Moan and Unthinkable.That said the cast do their job and what the director asks of them and they are okay. I just wanted more. This is the reason I like the more independent movies.That said, Gary Oldman as Vladislav is the strongest actor within the cast. He does try to add different characterisms to his portrayals. It may have been an idea to have a couple of extra scenes with him, just to build the deplorability of his character.If you like your action films to have a good story-line. And you like Ryan Reynolds to play Ryan Reynolds and Samuel Jackson to play Samuel Jackson... and you remember Salma Hayek fondly in her costume in From Dusk 'till Dawn... then this movie is for you.It is an enjoyable romp, though a destructive one, through Europe. And in the time of Lockdown Part 2, it's a great way to waste a couple of hours. Plus it's showing on Film4.Now race on over to my The Game Is Afoot list to see where this Odd Couple crashed into my rankings.Take Care & Stay Well.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
70,maurice_yacowar,Antagonistic hit-man and bodyguard find harmony,8,14 September 2017,"The Hit-man's Bodyguard draws on the classic romantic comedy plot where two bickering opposites discover harmony in each other. It was familiar safe even back when Shakespeare unleashed Beatrice and Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing (circa 1598; wow, even before TV). Antagonists become lovers. Or at least adequate room-mates, e.g. all The Odd Couples.Hit-man Kincaid kills the famous and ace security agent Bryce protects them. That makes them opposites, with Bryce apparently enjoying the moral superiority. They have a violent history, with complications. Kincaid accidentally wounded Bryce in one assignment. When Kincaid stumbled into another target and scored a miraculous hit on a Japanese drug-dealer, he unwittingly ruined Bryce's confidence and career. Also his love-life, because Bryce assumed the killing of his client was due to his lover Amelia's betrayal. In this narrative Amelia — an Interpol officer— coerces Bryce into guarding the notorious Kincaid to ensure his testimony against a Russian crime boss at The Hague. Kincaid finds any security assistants an unnecessary encumbrance. He does better on his own. He survives all the massive assaults that eliminate his other guards. There are many.Of course the two antagonists develop a respect and affection for each other. Indeed Kincaid acknowledges his unwanted partner's effectiveness. He also helps Bryce win back Amelia, first by unheeded counsel, then by persuading her. Kincaid dangerously pauses his own mission to save the captured Bruce from torture. So the mercenary serial killer has a heart. He even his own romantic weak spot, the wild Sonia, who has been jailed as a trap for Kincaid. Only to secure her release does he agree to testify. Both women are strong. Amelia fights off an attack by her boss, the Russian mole. Kincaid meets Sonia when she wins a (co-ed) Mexican bar fight. She is best defined later, when she sits in the serenity of the Lotus position while spewing obscenities at Kincaid's absence and at the men responsible for it. Sonia is so dominant her larger cell-mate cowers in the corner whenever commanded. Both men are given the strong women to assure the viewer that there's nothing effeminate in their bromance. America's penchant for tightly-bonded male heroes often suggests a suppressed homosexual relationship, from Tom and Huck down to Starsky and Hutch, Butch and Sundance, etc., etc. They're given at least one hetero interest to absolve them. Kincaid's virtue is telegraphed by the tattoo on his neck and arm. The image of crows departing a skeletal tree evokes his first kill. We see that tree and birds when the teen-age Kincaid murders the brute who killed Kincaid's pastor father. That set Kincaid's career path. The tattoo counteracts the Biblical mark of Cain, which brands the murderer as evil. This contract killer snuffs only the evil, whom the supposed hero Bryce is paid to protect. The moral advantage has shifted. This intelligent comic thriller has two driving energies. One is the virtually non-stop physical action, the chases and attacks. The other is the verbal intensity, comic, profane, often graphically poetic. Both advance the bonding of apparent but not true opposites.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

72,one9eighty,A fun film that caught me off guard,8,12 February 2020,"Ryan Reynolds plays a hot-shot bodyguard but he's left distraught as a high profile client is assassinated while under protection. Samuel L. Jackson plays an assassin who's been captured by European law enforcement agencies. He knows secrets that would bring down an Eastern European dictator, played by Gary Oldman. It's important that Jackson is brought safely to the Hague so he can help bring down Oldman legally. Unfortunately Oldman has moles in lots of places and he orchestrates a plan to have Jackson knocked off so he can't stand trial. Reynolds is brought in as a last resort to protect Jackson.This is a buddy action comedy that's as much tongue in cheek for humour, as it is packed to the brim with explosive action, car chases, gun fights and general mayhem. Filmed all across Euro the settings are beautiful and really add a bit of class to the film. This is never going to win awards for as a thinking-man's film, but it will entertain you if all you want to do if kick back and enjoy senseless emersion and suspension of disbelief. Prior to watching it I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it, it seemed like this is the kind of film that has been made every couple of years, but Reynolds and Jackson really worked well and had good chemistry.

76,RforFilm,"It may be another Midnight Run style story, The Hit-man's Bodyguard has plenty of action and laughs for me to say it was fun",7,17 August 2017,"How many of you have seen the movie Midnight Run? It was an action comedy staring Robert De Nero and Charles Grodin about a law enforcer trying to escort someone somewhere while being pursued by enemies that want the one being protected dead. Even if you haven't seen the latter movie, this is a premise that has been used for several movies. We see this a lot as it not only allows for a buddy road movie, but it's easy to write in action sequences. Just take a couple of cars, let them chase each other wherever they are, and you probably have a product that people are going to like.Now how this works depends on the players you have. One of my favorite road movies is still Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. Steve Martin and John Candy had great characters and a script that allowed a lot of play between the uptight and slob personalities. While there's no guide on how to do this right, it seems that everyone can agree that the two stars have to have conflicting characteristics in order to generate better comedy. For The Hit-man's Bodyguard, we get a combination of the large personalities of Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson. Triple A rated agent Michael Bryce (played by Ryan Reynolds) was once in demand before he let one of his clients get assassinated. He know tends to protect drug addicted Wall Street types only for the money. He's given a chance for redemption when he's asked to transport a skilled hit-man Darius Kincaid (played by Samuel L. Jackson) from the United Kingdom to the International Court of Justice to stand and testify for an eastern European dictator Vladidlav Dukhovich (played by Gary Oldman). Daris agrees to be there when he's told that if he does so, they will release his wife.Upon heading out, Michael realizes that he has more trouble then he realizes, as Darius is impulsive and would rather take the trip alone. To top it off, many of the dictators agents are after Darius, knowing that with him dead, the leader remains in power. Michael and Darius have several mishaps, close calls, all the stuff you'd expect out of this story.Something like The Hit-man's Bodyguard will seem like a scenario that's been done to death unless it has something new to offer. This does as both Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson make for a fun team. While I can' say their playing fully developed characters, they both separate themselves enough to give them a clear grounding for their comedy. I can say that I laughed plenty times to say that this was fun. I would even argue that this is so self aware of how tired this plot device is, this may be a parody is disguise. I take that back, this IS a parody, as many moments are enjoyably over-the-top. The action sequences are staged well, especially a boat chase in Amsterdam that made me realize that I haven't seen that before in that European location.What prevents this from being great are two things. First, I'd say that the climax goes on a little long as we get another ""liar revealed"" plot that separates the characters for a bit. This can be done well, but in the case for The Hit-man's Bodyguard, it flat out stops the story until they can reunite. Couldn't they have skipped this? They already seem to know the Midnight Run story line is being reused, so you'd think they'd known better. Secondly, the tones can sometimes be uneven. It's not too much, but there are some parts that would fit a Mel Brooks movie more then this. I'll give this seven The Bodyguard posters out of ten. This movie is enjoyably fine. It's certainly not great, but there's nothing wrong with that. I could see myself watching this again with a group of friends. On my own, I'd have to see what else was one before settling. If you don't like the Midnight Run story, then your probably not going to like this, but I think everyone will get what they expect. Check it out and see if it has enough to make it its own thing.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Jackson chews every scene that he is in while (very) frequently sprinkling in his trademark ""mother-trucker"" lines in each scene (though the word is not ""trucker"").There is not much new here.  The plot and destination is irrelevant (and Gary Oldman professionally mails in his ""bad guy"" role to emphasize just how irrelevant it is).  It is the JOURNEY to the destination that matters and like other ""mis-matched folks on the run"" films like MIDNIGHT RUN, this one creates a journey that is well worth watching.  The pair in the lead are terrific together, and play off each other well.  The action is ""good enough"" (but, again, nothing new) and by the end, I found myself rooting for these two - and had a good time along the way.Special notice should be made of Salma Hayek who does her best Samuel L. Jackson imitation in the role of SLJ's wife, trying to match him beat for beat (or ""mother-trucker"" for ""mother-trucker"") and, while she doesn't always succeed, it is fun to watch her try.A very enjoyable - if forgettable - way to spend a few hours.Letter Grade:  B7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",The Hitman's Bodyguard

80,dave-mcclain,Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds go Dutch!,8,18 August 2017,"For your consideration for Best Titled Film of 2017 (an award I made up), ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" (R, 1:58). That title says it all in three words – the story is about a hit-man and his bodyguard. More importantly, the juxtaposition of character archetypes (the hit-man who takes life and the bodyguard who preserves it) is intriguing enough to interest many Movie Fans – especially with Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson in their first film together.Plus, there are the cinematic memories the title brings to mind. There have been numerous movies with the word ""hit-man"" in their titles and others with a hit-man or two as main characters (some of the best: the ""John Wick"" series, ""Run All Night"", ""The Iceman"", ""In Bruges"", ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", ""Collateral"", ""Road to Perdition"", ""The Jackal"", ""Assassins"", ""Léon: The Professional "", ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Point of No Return""). All of those contribute pretty well to the images that come to mind when we hear the first part of this film's title.When we get to ""bodyguard"", there are also many movies with that word in the title – along with some about secret service agents (""Olympus Has Fallen"", ""In the Line of Fire"", ""Guarding Tess"") – and one futuristic bodyguard – in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". The one bodyguard movie that has the most to do with this film is from '92, because of the plot and because one of the movie posters for this one features a blue-tinted image of one of the stars carrying the other, like Kevin Costner carrying Whitney Houston in the poster for ""The Bodyguard"". So, is this one as much fun as that tongue-in-cheek marketing homage implies? For the most part, yes! Michael Bryce (Reynolds) used to be one of the most sought-after bodyguards on the planet, with a reputation second to none. That is, until he lost a high-profile client. Now the only work he can get is protecting relative unknowns like Richard E. Grant's coked-up businessman-on-the-run. Bryce is still one of the best at what he does, but few will go so far as to trust him with their lives – or with the life of someone important who really needs protecting – unless they're really desperate. INTERPOL agent Amelia Roussel (Élodie Yung) is just that desperate. When her efforts to get jailed hit-man Darius Kincaid (Jackson) from London to the Netherlands are compromised, she calls the only person whom she can trust – at least, with this situation. Complicating matters, she hates him, because she used to date him. Actually, no one in this high-stakes threesome really wants to be around the others, but they need each other. Amelia was dumped by Bryce two years earlier because he believed she betrayed a confidence, leading him to lose that client. She claims she didn't do anything of the sort, so she has hard feelings. When Bryce sees Amelia, he is reminded of his professional fall from grace – and of the love he lost. But he's willing to endure the painful memories and put his life on the line in exchange for Amelia's promise to help him get his AAA executive protection rating back. For his part, Kincaid doesn't think Amelia and her INTERPOL buddies are capable of protecting him, but he has to play by their rules in order to get his beloved, tough-as-nails wife, Sonia (Salma Hayek), out of prison. That's part of a deal he made in exchange for his testimony against the President of the former Soviet Republic of Belarus, Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman), in his war crimes trial. But when Bryce arrives at the INTERPOL safe house, he and Kincaid recognize each other as long-time rivals, two sides of the same dirty coin, and they almost kill each other right then and there. They can hardly abide each other, but each kind of needs the other. Amelia leaves Bryce to the task of getting Kincaid to the International Criminal Court in time for his testimony (in about 24 hours), while she goes back to INTERPOL to try to find and plug that leak. Dukhovich's henchmen, led by the brutally determined Ivan (Yuri Kolokolnikov), catch up with Bryce and Kincaid – early and often. As this lethal odd couple (two men with similar skills but very different approaches to life and love) make their way to the Hague, they use (and ruin) multiple vehicles and get into gun battles and close quarters combat on city streets, down country roads and through the avenues and waterways of Amsterdam, leaving a high body count behind, but never far from danger. ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" is indeed a hit – and deservedly so. The plot is far-fetched (one down-on-his-luck protection agent called upon to escort the only man standing between a war criminal's conviction and his freedom – and so much power and so many resources at the disposal of that eastern European strongman), but most Movie Fans won't mind. This film has a great soundtrack – with songs from the 60s-90s – plus a song written and sung by Jackson himself! – and makes fantastic use of those Dutch locations – setting its impressive action against its beautiful countryside and cityscapes. The action is exciting and virtually non-stop, the car chases are creative and thrilling and the two stars really make this film work. Their comedic chemistry is undeniable, even though Jackson is playing his usual bad-ass with a wicked sense of humor and Reynolds gives us his patented smart-ass with a heart, all while Oldman drags out his often-employed Russian accent and shows us a more powerful version of his ""Air Force One"" terrorist. It's all good – especially if you like action movies, along with a sense of humor. ""A-""",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung) is assigned to protect a prolific hit-man Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) as he is set to testify against a brutal Russian dictator Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman). Kincaid only agrees to go along with Interpol because they have his wife Sonia (Salma Hayek).When the convoy transporting Darius is attacked, he must flee with Agent Roussel to a safe house. Roussel used to date Bryce and she turns to him when she realizes there is a mole within Interpol. Bryce blames Roussel for the failure of his protection agency and the lowering of his rating plus he has had constant battles with Kincaid on previous jobs to make this assignment particularly unpleasant. Still, he agrees to take the job and the two escape the safe house hunted by Interpol and Dukhovich's men. Bryce sticks with a plan while Kincaid takes each moment as it comes constant drinking and mistakenly taking a goon's cell phone so they are easily tracked. The banter between Reynolds and Jackson helps move along the comedic parts between the action scenes. The shootouts and car chases steadily grow as Dukhovich's henchman Ivan (Yuri Kolokolnikov) moves closer to his target.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",The Hitman's Bodyguard

85,abisio,Two hours of smart laughs and realistic action; pure outstanding fun,10,18 August 2017,"The plot of two people running from killers who dislike each other has been done too many times (remember Midnight Run ?) but still you can get a lot of out it with the rights actors, a good script and direction. This time we have here to very good actors that are enjoying the fun as much as the spectator. Usually the script use one dumb and one ""macho"" character; but what happens when you put two ""machos"" both very smart but with some sentimental issues; do not think is serious; it is just for fun and that is what you get.Ryan Reynolds as the bodyguard is the serious part (and sometimes the dumb one) while Samuel Jackson is the hit-man (the target ); both are really good actors and both are really fun to watch (the chemistry between them is perfect) and incredible; it is Jackson who gets the funnier bits most of the time.In any case; they are not alone. We have a Salma Hayek that will make you laugh whenever she is on screen and deserves as much credit as the two male characters.If something could have improved is not giving more lines to Gary Oldman and Joaquim de Almeida; both are also excellent actors that could make an already excellent movie even better.In brief; go with your other half (and with kids if you do not mind the strong language and some gory but briefs parts) and enjoy; nobody will regret it.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
86,bob-the-movie-man,A plethora of clichés,6,23 August 2017,"2017's summer blockbusters fizzle to a halt with this formulaic action comedy. Ryan Reynolds (""Deadpool"") plays Michael Bryce: a cocksure ""Triple A rated"" bodyguard, always planning three steps ahead so that he can protect his clients without killing anyone in the process. With such arrogance, a fall is inevitable. On the other side of the legal scales is Darius Kincaid (Samuel L Jackson,  ""The Hateful Eight""), a contract killer who always gets his man. But the incarcerated Kincaid is offered a deal to release his equally incarcerated wife Sonia (Selma Hayek) in return for testifying against the fearsome Belarus president Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes""), on trial for war crimes at The Hague. An Interpol team led by Bryce's's ex-squeeze Amelia Roussel (the striking Elodie Yung) now have to get Kincaid to Belgium unscathed with Dukhovich's well-trained and well- armed thugs stopping at nothing to ensure he won't be there to testify. Fate transpires that Bryce and Kincaid become an unlikely team in trying to bring Dukhovich to justice. This is a movie whose script seems to have been glued together from a patchwork of other movie scenes:the bad guy / bad guy partner relationship of ""The Nice Guys"". Check.the street ambush of ""Clear and Present Danger"". Check.the Amsterdam boat chase of ""Puppet on a Chain"". Check.the comedic bar-room brawl from ""Airplane"". Check.Many of the action scenes are done with panache and some great stunt work. But it's all stuff we've seen countless times before, so what is needed for differentiation is the relationships between Bryce and Kincaid: this needs to be the cornerstone of the film. But it just doesn't quite work. Jackson's contribution is never in doubt, even though we've seen this motherf-ing shtick  countless times before: he's still magnetic, charismatic and a joy to watch. But unfortunately Reynolds just doesn't deliver the acting goods to make the banter believable: there is a reason ""Deadpool"" is his best film - he wears a mask for most of it! His 'puppy-dog look' gets rolled out multiple times, but it's unconvincing in the extreme. Together they are no match for Gosling/Crowe in ""The Nice Guys"".On firmer ground is the quirky relationship between Mr and Mrs Kincaid. Although sharing limited screen time together, Hayek and Jackson spark off each other wonderfully. Seeing Selma Hayek in uncharacteristically sweary and belligerent mode was highly entertaining (although it's worth commenting that my wife took great offence to the 'comic' bullying of an overweight cellmate).Elsewhere in the acting roll call, Elodie Yung delivers just the right measure of cuteness, toughness and passion as Roussel, but Oldman delivers a full-on retread of his Ivan ""Get off my plane"" Korshunov from ""Air Force One"". There is also a change to Oldman's character's face at the end of the film in the form of a rampant skin complaint which is 'explained' by a clumsily inserted news item about an ""attempted poisoning"": it's such a clunky and bizarre addition to the script that it made me wonder whether the actor has some unexpected ailment (like shingles) during filming.... but I can see nothing related to this online.  The screenplay by relative newcomer Tom O'Connor bumps along from implausible action scene to implausible action scene, with more that its fair share of 'WTF' moments. For example, after a random chase through multiple Amsterdam alleys and shops, Jackson pulls up outside the very DIY shop Reynolds ends up in to pick him up! The script is also tonally uneven throughout: given this is supposed to be an ""action comedy"" the action is often brutal and unpleasant and the comedy - in the main - just not funny enough. (About the funniest thing in the film are the most ineffective sub machine guns known to man, most notably in the mildly ludicrous, if well staged, boat chase scene!) The film also manages to offend, in more ways than the 15-rated violence and language used: I'm not sure WHEN this movie was actually filmed, but the use of an articulated lorry as a terrorist weapon towards the end of the film is certainly in very poor taste after the events of Nice, London and Barcelona. Not appreciated.Directed by Patrick Hughes (""The Expendables 3"".... say no more) this hodge-podge of a flick is sporadically entertaining, but is one I will struggle to remember in a couple of months time. (For the full graphical review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com.

87,kuarinofu,2 hours of pure enjoyment,8,24 February 2018,"This movie was advertised as a funny buddy-style action comedy and it sure had delivered some good laughs and cool real stunts with tons of action.Reynolds and good old Samuel L. J. are having lots of fun on set and they are channeling the fun through their performances. The movie is long but it never gets boring. It has lots of buddy comedy cliches, some of them are handled differently intentionally to provide some great comedy. They knew perfectly what they were doing.The action was intense and very well shot. It's so good to see good old real world stunts compared to mostly CGI-ish stunts of today's action movies. Amazing car chases, totally lethal though, but you have to sacrifice realism and ease your brain to be able to enjoy such movies. Time to time the green screen was a little noticeable, but it's ok.The story of course has a ton of stupid stuff but who cares, really. This was not made to be taken very seriously, obviously. The movie never tried to be something it's not. The only thing that felt a little off was the tone change in scenes, it's like some comedy scenes mixed with violence involving minors and terrorism. This really blurred the line between violence, death and everything else. Overall, I remember enjoying Rush Hour what, like 20 years ago? This brought the good old memories and gave them some new flavor. Definitely a good pick to watch with friends or solo, really helped me with my depression.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

90,msbreviews,Rating: C+,5,10 September 2017,"This is the type of film from which I always expect to receive a fun bit of entertainment. I know that I'm not going to watch a masterpiece, but I also hope it's not a waste of my time. Well, The Hit-man's Bodyguard isn't exactly a good movie, but it's also not a major letdown.Easy to say that the standouts are undoubtedly the performances of Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson. As a film critic, there are always some aspects of a movie that I already know that they're going to be great. I mean, who goes into a film with RR and SLJ and expect them to shank their acting?! Fun fact: their chemistry is awesome and it carries the whole thing.Samuel L. Jackson might even have the best lines of the script. It's funny how he plays a more relaxed and cool guy, while Reynolds portrays a very meticulous and careful type of special bodyguard. Usually, they play the other one's role so it's somehow interesting to see the relationship between their characters evolve. Ryan Reynolds is also hilarious, as he has been in his most recent movies. Honestly, they basically play an exaggerated version of their public personas in real life.Nevertheless, their characters are surprisingly well-developed. Their backstories are compelling and they justify well enough why they followed their respective career paths. They're mostly showed in well-edited and captivating flashbacks that never seem out of place, so kudos to you, Patrick Hughes.Elodie Yung (Amelia Roussel) proves that she deserves more roles in big-budget features because she's really great in this one. Gary Oldman is good as the villain, but here is where the screenplay starts to crumble. It's yet another cliché villain with no real motivations to do what he's doing and he doesn't even appear in the film that much. In addition to this, he's the main reason why the tone is so unbalanced since it feels a completely different movie every time he shows up. The script quickly jumps from a ""buddy-cop"" comedy to someone shooting a child ... Off-screen. Still, that happens.The humor has its ups and downs. There are some good chuckles here and there, but some jokes just fall entirely flat. When they do work, it's mainly due to the excellent job of the cast that is able to pull them off. The action is fine, there are a bunch of cool chasing scenes (the ones through Amsterdam are indeed pretty great), but their editing lacks quality. In some shots, I can even see the stunt man driving the car, but thankfully the sequences are long enough to make me kind of forget those mistakes.I praised Elodie Yung's performance and I keep that compliment. However, she's connected to one of my main issues with the protagonists' essence. Both Darius and Michael are who they are due to the love that they had in their lives, but once they show how the romances started, everything stops making sense. It's so cliché that it even becomes unrealistic and it's by far the laziest section of the screenplay in the whole film. Literally, it's like they ""bumped into each other and fell in love"" kind of romances.Following that train of thought, this isn't groundbreaking. It's an action-comedy in its raw, predictable form. Fifteen minutes into the movie and I already knew the entire plot, so obviously every attempt to elevate the suspense or tension in a scene, fails miserably, also due to extreme foreshadowing. Consequently, the first half of the film drags a lot and it becomes a bit boring, but the action-heavy third act partially compensates the previously wasted time. Patrick Hughes should have reduced the runtime by 20-25 minutes, at least.All in all, The Hit-man's Bodyguard doesn't disappoint me, but it also doesn't exceed my expectations. Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson carry the whole thing, either by pulling off some fine jokes or by perfectly portraying some surprisingly well-explored characters. However, both the plot and the villain follow every cliché in the book, as well as the unrealistic love stories that are so important to the main characters' personalities (Elodie Yung is great, though). The first half of the movie drags too much, consequently stretching the runtime too much, but it's still a movie that most audiences will fairly enjoy.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

The chase scene in Amsterdam were perfectly put in scene and contained some of the best moments of the year - action wise. Ryan Reynolds was very good and perfectly cast. He had the right comedic timing and charisma for that kind of role. Samuel L. Jackson obviously loved playing that role that gave him the chance to make fun of his own image. It worked. His performance was really something else here, not the usual stuff he does in action films more comedies, he really added a lot of personality to the character. Good job. Gary Oldman was fine as the villain but rather wasted. Obviously a paycheck job. But at least he had quite a good scene towards the ending. The soundtrack was great, the action choreography excellent. It had some really graphic scenes which was surprising but definitely working. Fine and fun direction. Definitely a film to get the right entertaining relief you would expect. And the duel Reynolds/Jackson really works. I hope they will do future films together again.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

96,CANpatbuck3664,Spectacular Comedic Chemistry and Solid Action Compensate for an Uninspired Plot,8,27 August 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We start the movie with Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) working a high-profile mission for an arms dealer. He's a AAA rated protection agent and he's paid to protect some very rich but very scummy people. He's also got a beautiful girlfriend Amelia (Elodie Yung) waiting for him at home. Everything goes well until his client gets on the plane and gets shot through the head by a sniper. Mike's career takes a sharp dive after that and he's doing less glamorous missions 2 years later. At the same time, hit-man Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) cuts a deal with Interpol to testify against Belorussian dictator Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman) for the release of his wife Sonia (Salma Hayek). His transport to the court is being protected by Amelia who is revealed to be an Interpol agent. They're ambushed by mercenaries on route and have to flee the scene and figure out a backup plan to keep Kincaid alive.If you're going to see this movie, you're going to see what kind of show Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson can put on together. I'm happy to say this is one of the best comedic pairings that have come across in a long time. I like buddy cop movies (they're not cops but it's the same kind of pairing) and these two are gut-busting funny together. The movie plays into their ludicrous pairing and whether most of the comedic dialogue was scripted or ad-libbed, it works at a high percentage. This movie would have been at best mediocre without them here and it was great to see them elevating this movie together.This movie rides the wave of Reynolds and Jackson's comedic charm but they also have an ace up their sleeve when it comes to the acting. First though, Reynolds is closer to being the straight man of the two but he nails the comedic bits and action scenes. As much as people love him as Deadpool (deservedly so) he can play other roles and he was great here. Samuel L. Jackson was awesome, Kincaid is a very Samuel L. Jackson character but with Jackson's performance and Kincaid's go with the flow charm, he steals large portions of the movie. Surprisingly, Salma Hayek is completely up to the task as Sonia. She's a good actress but she's every bit as funny as the two leads. Elodie Yung does a capable job as Amelia, she's a background character but she plays off of Reynolds capably. On the flip side, this is an easy paycheck for Gary Oldman. He does a fine job but this is the type of role he could have done in his sleep.When you come to see an action movie, it can be funny as hell but if it fails on showing you unique shootouts or tight hand-to-hand combat, you'll still leave disappointed. While I still think the comedy and the acting are the shining parts of this movie, the action is good enough to keep you interested. Hughes isn't afraid to shoot things in a different direction and use creative editing to spice up the movie. Some scenes work better than others (my favourites were the fight in the hardware store and the initial escort with Bryce and the coked-up lawyer) but I was never disappointed from the action set pieces.The Hit-man's Bodyguard has one weakness and unfortunately its pretty prominent. The plot is so generic that other generic movies would call this uninspired. 2 assassins (normally the trope is cops) with mismatched personalities team up to take down unnamed Eastern European dictator. Now, the key to how much you enjoy this movie is whether you believe this was done on purpose. I have to believe at least some of it was but it is the only thing that lowers my grade. If they had stuck Reynolds, Jackson and Hayek and director Patrick Hughes in a creative story, this would have easily been a 9 or a 10/10 movie. I'm not expecting a genre divining plot from every action movie (John Wick and John Wick 2 got the job done with light narratives) but I could have still stood for a little more originality from The Hit-man's Bodyguard.I can see why this movie has divided critics and audiences. Opinions on this one will be all over the spectrum and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I can't completely explain away Bodyguard's problems but if you can get past that, there's lots of entertainment to be had. I had a blast watching this movie and I would happily sign up to see a sequel. If you love action movies or are a fan of Jackson or Reynolds, go check this out in the theatre.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

This Reynolds / Jackson payday property actually is an hour and a half of gun file with 30 minutes of swear words and tepid dialog. The movie generally stands out for its sheer and willy nilly body count with extras shot and killed with little thought and often for minor offenses. The presumably more than 200 bullets that hit their mark represent a fraction of the total blanks expended during the full two hour run time. The squib budget on this clunker must of matched the costume budget of the second series of Star Wars films. If you like that sort of thing, this is the bullet buffet for you. 
Those less into handgun violence and more into continuity problems will have a field day. At its amoral heart the movie is a road picture on a nonexistent road from Conventry England to the Hauge. As famously happened repeatedly in the Sylvester Stallone's ""Cliffhanger"" characters are unexplainablely able to find each other in complex environments. Ryan Reynolds's beard varies from more full to more sparse often in the course of the same scene. In a climatic scene a helicopter shoots, firebombs and crashes on Samuel Jackson's character and, much like happened multiple times in Suicide Squad, it doesn't even have the effect of slowing his progress.

This buddy cop -esque style movie is the perfect vehicle to further show off Reynolds talents.
Except he doesn't play a cop.
Hilariously he's a Triple A rated executive protection agent.
(If there is even such a thing!)
His job is to get the worlds most lethal Hitman (played brilliantly by Samuel L Jackson) to The Hague so he can testify against evil dictator Vladislav Dukovich for all the evil stuff he's been up to.
Dukovich is played superbly by the fantastic Gary Oldman.
A role he could deliver playing it in his sleep.
There's something deeply satisfying about seeing Oldman play the villain. Anyone who has seen Leon will know immediately what I'm talking about.Director Patrick Hughes has taken the experience gathered from helming The Expendables 3 and delivered a cracking action movie that never lets up.
Released around the same time as Atomic Blonde, Hughes film is superior due to the perfect blend of wise crackery and ballistic action.
In some case even the action is funny.
Reynolds and Jackson have excellent chemistry but surprisingly it is Salma Hayek that steals the show as Jackson's foul mouthed long suffering wife.
Elodie Yung's performance here as Agent Rousel is much more enjoyable to that of her Elektra role in Daredevil.
It really is hard to fault this movie in terms of pure entertainment value. Sure they'll be critics out there that will over analyse.
In a nutshell The Hitman's Bodyguard is a lazy Sunday afternoon movie.
Go microwave some popcorn, turn your Home cinema system up to eleven and sit back and enjoy. Bullets wiz, explosions bang and Reynolds and Jackson bounce off each other like they've been doing this together forever.
Like all the best buddy/partner movies, Lethal Weapon immediately springing to mind this was an unexpected hit and I'd pay to see them together again.

111,EthanBJones_03,Recommended,6,6 October 2017,"'THE Hit-man'S BODYGUARD' - 2017Directed by Patrick HughesStarring Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L Jackson and Gary OldmanPlot Overview: ​Amidst the trial of Russian dictator Vladislav Dukovich(Gary Oldman), Michael(Ryan Reynolds) is hired by Interpol agent Amelia Roussel(Elodie Yung) to protect witness to the trial and incarcerated hit-man, Darius Kincaid(Samuel L Jackson). On their travels, the pair encounter countless mercenaries, tulips and singing nuns.Very few movie genres are universally loved. Drama? No. Horror? Most certainly not. 80s/90s action? Most certainly. I've yet to meet a individual who dislikes Die Hard, Terminator, Point Break, The Rock, Face/Off; the list does go on. Buddy action/comedies ran rampant during the 80s and 90s. Relax. I know Die Hard and Terminator aren't buddy action/comedies. But Lethal Weapon, Rush Hour, 48 Hours, Bad Boys and more are. It's them type of movies that this movie homages. And to that extend I will most certainly say that they succeeded. 'The Hit-man's Bodyguard' is designed to be a stupid, simple fun buddy action/comedy with two actors we like and a premise that is stupid and fun. That is all it is so that is all you should expect. So if you can deal FOR ONE SECOND that this movie won't be hailed as the Greatest Movie of All Time(because any less than that is not worth your time, of course), then I think you will enjoy this movie. And in that respect I recommend it.So what are the main positives? Well Reynolds and Jackson's performances and on screen chemistry certainly come to mind. Who'd have thought that Nick Fury and Deadpool would make such a great combination? Not me! But they definitely do. There is undoubtedly chemistry between the two and both actors sink their heart and soul into the role. They clearly wanted to have a laugh and they clearly accomplished that goal.There is an actress in this movie that I had no clue was in it. Due to my lack of knowledge, I wont spoil it for you either. B But I will say that she was one of the best parts of the movie. She absolutely steals every scene she was in and consistently provides a number of laughs.The comedy in this movie was also a major turn on for me. I cannot obviously outright claim your stomach will burst from laughter, because I don't know you(or do I...). Anyway, humour is entirely subjective so me trying to convince you its funny when it very well not be for you is both redundant and a waste of time for both parties involved. All I'll say is that I was pleasantly surprised with the comedic aspects of this movie and thought that the writers did a very good job at appealing to a wide audience.Now for flaws. The story was very weak. It was illogical and stupid. The premise was strong enough but they couldn't add much meat to the bones and thus the skeleton crumbled. As far as climaxes go, this is one of the weaker ones I've seen in a long time. It was so, so disappointing considering the rest of the movie. I was not at all pleased with it. The antagonist was also a major issue for me. Gary Oldman is always a good sign in film. He's a sensational actor and masters every single role he plays. He's quite literally a genius actor. But the character he had to play this time around was so dull and the attempts to make me loathe him were so transparent that I was surprised that Oldman accepted the role. And the thing is, I'd pay good money to see Oldman sink his teeth into a cheesy, over the top villain in one of these types of movies but the paper thin character that he got was so weak that even he could not save it.Cinematography doesn't matter for this type of movie really. It's gonna appeal to mass audiences mainly and they wont care about the editing choices. Despite this, I will say that I wasn't too pleased with the technical aspect of this movie. Poor visual effects, cinematography and editing are the holy trinity of things that need to be semi- competent for a movie to succeed. The cinematography wasn't so poor that it took me out of the action and whatnot. I still very much so enjoyed the action in the movie. It was fun, but the editing and cinematography did nothing to help that.In conclusion, I recommend this movie. It's fun, goofy and really just exists to waste some time. But it's time well wasted. If you want to make 2 hours pass, watch this movie. You'll be in the very least entertained for that length of time. I'll rate this movie 7 'AAA's out of 10.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

The lines were poorly delivered by both actors with their usual monotone voices that make you think, they both made love to Harvey Weinstein's wife or something.I have no idea how Ryan Reynolds was great in Deadpool, yet bad in everything else he has done, and Sam Jackson is simply a bad actor who has made a career out of being bald and Black.Movie, hit-man who now needs to protect a former rival and throw a splash in of poorly written and delivered comedy, a few moments of them talking about their hot headed women who are also bad actors, and blamooo, we get this turd.I am a very easy going movie watcher and this was just something I had a hard time watching. It was a bland mess, poorly written lines, and bad acting.Do NOT recommend.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
116,DeBBss,Breath of Fresh Air...,8,23 November 2017,"The Hit-man's Bodyguard is such a fun movie. Every part in the action feels right, and maybe the comedy is questionable, but it has this quality that makes it so entertaining. Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson make such a great team, and I wish they do more movies together.Story: 7/10A hit-man has to go to testify in a court against the Russian president for murdering innocent people. When the government is transporting the hit-man (Darius Kincaid), they get ambushed by the president's men. Amelia asks for the bodyguard's (Michael Bryce) help, to take Kincaid to the court before the time runs out. The story does have some creative parts to it, but we've seen similar stories like this. The story is good overall, we see these two very different people work together throughout the movie and become friends, and that's why I think the story is good.Characters: 9/10Michael Bryce: Michael was once a well known face in the bodyguard industry, but after his client's death, he went broke. Michael later finds out that Kincaid assassinated his client. Michael also has a serious personality, so him working with someone as foolish as Kincaid is difficult.Darius Kincaid: Samuel L. Jackson did such a great job on Kincaid, he made Darius Kincaid a likable over the top character. I like how these two very different characters have to work together and become friends with each other to get to the trial in time. Vladislav Dukhovich: Vladislav is the president of Russia. Vladislav knows that Darius knows about his crimes, so Vladislav ordered his men to take down Darius before the trial. Vladislav's motivations are realistic and logical, which makes him a decent villain.Amelia: Amelia in my opinion, is a weak character, she has no personality, and her relationship with Michael is pretty boring. If Amelia died, I really wouldn't care, because of how boring she is.Action: 8/10Although the comedy is kinda weak, we do get good action scenes. Another difference with Darius and Michael is their fighting style, Darius kills people and Michael doesn't, which makes the action so unique from all the other movies. The comedy isn't really laugh out loud, although there was one moment that was funny. The Hit-man's Bodyguard has a perfect blend of action that makes it so entertaining. Overall The Hit-man's Bodyguard has great action, but weak comedy. The characters are likable and they have a personality that makes all the characters unique. The Hit-man's Bodyguard does everything right in terms of action and characters, that makes The Hit-man's Bodyguard a good movie.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
117,gavinp9,Passable shoot-em-up comedy,6,2 January 2018,"'The Hitman's Bodyguard' has been marketed as a parody of Costner/Houston's 'The Bodyguard' from 25 years ago - but having never seen that, I can't compare. It is a pretty straightforward action/comedy, probably more like 'RED'. Plot is very simple - a Belarusian dictator (Oldman) is being tried at The Hague and Interpol need evidence from a hitman he tried to hire, Kincaid (Jackson). Thanks to Agent Roussel (Yung), Bryce (Reynolds) is assigned with getting him safely from England to Holland.There's a bit of unnecessary backstory about Bryce's bodyguard business, and some serious moment with him & Roussel, but the film's at its best when it's just Reynolds & Jackson on screen, bantering back and forth with at each other. Sure, there's plenty of gunfights, explosions, some Bourne-like stunts and actually a surprisingly high body count, but you never feel like much is at stake and wish they'd focused more on the humour than the action.It's clear Jackson is having a ball and it's great to see him laugh genuinely. Reynolds is serviceable, but plays the straight guy, and it's always fun to watch Oldman as the villain. Great cameo from Hayek too. This might almost set the record for the most Jackson ""mother-f***er""s uttered in a film too! Nothing new, no truly hilarious moments, but fun enough.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
118,jackmeat,"An enjoyable, but dark action/comedy",7,19 August 2017,"My quick rating - 6,9/10. From the trailers, you know you are getting a somewhat buddy type movie, such as the late 80s good cop/bad cop. This is the case here, well like I said, somewhat. Ryan Reynolds is coming off a major high from ""Deadpool"" and where that movie excelled, it creates a few problems for this movie. The first problem I have is you know I am not a fan of Reynolds (but I am coming around since he has been in quite a few good movies and I am putting that aside). Now this isn't the problem. This movie is far more serious and dark, dealing with a topic such as genocide as a backdrop for two quality wise cracking actors taking turns being the funny guy throughout a backdrop of constant action. You have the AAA endorsed bodyguard falling into getting an international hit-man (Jackson) to court to testify against a really bad man (Oldman) for international crimes. So Reynolds and Jackson have to put their differences aside to make it there, alive. This is the good, and bad of the movie. As Jackson and Reynolds have to take turns making us laugh, at some points they are forced to be serious and end up falling flat. Reynolds seems to be the one that gets stuck in the serious role more often and it just doesn't work out. Each character, including Hayeks foul mouthed bad ass love interest for Jackson, all have unique traits on their own, but all three of them cannot come together in this movie. Oldman as well is great, in the somewhat sparse usage and again, his strength seems a bit wasted. Don't get me wrong, pointing this out is merely just that. Opinion. The movie as a whole is very entertaining and doesn't want to let up in the ride they take you on. For a summer blockbuster, this movie relies a bit heavily on the cgi, which I am OK with since it keeps costs down (i think about 30 million for this flick) and gives you the money to throw at the actors needed for your movie. So I would say where Deadpool went in with a joke in mind, this movie was far more serious in nature, and as I mentioned, dark, and by the end you might wonder even though it was so amusing throughout, it really wasn't a comedy at all. But like most people, you will still laugh, and you should. Just realize I believe this script was meant to be far more serious and they all just decided to take a different route as it went along. Comparing the two Reynolds vehicles is quite unfair, Deadpool knew what it wanted to be, and I don't think this movie did. But won't stop me from watching it again when it comes out on blu ray, and I will enjoy it as much as I did in the theater.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

121,Donatien3,Brilliant Action/Comedy Spectacular,10,27 May 2018,"Partnering ""Deadpool's"" Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L Jackson, ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"" is everything you'd hoped for: amazing action setpieces, big explosions, some global political intrigue and lots of swearing. Lots of it.Forced to keep his mouth clean as Nick Fury, Jackson relishes letting the dirty words fly as assassin Darius Kincaid, especially his favourite: mother******. The highlight of ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"" is Jackson's interplay with Reynolds. Deadpool himself plays Michael Bryce, a (relatively) mild-mannered bodyguard who believes in playing it safe and following the rules.Gary Oldman plays evil Belarus dictator Vladislav Dukhovich, with Bryce and Kincaid teaming up to testify at Dukhovich's court case. Salma Hayek is Kincaid's wife Sonia, and isn't afraid to swear and kick ass herself.""The Hitman's Bodyguard"" feels like an updated version of classic eighties buddy cop films, except with a lot more violence and swearing, which makes is extremely entertaining.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

124,Mcduff3601,I don't know,6,30 May 2018,"I am on the fence after watching this one. I watched Central Intelligence before this one with The Rock and thought it was a bit better. Another one that is kind of close to this one is The Kingsman and I liked that more.It wasn't bad but...It felt like all the acting was just a little flat. Ryan Renolds who I like and can be really funny was... kind of subdued, I think that is because of his character. Samuel seemed off, I mean we have all seen him as a badass kickin butt before and he just seemed off. I didn't like Selma Hyak or Ryan Renolds girl (to lazy to look it up), both their acting was really bad. The story was pretty standard, good guys have a timeline to beat, bad guys try and stop them from going across the finish line.I did like the bad guys, Gary Oldman and his soldiers were pretty spot on. The action scenes are what saved this movie for me. I can't recommend this movie but at the same time I have seen worse. For me it was entertaining enough for a watch through but I will never go back to it. There are better movies like this out there (Grosse Pointe Blank).",The Hitman's Bodyguard
125,ayoreinf,A Hollywood sort of a hit-man,8,21 August 2017,"I liked this movie a lot. As far as 8/10 goes, this one tops most of my lists. But I'll start with the reasons for the two missing marks. It's such a Hollywood concoction the end and even the post end mini joke are way too obvious. I'm not against the making of Hollywood style action comedies, but even though this one was honest about it, it did push its limits way too far for me. This romantic Hollywood version of a hit-man with a moral code, is just too much. And it also influences the credibility of all those mass shooting scenes when none gets hurt by getting caught in the crossfire.So as I said this one is not a perfect ten, but as far as 8/10 goes, I'll repeat myself - it couldn't be any better. It's really done to the highest standards. the action, the acting - Samuel L. Jackson, is simply superb, Ryan Reynolds, and Gary Oldman don't fall far behind, and everybody else on screen is right on target.I also liked the fact that the movie is very self conscience about being a movie. The Japanese guy, is Kurosawa, the dissident professor is Professor Asimov. Look these names out if you don't know who they are. In short the movie repeatedly tells us it's only a movie. And if we didn't get it we have the scene after the credits proving it's a movie and nothing more.One last point I must mention is, that on top of the first class action and humor, the movie also has some extra depth asking us some moral questions about the nature of good and evil and about being responsible for your own actions. And in a non American way it doesn't answer these questions at least not in a blatant manner.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
126,ritera1,Very well done,9,23 November 2017,"Stellar job throughout.Granted, it was a buddy comedy with wise-crackin' and lots of shooting. Not like you've not seen that before.But had an artistry to it from action director Patrick Hughes who did the very well done Red Hill out of Australia and the third installment of The Expendables. Expendables was just a vehicle, sure. But even in that there was high-quality work with the action and comedy.And the ""buddies"" were a different kind of twosome. Read it was initially a drama and was changed to a comedy at the last minute. Would imagine that more was made of both being very sketchy in their morality.Jackson, the hit-man, thought of himself as a ""good"" guy in that he didn't kill certain people. But he was still a hit-man who took money from criminals to kill criminals. He was not any sort of superhero.Reynolds was after the money and prized his reputation by protecting high-end criminals. By default he thought he was a ""good"" guy because of his rationale and exclusions of certain things he didn't do.That alone is a compelling thing on the surface and it achieved its goal. But I will miss the exploration of such dynamics that the drama probably had. It seemed to me they were both essentially sociopaths.The frenetic pace and staging of the action sequences were 1st class. Reynolds hand-to-hand was admirable. Jackson sold his skills with a gun.The detail in the canal chase was stellar. The action behind Reynolds on the street that he ignores while complaining about Jackson was creative.Each action scene was structured in a cohesive and linear way.Both of their physicality were both funny and realistic, from Jackson's bullet hole in his leg to Reynolds being thrown from the car and him in the torture chair.Even introducing the characters were done well. Many films like this just fart out showing the character on screen for the first time. But in both and then with Selma Hayek was the way you do it. The flash of Reynolds. The chains and head tattoos of Jackson. Hayek at that window and turning as the camera moved in.The love stories both had with their respective women were engaging and credible. I did have a disconnect with the love-at-first-sight element both tried to sell in their flashbacks.I do have a problem in general with action films that show heroes being reckless. Endangering people. The Fast and Furious movies do it to a huge degree. This had that element but was not overtly prevalent. I know it's kind of hard to speak to that when you'd be sacrificing a great-looking shot and that nobody in general would ask that other than me.But yes, this is a fine film.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
127,CountJonnie,Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds as themselves,6,10 October 2017,"This movie has absolutely nothing new or special to offer. The ""acting"", action, humor, you've seen it all before. What makes it watchable is the chemistry between Jackson and Reynolds, the obvious fun they're having, and the speed of this movie which never gets slow.You don't have to do it for the story, because every bit of story or ""so called character development"" is just a tool to pass the time to the next action scene. You don't have to do it for the acting. Everything is so over the top, and the horrible dutch accents don't help either. Only Gary Oldman shows some skill here, but he's lost in the mess.You do it for the fun. We went to the cinema and had to choose between coffee or beer. Luckily, we chose beer. Jackson and Reynolds aren't the best actors, with Reynolds being a one-trick pony. But the fun they're having on screen is contagious, so you might just have a good time.

128,kaptenvideo-89875,"""Deadpool"" meets ""The Bodyguard"", with a lot of cursing",6,19 August 2017,"Bodyguard (Ryan Reynolds) teams up with a hit man (Samuel L. Jackson) who must testify against the dictator of Belarus (Gary Oldman). The two have to put their differences aside to make it to court on time. Also appearing: Salma Hayek, Elodie Yung, Richard E. Grant et al. It's a fine mainstream action comedy about two loved movie stars arguing, cursing, and eliminating lots of big men armed with big guns. There's a ton of shooting, fighting, car chases (also a motorboat chase), explosions, and a half-amusing appearance by Salma Hayek who also curses a lot. The characters and story are as generic as they can come, the main aim to emulate the exciting mix of humor and violence that worked so well for Deadpool"" – 2016's comic superhero movie starring Reynolds, bringing 783 million dollars from cinemas. ""Deadpool's"" mix works well here too. The only problem is the big amount of secondary filler material. You could easily remove most of the stuff concerning dictator and bodyguard's former girlfriend, and the result wouldn't be worse in any way. It would be even better, probably, because the 118 minute running length is a bit much. Why does almost every summer movie need to be close to two hours long these days? Still, action scenes are good and adrenaline-filled, and Jackson and Reynolds are enjoyable as always. Jackson turns 69 this December, by the way. How come he's still so cool and able to star in action movies? Not a geriatric bone in his body, it seems.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
129,WalkdenEntertainment,"Touching Story About A Hitman, A Bodyguard and the Hitman's Girlfriend...",7,10 January 2019,"After a previous mission turns out for the worst, professional bodyguard, Michael (Ryan Reynolds), accepts a new client to protect. The catch here is that Michael's newest client is actually Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson), a hit man who needs to arrive safely at the international high court to testify. So we have two skilled professionals, both with witty and fast paced personalities. Can these two work together and survive long enough for Darius to testify?Needless to say this is a film that is not to be taken seriously. ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"" is loaded with fun, over the top action scenes full of gun shots, random explosions and chase sequences. The other key element to this film is the continuous banter between our two lead characters. Actor Ryan Reynolds & Samuel L Jackson have always been known for their witty and fast paced sense of humour (Deadpool & Die Hard with vengeance for example). While Ryan Reynolds provides the same types of speeches it feels like he always does, it feels like Samuel L Jackson was given more permission to basically unleash as much (including foul language) as possible. As expected, the best results and praise comes from how these two interact with each other and still manage to find deep moments to talk about....love.As we can enjoy a good laugh and praise the crazy action sequence, let's also point out some of the other actors that pop up here. For me, the film's villain was the weakest part of this film. Vladislav (Gary Oldman) was simply a man full speeches and threats and I found it really slowed the film down. His scenes were boring and trying to be far too serious after audiences have just loudly laughed moments before. Considering actor Gary Oldman has performed excellently in many films, I feel playing this type character and the way the director has used him hasn't brought the film any justice or helped the actor's career. However, when the stunning actress Selma Hayek appears as Darius' wife stuck in jail, she was so unexpectedly funny that I would say some of the best jokes in the film also come from her character and the frustration she always has towards Darius.The film's structure is A, B, A, B and so on- we get an action scene, then our characters stop to discuss issues. The film repeats this process until the credits roll.Overall, I found The Hitman's Bodyguard funny and entertaining. It's major draw back is the film's villain and the way it at times feels like other films before it. The biggest strength is found within the dialogue between our two leading men and also in the surprisingly hilarious cameo from Selma Hayek. If you're already an existing fan of the actors of this film, then you will know what to expect. To those who are unsure about the film, you might be shocked or disappointed at the comedy joy ride that The Hitman's Bodyguard offers. With the right occasion and friends around you, this film is lots of fun.7.2/10

The basic premise is not bad, and the characters they set up are also not terrible. There's just something that falls flat about everything that happens in this movie. Every time the movie sets up a joke, I was very hopeful, and somehow, something fell flat in the execution, and this movie was just not funny.
I really, really hated it. The score of 2 is for the cast, because I still love these actors, despite the fact that the characters were SUPER poorly written.

The ICC fear that he may get off, makes a deal with hitman Darius Kincaid (Samuel L Jackson) for a testimony against Dukhovich for the release of his wife. When the escort goes wrong they have to turn to alternatives and end up recruiting Bryne for protection. This movie a basic format of a buddy cop movie. You have two guys who don't really get along to each, it's made perfectly clear they don't like each other. Overtime they learn about each other and realize their not so different. Thankfully these two do know each other so you don't get that cliché . It's here where a lot of the charm of the film comes from. They're at each other's throat from the very start. They have history between each other. The connection works primarily because Samuel Jackson and Ryan Reynolds the chemistry between this two have together is the glue of the movie. Ryan's Reynolds always has his witty personality and is sarcastic style of comedy, make it worthwhile given the type of character he play here is more of a serious stickler. He's always being sarcastic yet he's always going on about things being in order and sticking to the plan. Samuel on the other hand doesn't care about plans ,he just goes with the flow and has fun with all of it.knowing life not perfect. If the movie took itself more seriously it probably would still be as entertaining, but it would seem rather generic in that since. The comedic elements offers a more fun experiences gives the Film more of our personality to it. Another highlight of the movie is Darius wife Sonia (Salma Hayek) who is really funny, when they cut back to her she make her scenes count and leaves a impact. The part of the movie where it begins to feel slowed down is around the middle point at this point you're spending time with Michael and Darius however it doesn't really seem like they're getting anywhere. It feels like padding for the film a bit. The second half pick up once they have to meet the deadline for the trial alot with more is thrown at you. The actions great a perfect mix between practical stunt work as well visuals that's to some may be a little brutal but still appealing to watch. What the movie is over guilty of many props and clichés The hitman's bodyguard still stands on its own.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
134,zac-04879,Very Entertaining for Today's Standard Action-Comedies,7,16 June 2021,"The Hitman's Bodyguard would have failed as an action-comedy, but the chucklesome performances of Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson mould it into a fast, funny and well-produced buddy flick. Huge Deadpool fans will undeniably own delight in the film's violent action, foul mouths, and entertaining rate. However, the whole scenario is mildly flat and can clearly sink the attention of many audiences with high expectations.Among the brilliant humour, you'll discover that a repellent mouth belongs to each of the lead characteristics in the film. It's unquestionable to agree that several viewers will find disgust through the amount of language. Still, the bloody action will impress violent-action fans.Ignoring those elements will definitely not be a great option to the fans of coarse action-comedies, but teens will most surely discover that the storyline is quite memorable. Director Patrick Hughes has introduced a funny and engaging duo comedy crammed with frequent action, but infrequent lack of decent pace. Yet Jackson and Reynolds have equally delivered hilarious buddies entertainment.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
135,darkreignn,Goofy fun,7,23 August 2017,"Yeah, this movie is funny. Honestly, what more can I say? It stars Ryan Reynolds and Sam Jackson, you already knew it was going to be funny. Their chemistry is off the charts; it's absolutely hilarious to see them act together and there were plenty of moments that had me doubled over in laughter. This movie isn't a comedy masterpiece by any means, but it's just very goofy and filled to the brim with jokes and silly set pieces, and if you go in expecting that then you will enjoy this.However, if you go in expecting an action movie then you will definitely also enjoy this because, surprisingly, the action scenes were very well done. The director of this film also directed ""The Expendables 3,"" which I don't like to talk about, so I was not looking forward to seeing how the action in the film was going to look like. But when the first full blown action scene hit, I was shocked at how intense it was. The gunshots were LOUD, I'm talking louder than some scenes in ""Dunkirk,"" and I almost had to cover my ears, but this is not a negative; the noise just added to the intensity. But loud noises aren't the only good thing about the action in this movie. For one thing, and thank the Gods for this, but shaky camera was used minimally, and when it was it actually did mildly enhance the action because it looked pretty natural and wasn't used to the point of it being excessive; this is not ""Jason Bourne"" or ""Taken 3"" level bad. Luckily the camera man did not seem like he was having an epileptic seizure during filming. Also, I found the editing to be pretty clean and I did not notice many nauseating quick cuts or close up shots during the fight scenes, which surprised me because in ""The Expendables 3"" the action was very shaky and very incomprehensible with its use of fast edits, so I was very happy that I could actually decipher and enjoy the action, because there was a lot to enjoy. And I didn't even get to the best part yet. Towards the end of the film there are 2 fight scenes that feature Ryan Reynolds, one in a kitchen, and one in a hardware store, and they are both shot in one take and it is absolutely delicious to watch. It was almost as good, if not better, than the fight scenes in ""John Wick,"" and in fact I probably enjoyed it more than the fight scenes in those movies because during these scenes you could actually see Ryan Reynolds thinking of what to do next, of what item to use as a weapon next, of where to move next, and it was so damn cool and definitely one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen. Honestly, this movie is worth watching just for those two fight scenes because they are jaw-droppingly intense and so entertaining. Now, this movie isn't just a straight up comedy because there are few dark moments, and in fact the beginning of the film had one moment that was so twisted my jaw actually did drop. I will not spoil what happens, and if you do want to see the movie but feel put off by this I'm telling you that you do not have to worry because what happens is not shown, it happens off screen, but I'm telling you that what happens is pretty messed up. But other than that this movie is a total entertainment package that is definitely worth watching in theaters. Because you will laugh, you will smile, and you'll have a Hell of a great time.""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" reminded me a lot of 80s action movies, which is why I think I enjoyed it so much. It is intentionally ridiculous and definitely hilarious, and the action was filmed and choreographed pretty well. What can I say? It was nice to sit in a theatre and laugh for a couple of hours.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
136,pranayjalvi,Not so good duo of Reynolds-Jackson,5,27 August 2017,"The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" is a movie for anyone who just wants to see Samuel L. Jackson curse, Ryan Reynolds smirk and Salma Hayek kick butt while looking absolutely incredible.That's not to say ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" is a total wash, however; the cast seems game, and perhaps they realize it's on them to elevate the material, so the scenes between Reynolds and Jackson have some genuine snap to them, even though the dialogue and characterization are barely memorable.

There isn't much to be said when it comes to the Hit-man;s bodyguard, the camera work was good, the action engaging, the dialogue and acting, hilarious. But to point out a flaw, it was way too long, 30 minutes could probably be cut from this film. The bottom line: If you like Samuel L Jackson doing his thing and if you like Ryan Reynolds doing his thing you would like them in this film, there is nothing too inventive or unique but there are good chemistry and good interactions.

138,asifahsankhan,Reynolds and Jackson dazzles but The Hitman's Bodyguard thwarts all expectations. . .,6,2 February 2018,"Some movies just nail the zeitgeist, you know? It's uncanny the way certain filmmakers have their finger so tightly on the public pulse that, even though their new release began shooting a year earlier and was written well before then, it taps into the popular consciousness on opening weekend to a practically psychic degree. The Hitman's Bodyguard does the opposite.One of the best bits in THB comes when the script tries to pull off one of the worst plot reveals of all time. Like, someone admits to being the reason behind someone else's downfall and I'm not sure why I'm trying to keep it secret. It's the most obvious twist of all time. I'm talking around it here; but when a film be about a bodyguard who loses his business in the opening minutes when a client is assassinated; and an assassin. It ain't hard to put two and two together.Do we need this type of film to just relax, enjoy and watch for fun at the cinema without taking it too seriously? I mean come on it even manages to poke fun at Samuel L. Jackson and his use of Motherf****r in well all of his films...so to speak. Can you conceive of a less appropriate moment in modern history for a tasteless, tone-deaf action laugher that mines the comic possibilities of terrorists driving trucks into crowds of innocent people and portrays allied leaders as hacks? The plot revolves around a tyrant who suggests a fictional fusion of Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump - one who even attempts to obstruct justice when charges are brought against him. It wouldn't surprise me in the least to see the Mooch pop up in bonus scenes in the director's cut.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Interpol Agent Roussel (Elodie Yung) hires him to protect Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) a contract assassin to testify against Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman), who if Kincaid fails to show up at trial, will go back to power and treat his people as he wants and that's a very bad thing. Michael has to deliver Kincaid to the court in the Hague from Manchester.This is very over the top, too much foul language by almost everyone especially by Mrs Kincaid (Selma Hayek), who is in prison. The stunts, fights, explosions, car/boat chases are extremely good and well choreographed.  
And, yes, over the top also because of over-acting by Samuel L. Jackson as Kincaid, but maybe he can be forgiven due to the circumstances of his being arrested and then protected by a bodyguard who he did try to kill many, many times. (Count 28) The banter between Michael and Darius is sometimes clever, and sometimes funny, sometimes over done, but always honest. The scene I liked the best was when Michael and Darius got a ride in a bus filled with nuns. Very good. The carnage at the end when Michael and Darius are heading to the court house is unbelievably good and the hope is that a lot of the destruction was CGI and not real. It looked too real. Notables: Elodie Yung as an Interpol Agent who Michael is in love with, but Michael blames her for his losing his Triple-A rating and his job; Tine Joustra as Renata Casoria a Chief Interpol Agent; Joaquim de Almeida as Jean Foucher an Interpol Agent under Renata CasorisSo basically, this is a movie of extremely good stunts, explosions, chases, and foul language, but it has its moments. Production wise it is very good. (7/10)Violence: Yes.

Nudity: No.
Humor: Yes.

140,carlos37andre,A waste of really great actors,4,5 January 2018,"Yeah, I really don't have much to say about this movie. I came to see it, just hoping it would be fun, and I would have a good time watching two of my favorite actors out there (Jackson and Reynolds), but, man, the movie fails.It's basically a bunch of actions scenes (that are far from be exciting), some lazy flashbacks that I really do not care at all, and some jokes. There is just lazy character development, I just don't care for non of them at all.The only thing that sometimes (just SOMETIMES) was good were the jokes, Reynolds and Jackson are fantastic actors, that are being wasted here, but some few times they take a laugh of you. But, besides that (and I think that this is only because I love the guys) the movie just doesn't work. All the characters are pure cliche, the ""plot"" is the basic of the basic (and I don't have nothing against this, I love to watch a good comedy movie full of cliches, but, at least it needs to be funny).Anyway, in short, the movie is boring as hell, and is sad to see some great actors being wasted in there.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
141,monkeysgalore,An Insane Action-Comedy-Buddy Film,10,7 June 2019,"At first glance, The Hitman's Bodyguard may look very pedestrian, even stupid and unnecessary. I mean, a hitman needs a bodyguard? It just looks like another mindless action movie, without heart. But it's anything but. This movie is an example of a so-so concept being elevated by the actors and director. And I thought it was elevated greatly.2017 was a big year for action movies. We got Baywatch, John Wick: Chapter 2, Kingsman: The Golden Circle, two efforts from Jackie Chan (Bleeding Steel, which was awful, and The Foreigner, which was awesome), and The Hitman's Bodyguard. All of these movies, from what I've seen have some big action, but for me, I'd have to put The Hitman's Bodyguard at the front of all the aforementioned films, except for The Foreigner, and John Wick 2 only 'cause The Foreigner was amazing, and I've seen some scenes from JWC2 and it looks crazy. But The Hitman's Bodyguard is just different. It's special. And it is a lot of fun.If you don't know the plot, it's about world-class hitman, Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson), having to testify against a ruthless dictator (Gary Oldman), and top bodyguard Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds), must deliver him to the court on time. The two begrudgingly work together to fight through hordes (and I mean hordes) of bad guys in order to reach their destination.Both Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson (two of my favorite actors) are eternally watchable, and both really sell their performances and look like they have a lot of fun doing it. Both are very likable, and Jackson has immense charisma, even when he's just f-boming, and Reynolds is extremely likable, doing his signature deadpan, mocking humor while playing the straight man to Jackson's antics. They both make the film, and their chemistry just crackles on screen. Gary Oldman also does a good job as the villain, dusting off his bad guy performances from The Book of Eli (2010) and Air Force One (1997).Tom O'Connor did an excellent job with the script, and the film ends up perfectly balancing action and comedy, and it doesn't take itself seriously at all. O'Connor hasn't written much else, and actually his only previous work was Fire With Fire (2012), which I did not see, since it doesn't look anything like this movie. Fire With Fire looked like just another in the long line of mediocre disposable action flicks Bruce Willis put out in the 2010s which didn't really utilize his talents at all. However here, O'Connor shines, crafting an excellent, if cliched and familiar, story. And his script is really brought to life by director Patrick Hughes, who masterfully crafts explosive action sequences. Hughes is no stranger to action films, having demonstrated his proficiency in action direction in The Expendables 3, another enjoyable, mindless action film. Both O'Connor and Hughes wowed me, and I'll definitely be looking for their names in the future on other films.The film's story is very reminiscent of 16 Blocks (2006), a pretty entertaining and underrated action thriller starring Bruce Willis as a cop and Mos Def as a convict, back when Willis was still trying. The plot of that film was much the same, two men forced to work together to get to a courtroom, having to battle their way there. This film is much like that film, except it takes itself far less seriously, and ratchets up the action to 11.And I'm not kidding. This film is one of the most action-packed, and often over-the-top (and I mean that in a good way) action movies I've ever seen (and I've seen a LOT of action movies). The movie does take a little time to get started, as it actually develops its characters, but once it gets going, it never lets up until the credits roll, pausing only occasionally and briefly for some extra character development, which was refreshing for a movie like this. But the pauses are brief, and this movie is pretty much one non-stop action sequence. The electrifying scenes include the transport ambush, the apartment fight scene, the Amsterdam Canal chase, the construction site car chase, the infamous kitchen/hardware store fight scene, and the large-scale final battle that's nicely topped off with an incredibly over-the-top helicopter crash and explosion, to name a few.There's also a brutal torture sequence in which a man has his face covered with a cloth and water's poured on him, and he's then electrocuted by having jumper cables attached to his ears over the cloth. The scene was surprisingly intense, and though there were some great one-liners during it, it was almost a departure from the tone of the film, as was the case with some other scenes. However, I liked the shift, as it reminded us that it wasn't the movie's world that was funny, it were the characters in the world, and the world is actually brutal and unforgiving at times, which we're reminded of throughout. Not that the film's message is nihilistic, it's just realistic, which is a word I didn't expect to use when describing this film. But I digress, the torture sequence is quite innovative and memorable, and I'd put it up there with the infamous torture scene from Casino Royale (2006).While this film is a crazy, pedal-to-the-medal action film, it has some great laughs, and as I mentioned before, it rarely takes itself seriously. It knows exactly what it is and what it wants to do, and it achieves its goal. Jackson and Reynolds' comedic chemistry is excellent, and I was almost disappointed whenever the scene changed to one they weren't present in. The humor is definitely smartly written, as its more quick witty remarks and quips rather than slapstick, although there are one or two physical comedy moments which were pretty funny, especially since they abruptly occurred, and surprised me. All this to say, the film perfectly manages to balance its action and comedy portions, giving us heaping piles of both.I highly recommend this film to action-lovers everywhere, and fans of the two leads. You will not be disappointed. Just turn your brain off for an hour or two and enjoy the ride. I will note the heavy amount of violence and language, so be warned. Aside from that, do yourself a favor and watch what is undoubtedly one of the best and most fun films of 2017.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

146,achyutaghosh,funny to the core,7,2 September 2017,"The Hit-man's Bodyguard is racy and entertaining, if generic, action thriller. It is generic in plot- putting two charismatic actors together with their chemistry and comedic timing driving the movie forward. It is racy in treatment- hurtling from one action sequence to the other.Micheal Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) is a AAA rated bodyguard, who falls from grace when his client gets terminated by assassin for hire, man-on-a- mission-to-rid-the-world-of-evil-people and passionate lover Darius Kincaid (Samuel L Jackson). The washed-up Michael gets a chance to redeem himself by transporting Darius safely to testify against a sadistic dictator, Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman). What follows is a race against time, as Dukhovich unleashes hell on the two wisecracking heroes.""This guy single-handedly ruined the word mother**ker"" The Hit-man's Bodyguard excels solely because director Patrick Hughes lets the leads do what they do best- Samuel L Jackson gets to say Mother***cker every few minutes, while Ryan Reynolds gets the family friendly witty one-liners. It is mostly a laughathon then; even the poster is a rip-off from Kevin Costner- Whitney Houston starrer- The Bodyguard. Throw corrupt cops, lovelorn psychotic lovers, boat chases, bike chases, car chases in the mix, along with beautiful cinematography, and a rocking background score, nevertheless at the end it is just a cheesy, buddy flick.But then, I cannot stress on this enough, it is Jackson and Reynolds that makes it so watchable. Jackson looks like he continued from where Snakes on a Plane ended, while for Reynolds, think Deadpool with a PG filter.7/10 for The Hit-man's Bodyguard- it is a solid, predictable action comedy.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
147,stevepat99,"Same old, Same old, plot less yet huge plot holes & endless Reynolds snarkiness",4,1 September 2017,"Another get the witness to the courthouse saga. Where's Clint Eastwood when we need him? I've always liked Reynolds but he's worn me out. Seems this script was written for his endless sarcastic remarks, like 98% of everything he says.The film begins with a flashback of Reynolds AAA bodyguard agency taking a client to his private jet. Reynolds stands about 75 feet from the jet, with his eight or so employees standing behind him. Then, he stops and allows his client to walk, alone, in open air, to the jet. We knew this would not end well since every real bodyguard squad would surround their client yada yada. He makes it to the jet, gets on board and sits by an open plane window (meaning shade is NOT pulled down). Like that would ever happen.During an endless canal boat chase, bad guys going after Jackson, Reynolds is captured and tortured with bad guys telling their boss 'We'll question him.' And demanding Reynolds tell them where Jackson is. Absurd, since all the while they know (since they all have cell phones) where Jackson is since their comrades are at that very moment busy chasing Jackson forever on the canal.Selma was a gritty, great shining light.The senior cop, Reynolds old girlfriend seemed way too young for such a front page major assignment.When Ryan is shot Jackson tells him to 'hold on' 'stay with me', words we all know are said when the victim is near death, in this case bleeding out. Jackson then leaves him unattended and minutes later Reynolds miraculously has gotten up and walked to a nearby corridor, despite the fact he has no idea what is going on in that corridor.Then, the 100's of bodies, thousands of bad guy bullets that can never do serious damage to our heroes and 30 minutes at least of 'chase' scenes that should have been left on the editing floor.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Jackson. Jackson, who has close to two-hundred acting credits to his name, can basically pull off anything; action, adventure, drama, comedy and of course, wellas I mentioned, anything. This time around, Jackson decides to pull of working next to a post-Deadpool Ryan Reynolds, and thankfully, given the absolutely hysterical and effortless chemistry between the two, allows The Hit-man's Bodyguard to be an easy to swallow throwback action comedy duo film.The Hit-man's Bodyguard is a very campy yet guilt-ridden entertaining action comedy film that pays homage to so many films and instances of the nineteen-ninteis. Right out of the gates, in the film's first theatrical trailer, it begins and ends with the extremely famous and recognizable motion picture soundtrack hit ""I Will Always Love You"", which belongs to, and still is, one of the most purchased movie soundtracks of all-time. In addition to stealing The Bodygaurd's music, the first theatrical poster for the film is a very direct spoof to the theatrical poster as well, therefore cementing its nostalgic feel, even before watching it. Playing out action, comedy, romance and (somewhat) drama much like the early Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme actioners that once made these names household names, two of the best one-line giving A-list actors team up to give us the last fun-filled summer movie of 2017, and just in the nick of time, before all of big serious film festivals and Oscar hopeful award films.While the premise of The Hit-man's Bodyguard is nothing to marvel at, just the idea of Ryan Reynold's Michael Bryce, a straight-laced, by the numbers and mathematical AAA rated executive protection agent guarding Jackson's world renown assassin; a foul-mouth and reckless Darius Kincaid, had me hooked immediately. I mean, come on! These are two actors with such expansive filmography's that, we all know both are at liberty to add so much of their own personal comedy and selves into roles that are, essentially, caricatures of all the great and painfully pleasing characters of our childhoods. Plus, the direct comparison of Reynold's Bryce to his recent discovery of bad-ass, fourth wall-breaking anti-heroes, is just a fun pace for the actor.Joining in the fun, is the always transparent Gary Oldman, who can play every bad guy in film, from now until its eventual extinction. Playing a ruthless Eastern European dictator, who must do anything and everything to destroying Kincaid, before he is able to testify him in the court of law, adds to the nineties nostalgia and camp in ways that only Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Sschwarzenegger could understand. Additionally, the film was also able to nab the always cunning Richard E. Grant; the kick-ass young Elodie Yung, and not to mention, the scene-stealing Salma Hayek, who plays the fouled mouth, violent and enraged Sonia Kincaid.While this is one film in 2017 where everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, seemed to have fun making, this is a film that radiates a good-time. Sure, the editing isn't seemingless, the foreshadowing may be all-too obvious, the action is rushed and jumbled up into very incoherent forays, but The Hit-man's Bodyguard is very aware of the film it is, and what it wants to be and what it wants the audience to get from it; which is, good-ol' popcorn fun.One of the strengths of The Hit-man's Bodyguard is the time it takes with comedy; incorporating music, song, and somewhat choreographed sing-alongs, including the one-hit wonder ""I Saw the Sign"" into the film, Bodyguard is able to deviate away from the action timing and saturated placement of explosions, car chases and bar brawls that, at times, feel forced.While the summer 2017 was anything less than impressive, this film will surely not be the one to injected some much needed life into the box-office. Don't let this fool you though, the end of August marks the end of the summer movie season, and although everyone knows that the end of August films are more of a dumping ground to recoup budgets and fulfill studio contracts, The Hit-man's Bodyguard doesn't look to face much competitive until the first week of September, where I am sure will be faced with horrifying results, once Pennywise and the new remake of It is released.For now, Jackson, Reynolds, Hayek, Oldman and company are going to, more than likely, stay on top of the box-office for a couple weeks, with very modest numbers, but enjoy what its like at the top, especially when your only competition, will be killed off by two of the most charming leads working in Hollywood today.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
150,gcsman,"A fun ride, but that's about it",5,9 April 2018,"At its basis this is a two-man buddy film, which we've seen a hundred times before, so really the only interest is in how well it's done. The two stars, Ryan Reynolds and Samuel Jackson, are both experts at rapid-fire ongoing dialog and to its credit, the script just lets them go at it. After a fairly extended setup to bring them together, it's a fair bit of fun just to listen to them bicker as they crash up a complicated series of cars and cycles trying to get to an international trial in time (see below). The plot takes too long to (finally) wind up, so it overstays its welcome mainly because the car chases and fights go on and on, even though some of the details are inventive. My favorite scene is probably the one where a worn-out Bryce (Reynolds) has had it with his rogue client Kincaid (Jackson). He's drinking at an open-air Amsterdam bar commiserating with the bartender (""You know, I really don't care. They can kill him."") while just behind him a car chase and a firefight are unfolding.Actually, there is one serious bit of content here although it's pretty well buried in the dialog towards the end. The plot rests on the premise that an evil Belarussan dictator Dukhovich is on trial at the international criminal court in the Hague, and he can be brought to justice as long as Kincaid can get to the trial in time to give crucial evidence. But even after the evidence, Dukhovich rants that what he does in his own country is his business and no one else has any authority to say different. In other words, he rejects the whole concept of ""international justice"". However, working out how to deal with brutal leaders like him is exactly what happened in the mid-20th century and it's what led to things like the Geneva Conventions and the courts at the Hague. Yes indeed, there is such a thing as international justice now, and these people have to answer to it. (The great Gary Oldman plays Dukhovich, I guess just for a paycheck; he isn't on screen for very long, and a dozen other actors could have played the part just as well.)",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Michael Bryce (Reynolds) is hired to get him there.I like hit-man movies, but not this one. I only watched about 20- minutes and could not stomach anymore of Samuel L. Jacksons overacting. It was too much for me. Ryan Reynolds had a look on his face that told us, "" what am I doing in this?"" The banter between them was most annoying. Perhaps the movie settled down to something enjoyable later on, but I will never know. The other thing that was also annoying were the f-bombs out of the mouths of the actresses who seemed to relish overacting, too, and spewing those F-bombs. There was no reason to continue and I got out.There are some notables in here but the scenes passed by so fast I am not sure what they were all about. This is one forgettable movie.

155,AnishMisra,The Hit-man's Bodyguard Review,7,15 September 2017,"The Hit-man's Bodyguard is a film directed by Patrick Hughes. I actually had no expectations while watching the film because of the Rotten Tomatoes' reviews. Then some of my friends happen to watch this film and said the film was quite entertaining, which increased my interest into watching this film. And after watching it, I can say that their statement was definitely true.Plot: Micheal Byers has to protect his former enemy hit-man Darius Kincaid from the assassins of Vladisav Dukhovich.Story and Direction: Patrick Hughes is infamous for directing Expendables 3 (which I personally didn't like). But Patrick has definitely improved from that time. And this film is a very definite proof of that. This film makes me remember my favorite genre of action-comedy films of the 80's which has suddenly gone lost. The chemistry between Kincaid and Byers is the one to watch out for. From their first meeting only, the film was a laugh riot. The action scenes are good. I was very impressed by most of the stunt work. As for flaws in this film, there is basically nothing new. I mean that, it doesn't have it's own unique identity. And some of the VFX in this film actually looked fake. Which kind of irritates me a bit. And also, we have the villain who basically does nothing. He just sits behind a chair and gives orders. But with these flaws, also I found it quite an enjoyable watch.Acting: Ryan Reynolds was great as the bodyguard. In each scene, you are with his character. Sam Jackson was par excellence. When he enters any scene, he basically just kills it. Each time a profanity used to come out of his mouth, I was bursting out of laughter. Gary Oldman was not used much in this film. But for how much screen presence was given to him, I liked it. Salma Hayek was another one of the highlights of this film. I was liking her presence in the film. Elodie Yung was just OK.Favorite Scene: The scene where Kincaid tells how he met his wife. I mean the slow music, Sam Jackson's expressions and Salma Hayek's aggressive-ness were all to look out in this scene.Verdict: The film is a very enjoyable watch like I just said. If you go into this film expecting you will get something out of this world, please do avoid it. This film is a stress-buster.I am going with a 7.5/10",The Hitman's Bodyguard
156,bastille-852-731547,Disastrous Attempt at Action-Comedy,1,9 August 2017,"I saw this film at an advance screening. I didn't think the trailers looked good, and the fact that it was from the director of ""The Expendables 3"" didn't impress me. However, I went in both optimistic and hopeful, thinking that the chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson could make this a good time at the movies. Unfortunately, the film is a disaster.Why is it so bad? Well, the reason is that the film's inability to produce a tone is just jarring. The film seems to go for a comedic tone at some points, but also wants to be a hard-R, ultra-violent action movie at times. I've seen R-rated action and comedy blended together very well, such as in ""Deadpool."" That movie worked because the action, while gory, was tongue-in-cheek, and was often accompanied hand-in-glove by a sense of humor or cartoonishness. The same cannot be said for ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard."" The film's erratic pace seems to believe that comedy and action are mutually exclusive, which is the film's biggest Achilles heel. As a result, the lighter moments feel completely removed--and almost isolated--from the action scenes. The action scenes feel solely brutal rather than cartoonishly brutal, and the parts that are supposed to be funny feel like throwaway lines. It doesn't help that the film's comedic lines aren't even funny or well-written (and don't hold a candle to something like ""Deadpool,"") while the action scenes seem generic and helter-skelter, rather than skillfully choreographed such as the action in films like ""Atomic Blonde."" There are plenty of other flaws in ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard."" Besides the tone, three of the other worst offenders plaguing this film are its plot, pacing and script. The plot, with its cookie-cutter characters, is about as clichéd as it gets. Gary Oldman, unfortunately, is underused in his role as the villain--a violent, vicious Bulgarian dictator. The film is paced all over the place, alternating between action scenes that move too fast to breathe as well as 'filler' scenes that really add up to nothing in the plot. The script is a bit of a mess, with 'comedic' one-liners that have been done to death in just about every other R-rated comedy and simply aren't funny.I was hoping for some good entertainment with this film, but unfortunately it is terribly flawed on many different levels. Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson have been in much better, and deserve better projects. Nonetheless, this one should clearly be avoided. 1/10",The Hitman's Bodyguard
157,destinylives52,"A Very Funny, Hyper-Violent Piece Of Entertainment",8,13 September 2017,"Samuel L. Jackson plays the hit-man and Ryan Reynolds plays the bodyguard in the action/comedy ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard."" Why would the most feared hit-man need a bodyguard? Because a dictator is on trial for war crimes, and the only one who could incriminate him is Jackson. Taking Jackson from prison to the courtroom will be a hell of an ordeal, because the dictator has his goons out in force to stop Jackson from testifying. And that's where Reynolds comes inunofficially hired by Interpol to protect and escort Jackson to the trial. Unfortunately, both men are sworn enemies, and they may kill each other before the bad guys get to them.My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" is the flashback scene when Jackson meets his future wife (outrageously played by Salma Hayek) for the first time. It was funny and sexy with an overdose of hyper violence.""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" is loaded with shenanigans; but this is a movie that isn't meant to be analyzed for story logic. This is a fun and very funny, graphically violent movie that shines every time Reynolds and Jackson are on screen together. Kudos to director Patrick Hughes for adding energy to the story with his slick direction that really complements the script and lead actors.Mannysmemorablemoviemoment",The Hitman's Bodyguard
158,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,8,26 August 2017,"Usually Jay And Nick (The Autistic Reviewers) look up Movie Critics and will always listen and take in what they say in regards to a movie...for one of the first times ever we are here to tell you ""The Critics got it WRONG!"" 39% on rottentomatoes and low ratings everywhere on the internet...we weren't sure whether to see it or not, but we are so glad we did, because it's the most hilarious action packed Buddy Comedy we've seen in such a long time! Michael Bryce (played by Ryan Reynolds) is the worlds best bodyguard and he has never been shot nor has he ever failed to protect the person he is responsible for. Michael Bryce's next mission will be his toughest...to protect an unstoppable and the worlds best Hit-man Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson). Bryce's job is to get Kincaid to the court to testify against a very nasty, cold blooded Russian Killer Vladislav Dukhovich (played by Gary Oldman).Jay And Nick don't know what happened with the critics, but Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson have been the best on screen team buddies ever. Their chemistry just works. They are both hilarious together, and you could tell they were both having a great time being in the movie. The theater that we were in could not stop laughing...they were laughing at least every 30 secs, and so were we. The action was brilliant too, a lot of fake CGI mind you, but loads of car chases, fighting and shooting! The soundtracks that play during the fighting and shooting made it twice as much entertaining! We should also point out that Salma Hayek (who plays Kinaid's wife) was hilarious. Every time she speaks she has you laughing so hard! And how Jackson and Hayek meet is hilarious! Only complaint in this review would be that the CGI is too fake and Gary Oldman (who plays a very magnificent and terrifying villain) doesn't get enough screen time.But those 2 minor complaints aren't enough for us to give it a 1/5 star like all the critics have. This movie is a roller coaster ride from beginning to end. Ignore the critics and go and have a great time laughing your head off! And hats off to Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson who brought such amazing acting and chemistry to make this movie work so well! 4/5 stars. The Autistic Reviewers.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
159,danielharden,"Explode a car again, I dare ya, I double dare ya mother f*cker!",5,21 August 2017,"Everybody loves actors, they are essentially the face of the film industry and many are role models in their own right. Actor's play a huge factor in marketing a blockbuster film to an audience, and in some cases, they are the only thing the film can use to market itself Well aside from genre of course. The Hit-man's Bodyguard is a film very similar to 2016's Passengers starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt. Both films seemed like nothing more than an excuse to get their two lead actors in the same room. Whereas Passengers had an acclaimed director at the helm and got moderate to mixed reviews, The Hit- man's Bodyguard solely relies on the talent of its stars, Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson, and offers little more than their persona's comically clashing with one another.Reynolds and Jackson are two of the best actors at delivering insult comedy, but they are simply the performers of their material, not the writers of it. The Hit-man's Bodyguard seems to have mistaken Reynolds and Jackson for professional writers or impressionists, as the film's attempt at comedy feels more like a prompt sheet they gave the two leads, hoping they could work it into something funny through their fantastic on screen chemistry. But Reynolds didn't write Deadpool and Jackson didn't write Pulp Fiction, they just executed other people's work with outstanding comedic flare. The film's script simply puts swear words into normal sentences, hoping that because it's Samuel L. Jackson's voice saying ""motherf*cker"", it will be funny Well, it isn't, except to the one lady in my cinema who even found the serious terrorist attacks hilarious. This uninspired approach to comedy is frankly annoying, as it leaves the actors with nothing to work with and having to make the screenwriter look good. The film's story is also pretty cliché so I don't really know what the screenwriter was paid to do honestly This film had and still does have, so much potential with its paradoxical title, if only this idea was given to filmmakers who were able to find that potential and live up to it, rather than sit back when Reynolds and Jackson walk into the room. But then again the film is making money so guess they played the game right.This film is also rather confusing as to what it wants to be at times. We don't really know any of the characters in this film, even though a very slight attempt is made with Ryan Reynolds and Elodie Yung, and Sam Jackson is given a fair bit of backstory. The film flashbacks to Jackson's past as he tells stories of his past, but when the time comes for that to be relevant it's completely glossed over and forgotten about, same goes for Reynolds motivation of his triple-A rating... He went on about it enough for Christ's sake, someone give the man his God damn rating back... The film introduces certain aspects only to forget about, or gloss over them, later in the film once they change their mind on what they want to focus on. The Hit-man's Bodyguard all of a sudden gets caught up in love and characters romantic relationships, because romance is essential for any blockbuster movie, the guy has to get the girl in the end right? To be honest I didn't care about that and wished they stayed more focused on the main story at play here rather than trying to turn it into a soppy love story.Which brings me to the pace and direction of the film, it's fine. Patrick Hughes improves upon his last movie, The Expendables 3. The film is shot better as the action scenes are rather fun at times, especially one that starts in a kitchen and ends in a home depot. The action in this movie is actually decent and way better than I expected, hence why I believe it should have been a straight-up action film, rather than padding its runtime with comedic failure. Patrick Hughes has a thing for blowing up cars in this film. I'm not sure why, but nevertheless a drinking game lies within that. Although the action scenes are shot rather well, the film does, however, feel rather rushed. As I said the action is decently shot and fast paced, but the combination of action scenes and how the film is edited as a whole, doesn't make you feel any urgency but instead makes you feel the film's hurry to end.Overall, The Hit-man's Bodyguard is a very forgettable action comedy that relies entirely on its cast. The action is shot well and is enjoyable to watch, but the whole film feels rushed, lacking in a clear focus and tries too hard, or not hard enough, to be funny. The film is neither bad or good, it's just a dose of Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson, as well as Gary Oldman, who for some reason isn't used to market this film? If all you want to see is Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds awkwardly sing battle each other in a car, then I guess you're in luck.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Maybe it's my old age, 26 not exactly being THAT old however, I find it a rarity for me to now go and see a comedy and leave the cinema with a belly ache from laughing so hard. Don't get me wrong, I was excited for The Hit-man's Bodyguard, just as I would have been ten years ago however, the main difference is that I would have lapped up all of the jokes in this film and been ready to call this one of the best films of the year ten years ago, whereas now at the grand old age of 26, I found it almost painful to sit through at times.Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) is regarded as one of the top bodyguards in the business but when he's assigned to protect Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson), a notorious hit-man and also someone Bryce has had ties with before, it might not be the easiest assignment of his career. Getting Kincaid to a courtroom to testify against ruthless dictator Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman) comes with its fair share of obstacles.Patrick Hughes is a relatively inexperienced director, with The Expendables 3 being one of his only films, and it really does show with the bombastic action that The Hit-man's Bodyguard possesses. Aside from a high-octane speedboat chase through Amsterdam, the action in this film is very underwhelming.The other major selling point of this film, the comedy, is where it falters as well. It takes a while for Reynolds and Jackson to actually share a scene and the wait for that to actually happen is just tedious. The first half hour is pretty bad and luckily the pair sort of save the film from being a complete disaster by sharing some form of chemistry to enjoy. The writing is painstakingly mediocre and wastes the opportunity to make this one of the comedies of the year by opting for fart jokes and foul language.Frustratingly there are some very funny moments, particularly when Kincaid tells Bryce about how he met his wife however, these moments are very few and very far between. When the biggest laugh in a comedy is when a woman farts you should be worried.Coming to the performances, Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson just about keep this film afloat with plenty of verbal sparring, Reynolds bringing the sarcasm and Jackson doing what Jackson does best by being himself. Gary Oldman comes out all guns blazing as the villainous Dukhovich, Elodie Yung doesn't get a chance to show off any of the skills we've seen from here in Daredevil and Salma Hayek makes for one of the most irritating characters of the year as Sonia Kincaid, Darius' wife.Loud, foul-mouthed and aggressive, and that's just Samuel L. Jackson, The Hit-man's Bodyguard is unfortunately a major disappointment for me. I want to see more effort put into comedies from the major studios because what we get most of the time gets tiresome pretty fast.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Well, the title of the movie is not special because we can know whether this movie is about Hit-man or about Bodyguard or combination between them, and we can also know that this is an action movie. Like other action movie, this movie contains the blood and bleeding scenes, sexually contents and hard languages, rude scenes, etc., so if there are children with you to watch this movie, make sure that you activate parental advisory ethics. For the story review, this movie is telling us about how a Hit-man and a Bodyguard who meet each other, struggling together, and being partner to defeat a Belarussian dictator. While Samuel L. Jackson (Hit-man) meet Ryan Renolds (Bodyguard) in action movie, everybody knows that this movie is packed with cool scenes and some comedies. Yes it is. I can tell you that this movie can make the audience a good feeling to respect the Interpol, as well as laughing at the same time, because this movie's good points is not just about easy plot of the story, but also the laughable scenes in the middle of troubles. Until then, this movie is quite fun, but I can give some critics, well I am movie reviewer. First of my critic is about some plots that are forced to be happened, for example when the the Hit-man saves the Bodyguard in many scenes, the audience never know how the Hit-man can detect the Bodyguard's location, this thing just happen in movie, hard to be copied in the real life. The second critic is about the appearance of international justice system of ICC. It is true that ICC can hold trial against dictators around the world, but why this movie is choosing a Belarussian case. According to Edward Said's Orientalism, this is the view of the Western politic that construct the idea of ex-Russian countries are having trouble with corruption and dictator-ism. Well, but those points of critic are not reducing the fun feeling of watching this movie, to see the beautiful city of Amsterdam, the handsome Ryan Renolds, and the sexy Salma Hayek. The scenes style of running, surviving, combating, and shooting are look like James Bond movie and the plots that are easy predictable and hard-dying main actors are definitely look like Die Hard, that's why I said this movie is the combination of James Bond and Die Hard.

As an elite member of his craft, he is well paid and lives a very good life keeping high-profile targets safe the world over. When things unexpectedly take a turn we find Michael two years on having hit the skids and struggling to claw his way back to prominence in the new film ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"".Things become complicated for Michael as a despotic tyrant named Dukhovich (Gary Oldman) is on trial for war crimes and countless atrocities, and is about to go free due to removing all those who would be able to testify against him with credible evidence.  That is with the exception of one Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson).  Darius is incarcerated but makes a deal to testify in exchange for his wife (Selma Hayek), being granted freedom.  Darius knows he is a marked man but takes the chance and under the watch of Interpol Agent Roussel (Elodie Yung), they set off.Naturally things do not go as planned and the two find themselves fleeing for their lives with numerous deadly assassins hot on their heels.  Unsure who she can trust, Roussel calls in Michael even though they have some seriously unresolved issues about one another that destroyed their previous relationship. Further complicating matters is the history Michael and Darius share which makes them naturally hostile to one another.Nevertheless, Michael and Darius set off to reach the courtroom but the imposed deadline and face numerous dangers and hilarious situations along the way.Jackson and Reynolds work very well with one another and their banter and chiding comes across as very natural.  The jokes come more often than I expected but the film is very much an action film, and the sequences are intense, funny, and gripping, especially and extended chase and fight sequence along the canals and shopping district of Amsterdam.While some may say that the film is just a variation on the Buddy Cop genre of old, the strong cast and the winning mix of jokes and action make the film a very pleasant surprise and one of my more enjoyable films of 2017.

This is one of the best action movies I've seen in a long time. It simply delivers on all levels. It's really, really funny and the amazing chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson, (who is 68 years old and still makes actionmovies and look good doing it which is very impressive) makes it a feel good action comedy. *SPOILERS AHEAD*The plot is simple: Reynolds is a former 3 star bodyguard who, very much against his will, has to escort Jackson to a trial where a Russian dictator is charged with genocide, played very well by an almost unrecognizable Gary Oldman. If Reynolds can pull this off, he can get his 3 stars back and possibly win back his ex-girlfriend who he blames for losing his stars. With memorable lines like this one from Reynolds: ""this guy singlehandedly ruined the word motherf***** and that is not an easy thing to do"". This is happening why hit men chase Jackson around in the background and Reynolds just had enough. One of many many funny scenes. But the action itself is also great. Lots of carchases, explosions, hand to hand combat a nasty torture scene and lots of blood And a lot of f-bombs. And every time a scene gets a little emotional some unexpected action happens. Mostly it's hilarious. And an extra bonus the still very hot Salma Hayek, who is also funny plays Jacksons wife. She calls Jackson her little cuca racha which means cock roach. At an hour and 58 minutes it's also a perfect length, where you don't get bored, like you do with most movies today that drag on somewhere bettwen two and a half and three hours. If you, like me have had it with cencored boring PG13 action and grown men in spandex suits and you miss those great actionmovies from the 90'ies like The Last Boyscout and Point Break, then this movie is for you.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

While his limp is clearly there, it's not significant enough. He wouldn't be able to put any weight at all on that leg. As he takes the bullet out while talking to his honey, who uses the F bomb way too much, by the way, trying to funny and entertaining, his expression of pain is unrealistically subtle. This makes the rest of the movie unrealistic; and he fights Ryan Reynolds in the apartment soon after before fainting to the floor. He wouldn't be able to even fight like that in the first place. When Gary Oldman drives a knife through the back of a guy's hand, the guy's red face and extreme wincing is also unrealistically mellow. He'd be SCREAMING in pain, especially because Gary even TWISTED it in his hand. Gary rubbed a bunch of words in throughout this process, every one of which the guy wouldn't be able to process. At the climax, of course good guy Samuel L. Jackson made it out of the way of the oncoming truck as he reversed out into the busy street but the bad guys had perfect timing in having it plough right into them. Of course the explosion on the rooftop doesn't kill Samuel as he's in pursuit of Gary Oldman and surprises everybody by suddenly emerging from the smoke to take care of him once and for all. So predictable.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

I rented this mostly because I own stock in Lionsgate. This is unoriginal, formulaic, pandering pablum, but I enjoyed this more than Dunkirk. At least this tried to have actual ""characters"", instead of the cardboard cutouts in Dunkirk. At least this tried to entertain, instead of ... well, I still can't figure out WHAT Dunkirk was supposed to be doing. Otoh, MINUSES 
1. THB attempts to pass off swearing as intensity.
2. Both SLJ &, I think that was, an overweight S Hayek played their characters so far over the top that they ended up on the bottom. But, SLJ is entertaining & SH does have a great pair. (Ha HA!)
3. THB is typical post-Obozo trash with typical PC sexism & racism, where all of the evil people are white men & 98% of the characters with morals, courage, etc are women or ""people of color"". Yawn. Maybe Hellary wrote the script in her rest-of-her-evil-life spare time.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
181,ElliesWonder,Adrenalize by Hit-man's Bodyguard,9,18 August 2017,"Cinema review. Spoiler possibly included.I was adrenalized by The Hit-man's Bodyguard, I thought it would just another popcorn movie, my mood was short earlier. However, this action movie way much exceed my expectation!Every minute is intense and thrilling, my attention was totally captured throughout the entire movie. Samuel and the guy from Deadpool have a great chemistry, their fighting and argument amused every audience in the theater, it was so enjoyable to watch. This is the funniest comedy and exciting action movie in 2017 so far.The story is about an 3A protection agency (Ryan Reynolds) failed his career and become a bodyguard because his client got killed, and he believed his Interpol agent girlfriend sold him out. Yet the bodyguard still loves the agent, so he agreed when the interpool agent asked him to protect a witness to the international court in 24(?) hours because she needed a system outsider to help. There were spies inside the interpool, and huge groups foreigner hit-men wanted to hunt down the witness. The witness is the most notorious hit men (Samuel L Jackson) in the world, killed 250 targets in his career. The protection delivery journey is thrilling and funny, hit-man and protection agent is natural enemy, and they usually fired on each other before; their personalities also stand opposite, a planner elitism and a freehand unkillable hit-man. I laughed so hard with every argument they have.9/10 Take one point off to their horrible destroying, they destroyed everywhere with all the fire, bombs and cars turnover, if this truly happened, poor Europe government going to have a huge debt.Lastly, RIP to these few days terrorist attacks in Europe. Every human is a matter just like the movie scene. It is unforgivable to those who hold the power and use it against innocents. Peace.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
182,RoboRabbit89,A Bodyguard and Hit-man team up to stop a Russian dictator.,7,10 October 2017,"This is my very first review. Sam Jackson and Ryan Reynolds are two of my favorite actors. Now I haven't seen them in every thing but... you get the point.I seen this movie back in August with one of my friends and we both loved it. Since it's been a while I'm a little fuzzy on the details, so I'm just going to tell you mostly how I felt a bout it in this review.It's great escapist fun, Patrick Hues the director did a good job with this one, Now I know he directed ""Expendables 3"" and I now a lot of you hated that film, I personally liked that film even though it wasn't the greatest.Selma Hayek was good in her little part even though I haven't really seen her in very much these days, Gary Oldman was great as the Russian baddie,Sam and Ryan are very good together as ""buddy assassins"" they have good chemistry on screen, and the action was great too even though it has clichés, but when they work you don't notice as much, I've read some reviews on here and some of you I guess didn't care for this, well to each there own I guess, What more could I say, give this one a chance and I think you'll like it too.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

184,Genkinchan,Funny action comedy,6,16 July 2021,I decided to watched it prior to watching the sequel and to my surprise it is quite entertaining and more over Samuel l Jackson steals almost every scene he is in it . Ryan Reynolds was overshadowed by Jackson.Secondly the only thing that is less fulfilling for me was the screen time for Gary Oldman should have put more screen time for him tooThirdly the plot is simple yet entertaining definitely better than the sequel.,The Hitman's Bodyguard
185,sujanfaster,Unclassy but Sassy!,9,2 September 2017,"We all know what happens when you bring two of the most entertaining Hollywood figures in an action film. The Hit-man's Bodyguard is like a cheat meal for the movie lovers. This one is definitely ain't for the critics. The title of the movie itself indicates how much fun the movie is. It had been a while since I had watched an R rated action comedy. Over the top action sequences, crude banter and sharp sarcasm make this movie one of the most entertaining ones of 2017.The script for a movie like this is least of the things that we need to worry about. This is almost like a romantic movie where the lead characters are trying to sort out things despite their differences. The chemistry between the lead actors (one who is a professional bodyguard and other a supercool hit-man) is what makes this movie totally entertaining. Almost every other line is full of sarcasm and dark humour (or if not Samuel L Jackson's classic cursing). The rest is full of bloody combat sequences, chases and of course the stereotypical bad guys. Sometimes the movie also feels like a road trip across the beautiful places of the UK and Netherlands. Samuel L Jackson and Ryan Reylonds form one of the best pair of action buddies on screen (well not necessarily buddies TBH). Ryan Reynolds has continued from where he left off Deadpool. Sam Jackson's cursing and mannerism remind us of so many previous characters that he has played but it is totally worth it. Elodie Young shines in another action role. Salma Hayek still looks hot and also is very funny in her few minutes of appearance. Gary Oldman however has a disappointing role of a conventional Russian bad guy for an actor of his caliber. This movie is a very good stressbuster if anyone is having a bad week. It has all the typical elements of for two hours total entertainment. Make sure to leave your logical and intellectual self behind before watching this movie.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
186,cyifly-2,Mindless Drivel. Really Bad,3,29 March 2018,"Every bad Hollywood cliche in the book is wrapped up into one 2-hour show... that feels like 3 hours. Russian bad guys with bad accents, silly action sequences that can't possibly happen, people get shot and run all over the city, plot holes no one explains, countless people who shoot weapons for a living can't hit their target, and on and on. I can 'go' with a lot of things. I can let things slide in the name of fun. But there was very little fun to be had here. It was just ridiculous. I felt my IQ dropping the longer it ran and saw myself rolling my eyes over and over. If you made a drinking game of how many times SLJ uses the F word or how many groups of people show up to shoot at him, you'd be completely wasted within an hour. That, actually, would've been more fun than the actual movie.Lots of really good talent -- some are even Academy Award winners -- just wasted. How they every got this caliber of actors together to do such a poor movie is bizarre. Don't waste your time here. I found myself looking at my watch each time another car went flipping through the air or every time another group of guns that can't hit who they are shooting at shows up. I kept thinking that it had to get better. I wanted to turn it off at the 1:00 mark. By the 1:30 mark, I just couldn't take any more -- and it still had a half hour to go. Save yourself the trouble.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
187,wheatley-20230,Unwatchable,1,12 October 2018,"Gratuitous violence and bad language don't necessarily render a film unwatchable, but they do here. The film had insufficient saving graces to rescue it. Most disappointing was the waste of a promising comic scenario.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
188,Jim-Eadon,A me-too thriller,3,22 November 2017,"This is a run of the mill mismatched buddies / assassins thriller. We've seen it all before. At no point during the movie was I rooting for the protagonists, quite the opposite. It's worth noting that protagonits are absolute idiots, in real life they would get themselves killed walking down the stairs. The ""bodyguard's"" girlfriend was even more annoying. I sincerely wish Hollywood wouldn't churn out by-the-numbers crap like this. It's tired. Every action scene was unbelievable, so the action scenes were no fun either.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
189,JCinHB,Lots of Action,6,27 July 2021,"Come on, this movie is NOT a 9 or a 10, Its a solid 6 and worth watching. Lots of action, car chases, blowing up things etc. Turn off your brain for 2 hours and enjoy.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

191,iceman88869,"Been done before, but entertaining",6,28 August 2017,"I enjoyed the movie to a point and it was a good combination of Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L Jackson. The bad thing is, I don't enjoy knowing what is going to happen and how things are going to work out before I am even half way through the movie. Everything that was done in this movie has been done in hundreds or even thousands of other movies. It's a middle of the road action movie with a few good laughs as you would expect from Ryan and Samuel, but it is no doubt nothing ground breaking. Entertaining for the time it runs, but very forgettable and will never become a classic.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
192,Rayofsun71,It's good if you don't take it seriously,9,25 April 2018,"Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson pair up and it's a match made in heaven. A good amount of action, humor amd heart. Just don't take it too seriously. This is one of those movies for that.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
193,Colbridge,The pairing of Jackson and Reynolds is something new and this is what keeps you hooked,6,9 June 2021,"If you like good action set pieces, thrilling Bond style car (and boat) chases and mismatched buddy movies then this one ticks all the boxes. Hitman Samuel L. Jackson is paired up with bodyguard Ryan Reynolds and together they fight, shoot and cuss their way across Europe in Patrick Hughes' crowd pleasing popcorn action thriller.It takes a little while to get going but once it does there are some high octane moments to enjoy and the wise cracking banter between the two leads is great fun, not to mention Salma Hayek's turn as Jackson's crazed wife. Gary Oldman doesn't get much to do except play a familiar cliched villain.The premise of the film reminded me of Midnight Run with the odd pairing of Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin where bounty hunter De Niro has to safely deliver accountant Grodin to his destination during a dangerous, event filled journey. However in this film both Jackson and Reynolds share equal amounts of on-screen action and you get a sense that they want to out do each other.You've seen it all before of course but the pairing of Jackson and Reynolds is something new and this is what keeps you hooked amidst chaotic scenes of mindless violence and sadistic killing.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

196,arnieiam,Surprisingly Entertaining,8,13 December 2020,"I watched this movie on Netflix 2 hours ago (baked). The title basically states the plot but just to elaborate quickly: Van Wilder, a professional bodyguard for (corrupt) political figures, is now tasked with protecting Shaft, an assassin, so that he can testify against a dictator in the International Criminal Court.The ICC is located in the Netherlands hence the second act takes place in Amsterdam, a city I love visiting. Whenever a film establishes a location, they better make good use of it and they did here. I appreciated little details like a set piece through the red light district which had hookers running away in fear.The premise is pretty simple and the best way to execute it is to have two actors with proper chemistry. Both Reynolds and Jackson are very verbose and witty actors who carved out a niche playing wordy badasses. They seem to have some good banter going. Sometimes they try too hard to get in the last word which can get annoying. But then there are times where they discuss ethics.And its because of the mixture of well executed set pieces and the chemistry of the two leads that carry the film well and make it quite entertaining. So yeah it is no Shane Black movie but it emulates it well enough.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
197,NestorTheGreat,Rush 48 Leathal Weapon Hours,7,10 October 2021,"A lot better on second viewing, and yet I wonder if it could've been better under another director's control. The dark subject matter is eclipsed by the down-your-throat comedy elements except when the exceptional Gary Oldman brings his evil Russian dictator to the fore! An immoral, protect-whomever-pays bodyguard goes up against a contract killer that only kills those that deserve it, who's kinkly in love with a sociopath that'll kill you just for looking at her wrong! Talk about a mixed bag!The Leathal Weapon, 48 hours, Rush Hour comparisons are inevitable, and unfortunately Hitman's... falls short. The car chases make up for the shody fight scenes, and the story holes could be forgiven by Ryan and Samuel's commitment.Not a bad escapism film if you leave your puzzle-solving skills at the door!",The Hitman's Bodyguard

199,fuelrodx,Better than expected,8,12 March 2021,I like both of these actors. They were able to bounce off of each other pretty well. At first they're fighting each other and you're wondering which way it's going to go. You see that they already know each other and end up having to deal with an enemy alongside each other. It is humorous and has enough action in it so it seemed to balance out sufficiently. So I got the DVD.,The Hitman's Bodyguard

202,aingmire-26563,Ryan Reynolds classic.,7,17 August 2021,This movie is so funny and a great comedy. The one thing I loved was Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson's chemistry. The acting is good and it has a pretty good plot. If your looking for a great comedy then I suggest this.,The Hitman's Bodyguard
203,TakeUpReel,Cliche filled movie that you've seen numerous times before,3,5 July 2018,"Spoilers ahead!The writer must have copied pages from scripts that the main actors have already starred in to create this script.The director must have said, ""Remember the character that you played in the last dozen movies that you were in......yeah, do that again!""It seems that Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson play the exact same character in every movie that they're in. I swear I've seen Joaquim de Almeida play a very similar role in another movie.Gary Oldman seemed like he was reprising his role in Leon:The Professional. Granted GO has better range as an actor than most of the others that were in this movie.The chemistry between Salma Hayek and SLJ was awkward and seemed forced. Maybe that's why Salma's character seemed forced (in an attempt to pair the two).The choice to change this movie from a drama to a comedy (of sorts) was the wrong move. The ""jokes"" were stale and fell flat.The fight/car chase/shoot out scenes were ridiculous, especially the scene when SLJ was in the boat and RR was on the motorcycle.SLJ's character was determined to be unkillable in order to justify the lazy writing in this movie. Why did RR's girlfriend sporadically speak French? It was a meaningless addition to the character that wasn't really explained.When RR got into a car where the steering wheel was on the left-hand side, he made a comment about the stick shift being on the right. Is he suppose to be British in this movie? If so, did everyone forget to tell him to adopt a British accent? Personally, I'm glad he didn't do an accent, but it made the line in the movie seem odd.If you've seen any other movie in your life, you've probably seen this movie under a different name. I'm glad I didn't waste money at the box office to see this.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
204,mathmaniac,Excellent action flick,10,19 November 2017,"It helps that this movie, packed with violence, has dreamy dripping-with-sincerity Ryan Reynolds as a central character. The big surprise is how the 'unkillable' Samuel Jackson character comes across as lovable, loving, and even heroic.The two have great chemistry in a bickering ""I'm starting to like you"" way as they discuss their views on their women while shooting up everything that moves (except the innocent, of course).The plot moves along at a fast clip. There is nothing BUT action on the screen, it seems - no downtime until the very end of the movie when Samuel Jackson and Salma Hayek share a moment amid a bar brawl. And make it romantic.If you are a fan of this guns-gore-and-guts genre, you will enjoy watching this. It is satisfying when you come home at the end of the day, frustrated and wanting to kick your boss or throw nun-chucks at the telephone filled with 20 waiting messages from telemarketers and the dog has just thrown up on the Persian rug. Make a bowl of popcorn, curl up on the sofa, and enjoy!",The Hitman's Bodyguard
205,msudude22,Typical Samuel L. Jackson Movie,1,3 December 2017,I pretty much knew it was going to be a typical Samuel L. Jackson movie. I started to watch it anyway. I watched about a half hour and then turned it off. Samuel L. Jackson is really the black version of Joe Pesci. All he does is say the f word over and over in all of his movies. I got bored after 30 minutes and turned it off.,The Hitman's Bodyguard
206,slicedbread117,Amusing and Campy but Doesn't Live Up to its Potential,6,4 September 2017,"The film industry has seen plenty of films in the past that use the ""buddy cop"" (if you will) formula, many failing, but some have seen better fates. So in an action/comedy genre that has seen quite a bit of repetition, The Hit-man's Bodyguard needed a distinction to let it stand out from its own kind, and that variance was marketed as the team-up of Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson. The duo may be entertaining, but it's still not enough to bring the film to a higher level.The main showcase is of course on Reynolds and Jackson, trying to build chemistry and create comedy gold together. No doubt, the two are highly entertaining on their own levels and are the focus of the film, but the chemistry isn't has stellar as its being made out to be. Don't get me wrong, there is some solid connection between the two, and again, individually both are hilarious, but there was never that defining scene or two that really made their characters bind as I'd hoped. There was very much an ""opposites attract"" feeling towards the two main characters, and while Jackson's vulgar hit-man is consistent and often hilarious, Reynolds' bodyguard jumps between a tidy, safe and sound, OCD-style character and a little bit of Deadpool, which doesn't help the chemistry building between him and Jackson. The character writing, I felt, was the blockade keeping the two characters from flourishing more than they do. Reynolds and Jackson work with what they're given and are still the strongest point of the film, without question. They land plenty of great jokes and show flashes of strong chemistry, but it's unfortunately, at least for me, not as strong as you'd think.There is, as expected, a very generic story put in place, which is corny and predictable but if not taken too seriously, can be a fun and somewhat interesting. The run time is about 20 min longer than needed, sometimes dragging for small stretches, especially near the beginning where the movie takes a while to get going, but picks up in the third act enough to keep the narrative from becoming boring. It's hardly anything that will knock your socks off, but if you loosen your expectations a bit, it's a fun popcorn-flick story.The Hit-man's Bodyguard is, after all, an action comedy, so naturally the film is packed with both aspects, mostly great, but sometimes fairly poor. The action sequences have some John Wick-style action, with high-octane gun fights and a lot of campy blood and gore that helps make the action entertaining, but occasionally can get super cheesy. The fight choreography is okay, and the car chase scenes are straightforward and predictable, but still entertaining for what they are. I touched on the comedy side for a bit already, but I'd like to reiterate that there is a lot of good, well timed humor, a lot of it made stronger by the classic delivery of Samuel L. Jackson, who is easily the funniest part of the movie.Along with Reynolds and Jackson, there are a couple other bigger names in the cast, including the ever-so-sinister Gary Oldman, who even in the dullest of stories can provide a intense and threatening villain, which, even without much screen time, he succeeds at here as antagonist Vladislav Dukhovich. More screen time would have been welcomed for Oldman, but the majority understandably went to the main combo. Elodie Yung also appears with a limited role, nothing more than okay in support of Reynolds and Jackson. Not much depth in the cast, as the focus was meant to be on the top billed cast.To expect anything more than a fun action/comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously would have been a mistake, but that doesn't help cover up some obvious flaws. The dynamic of Reynolds and Jackson help maintain intrigue and laughter throughout the film and the action is often fast-paced and fun, but there's a heavy lack of originality and a just missed spark between Reynolds and Jackson that could've made this team-up one of the best in recent memory. The Hit-man's Bodyguard has plenty of missteps, but is ultimately a decent shoot em' up popcorn movie that will keep you entertained enough to be worth a couple of hours.6/10",The Hitman's Bodyguard

215,thirtyfivestories,All Lives Are Worth Protecting,4,5 October 2017,"The protection business is booming. Corruption has pushed the demand for professional armor-guarding above the roof. Wealth is a mountain climbed with slimy, profiteering hands. Micheal does not think too much about his clients' ascents, all he is concerned with are the enemies they have collected on their rise to the top.Micheal's operation gathers scenarios. He prides himself on foreseeing the unforeseeable. He has rose to his AAA status by being as fickle as the scumbags he chaperons. Saving lives is the business model, but one cannot help but to wonder if this is a misuse of resources.Darius is Micheal's worst nightmare. An assassin that does not subscribe to any logistical course plans, Darius is the intangible crack in Micheal's security. They are at odds without being enemies. Neither has respect for the other, but they both walk with a subdued fear of one another. Well maybe just Micheal does.As even the least astute viewer could predict, the two fill the roles of yin and yang in unashamed cookie cutter ways. Conveniently paralleled backstories pull the unlikely duo into a phony symbiosis, and the breaks in character flow from this light bromance.​What is a nobler calling: Saving the lives of pampered villains, or killing them? Neither is righteous, but the origins of these careers hold some promise. Taking up very little screen time are hints of these heroes' calls to adventure, but clearly monetary fulfillment robbed their sympathies along the way.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

There is definitely a chemistry between Jackson and Reynolds where I could see them hooking up for future projects.Hayek definitely showed range and some action star potential (but we probably should accept it was most likely body double/stunt women).Plot ridiculous and law enforcement made to look less competent which always is sad for them.

I will admit that the first 20  minutes were pretty generic for me and I found myself thinking, ""This  is pretty much what I expected, but it's a free screening so just enjoy  it.""   However, once Reynolds and Jackson team up on the screen the entire  chemistry of the movie changes and it ended up being one of the funnest  ""buddy cop"" movies I've seen in quite a while. (I know it technically  isn't a buddy cop movie, but it really is for all intents and  purposes.)   The movie doesn't take itself seriously (were you really expecting that  with Reynolds and Jackson?!), and just like any modern action/comedy  the plot isn't meant to be something like Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.

Avoid!",The Hitman's Bodyguard
221,cschultz-2,Violent and Disappointing,3,27 August 2017,"Despite a yeoman effort from a talented and likable cast, ""The Hit- man's Bodyguard"" often resembles a deal made in a studio's boardroom more than an actual motion picture. This notion is augmented by the knowledge that Tom O'Connor's original script was originally intended as a straight dramatic thriller, but underwent a frantic two-week revision prior to production in an effort to turn the picture into a buddy comedy.A broad and exceedingly violent live action version of a Road Runner cartoon, ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" concerns the efforts of a down- on- his-luck security agent charged with transporting an international assassin safely from England to the Netherlands to testify in the International Court of Justice in a trial against the brutal dictator of Belarus. Sent to prevent them from reaching their destination are a rogue's gallery of enemy agents as cartoonish as any you've seen since the old Dick Tracy comic strip. Naturally, the bodyguard and the hit-man despise each otherat first.The security agent is played by Ryan Reynolds and the assassin is played by Samuel L. Jackson. And part of the problem they need to overcome is that their characters have met before—in fact, they've exchanged gunshots. And while both actors do their best with a script which is long on comical interplay, mayhem, and bloodshed, but short on actual plot or logic, Reynolds and Jackson are never quite able to persuade the audience they develop enough mutual loyalty along the way to make the story credible.Even worse, the picture manages to eventually actually wear out its welcome, and becomes tiresome. The clock ticks about twenty minutes past what seems like a logical and satisfying dramatic conclusion, and into what feels almost like a different movie entirely. And just when the new plot gets itself rolling, the picture seems so anxious to put a period at the end of its sentence that it leaves its heroes' situations largely unresolved, a mistake the filmmakers attempt to remedy with the inclusion during the final credits of a long, pointless, and resoundingly unfunny outtake.In the process, the violence is literally numbing—the body count is enormous, and enough vehicles to fill a cineplex parking lot are crashed, shot up, launched into the air, blown up, or otherwise destroyed. The stunt budget must've been half the cost of the production. The final effect is of overkill, in every possible sense of the word.Directed by Patrick Hughes and filmed mostly in the actual locations, ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" is recommended only for die-hard fans of either Jackson or Reynolds or both, or for those viewers looking to lose themselves in a European travelogue loaded with gratuitous violence and carnage. Others should proceed with caution. Needless to say, audience members with young children are encouraged to leave the kiddies at home.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Enjoyed the eclectic musical soundtrack, which really fit; unlike the MF-ing-obsessed dialog out of the mouth of the beautiful Selma Hayek, which really didn't.The chemistry between Samuel L's charm and Ryan Reynolds' deadpan works, and the comedic content and delivery of their repartee is the real entertainment here.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
223,MichaelNontonMulu,An Endless Fun and Full of Action Movie,8,17 August 2017,"It had been a while since I was totally enjoying a funny comedy action movie. This was by far the most exciting old fashion action movie I have seen in the past few months. It was fun, got lots of funny moments especially when we saw the interaction between Ryan Reynolds (Bryce) and Samuel L. Jackson (Kincaid). It was actually not a new recipe where two people of different background had to work together to be safe from the bad guys (a little bit similar formula in the movie Bulletproof with Damon Wayans and Adam Sandler). However, this movie was having a lot more awesome ridiculous stunts and a lot more brutal. Yes, the killings were pretty violent but not up to the level of horrifying.The movie had got an R rating mostly I think due to the profound language (countless times we would here the ""F"" word being used in here) and some of the action sequences. The main attraction in this movie was definitely the amazing chemistry between Bryce and Kincaid's characters. It was really wonderful to see how difficult Bryce who was a methodical full of planning type had to deal with Kincaid who always did anything based on instinct. Surprisingly also, Salma Hayek's character as a totally violent person was very fun to watch. Did I mention also about this movie being very funny? If I had not said it enough, I will say it again that this movie was very funny. There were so many moments that my wife and I and the rest of the audience would really laugh out loud. And the action sequences were sooo many in between. I felt there was no dull moment in the movie at all. For a movie of almost 2 hours, it sure filled us with lots of entertaining scenes. Just when you thought that it was over, there seemed to be something else again. And if you wait till the end credit scene, you can see a quite funny scene before it ended.Another factor that made the movie so fun to see was the use of some 80s songs to accompany the ""romantic"" scenes such as Hello by Lionel Richie or I Want To Know What Love Is by Foreigner. The explosion effects and the sound effects were great. All in all this film was a really entertaining movie that gave us lots and lots of fun. I would really really recommend this one for you to see in the cinemas near you. Please be sure to watch this one with your friends and family (minus the children as it was not for their consumption).

226,rebeccalucy,Decent action film...,6,26 December 2017,"A good experience but not much comedy as I thought there would be. The concept for the film is quite unique with the dictator idea. Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson and Salma Hayek were quite funny and gave some good performances. They all had good chemistry together and played off each other quite well. Most of the acting was very good, but some are under used like Gary Oldman. He was quite frightening but he didn't have much time to develop his character. The cinematography can be good, being a bit more experimental than unusual action films. Particularly in the first 30 minutes there is very little comedy, which makes the film have a bit of a tonal shift. The film is also quite quiet in parts, having to be put on very loud to hear some things that are being said. If watched as an action film first it is quite good!",The Hitman's Bodyguard
227,ReelLifeReviews,Forgettable,4,10 August 2017,"The Hit-man's Bodyguard - Short on laughs and long on runtime. How a concept like this could be stretched into 2 full hours is a feat unto itself.There are some actors in Hollywood that are basically infallible. The likes of Daniel Day Lewis, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (RIP), Tom Hanks, and Gary Oldman come to mind when I think of consistent, quality performances. Unfortunately for Gary, his streak has come to a crashing end. I don't know why he would sign on to a movie like this in the first place, but more than that, I don't know why the director, producer, studio, or even Gary Oldman himself would hang his hat on what ended up in the final cut.As we've come to expect, Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson play themselves in the movie, not really bringing any character into their roles. They're funny guys, to be sure, but they just don't hit the mark for me in this one. People were definitely laughing in the theater, but it just gets too slapstick for me at times. The fight scenes themselves, however, are intricate and well- choreographed. They aren't at the level of John Wick 2, but they easily surpass the fights from the recently released Atomic Blonde. There are a couple good car chases as well, with one being to the tune of Black Betty, which probably stands as the best car chase backdrop; perfectly chaotic and fun.This movie of course doesn't take itself too seriously, but I at least wanted to laugh and enjoy the story. I didn't end up doing much of either. It's another film that when you see it in Target in November you'll say ""Oh ya, that was a thing that happened."" Not exactly a quote you'd want on the cover. 4/10.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
228,DJKwa,Deadpool and Nick Fury's European Vacation,6,5 September 2017,"There's an obvious joke to be made about The Hit-man's Bodyguard. With the pairing of Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds in an action buddy-comedy, it would be easy to joke that The Hit-man's Bodyguard is one Marvel logo away from being renamed ""Deadpool and Nick Fury's European Vacation"". Luckily, with Reynolds once again playing a wise cracking, smart-ass and Jackson playing up his trademark no nonsense persona, it wouldn't be a stretch to draw the comparison and the odd match-up proves to be just as much fun as it sounds. The set up of the story is simple. Reynolds plays an executive protection agent (aka bodyguard) who's tasked with transporting Jackson's hardened hit-man across Europe to testify against a ruthless Belarusian despot (played by Gary Oldman) at the International Court of Justice. Having crossed paths numerous times before, on opposing ends of a gun, the two must learn to put aside their differences and work together if they want to survive and make it to court in time. It's formulaic stuff, taken from an assembly line of Euro-centric action thrillers but with complexity substituted for laughs and nuance for a high-body count. Action scenes (particularly one standout staged on the streets and canals of Amsterdam) are brisk and over the top, and the humorous banter between Reynolds and Jackson flies fast and fun, with the two well-matched leads turning trading insults into an art form. Long stretches of the film feature the two sitting in a car together, and it's a joy to watch them cut loose and dig into each other with the acuity of verbal ninjas, spryly tearing each other down with a flick of the tongue. It's all highly entertaining, but the decision to use real world politics to stage the cartoonish action is a jarring choice that leaves the film with a bitter aftertaste. Not surprisingly, the screenplay was reportedly reworked last-minute from a drama into a comedy and the film is left feeling like a patchwork of conflicting tones. Most glaringly, Oldman's war criminal villain feels like a remnant of a much more serious draft of the screenplay than the one on screen. He's a reprehensible character whose crimes against humanity, including the brutal massacre of a village, don't sit comfortably in a film where death and destruction are mostly played for laughs. While it's hard to look past the film capitalising on real world tragedy to propel such light-hearted action, The Hit-man's Bodyguard wisely avoids putting too much focus on anything besides its two well-matched leads. Reynolds and Jackson are front and centre in nearly every scene and they work so well together that it wouldn't be surprising if the screenplay were overhauled into a comedy after one screen test with the duo. Despite the troubling story elements that remain, their chemistry alone makes The Hit-man's Bodyguard worth watching.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

233,TheJediWay9,Fun Enough,7,17 August 2017,"""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" is directed by Patrick Hughes and stars Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson. Reynolds plays Michael Bryce, the world's top bodyguard who has to protect a hit-man (Jackson) who has incriminating information about a Russian dictator (Gary Oldman), while trying to put their past differences aside. Reynolds and Jackson have good chemistry when they are on screen together. Their ""hate banter"" back and forth is really something fun to watch, as cliché as it might be. There are some funny lines that they have as they banter back and forth with each other, but nothing that was gut busting hilarious. Some of the jokes land, some of them don't. However it was a really solid and interesting pairing for a movie like this.When people are getting shot and explosions are occurring it's a fun movie...for the most part. When I say ""for the most part"" I mean this: When the action sequences are competently directed and filmed in a coherent way in which the audience can tell what is going on that's where this movie gains traction and is a lot of fun. When these action sequences are edited pretty poorly and there's too much shaky cam and flash cutting, it sort of becomes a bit of a mess. Shaky cam doesn't usually bother me too much, but it was not done to perfection in this film and when they straightened the camera up after the shakiness has subsided, the picture is slightly out of focus and concentrates on things that we don't have to see. Salma Hayek was in the movie and while she does have a bit of comic relief, there were some scenes where I just thought to myself ""why?"" Her character was a bit of a nut case and annoying, but there were times when she went for it with the raunchy dialogue and those times really worked. Gary Oldman had no purpose being in this movie. His talents are needed elsewhere. First off, he's barely in the movie and second, he tries to portray his villain character in the way Gary Oldman would portray his villain characters in those classic 90s films, and it didn't work. By the time his character decides to actually do something in this movie it's too little, too late. The audience is literally spooned all of the information needed thanks to almost every other scene in the movie being exposition. And it's always when characters are in cars...just sitting there...talking.Finally, this movie goes on for WAY TOO LONG. They could have easily have cut out the last twenty minutes of the movie and nothing would have changed regarding the story. Speaking of the story, it does try to get a little too clever at times and becomes convoluted, which this movie didn't need. This movie can be fun at times for what it is, which is pure escapism cinema. Nothing more, nothing less. During a s stormy night, I'd probably watch the movie if I had nothing else to do.I am going to give ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" a C+.You can check out my review of the film here on YouTube as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpiLC8aLwQ4",The Hitman's Bodyguard

236,iamjacksmoviechannel,And iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii like this movie,7,23 August 2017,"""The Hit-man's Bodyguard""- this movie deserves credit alone for creating what seemed like the most hilarious trailer of the year based on a ""The Bodyguard"" spoof you could swear was coming at least 20 years too late. But you pair Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson together and you can almost guarantee amusement and for the most part that's what it gives. Reynolds is a bodyguard who's beating himself up over losing a client two years ago, Jackson is an imprisoned assassin willing to offer up hard evidence so that a genocidal foreign president played by Gary Oldman goes to jail forever. Soon the two have no one but each other to trust, which makes it all the more difficult than that they both have a rough past with each other that make their partnership a prickly one, thus cliché action buddy comedy begins. This movie lucked out with the casting though. Reynolds is a king of sarcasm as we all know and Jackson is perfect at chiding him and getting under his skin. These guys are never not fun to watch and about 99.9% of that comes from performance alone. You also can't fault what Oldman is doing here, he's going to hammy levels of viciousness to make this villain-behind-bars menacing and it's what the movie needs. Salma Hayek is also here playing Jackson's wife and not her performance, but her character in general, is probably one of the biggest problems with ""Hitman"" as a whole cause it's way too happy saying curses than showing some actual wit. Even with Reynolds and Jackson you wait for the really funny banter to come and it really never does outside of Jackson doing his trademark cursing or Reynolds doing his schtick. There's also so much that could be cut out here, from the constant talk of the character's love lives to a bunch of flashbacks to the more serious stuff like ""there are some people just need killing"". What put this movie over the top for me though was a great feeling for the action sequences by director Patrick Hughes, who does some really awe-inspiring stuff with shoot-outs and car chases, one through the streets of Amsterdam is incredible. Overall I felt the action was incredible and Jackson and Reynolds amusing enough to keep this thing chugging along past it's flaws.So I go 7 out of 10 guys.

237,jonathanmark-77048,A Very Underrated Action Comedy,8,15 August 2017,"Plot: The world's top bodyguard gets a new client, a hit man who must testify at the International Court of Justice. They must put their differences aside and work together to make it to the trial on time.This is a very underrated action comedy, this is more of a throwback to 90s action comedies which I love to death. I just came out of the screening of this and can't wait to see it again and pay for it. The story is well told and well written. Ryan Reynolds gives his best performance as Michael Bryce (yes I like this more than Deadpool),Samuel L Jackson gives one of his best performances in a long time, I was worried because I thought he would go overboard with his famous curse word but he didn't and I'm glad. The supporting cast are also very good especially Gary Oldman reprising his Air Force One performance but not as over the top, Elodie Yung who was very likable, and Salma Hayek who is just as funny as Jackson. The action is mostly well handled especially the chase scenes which were very exciting and fun. The fight scenes were decent but they used too much shaky cam at times which are the main reason why I gave this an 8 and not a 9 along with them maybe cutting out 10 minutes but that's it.Overall, The Hit-man's Bodyguard is a very good and underrated action comedy that deserves to be seen if you're a fan of 90s action comedies because this is a love letter to them. It has a good story, a good heart, mostly likable characters(you can't say that Jackson is likable along with Hayek but that's the point.), really good action, and a good soundtrack. This is what I want Hollywood to make not a lot of the franchise movies, more movies like this which didn't need a big budget to be exciting. Go see it if you have a chance, you won't regret it.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
238,tyingling7766,"They got together, and the laughs and action came",7,10 September 2017,"Okay, so Hollywood finally got Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson into a movie. From what I heard they have been trying for ages. With the fact the two of them are two of the most sought after actors in movies nowadays it was no surprise it took so long for it to happen. But it did, and there were some bad things that happened with the movie, but more good. First let's get the bad out of the way. There isn't that much, but there is some. Now, I'm not one to push flashbacks away from telling a story, but this movie did do a bit more with the flashbacks. Some of them didn't need to be in the movie. Yes, they did make sense, but there was only one that should have been used. The opening flashback was all that was needed. Nothing more. Then we have Sam Jackson. It was like the director said, ""Hey, everyone likes it when you constantly yell and blurt out MF all the time."" They even made a joke on the matter in the movie, and it was hilarious. Now, as much as I like Sam Jackson as an actor, I just can't stand how directors want him to continue to do the same thing over and over again. He has a lot of acting chops in him. Look at movies like Deep Blue Sea (yes I know, just watch him in it). He wasn't the same type of character in that movie and he was great in it. The thing that hurt the movie a bit more than the other two was that Gary Oldman was severely under used in this movie. And yet again, they used him in the same fashion as a lot of other movies he has been in. The dictator with too much power. The man played Commissioner Gordon to a ""T"" and ruined it for everyone else. The plot was a bit far-fetched. Why would Interpol bring in an outsider to move a prisoner? Even if they think there was a mole, the agent in charge would know at least one person who she would be able to trust in Interpol that could get the job done. Now, Reynolds' character is supposed to be the best in the business but still. He shouldn't have been brought in. The action was the second best part of this movie. Reynolds has become one of the best action stars in recent years. You can thank David S. Goyer for casting him in Blade Trinity. He is one of few people that makes the action scenes look quite believable. Sure, some of the moves wouldn't really incapacitate someone, let alone kill them. Still, looked believable. The comedy was the best part. Which is the reason someone wanted to bring Sam and Ryan together. Of course, they left a lot to be desired, especially with the ending of the movie. There were so many jokes in this movie to keep a good count on. Sometimes, you would still be laughing at one joke before the next one came into account. I personally believe that you can tell how funny a movie is by the fact you can't remember some of the jokes because you were laughing too hard. All in all, I would say you should watch this movie for the match up alone. There is no reason we shouldn't have gotten these two together before this year, but we finally got them. And, by the way the movie ended, I think we're going to get them together again in the next few years.Rating: 7 out of 10",The Hitman's Bodyguard
239,pokedom,I like to think this is simply a day in the life of these guys.,6,19 September 2017,"I was super excited to see this film. I distinctly remember at the end of watching Deadpool Ryan Reynolds turning to the camera and saying, ""What, you waiting for Sam Jackson to show up?"" And that got me thinking: how cool would it be for that to actually happen? And guess what! It happened!There's just a few catches to this dream team however.The comedy is, for the most part, on point. I know comedy is subjective (though in reality, it's just whatever makes you laugh is subjective), so this movie isn't going to be for everyone. If you don't like lots of cursing, this is not the movie for you. But if you remember all of Sam Jackson's best moments (ENOUGH IS ENOUGH... SAY WHAT AGAIN... you know, the usual), this movie's got some of the best. He's got a genuine character outside of saying mothaf-ah a literal ton of times, and when he's funny, he's hilarious. Ryan Reynolds complements him perfectly. There's a scene midway through where Sam Jackson is in a populated area shooting at Russian agents... no context... and Reynolds is just talking to a dude behind a counter about Jackson's life. Acting all casual while the background is just in utter chaos. It's hilarious!Thankfully the movie is funny enough to carry everything else. There are a few serious problems that prevent me from loving it even more. The plot is easy to follow, but it felt more as an excuse to tell great jokes. You can just tune it out and enjoy this movie as a roadtrip-comedy between the two actors. But the plot is trying way too hard in the background. Sirius Black/Commissioner Gordon is a Russian dictator who's in court because of his heinous crimes. And Jackson is the only person with evidence. Despite this, the only reason Black is in the court is because he killed several hundred people who disagreed with his ideas of running the country. So the only reason the trial is going his way is because there's a lack of evidence. Apparently there's a whole website that only Jackson has access to that shows all the bodies of the people he's killed. No one could hack into this website? No one could call him and ask for the password? He absolutely has to be there to testify? Okay.A few more issues before we wrap up. There's one really obvious reveal midway through the film. It's so obvious that I audibly groaned when they revealed it. I won't say anything, go watch this film to know. Sometimes a joke goes a bit too far. They make a joke, and they could end the scene. But then it goes on for a few seconds more and they try and make another joke before the scene ends. Like in jail with Jackson's wife, there's an inmate who cowers in the corner. They could end the scene with her cowering. But no, the girl then farts. My audience erupted with laughter... I just kinda stared.This isn't a movie for everyone. I can tell that a lot of people might not like this, and this is fine. But for me, it did everything I had to: I laughed and laughed and laughed. If you're interested in this power couple, go right ahead and watch it.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

248,Marthian80,Fast paced action movie that simply delivers,7,13 October 2017,"I didn't know much about this movie but I like both Samuel L Jackson and Ryan Reynolds plus lots of it is shot in my country so I was mildly curious.The story starts with the character of Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds), who is a triple-A executive protection agent and busy delivering a Japanese client to the airport. However, Michael is not a triple-A agent for long as the deliverance of his client ends in disaster. Two years later, he is reduced to a second-class bodyguard, trying to make a living and still unhappy about the incident which cost him his status. His life will soon start to get much more excited when his ex-girlfriend Amelia (Elodie Yung) gives him his next job: take the extremely dangerous professional hit-man Darias Kincaid(Samuel L Jackson) from Manchester to the Hague in the Netherlands. Kincaid has to testify against a Belorussian dictator because he is the only one that can provide hard evidence to lock this man behind bars. Michael agrees, but soon founds out that transporting a professional hit-man who is hunted by lots of angry Belorussians is not an easy task. This is a very entertaining action movie with loads of comedy moments thrown in. Off course there are many ""buddy"" movies like these but when the main character have lot's of chemistry together, they can really work. And with Jackson and Reynolds that is definitely the case! They obviously had a lot of fun together and there are some very good jokes that made me laugh out loud. The background for both characters is also nicely done and they develop a relationship throughout the movie. Gary Oldmen does his best to try to play an evil dictator but because he's in court and in prison most of the time, it doesn't really work. The supporting characters and the other villains are not much more then plot devices and dudes for Jackson and Reynolds to kill, but sometimes that's all you need to make a fast paced action movie. What does work is the excellent stunt-work and fight scenes. There are some terrific car chases, great shoot outs and exciting fist fights. Almost every kind of vehicle is used in this movie to make a chase in, even boats. The Dutch cities look very cool in this movie as a setting, we should do this more often.. ;) You shouldn't expect much realism in a movie like this and the plot is very simple, it reminds me of the 80's action movies, but when you look past that, your in for a lot of fun. I recommend watching this when your in the mood of a fast paced action movie that simply delivers.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

The story line was not beyond belief, although there was nothing particularly original about the script - standard buddy movie where the two characters were at war with each other the whole time and despite their dislike of each other they become friends and win through in the end. As we knew they would from the get- go. All very predictable. The action scenes were full on and non-stop and the movie as a whole was very very watchable - apart from the nonsense romantic BS backstory. The Jackson/Hayek romance story had a place in story line but the Ryan Reynolds/Elodie Yung story added nothing to the story and was little more than the usual Hollywood nonsense that they have ruined countless movies with. It seems to me that Hollywood has some sort of weird censorship type mentality where they put together a good story line and production then some 'overlord"" comes along and says ""dumb it down because the average movie watcher is a moron and won't follow a story unless we make it more cheesy"".

But, let me say that there were also some interesting action ""solutions"". Generally it was a real fun to watch. What got me was loads of sarcastic humor presented by great cast and woven into quick'n'crazy action scenario. Generally not too deep (story) - but why should it be for the sake of simple fun.

257,rs403404,Just Misses the Target,6,23 August 2017,"The ad campaign and the casting for this movie is spot on. Perhaps one of my favorite movie posters of the year is ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" spoof of ""The Bodyguard"". I wish I could say the actual movie provided that much enjoyment. The setup is fairly simple. A captured hit-man (Samuel L Jackson) is given a deal to testify against an evil dictator (Gary Oldman). Unfortunately, Interpol has a mole and the agent (Elodie Yung) in charge of making sure the hit-man can testify calls the one person nearby who can help her and is out of the Interpol loop. Enter the disgraced bodyguard (Ryan Reynolds). Soon the hit-man and the bodyguard find themselves as a duo who must work together to ensure the hit- man reaches his court date The ads sell this film as a comedy with action elements. Sadly, this is an action film with comedic elements. I say sadly because the action here is extremely generic. The comedy isn't great for the most part, but it has its moments provided largely by some strong soundtrack choices and a great chemistry between Reynolds and Jackson. Salma Hayek is fantastic here as the Hit-man's wife. A scene showing them meet is easily the best scene in the movie. Gary Oldman (perhaps my favorite all time actor) seems like he's in a different movie. He's reprising his villain from Air Force One where his villain from The Fifth Element would fit this movie's tone infinitely better. I would actually love to see this film in the hands of a more gifted comedy director. Perhaps Edgar Wright or the duo of Lord and Miller. Someone who could add more flavor.That is a large part of the problem with this movie. The direction by Patrick Hughes is downright lazy. Shots range from standard to just ugly. The cinematography by Jules O'Loughlin is perhaps the worst I've ever seen from a major studio. Shots are overexposed. Other shots that are out of focus. It's inundated with sloppy rookie mistakes and for some reason Hughes let it go to print that way. I guess turning the iris or focus dials to the correct setting would be too much work?Jackson and Reynold are by far the best parts of the movie and are putting way more work into the film than many of the behind the scenes crew. I want to see this movie remade with a director and cinematopher that give a crap about making a good movie. As it is, Jackson and Reynolds almost make this movie worth recommending based on their interplay alone. Almost. The Hit-man's Bodyguard just misses the target.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
258,darryl-42069,The Deadpool/Nick Fury crossover we've been waiting for,8,19 August 2017,"In 2015's Deadpool, Ryan Reynolds has everyone wishes that a Deadpool movie with Nick Fury himself could become a reality.2 years has passed, and look what we've got: An actual ""buddy-cop"" movie starring Deadpool and Nick Fury with more yelling, even more cursing, and proofs that sometimes the Avengers/X-men don't gives a s**t.Pros: Ryan Reynolds as Michael Bryce is terrific. He has given one of his best performances, on par with The Merc with a Mouth himself. Samuel L. Jackson as Darius Kincaid is also great in this movie. The chemistry between Reynolds and Jackson worked very well, and it's one of the best bromance in recent years. Élodie Yung is also great as Bryce's ex- girlfriend. Salma Hayek took me off guard because she's so funny in this movie. And Gary Oldman is fantastic as the main baddie of the movie.This movie is directed by Patrick Hughes, who also directed the somehow not-really-fun action movie: The Expendables 3. But thankfully, he has improved in this movie, proved by how he direct his action scenes. He now handles the action scenes really well, with great camera angles and some wide shots. This movie is easily one of the funniest movie I've seen all year. There's not a single dull moment in this movie (I mean, you can't go wrong when Deadpool and Jules Winnfield is in this movie). The flashbacks, explaining the character's past is also really well directed.Cons (Not really): Although it is great, the movie has several flaws. Some CGI explosions are easily noticeable, but I'll just give it a pass (It's from Millennium Films, most of their movies will most likely had one or two bad CGI moments). The action scenes were also more aimed towards ""comedy"" rather than ""tension"". Nearly all action scenes would start and ends with comedy, complete with not-so- tenseful music, but that's just me nitpicking.Cons (Now this is the real deal): I felt like the female characters were underused. *SPOILER ALERT* Salma Hayek's character literally doesn't do anything other than mocking and cursing in her cell, while Élodie Yung's character is the type where she just gives this guy a mission, sits back and relax until her arrival at Am******m, and cannot do anything until the final act of the movie *SPOILER ENDS HERE*. Come on Hollywood, give us more badass female will ya. Some of the fight scenes were hard to follow because of shaky cams. And Gary Oldman's over the top bad guy performance felt out of place, as if it's a different movie.But overall, I had a ton of fun watching this movie. It's definitely worth your time, and it's easily the funniest movie I've seen all year.

It has loads of action and a lot of errors, the Interpol thing I mentioned and the Dutch policecars that don't look like policecars but more like the cars of the guys that give out parking tickets and stuff.The bug trial the movie is about wouldn't be held in some fancy building in the middle of The Hague but in a special highly secure courtroom the Dutch call ""The Bunker""The whole thing just looks like a hasty put together movie, it never gets dull and it's ideal to watch when you have nothing better to do and some time to (violently) kill... ;-)",The Hitman's Bodyguard

An excellent turn from Salma Hayek (Desperado, Frida) as Kincaid's wife Sonia, which was reminiscent of Pulp Fiction, great chemistry between the two leads which takes us into 'buddy-cop' territory, Deadpool-esque comedy and Bourne-like action, this was a winner for me.

The comic book connections make it as though Deadpool has broken up with Elektra, and is protecting Nick Fury from Commissioner Gordon. On that level, it is even more humorous.The plot isn't anything spectacular, and could have been out of any standard action film from the last thirty years. That's not a problem, but it is a missed opportunity. You don't put these guys together all the time, and some greater originality in the story would have gone a long way to making it a better experience overall.Salma Hayek and Elodie Yung are easy to overlook in a movie like this, but doing so would be missing out on the elements they both bring to their interactions with the male characters.

Ryan Reynolds and Sam Jackson's chemistry was the only thing keeping me from leaving. The story was a bit hard to understand at first and you really had to focus on what was happening where. Another annoying piece from this movie was that the majority of non-white women would just get mad and yell in their respective languages. It came across as very stereotypical and overly used. Selma Hyak is a great actress reduced to a screaming woman who swears a lot. And Gary Oldman who? He was barely on screen and his storyline seemed very rushed.

269,tlrg-legend,The film would have fallen flat if not for the efforts of Reynolds and Jackson,6,18 September 2017,"There was a time when the buddy movie formula ruled the Hollywood cinematic universe. We loved the brashness of such films as Lethal Weapon or 48 Hours. But then the formula fizzled out and filmmakers moved to other things. To cite an obvious example, The Nice Guys (2016) starring such acting heavyweights as Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling was smartly set in the '70s but despite its okay plot, and superb acting by both Crowe and Gosling, wasn't a big box-office hit.The Hit-man's Bodyguard looked like a great idea on paper – bring together Ryan Reynolds, fresh off the boat from his profanity-ridden Deadpool and Samuel L Jackson, who is known for his on-screen cussing, and wait for the fireworks to start as the duo at first go all out to murder each other and then develop a mutual respect that borders on friendship. And, for most part, director Patrick Hughes, of The Expendables 3 fame, gets it right. The best scenes in the film are when Reynolds and Jackson are pissing each other off. Reynolds doesn't roll off expletives like he does in Deadpool but Jackson does go over the top. Reynolds smartly plays the straight guy to Jackson's more gregarious character and it works.The plot of the film is explained in its title itself. Reynolds is a down-on-his luck private security agent, who is cajoled by his girlfriend Elodie Yung, an Interpol agent, into making sure an ace hit-man, Samuel L Jackson, reaches the international court at Hague alive to testify against an evil dictator of Belarus – which is an actual country, by-the-by . The creepy dictator is played by Gary Oldman who gets to ham to his heart's content. Now, the bodyguard and the assassin have a history – it's revealed that Jackson tried to kill Reynolds some 28 times in the past – so one can see that their relationship isn't going to be easy. In fact, they start of by trying to kill each other and only Jackson's injury prevents him from killing his would-be bodyguard. The rest of film is devoted to the banter between them and how they defuse the tension and reach their goal.The film's chief flaw is that director Hughes just doesn't get the tone right. Instead of concentrating on making a buddy movie with a smattering of violence, he goes for the overkill, piling up bodies by the dozen at every action set piece. Then, there are a couple of gory scenes as well that jar. Gary Oldman executes the wife and child of a rebel in cold blood and Reynolds is tortured through electric shocks in a graphic manner. The action scenes too don't have a fluid intensity that we have come to expect from Hollywood blockbusters. Then, while we get that Reynolds' motives for helping his ex is to get her back, there are too few scenes between him and Yung to get the chemistry going. Compared to that, the scenes between Jackson and his wife, played by Salma Hayek, are epic. She out-cusses him in a scene set in a jail and we see a nice montage of her fighting off guys in a bar and Jackson mooning over her as she uses the jagged edge of a beer bottle to open up a man's neck that's love at first sight served with a Gothic twist.The film would have fallen flat if not for the efforts of Reynolds and Jackson. We can see they are enjoying working with each other and it's their camaraderie plus some crazy-ass dialogue that saves the day. Watch the film if you are a Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L Jackson fan. Watch Midnight Run instead if you want to watch a real buddy movie",The Hitman's Bodyguard
270,n-middleton-117,"Simple, expected enjoyment.",7,25 June 2019,"There's very little about this film that surprises you. The story is fairly straight forward without any unexpected twists. However, the film is still quite enjoyable thanks to the wonderful character dynamic created by Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L Jackson. It's the kind of film that you'd watch when you want a simple, straight forward, reliable movie to watch. It doesn't require much engagement to be able to follow and enjoy, but at the same time is stimulating enough that you don't get bored with it. Overall, a very sound performance, an enjoyable watch, but not something you'd ever expect to make people's ""Top..."" lists",The Hitman's Bodyguard
271,micglou,Entertaining and funny...,7,5 September 2017,"I liked this movie mostly because putting Reynolds and Jackson in a movie is pure greatness, they have awesome chemistry and very funny dialogues. The movie has a good pace, the action scenes were good and two great chase scenes. Although the story is pretty much a dime a dozen what obviously makes the progress very predictable, it does have a couple of good unexpected moments that don't add to the story but are great for quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, that along with the many giggles I've had watching this movie.On a personal note; what made this movie even more enjoyable is because for a large part it takes place in Amsterdam.A solid 7 in my books, a good movie for a popcorn evening.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

As the movie progressed, I felt like it could've been better with a better written script minus Ryan Reynold's love interest, I did not like her acting frankly, she just felt like she was a filler part and the movie could have been interesting without her dynamic with Ryan Reynold's character. Also, I did not like the parts where it glorified violence especially with respect to the Hague proceedings that just felt weird to me.The cinematography is well done, the shots of Amsterdam are beautifully taken and so are the action sequences, the crew deserves appreciation its what kept my attention the beautiful shots and sequencing.Samuel L Jackson, Gary Oldman and Salma Hayek were fun to watch in their roles especially Samuel L Jackson, he made his character his own he became Darius Kincaid.I went into this movie thinking it might be like Hot Fuzz which is superb in its own right, parts of the movie were good parts of it were just meh.

280,benaboo,Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson Are Hilarious and Should Make More Movies Together.,7,26 August 2017,It took me awhile to get into this movie but after awhile it really became hilarious. Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson are hilarious together and I would love to see them be in more movies together. This may be my favorite Samuel L. Jackson performance yet but I haven't seen Pulp Fiction. I like the music they used for this movie. It was a little strange because there was one scene where they were playing a Chuck Berry song during an action sequence. It was a good song but it's not my idea of a song to play during a scene like that. That's kinda like playing Josh Groban during a chase scene. This movie is not without its flaws. The action while good is not very memorable. Gary Oldman is forgettable as the villain. I wanted to enjoy the movie more than I did. It mostly works because of the humor and back and forth between the two leads. This movie is a hilarious action comedy. I hope this movie will eventually be considered a classic.,The Hitman's Bodyguard
281,Sawyer-4815162342,Mindless and Forgettable; Yet Fun,7,28 August 2017,"Don't expect too much from this movie and you will probably be pleasantly surprised. It's not the best movie, the plot is pretty generic, the bad guy is VERY generic, and the shoot outs and stunt scenes feel formulaic.But don't get me wrong, this movie is fun. It's obvious Reynolds and Jackson had a good time filming this movie and they play off one another very well. I enjoyed their chemistry. I also liked the fact that there were some jokes and scenes that seemed kind of meta (Like when Reynolds is saying how Jackson's character has ruined the word ""motherfucker"" for him through overuse.) The violence is overdone to the point of being often funny.A couple other negatives: Some of the stunts use CGI that is pretty crappy looking. There are a few continuity errors like crashing a car then in the next shot the car is undamaged.I recommend shutting your brain off and enjoying this for the popcorn fare that it is.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

284,RuthlessGoat,A rocking good time with The Hit-man's Bodyguard,10,25 August 2017,"I usually don't do these user reviews, but there is so much negative ink on this movie that I felt compelled to jump in.The Hit-man's Bodyguard. Let's get this out of the way and get onto the review. Most professional critics, including some of my favorites, hated this movie. Their points are all valid, but I think that the points that they are so critical of are points that are not relevant to what the movie actually accomplished. Were there flaws? Sure. The bottom line I guess is whether or not those reviewers who marked down the movie (A dismal 39% on Rotten Tomatoes & a tepid 47 on Metacritic) really comprehended the purpose of the film. I know, its annoyingly smug to state things like ""You really didn't get it"". Enough of this, already and on to the review.The Hit-man's Bodyguard was a blast and was hilarious. I know that it seemed to struggle to find its way, but these shortcomings (and others) were overcome by the great chemistry between Sam Jackson and Ryan Reynolds. I'll get to Salma Hayek later. I'm not going to spend any more time than necessary defending this highly enjoyable film, but as I stated, there were some flaws. O.K., Gary Oldman was tragically underutilized as was the legendary Richard Grant, but so what? The plot was predictable and some of the car crash and shootout scenes seemed to go on forever. This was overcome by great character development and interaction and a very funny script.This movie was a violent comedy, a spoof, a laugh around every single corner. Its been a long time since I have been in a theater where the audience demonstrated such enjoyment with constant guffaws and laughter. ""Where did you find her, Christian Mingle?"" Absolutely hilarious. The film ran a full 2 hours and could have benefited from some more editing, but what the hell, I loved every minute.Michael Brice was a bodyguard who fell precipitously from grace after a high-profile client was assassinated on his watch. Even though he was still highly competent he was suffering from his diminished status and a failed love affair with an Interpol agent. He was reduced to still dangerous but less glamorous jobs, until he gets a call from his former lover agent, who demanded his services for a really important job.He must protect the most deadly hit-man in the world against those who would prevent him from testifying against a murderous and extremely corrupt Vladislav Dukhovich, the dictator of Belarus. The deal to get Kincaid to court included a pardon for Ms. Kincaid, an over the top character (Salma Hayek) that you have to see to believe. Darius Kincaid, the most dangerous assassin in the world, had fallen in love with what looked like for all practical purposes, the most dangerous woman in the world. Their interaction was literally dynamite.The balance of the movie consisted of vulgar, hilarious and sometimes unintentionally touching interactions between Reynolds and Jackson. They mostly discussed their deadly professions and their love lives. This was a comedy/action movie, punctuated often by back and forth verbal sparring. This unlikely duo took a meandering and comical route ""to get to the church on time"". In this case, however, the church was an International Court in Belarus, and the route was littered with car chases, boat chases and exploding everything. There was also almost non-stop gunfire and unlikely but highly entertaining fight scenes.This movie is obviously not for everyone, but if you are a fan of non-stop action and good-natured, but deadly bantering, The Hit-man's Bodyguard is a rocking good time. Oh, and don't miss the very last scene. If this one didn't have you leaving the theater with an ear to ear grin, then this movie was not for you.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
285,Tokyo55,Must see film!,10,6 October 2020,"One of the most entertaining action movies I've ever seen! It had everything you would hope for but what makes The Hitman's Bodyguard such an amazing film is its constant comedy. One of the most unique and complete films I've ever seen and I've seen it 5 times and counting. Do not watch this film edited for television, it will not be enjoyable and won't make sense. Some of the best car chases and fight scenes in cinematic history. Forget the ridiculously low rating and enjoy this masterpiece. Salma Hayek is a treasure and perfect for her role, subtly funny as can be! Not sure what else was out that year but this movie could have won an Oscar for best picture and should at least have been nominated.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
286,Chancery_Stone,No Deadpool,3,11 July 2018,"This looked really good from the trailer and it had an edge of sarcasm that made it reminiscent of Deadpool, so I expected that quality of writing. Nope. Not at all. While it does have good dialogue and Jackson and Reynolds are never less than watchable, this is really just a mainstream buddy-buddy chase movie with more swearing.It feels forced throughout, trying too hard to be edgy and in-your-face, while it keeps one foot firmly in the '15-30 year old male who likes fast chase sequences' camp. Additionally, and probably for the same reason, it has an odd nasty sexist streak running through it, with Hayek demeaning her very notably fat cell mate while she always looks 'hot' as per same 15 year-old boy's idea of 'hot'. Reynolds' love interest has as much charisma, with or without him, as a face cloth and she is constantly handled by her male superior. That's maybe meant to be in there to flag up what a creep he is, but it's done in such a casual way, while bursting Hayek's breasts out on every occasion, that it just looks like a normal chase movie/thriller.All round a very disappointing movie. Watchable, but by no means a good use of the two stars.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

288,imdb-936-837144,The Odd Couple,8,28 August 2017,"""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" opens on the morning oblations of one Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynalds) getting ready for work. He's neat as a pin for his gig as an Executive Protection Agent in charge of shepherding a Japanese arms dealer in a high value transport. We will come to learn of his back­ground as a Boy Scout, then trained by the CIA, then gone private. He is emblematic of, (Prov. 22:6) ""Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."" Still follows the Boy Scout motto: ""Be prepared."" Some two years later Interpol is losing some necessary witnesses due to a mole in their organization. They have one witness left, a hit-man Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) who is no boy scout (i.e. not ""morally straight"") but his wife affectionately calls him cucaracha (Spanish for cock­roach) on account of his scurrying around and that he's hard to kill. In desperation Interpol contracts Michael, now on the skids, to be the hit-man's body­guard transporting him from Manchester to the Hague. They make an odd couple. The hit-man got into the business by disrespecting his preacher father's advice that revenge should be left entirely to God.The deal they offer Kincaid is they will set his wife free (but not him) if he will testify (""It's mighty white of you."") Michael will get his three star status back if he's successful. And Kincaid goes back to prison after being self-motivated to insure their success. That puts (black) Kincaid in servitude to (white) Michael, and he's already a love slave to his (white) wife. The only one out to protect Kincaid's interests is his lawyer. We'll see how far that goes.Along the way they will encounter a group of singing nuns. The nuns will put us in mind of ""The Magnificat,"" a canticle sung at vespers, about God scattering the proud, putting down the mighty, and exalting the meek and humble. Historically, that would include wiping out a world of sinners with a flood, rescuing Noah and his brood, Noah then passing on a blessing to his two elder respectful sons and their progeny but placing the brood of his youngest son Ham in servitude due to his disrespect. And let us not forget Naomi who sent her unworthy Moabite widowed daughter-in-law Orpah back to her father but took her worthy one Ruth with her to her Jewish country. Ham was the progenitor of ""African Americans"" through his son Cush (Hebrew for black) who did in fact end up in America in slavery to the progeny of Ham's other two brothers. Ruth was the great-grandmother of David, and by rabbinic tradition Orpah was the great-grandmother of Goliath, which shepherd boy and giant fought each other. History didn't used to be so important, but now that the Confederate statues are coming down on account of their reminders of slavery and conflict, let us not forget other historical figures; that is, if the lawyer doesn't come through and obviate the movie's servitude.Despite the historical template in play, the race relations between the two principals in this film end up being good giving us good feelings. It is white of Michael to give Kincaid his best three star protection. And Kincaid is forth­coming in giving good love tips to Michael (""a romantic retard""), putting us in mind of (Acts 13:1) ""at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as  Simeon that was called Niger"" (Latin for black.) There are a lot of bullets that fly in this movie, coupled with the humor of two different personality types working together. It treads in the area of race relations, doing pretty well even though it's up to a single lawyer to hold the line on political (& legal) correctness. It's a bit loud at the start with a vigorous gun battle, but it settles into a dull roar as it goes along. The actors pull their weight, the script­writer doesn't fail to come up with some zingers, and the body count mounts beyond numbering. This is one righteous movie if you don't mind plenty of action.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Ryan Reynolds trying hard not to be Deadpool, and Samuel L Jackson playing the same foul-mouthed, smart-aleck character he does in each film he's in. There was no discernible chemistry between either of them and their oddly chosen significant other. I did watch it to the end despite losing interest before it was half over.

291,stani_cv,has a few laughs here and there but that's about it,5,18 March 2019,"I had zero expectations for this movie and yet it managed to disappoint. I don't even know where to begin. Acting: You basically have Ryan Reynolds who acts like Deadpool in a suit without a mask and Samuel L Jackson being himself as usual. Gary Oldman does a good job playing the Belarusian dictator but there's only as much you can do with a completely two dimensional character. There is also Salma Hayek in a minor role and other people that don't really matter. They're all good actors in bad roles. I don't see any chemistry between the main cast. They could have shot their scenes separately and stich them together afterwards and I wouldn't even notice. Story: nothing original here. Bad guy that has to face justice with the help of another bad guy who's actually good. Nothing new under the sun, but that's far from being the biggest issue with the movie. Character development is zero. They all ended in the same place they originally started. What really makes it even a bigger mess is how completely ridiculous everything is. Nothing that's happening on screen makes sense and it's not even funny. If I have to go through every single situation it would take a whole day. Just check the ""goofs"" section to get the idea. The most obvious ones being: the bad guys managed to track them all over the place through some magical means. Even though Dukhovich was in prison he somehow managed to control and order all of his people. How did so many terrorists managed to slip through the cracks so they could actually blow up the international criminal court? The last nail in the coffin of this movie were the visuals. Not sure who made that explosion in the end, but it's almost like they ran out of money and grabbed someone off the street to finish the effects. This is just a cheap movie with expensive actors. There are much better action flicks out there.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

295,fluffy2560,Dire.....,2,12 February 2018,"Generic action thriller that wastes all our time. Sure I can live with the BS of the story line but what really got my back up were the utter inaccuracies from the ""mountains of Belarus"", the idea that Interpol is some kind of international cop fest and Coventry is anywhere important anyone wants to go. But I save my ire for the farce of continuity. This is farce in your face big time. Guys, if you are going to make a movie, try and at least pay attention to what you are doing. What were the producers, the directors, the scriptwriters and Netflix thinking? Are we really so dumb that we can appreciate anything about this movie. It's two hours of my life I'm not going to get back. I could write a list of continuity mistakes but I'd be here all day so this will suffice:Looks to me am pretty sure I saw the guy run over by the speed boat was shown wearing a wet suit and Samuel L Jackson kept moving between the left and right hand side of the speedboat obviously to hide the stunt driver in between shots. And weirdly, they kept moving the action around from Amsterdam to The Hague. And as for Coventry, it looks remarkably like the same film set as London in the first sequences. The cross channel ferry is shown leaving Dover and then we see some pleasure boat on a Dutch canal substituting for the ferry's arrival. Jeez, do me a favour!Samuel L Jackson must have been paid buckets of money to waste his time in this movie - I like him but this is acting Eddie Murphy style - smartass jive talking. Come on Samuel L Jackson, you're better than that. As for Ryan Reynolds surely he has better things to do. Gary Oldman is a great actor so why is he in this drivel. Selma Heyak is nice enough to look at and tries to be fun but I really felt for the cellmate abused in the corner. It could have been done differently, abuse is unacceptable anytime, but it's quite topical now that systematic abuse of women is now so much in the news. Why anyone would think abuse like that was even remotely funny, I do not know, and the Dutch would never allow such behaviour in their prisons. Finally, I see this movie has made it's $30M budget back about 5 times. Unbelievable. Please do this again Netflix, God forbid there's a sequel and please put some cash into decent series like Altered Carbon or bring back the British TV show UFO or remake 2001 A Space Odyssey.

I think the musical and instrumental part of the film especially of the action movie is very important for its future success. IT can keep the audience entertained or the opposite- not catch their attention. also I really like the cast of this film. In my opinion they are chosen very correctly and suit their roles very well.,The Hitman's Bodyguard
297,BB02,So much fun,8,7 November 2020,"Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson are just born to share the screen together. The movie is simple, straightforward and completely lacking any kind of surprises - and that's exactly why I had such a good time watching it. This is just the film to see on a Friday Night after a rough week.Just Action, Explosions, Blood and 2 Stars on the top of their game with a killer chemistry. But the movie also has a surprisingly amount of heart and romance for a film with so many dead people.Also Salma Hayek steals every scene as the hitman's sociopathic sweetheart. This totally anarchic love story makes Joker and Harley look pretty boring. And Gary Oldman does his best with a one dimensional part in making him as detestable as possible.I also desperately want to see more of Elodie Young, who is just underused in this film, but leaves a strong impression. And as great as Reynolds is in his part, Sam Jackson is as usual the highlight of the film, adding another iconic and incredible cool character to his long resume.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

-The opening scene was a very good way to start the movie, it was cool and funny at the same time

299,mbrooks-8,The Hit-man's Bodyguard Did Not Know When To End.,5,2 September 2017,"Boy did that thing need some serious editing. The last half entails a prolonged boat chase, a side chase with goons after Ryan Reynolds for absolutely no reason, then our heroes get to their final destination and we get more explosions and gunfights, a hospital is attacked so the villains can steal a helicopter, Ryan's ex-girlfriend has lame fight with her evil boss in the hallway of the courthouse, and then the bad guy is finally dispatched.The film's final forty minutes is just so much noise that you are soon begging for it to end. Bloody pointless action as well as a waste of Gary Oldman.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
300,pthef,Magnificent,8,19 August 2017,"I downright loved this movie when I saw it yesterday. Indeed, I cackled at it. I figured with two really strong comedic talents, they were either about to lay a stink-bomb on us, or be brilliant together. Well, they were brilliant, playing off one another like they'd been doing it all their lives. Darius Kincaid (Jackson), a hit-man, is to present evidence at The Hague of war crimes committed by the president of Belarus. Interpol has been compromised in attempts to assassinate him. So the Interpol agent saddled with him calls in her ex-boyfriend, Michael Bryce (Reynolds) to take charge of Kincaid to get him to The Hague to testify. They hate one another, but have to rely on one another, and do so most hilariously. Y'all see this movie!",The Hitman's Bodyguard
301,hollywoodhernandez-70868,Hit-man's Bodyguard is a star driven action/comedy,9,17 August 2017,"As the summer movie season comes to an end Hollywood gives us one last action/adventure film that is driven by star power; The Hit-man's Bodyguard starring Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson. Reynolds plays Michael Bryce, an anal retentive hit-man who is strictly by the books; while Samuel L. Jackson is Darius Kincaid, an assassin who flies by the seat of his pants however; his style seemingly makes him bulletproof.The fun, and a whole lot of killing, begins when Reynolds gets the assignment to be Jackson's bodyguard and The two world class hit-man set out on a trek to get Kincaid to a world tribunal to testify against a dictator (Gary Oldman) who is accused of war crimes, but everyone who's previously tried to testify against him has ended up dead.The two lead characters could not be any more different. Reynolds, who was heartbroken by his previous relationship with a secret agent, is jaded and bitter while Jackson's character is married to another hired killer (Salma Hayek), who is currently doing time, is a romantic, love struck fool who takes to singing loves songs at the drop of a dime.  He's also prone to dropping the ""MF"" word. (There are more MF's in this movie than in any other I can recall since Pulp Fiction.) MF's aside, this is one funny film. It's in the tradition of classic ""buddy movies"" like Lethal Weapon or 48 Hours. The contrast of the two main characters make for some serious comedic moments. The jokes make for a smooth transition from the car chase scenes and violence. The Hit-man's Bodyguard never takes it's foot off the gas. The movie goes at full throttle from beginning to end. It is a seriously fun movie!The film is rated ""R"" for violence and harsh language and it has a run time of 1 hour and 58 minutes (which passes very quickly). On my ""Hollywood Popcorn Scale"" I rate it a JUMBO!Hollywood Hernandez",The Hitman's Bodyguard

303,JamiroBontes,It's another comedy action movie!,6,3 September 2017,"The Hit-man's Bodyguard is about Michael who used to be a triple A agent trying to protect Darius who is a hit-man. Michael tries to get Darius to the court room because he knows something about a bad guy that needs to be in jail. But along the way there are other bad guy's that are trying to stop them getting there. While also Michael is trying to tell Amelia that he loves her.First of Michael played by Ryan Renolds and Darius played by Samuel L. Jackson is what makes this movie better then it initially was. They do have chemistry and sometimes they are funny in the movie. The action is alright, there is one good scene were Ryan Renolds is fighting someone in a tool shop and he is using the tools to fight him. Other than that this movie is a mess, sometimes a scene is funny but then the next is dark, very, very dark. The story is just stupid and the love story is just cringe.Don't go into this movie expecting the next 21 Jump Street, because it doesn't have the quality or the laughs that movie has. I feel this is just a summer movie where people go to have fun for two hours and then go home and don't think about it anymore. If you want to see this movie then go see it, but know that you are just going to have some fun and that's it. It's alright, it's just not that great.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Reynolds with Elodie Yung that supposedly happened before our story begins. Jackson's relationship with Salma Hayek before our story begins. Neither relationship is ongoing during the movie. We're just supposed to accept it though it the the motivation for each's character. What? Yeah.This was supposed to be a 2 man buddy movie where we never get the feeling they even know each other. They could have bother shot each other and I wouldn't have minded at all. It would have save me 2 hours of time.Then there is the 40 minute lull of nothing about 45 minutes into the movie. No action. No one getting laid. Nothing. A 2 hour movie should not have long dull periods. They could have cut the movie down to 1:25. At the end of the move, I wondered what they were trying to accomplish with this movie. Was it about the relationships of hitmen? No. We already had the whole 9 yards and it was better. Was it about cool hitmen? No. We already had Hitman.Watching Samuel L Jackson clown on people (including Ryan Reynolds) was BORING from minute 1.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Great acting by Reynolds and Jackson - hilarious roles for each of them. The directing was also very good, I felt captivated by the storyline throughout and it certainly wasn't what I was expecting from the trailer. Lots of funny jokes and great action scenes.

317,maxigarciasoto,The Hitman's Bodyguard - Movie review,7,9 January 2018,"I remember when i went to the theatre to see a movie last year, and while i was waiting for my film to be shown, a trailer for this movie appeared and i was interested in this movie. It look like a movie just for fun and a good time, and this movie delivers that in every way.This movie is about Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) and how he has to protect an assasin called Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) to eventually get him on a trial, which only has 27 hours to get there. This film is very funny and that is mostly with the chemistry between Michael and Darius, they are very different people, but they have to work together to get to the trial and they have to learn to how to put their differences aside. I really like the chemistry between them and they were very entertaining in the action sequences as well. The camera work in this film is good, i wouldn't say is great, but it is acceptable. There are some scenes which are very well done, and another scenes there are just ok. The movie is a lot of fun, and that is the best aspect of it. I didn't go to see this movie to see a great oscar worthy movie, i went to see a entertaining film. And it didn't disappoint me at all.Sonia Kincaid is played by Salma Hayek, and is great to see her, she is very funny. As well as Samuel L. Jackson, a lot of the comedy comes from him. Ryan Reynolds wasn't bad, he was good, but he wasn't has great as Salma or Samuel.Ask for flaws in the movie, yes there are some flaws. For example, Gary Oldman's character wasn't good realized, he gave a good performance and his accent work on the film, but his character wasn't as compelling as Ryan's or Samuel's. There is this one scene were Ryan Reynolds is giving a monologue on a tiny bar, and it cut together with an action scene. Now look, this scene is very funny, but when it cuts back to Ryan, the green screen is so noticeable that it took out of the movie, and after it happened i was still thinking about it and kin of bug me. Also in the second act there is this twist that happened in the film and i suppose that when i was only 30 minutes of the run time of this movie, it was very predictable.Ryan's character has a loved interest in this film, and i really didn't care about it, i didn't care about Michael and how he wants this girl he likes. And can be kind of a let down because is shown thought out the entire film, and in the end, it was, in my opinion, useless.Ending with this review i want to say that, i really enjoy watching this movie, it is ridicules, and it knows it. If you want to see an entertaining film and pass the time this movie is going to do that, it will entertain you. Is not a masterpiece, is just pure action-fun. And for that reason this film gets a 7/10.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Action scenes were all well done and thrilling, not as intense as recent Atômic Blonde, but still really good. Jokes are excellent. But the movie lives on the superb performance of Samuel, Selma and an especially evil Gary. Elodie and Ryan were both good but a bit overwhelmed by the others and Ryan's role didn't gave him much opportunity to shine. Story is certainly not entirely new, but hey it is a action piece. I deducted one point, because I felt a few more jokes on Ryan's side would have given a better balance to the duo. Most of the laughs were from Samuel on Ryan's expense. Yes, I understood that he plays the boring type. Selma as always makes her character very believable and had similar fun paying it as obviously had Samuel. Splendid cameo from Richard E.

Samuel L. is entertaining as always, and his back and forth with Salma Hayek was spot on. Yung, as a young Interpol operative, was too much.

Let me tell you right away: This movie is something you watch with your brain turned off while being tipsy after three drinks. The title is ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" starring Samuel Jackson. The trailers even over play the motherf****r cliché of Sam Jackson. Right off the bat, you expect this movie to be a cliché-fest filled with guns and off-topic romantic interests. What the movie gets right is the chemistry between two actors: Samuel Jackson and Ryan Reynolds. It was brilliant to have these two actors in the movie. Otherwise, the movie would have been a big fail. These two guys, however, keep the scenes lively through their experienced comedy acting. Hell, the scripts were probably written with these two guys in mind. There are awesome actions sequences and hilarious dialogues included in this movie, as you would expect from these two actors.

Those movies show how an action comedy should look like. For a start, one needs a proper script-writer, not an amateur.

332,spywatcher459,High-caliber action and laughs...doesn't get any better than that!,9,26 August 2017,"After seeing a trailer for this on youtube I knew that I had to take a chance and see this, given that it looked like it had some silly elements of Deadpool mixed in just a little bit. After watching it today, I must say that it was worth the money I spent for the ticket. The Hit-man's Bodyguard is a fantastic action film with comical elements of buddy-cop thrown into the mix for good measure and with Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds in the lead roles, you can't possibly go wrong with that combination.Here's the story in a nut-shell: Michael Bryce is a (as he puts it), a Triple-A executive protection agent who has a pretty good life as a professional bodyguard but that all comes to an end when an assassin's bullet kills of a client. Fast forward to years later, Bryce is now down on his luck taking crappy security jobs and still holding a grudge at his ex-girlfriend Amelia Roussel, an Interpol agent whom he blames for losing his client and getting his reputation shot to pieces. But Bryce may finally have an opportunity to get back into the game when he's asked to safeguard a witness who is to testify against a genocidal Russian president (played by veteran actor Gary Oldman). Lo and behold, the witness that he's asked (or rather strong-armed) into safeguarding turns out to be Darius Kincaid (Jackson), a vulgar hit-man for hire and occasional thorn in Bryce's side during his years as a professional bodyguard. So they get together and you can pretty much guess what comes next: car chases, gunfights, stuff blowing up, trading quips and insults, etc. As time goes by, Kincaid and Bryce struggle to see eye to eye with each other but the host of problems that Bryce had in the past, coupled with Kincaid's erratic cavalier attitude towards life make it extremely rough for this duo to avoid putting a bullet in each other's mugs. LOL!The cinematography for this film was sweet and they filmed in a lot of lovely locations (I'm guessing most of this was in shot in Europe), the action choreography was spectacular and the dialogue and comical elements in this were spot on. Granted 'The Hit-man's Bodyguard' does have some dark-comedy in it and though it is mean- spirited, it's a reminder to the audience not to take the film too seriously. The fun part of this film is how Bryce and Kincaid learn a little bit about each other during their journey to the courthouse but that alone doesn't stop either one of them from taking pot-shots at each other or trying to annoy one another. Elodie Young was gorgeous and fantastic as Agent Rousell, Bryce's ex and I loved how she spoke French in this during certain scenes. Selma Hayek steals the show herself playing Kincaid's wife, a woman who is just as vulgar as her husband, who is incarcerated to ensure Kincaid's cooperation.All in all, 'Hitman's Bodyguard' is definitely a film that I recommend to Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds fans. Give it a shot...you won't be disappointed.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

I did not pay a movie ticket, otherwise I would be very angry right now. I was bored out of my mind! Samuel Jackson did his stereotype bad persona, frak this and that. My ears were hurting of the constant fraking. In Pulp Fiction it all had its place and time, and didn't feel forced upon you. It was the natural flow of what happened. Not here. Cursing for the sake of coolness. Nah, it will not make you cool it only felt sweaty. And all that super stunts, with a shot leg. Nah, again. Ryan Reynolds on the other hand brought his stereotypical Deadpool act. I just could not endure it any longer after 30 minutes. It is the classic example when they have the actors first and then just rush a script from old clichés, used already 1000 times in other action comedies.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
334,antoinedb2001,A comedy surrounding a Hit-man and his Bodyguard...How is it?,7,28 August 2017,"""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"" is a comedy action film directed by Patrick Hughes, and stars Ryan Reynolds, Samuel Jackson, Salma Hayek, Gary Oldman, and Elodie Yung. it is about a Hit-man (Jackson) who is tasked to speak as a witness on behalf of a ruthless ruler (Oldman) in court, and must travel across the country to be there, whilst being Protected by his Bodyguard (Reynolds), as the two travel together, hating each other. I'll start by saying that Reviews for the film weren't good, as it sits on a 39% on Rotten Tomatoes, despite being a significant hit at the box office. however, where does this film stack up for me? here's what I dislike about this film:-The main plot while serviceable takes itself way to seriously in a comedy like this. the transitions between a comedic scene and a dramatic scene happen very abruptly very often, and whenever it does it's always boring to watch. -the villain played by Gary Oldman is good, but he belongs in another film. he tries his best, being the outstanding actor that he already is, but he tries way to hard to be threatening here. and it's understandable as he is supposed to be playing a character who slaughters anyone to get what he wants. which brings up another problem. -the change in tone is not good. it always keeps coming back from being lighthearted and funny to an attempt at being intense, dark, or thought provoking. which brings up another problem.-there's also a predictable romance that the film also centers on a lot, which is nothing but arguing and fighting, which does brighten up towards the end, but it's all pointless. you know these two will get back together, and yet you still have to sit through it. by reading this you probably now think that this movie offers more bad than it does good. well it's a messily made story, which nearly jeopardizes the film for me. however... here's what I did like about this film:-the chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Samuel Jackson is worth the price of admission. they both work really well together, and every time a joke hits them both, their delivery is always perfect. the acting sells it with them together performing these gags and laughs, and it's funny. which brings up another praise.-Salma Hayek...my god what a surprise. She's a tough prison woman who has a personal connection to Samuel Jackson, and she nails every scene she is in. she curses in English, she curses in Spanish, and she's really brutal, especially in a really funny fight scene during a flashback sequence. she's one of the best parts of the film and I was always entertained by her energy and comedic timing. -the film has some very well made and well choreographed fast action sequences. this is coming from the same director who did the most recent Expendables film so you would know how much of a good job he does here in terms of the action. it's very fast and full of grit in some parts considering how it's more grounded in reality. however, these scenes do whatever they can do with the limitations they're provided with, and almost every action scene is polished well enough to be highly entertaining. -also the acting is really really good here. there's not a single actor who doesn't give a bad performance, with the exception of one hired Hit-man who is assigned to capture and/or kill Reynolds and Jackson. almost everyone here gives a good performance, especially our two main leads who are fantastic as the dynamic duo here. reading this now you're probably thinking that I find this movie to be a mixed bag. however that isn't the case. The stuff that's good is really good and completely overshadows any negatives I have of the film, even more so when I saw the film a second time. the first time I liked it but not a lot. however the second viewing I enjoyed a lot more because there were a lot of good moments I was waiting to see people's reaction to in the theater. and when those moments hit I heard more laughter in this viewing than I did the first viewing, which made a better experience for me. in my final word for this movie, I will say that you can go see this film. you just need to know what kind of movie you're watching. with the film's first official poster and teaser trailer, you'd think you would be watching a spoof of Kevin Costner's ""The Bodyguard"", or a spoof movie in general. but this in a lot of peoples eyes (including my own) is just a run of the mill comedy. don't walk in expecting something great, just know what kind of movie you're gonna be watching and hope that you'll walk out enjoying what you saw. if you don't enjoy it, people like me would understand, after all film is very subjective. full of different opinions on a number of films. overall, go see it. you'll probably like it. just don't expect an award winning comedy, just expect a comedy and you're probably going to walk out liking it.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
335,imdbbonfiresky,Meh. Cliché. Boring.,5,28 August 2017,"Samuel L Jackson plays a shadow rehash of his previous acting roles. Pretty much just get paid to say MotherFawker 200 times through this movie. It was a hard sell hes this tough hit-man.More like a tired old man dragging through the movie. When he has his signature manic laugh, I can tell he is acting. What was up with the music choice for the action sequences, it made it sound goofy. Gary Oldmans Russian dialect was pretty off, no wonder he switches to English in the beginning. Selma Hayek was fun to watch.But overall this movie felt like, what would happen if ignorant Americans go to another country and not give a sh*t about the people or the culture or ""the stupid dutch buildings""(Selma Hayek quote) The whole movie Samuel L puts a ton of innocent people in danger with complete disregard, but then has a line saying. ""I cannot see innocent people get hurt.""Ryan Reynolds was his usual self, put in a good performance. But the cheesy music over the top unrealistic action sequences. The whole timing you got 5hours to produce this witness. Done before, done better, less plot holes. Forgettable movie.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
336,SnekDok,Quickest most helpful review you'll get....,4,27 November 2017,"To sum it all up in one line, this movie should be re-titled to ""driving and talking"". If the dialogue was interesting or even remotely funny it would be something... but the only funny parts are slapstick(non-dialogue) comedy at Ryan Reynolds expense and there's maybe two parts that are chuckle-worthy. You'll be on your phone checking the weather and other things before the halfway point I guarantee it.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
337,dwgmartin-33760,Silly but amusing,5,19 December 2017,"The Hitman's Bodyguard: Samuel L. Jackson is a hitman and Ryan Reynolds is his bodyguard, they don't get on... But they'll have to. In order to take down some evil dictator, Jackson has intel and Reynolds has his back....and they only have 24 hours to do it. Plus Jackson says motherfucker so much so the word losses all meaning.As you might have guessed The Hitman's Bodyguard is a rather cliché and generic buddy action movie, but the film rides and dies on the interactions between Reynolds and Jackson which are top notch.
Everything else is kinda the norm but not insulting so, there's also something happening on screen. Some of the jokes (back and forth between Jackson and Reynolds) are pretty good and get a chuckle but there are some misses.Oddly though this is the second Lionsgate movie this year to include a scene with a bus full of nuns. They first appeared in Power Rangers and now they're here... I have respect for you Lionsgate, I like your use of nuns.The Hitman's Bodyguard strides itself on the chemistry between Jackson and Reynolds, which is there and enjoyable but beyond that (minus a bus full of nuns) there's not a great deal.

I would've given it 10 stars, if it hadn't been for the fact that it was dragged out by mindless, killing scenes or just continuous gun shooting. The other problem I have with it is that it has an overdone ""moral"" at the end, and some of the jokes were too forced, and all that political theme is also overdone. They could've worked out some of the background and reasoning for the characters' behavior better to be more creative.If you're reading reviews on here because you're going to the movies tonight, I would suggest, if you want a comedy, to go see Logan Lucky instead(it's funnier), or if you don't care if it's funny or not, Wind River is also a lot better than this movie.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

My stand out performer though definitely had to be Salma Hayek she was so good!If you like action and you like comedy, this is the movie for you! There's guns, there's car chases, there's speedboats and stunning locations.

Since then his clientele has dwindled to moneyed, paranoid, possibly coked-up, riff-raff. And then Bryce gets a call from his ex-fiancé, Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung), an Interpol security officer. She was part of an Interpol escort to get a crucial prosecution witness from one side of Amsterdam to the other, 'The Hit-man' Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson), to testify at the Hague against war criminal Dukhovich (Gary Oldman) - but an entire street in Amsterdam opened up and machinegunned everyone in this caravan except Amelia and the Hit-man, and now Bryce is being asked to finish running this gantlet.This is sort of a high-tech upgrade of the Bruce Willis movie, 16 Blocks, or Clint Eastwood's The Gauntlet, or Stallone's Cobra.

But one thing is for certain.This movie is entertaining! It wasn't a total waste of time, and I loved the connection between Reynolds and Jackson. All of the action sequences and comedy bits were awesome. Having Reynolds and Jackson as the main roles for this helped even more, it's almost like they were meant for this movie. The fight scenes, nothing too special, just trained people doing what they were trained to do.There were some things that were a bit weird. For example, some shots were a bit fuzzy, and this happens throughout the movie. It is quite noticeable, but I am sure that is on purpose. There were also things that somehow happened just when the plot needed it, like how one of the men that Dukhovich hired as a mole overheard that there is activity in the safehouse where Kincaid was.But, overall a great watch and you will not be disappointed.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

349,divyankk,Movie should be called The bodygaurd need security,2,5 January 2018,"Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) can easily could protect itself and didn't needed any bodyguard.
As we can see in the first few scene where he is attacked multiple times at different locations.
It was Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) who needed the protection.
Where we can see that he was not up to the mark or doing his best saving his client (Kincaid) who seriesly injured and was limping around. Kincard even escaped the police from the safehouce by jumping off the building and showing Michael how its done.In the movie when we here the phrase ""in a Triple A rated protection I expect the bodyguard to take a bullet for the client"" then there has to be a scene in the movie. Where Kincard can escape from being hit but Michael has to get in between the shooter and Kincard and recieve the bullet injury and not be hit seriously. This stupid thing happen in all movies.In one of the scene Kincard defend himself by firing a flare gun at the opponent while Michael cannot even defend himself with a gun full of bullets.
Also the bodyguard should not be the one who gets captured and need saving from the client/Kincard.So i conclude by saying the whole movie was badly made and they should have changed the title of the movie, as it the opposite which happened.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

You can see the humor that Reynolds has in Deadpool and that Jackson has in Django Unchained here. I think this is what I liked the most.They also have great chemistry together, I personally would not have guessed this, but now it makes a lot of sense.It has interesting action scenes. I personally am not really into that so it makes no difference to me, but they seem pretty good.They also don't go overboard to make it not credible, but exaggerated enough that it is funny.It is easy, it does not make you think a lot afterwards but it entertains you and I think this was the role of this film.

The results are absolutely hilarious and extremely fun. This film proves that experimentation is the key to making fresh and exciting films. The story plays out like your typical 007 film. Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) who is what he calls himself a ""Former Triple A Protection Agent"" has to escort an infamous hit-man, Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) to his Testimony at the International Court of Law to prevent the corrupt Russian president from getting back in power. But what really makes the plot shine is its characters. Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson absolutely nail their roles as respective former triple A protection agent and foul mouthed hit-man and their opposite chemistry is responsible for many of the film's funniest moments from their banter in-between action to full on shouting during the action. This proves that opposites can really attract in certain situations. Diegetic sound is used in an excellent manner in this film. Guns sound beefy and whenever someone gets shot you really feel the impact of the shot as they are appropriately used in this film with the right dosage of blood and pain. This film absolutely deserves its 15 rating. Cinematography is also used effectively in this film even during the non-action scenes of the film. Just by looking at the environment around us at the beginning when we're introduced to Michael, we get the feeling that he is a very successful ""Triple A Protection Agent."" Many shot types were used which help to portray Michael's character as well as Darius' when we find out about his backstory as well. But the camera worked during the action scenes as well because there was the right amount of tracking of both Michael and Darius when each individual needed the camera the most and there was rarely a lot of filler. With remarkable characters, great cinematography, sound and smart funny dialogue, The Hit-man's Bodyguard is a wild and funny ride for lovers of both comedy and action films.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Ryan Reynolds says something stupid and Jackson stares at him for 2 seconds and busts out into a loud and obnoxious laugh. End scene.Now take this scene and repeat it 20 times.

Unfortunately the experience was pretty disappointing. Its like the studio just put together a bunch of action movie clichés and just pumped out another one using the same old tired stereotypes. Even the car chases and fight scenes were the same thing we have seen hundreds of times before. I really was thinking of switching this off for most of the film - it was that bad. I can say, things improved slightly at the end - and patient viewers will be rewarded with a reasonable climax. The lead-up to it though, was just not interesting.

369,lowgunberry13,"It's ""Die Hard"" Meets ""Lethal Weapon""",8,19 November 2017,"I knew when the teaser trailer came out this spring with the wild clips of stars Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson to the tune of Whitney Houston's iconic version of ""I Will Always Love You"" from the 1992 movie ""The Bodyguard"" that this was going to be an epic action comedy. But considering this is a very hard R flick I waited till ClearPlay or VidAngel got it filtered.These two potty mouths have their own unique comedy trade marks. Reynolds is known as the sarcastic jokester. Jackson usually spews F-bombs and colorful phrases. They are both at the top of the game here, spending nearly the whole movie verbally assaulting each other. Reynolds plays Michael Bryce. He was once a AAA-rated security agent. But when one of his clients is popped under his watch, Bryce's career and personal life also take a big hit. A few years later, he's recruited by a special agent ex-girlfriend to transport hit-man and current federal prisoner Darius Kincaid (Jackson), from England to The Hague to testify against a ruthless Eastern European dictator (played by Gary Oldman) who is out for blood. Oddly enough Bryce and Kincaid have a bad history together and they both share romantic issues with their ex's. ELODIE YUNG round out the cast as the Interpol agent with Salma Hayek as Kincaid's other ½.This is a hard R-rated action film with a very high body count. Close to a hundred characters are killed in every possible way. There are multiple shootings, stabbings, strangling, explosions, throat slicing, car crashes, helicopter crashes – and one character gets pushed off a 10-story building.There are at least a half-dozen lengthy chase sequences. Each one gets more intense than the next. A scene in Amsterdam involving Kincaid in a speedboat and Bryce on a motorcycle on the run from the bad guys is surprisingly well staged and shot. Problem with the chases the bad guys seem to have an endless supply of bullets that never seem to hit anything critical, but when the good guy killers return only a couple bullets its lights out. This duo kind of has a ""Lethal Weapon"" feel to it with both leads as the Riggs character.Jackson is even on the soundtrack. He wrote and performs the ballad ""Nobody Gets out Alive"", which appears twice, including a full version during the closing credits. Reynolds actually sings in a scene midway through the movie. He's not that great but it's still funny.Rated R for strong violence and language throughout The bulk of it is the sexual references, F-bombs, other language but the rating has no mention of the sexuality, which covers quite a bit of content but no actual nudity.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
370,AlexanderRohdeJ,The best action movie of 2017!,8,19 March 2018,"I could defend this movie for all eternity. 
When I started this movie I didn't really know what to expect. The director haven't really done that much work previous to this one. On the other hand I enjoy both of the two leading actors. So I knew I probably wouldn't HATE it.
But what was gonna be brought upon me I could not have foreseen.
I enjoyed this movie so much I haven't stopped thinking about it ever since i finished it.
The chemistry between Ryan reynolds and Samuel jackson is comedy gold.
The tight and beautiful editing of the film, mixed with great dialogue and amazing cinematography is stunning.
The storyline is brilliant. A top level bodyguard that has to protect a top level hitman. I mean come on? How could that possibly dissapoint. It just works so well, it's hard to explain all the things that makes this movie work. It just does. 
I don't understand the negative reviews towards this movie?
I am not the biggest fan of action because of the constant clichees and remakes that hollywood normally produces. But this action movie, is so unique. I could not have loved it anymore.
I highly recommend this to everyone. 
I sort of compared it to ""Babydriver"" because they came out around the same time. And it seems to me that everyone talks about ""Babydriver"" all the time. Honestly this movie was much better to me and much more original if you ask me.

When films like this can get financed and then made you know that everything is lost. There are no words to describe how terrible this film is, its not actually a film. When the director and production team watched this film after edit did they not put their head in their hands and silently wonder if they should go into hiding?The industry no longer relies on talent to support itself instead it allows films like this and the utterly terrible Dunkirk to be made and then uses hilariously fake critics like Mark Kermode to claim they are works of genius etc.From now on I will only watch films via free websites as I can no longer support an industry that has so little integrity or talent and is scamming all of us.

372,neillaoshi,Has its moments,2,28 August 2017,"Everyone seems to be writing here that the casting was great: I have to disagree. Samuel L Jackson is 68 and, although he doesn't look his age, neither does he look like an action hero who can run around and leap from building to building, with or without and gunshot in his leg. Obviously this movie is very far from realistic, but from the moment Jackson jogged into the action waggling a machine gun behind him I felt unconvinced. Other than that my main criticism would be the uneven tone of the film and, of course the paper thin plot.If you are just looking for something to kill a few hours with, this is not the worst choice you could make, but there are certainly a lot of better films out there if you want something with a plot and good dialogue.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

377,arwel,OK if you just want a mindless shoot-em-up,4,26 December 2017,"I suppose this is an OK film if you just like a lot of shooting, explosions, and chases. If you think about the plot for a moment, it's ridiculously improbable. If you want to get someone from Manchester to Den Haag, the logical way would be to fly from Manchester (which has the biggest airport in the UK outside London) to Amsterdam Schiphol, which is half way between Amsterdam and Den Haag - you could do the whole transfer in 2-3 hours. If you insist on going by ship, you wouldn't go through Dover (which as far as I know has never had a service to the Netherlands) - you'd either head southeast from Manchester (not going anwhere near Coventry) to Harwich, to catch a ferry to Hoek van Holland which is down the coast from Den Haag, due east from Manchester to take an overnight ferry from Hull to Rotterdam, which is even further from Den Haag, or northeast from Manchester to Newcastle upon Tyne to catch the overnight ferry to Amsterdam/IJmuiden; in any case the crossing takes 8-20 hours which would make it difficult to meet the deadline in the story. Oh, and Interpol is a co-ordination organisation between police forces - it doesn't have any agents or powers of arrest of its own.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
378,U2bum,Good blend of action and comedy,6,17 January 2021,"It took about 20 minutes before the comedy began and then it was blended well with the action scenes. The soundtrack complemented the movie and the music played nicely over the action. I didn't care for the CG blood splatter on the camera a few times or when helicopters fly by the camera causing it to shake, but that's just me.Overall, the plot was a bit weak and predictable but it didn't take away from the movie. There are a few continuity errors that you catch if those things stand out to you but again, they didn't detract from the movie.Lots of head shots and blood splatter but it wasn't gory. Worth a watch if you like that kind of action and comedy mix or if you like Ryan Reynolds or Samuel L. Jackson.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
379,cfb-150-652465,Great Action and Comedy - But...,6,22 August 2017,"Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson were cast perfectly in their roles. Both did an excellent job. The director went a little overboard on the (always) implausible action sequences. I can forgive the implausible gun battles where the good guys stand out in the open and are able to kill 20-30 bad guys (with machine guns) and not get a scratch. Well, They did get a scratch, but seemingly very minor as it didn't slow them down. One of the rubs is that Hollywood seems not to have Google or Wikipedia. Or at least doesn't know how to use it. Samuel L. Jackson is to be taken to the Hague by Interpol agents. These Interpol agents are very well armed. Interpol does not have armed agents and do not have arrest powers. They simply are an investigative agency.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

I think this movie could deserve an 8.5 rating (+ 0.5 for hilariousness). The plot is very basic, but with different storyline elements sprinkled it that make almost every interaction simply fun. The action is superbly done, the GREAT comedy is both verbal and visual with the lead actors hitting their roles out of the park (especially Samuel L. Jackson).

But, in the other hand if you remember all of Sam Jackson's best moments this movie has some of the best!
The plot is easy to follow, but it felt more as an excuse to tell great jokes, you can just enjoy this movie as a roadtrip-comedy between the two actors, but the plot is trying way too hard in the background!

All in all a utter waste of time.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
390,GrantTDawson,"Not everyone will like it, but I did.",8,10 August 2017,"The Hit-man's Bodyguard is a movie I never knew I wanted to see until I saw the first trailer. I was instantly hooked, and couldn't wait to see it on opening day. Well, I actually got a bit lucky for once as I was invited to see the movie almost two weeks before it opened. And I gotta say, it's one of the best action/comedy movies I've watched in quite a while...perhaps since Deadpool.So what's this movie about? Well, it's about a guy (Ryan Reynolds) who used to run a protection agency before he lost a client and his business failed, forcing him to become a personal bodyguard. He is tasked by an Interpol agent to get a witness who is a former assassin (Samuel L. Jackson) to a courthouse to testify against a dictator. Craziness ensues.While the story sounds interesting, it plays out in a pretty typical and predictable way. Not that I should have expected much more. It is an action/comedy film, after all. But predictability aside, the story does get the job done. Yeah, you'll be able to figure out how the film will end within the first 30 minutes or so, but that's not all that important, because it's all about the journey to that very predictable, and satisfying, ending. And boy, the adventure that Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds go on is extremely entertaining.Being a comedy, you'd expect some good comedy in this film, right? Well, The Hit-man's Bodyguard delivers on that expectation and then some. Once you get past the movie's slow start, it's pretty much an all you can chuckle buffet. (The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson is incredible!) Of course there are a few jokes that fall flat, but they are few and far between. Oh yeah, if you're a fan of Deadpool humor, you'll really like this movie. It's not full-blown Deadpool, but it's pretty damn similar.Now, the biggest surprise for me with this movie is how great the action sequences are. The team behind this film definitely drew some influence from movies like John Wick and Jason Bourne for both the combat scenes and the chase scenes. They're riveting, with some great humor sprinkled in.Overall, The Hit-man's Bodyguard is one of the biggest surprises of the year so far for me, and will definitely go down as one of the most enjoyable films of the year. It's funny, it's action packed, and the story is interesting enough to keep it all moving towards a satisfying conclusion. So yeah, I guess you could say it's pretty dang good. Go see it when it comes out on August 18th.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
391,amberlitteken,Generic action comedy.,7,16 October 2017,"This movie would have been great if they had just left it at that--an action comedy filled to the brim with expletives and sarcastic humor. But they had to add an underlying theme of love. And the main character, Michael, had an uninteresting and forgettable love interest. But if you are looking for an action comedy and don't mind harsh language, you will enjoy this movie.If you like generic action comedy you'll like this one too.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

I am really starting to dislike Ryan Reynolds and his sarcastic and yet 'witty' personality. I did enjoy some of his movies but it seems to be always a hit and miss with him.As for Samuel L Jackson, his quality of work has been steadily declining during the years and I am sure an actor of his calibre is well aware of this. The only incentive I can think of is money and I can't hate the man for that; he has talent it's just not properly focused.

I don't know why the makers of movies these days even bother hiring a scriptwriter, as the entire movie is just one long F**K, or endless variations of the word, they even managed to cram three 'M***********S' into one sentence! It is strictly a by the numbers movie, the head of the agency is a masculine looking woman, the agent assigned to protect Jackson is a woman,the villain has seemingly thousands of henchmen all willing to die at his bidding, there is the van chase through the streets, the motorbike chase through the market,the motorboat chase through the canals....Yawn!

I don't know why that's always so overlooked? Maybe because he IS so funny and good looking? Never understood that. But either way, great team up! 
There were a few things that could have made this movie really great- I think they needed to do something different with Gary Oldmans character (too serious, I know they were going for an opposite effect, but I think they could have really played with a comedic element with him) and Selma Hayek should have had maybe a few more scenes. There was some sort of element missing from the movie that I couldn't put my finger on, but as a whole I got exactly what I signed up for when I went to see it. I got some awesome action sequences and great stunts, Ryan and Sam were hilarious and great with each other, I liked the small bit of love story they brought in for each of them, and I liked the premise. 
A great sequence I really enjoyed was the chase and the fight scene with the Little Queenie song - I'm a sucker for fun fight scenes with great oldies music haha.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Ryan Reynolds and Samuel Jackson do as they do, not exactly them stepping out of any boundaries or being ground breaking. It was also good to see Salma Hayek again, you don't see her too often any more and she's still rockin it
It takes it self a little too serously at times, but at others it was like a comedy should be. There's a couple ""twists"" in turns of story but they're honestly so so soooo easy to spot and it's like a slap to the face.
The dialogue was great and natural, it has that buddy cop kind of thing going on as well. The camera work was great with the exception of a couple lens flares, some action scenes felt too long while the majority was perfect timing. 
Overall the movie is a harmless buddy cop movie, with great laughs and performaces from Gary Oldman and Ryan, I highly recommend this movie if you're in need of a good time. 8/10",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Ryan Reynolds was ok, he's not bad and I think he and Samuel Jackson have chemistry and could be good together in a movie with a script, but he didn't have much to do in this. It's just really awful and it has nothing to spoil. There's one character-building scene at the beginning and then it's just one long, super violent chase scene with tons of bullets and bodies and something I can't even call a subplot that I think was intended by someone, once, to build a relationship between the two stars but falls absolutely flat. Really, I don't know why they bothered with even the light dusting of explanation for who those people were and why they were there; just open with bullets flying and go to the end. One hilarious, good touch was Ryan Reynolds' climactic battle with the bad guy's chief muscle, which starts in a restaurant kitchen full of sharp things and hot things, moves out the window and into a hardware store full of all kinds of things. Apparently, the police in Amsterdam have two used Hondas or something and maybe four officers.

RR, while not as much on fire, as such, still manages to make a great had-enough straight man who nevertheless manages to be funny when he can get a word in between SLJ's non-stop one-liners and jokes.My only issue, which is not a complaint, is that, like almost all other action movies, it's not really believable. The premise isn't even believable. The events in the movie (other than Gary Oldman's scenes - each of which he steals with seemingly impish glee) would never happen in real life.Other than that, watching this movie is a fine way to spend 2 hours. Would watch again.Oh, and watch out for the small role played by Selma Hayek. She plays an insane Mexican killer, and the scenes with her cellmate are comedy gold!",The Hitman's Bodyguard
433,chazzy1864,Very mediocre,5,18 November 2017,"Honestly, this movie was a let down. I love Ryan Reynolds, to the point that I'm very biased. I was bored throughout this movie. The premise is somewhat close to Safe House (2012). Not exact by any means, but close enough that it made me draw comparisons within the first 30 minutes and from that point on, I just kept wanting to stop the movie and turn on Safe House. I'm not lying. The movie had its moments, but more often than not,I thought it was ridiculous in a bad way and never all that good. Safe House is a movie that has Ryan Reynolds protecting a highly valuable, highly capable target, and is exponentially better.The problem with this movie, is it is so ridiculous, it is supposed to be funny, however there is only a handful of times that actually made me laugh out loud. More often than not, it seemed to try to take itself seriously, especially when it shouldn't have. The gun play tried to portray itself as realistic, but fell very short. At times the characters were so amazing they could pull off ridiculous shots with no effort, then couldn't hit the broadside of a barn. While the movie wasn't horrible, it wasn't great. It made me think of better movies that I wanted to watch, while hoping better moments came. Occasionally a better moment would come... I'd laugh out loud (genuinely!) and then it'd pass, leaving me bored again. You won't hate yourself for watching, but you won't be happy about it either. 5/10",The Hitman's Bodyguard

435,MathiasWatts,Enjoyable buddy action comedy,6,29 August 2017,"The on screen chemistry between Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds is undeniable. In the spirit of previous ""I don't like you but I need you"" interactions between the two leads such as 48 Hours (Nick Nolte, Eddie Murphy) and Money Talks (Charlie Sheen, Chris Tucker)this buddy action comedy will be enjoyed by younger and older audiences alike. It is arguably one of the best action comedic duos since the first Rush Hour (Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker) and is just as entertaining as The Rundown (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Seann Williams Scott). Although every scene that was meant to be humorous was not totally laugh out loud funny, the clever wise cracks and bickering back and forth between Bryce and Kincaid was entertaining enough. Finances aside, The Hit-man's Bodyguard could justify a sequel if well written. However like Rush Hour it should not have its well received welcome worn out by underwhelming sequels. Every scene that Jackson and Reynolds are in together is the meat and potatoes of this movie. I only wish they could have gone more in depth to their interactions prior to Bryce becoming Kincaid's bodyguard.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Mixed with Netflix algorithms that tells what people ""like"" for each genres.If you like cliché after cliché, ""motherfucker"" after ""motherfucker"" couple friendly i.e. female friendly watered down action with an eye candy bait for them to be okay to watch it, while the boyfriend hopes Jackson says a sentence without ""motherfucker"" pushed into the script.

Very cliché, very embarrassing to look at times. Ryan Reynolds performing as a unsuited Deadpool, cause that's what his character is, Deadpool without a suit. We get it, he is suppose to be funny and sarcastic, but come on, not in every single line of the movie. There is a scene ""spoilers"" Where he is being torture, that it has the same feeling as when Wayde Wilson was being held in the mutant x underground laboratory.On the other side, Samuel L Jackson, must have signed a contract to say motherfuker. every time he can or the producing company made that, because, well he says it at least 20 times.

The acting and filming is top notch, for me this has to be one of the coolest films of 2017.

The comedy was funny, I enjoyed the backstory, but it was just too much of the same over and over that it made it a bit of a bore to watch towards the end.

But the scenes detailing Reynolds relationship with his ex are almost cringe worthy.Salma Hayek was good in small over the top role as Jackson's wife. Plot was basically Midnight Run with a kick ass hit- man instead of a wussy accountant and the action scenes ranged in quality from pedestrian to slightly better than competent. Second half bogs down with too many of them. Would have benefited more from keeping the two leads together instead of separating them and having them run around rescuing each other.

In one scene, a mother and young child are shot at point blank in front of their husband and father. Along the way, limbs are severed, a man is electro tortured, people are stabbed in the neck with broken beer bottles, blood gushes everywhere...It's pretty gory. But it has a light hearted almost sentimental thread running through it that I really liked. And the action scenes are amazing. Some of the best car chase and fight scenes I've ever seen.

It's classy with some great chase scenes and action packed almost from the get-go. I enjoyed the dynamics of the two main characters, the jokes and interplay between the Goodie and the perceived Baddie is great, though this does flip round as the film progresses.The use of Manchester and Amsterdam, The Hague as the main locations makes for a great backdrop and the chase scene and stunt driving in Amsterdam in particular is excellent.Samuel Ls rendition and singing during and over the final closing titles was particularly enjoyable - meanwhile Ryans style, clothing and choice of cars provides visual entertainment.Best movie I've seen for a good while..",The Hitman's Bodyguard

The way too digital film quality sticks out like a sore thumb, its like the entire video and the characters were Botox-ed all over after the filming was done. And it tries too hard to balance the seriousness with logical explanations and the comedy that in the end both fails.

A (thin) love story. It has everything.But it drags on. Repetitions of dialog. More chases. More killing. After 20 minutes it becomes boring. And predictable. The story is not going anywhere.

The 7/10 is a bit better. However, whilst I recognise that this film is no Oscar winning masterpiece, in terms of its actual entertaining value it is my second favourite of the year - losing out only to Baby Driver which was masterfully executed and refreshingly unique. From start to finish the film is explosions and guns. The lines are witty and I am sure I would have found the scene with the nuns (this is in the trailer) might have been more entertaining viewing for the first time.

Jackson) are unlikely partners forced to buddy up together in The Hit-man's Bodyguard. So far, so normal - the difference here is that Kincaid is a hit-man and Bryce an elite level bodyguard who have had a shared history in that Kincaid has tried to kill Bryce on numerous occasions. Bryce is charged with getting Kincaid from the UK to The Hague in Holland so he can testify against the evil Dukhovich ably played by Gary Oldman. Will he succeed or will Dukhovich's henchmen kill Kincaid? Will they kill each other? (It was nice to see Hollywood realise that London is not the only city in England). This is a thoroughly enjoyable action/comedy flick with decent support from the likes of Salem Hayek as Kincaid's wife. In fact despite all the screen time Jackson and Reynolds share together the funniest scene for me was the one in which we learn how Jackson and Hayek met. Jackson lets go over 100 expletives in the film and is supported in the swearing department by Hayek and Elodie Yung (as Reynolds former love interest) but at no point in this film does it feel it is included just to shock or offend and does not detract from the film at all.

493,momofmany,Most Entertaining Movie I've Seen in YEARS!!!,10,28 November 2017,This is absolutely the best movie i've seen in years! Hysterically funny and wildly entertaining. The chemistry between Samuel L Jackson and Ryan Reynolds is fantastic. The comic timing and delivery is top notch. It's not often you find a truly great action movie and laugh out loud funny comedy with phenomenal character development. I rarely watch a movie more than once and even if I do there needs to be a good amount of time between viewings. This is likely because I have 7 children and they watch the same movie until I want to pull my own hair. We watched this Sunday night for the first time. Today is our Thanksgiving (tuesday because my husband was working on actual thanksgiving) and as soon as the meal was done we and our friends sat down to watch it again (sans children of course). I am enjoying it even more the second time around.,The Hitman's Bodyguard

499,madelineelainecohn,Predictable and Clichéd,5,24 August 2017,"Imagine every single action movie cliché and it makes an appearance in this film. While I was watching this movie, I would think to myself ""this won't happen, it would be too cliché"" and then it would happen. It was painfully predictable. So many ex machina moments. Gary Oldman's character was a huge disappointment. Gary Oldman is such a fantastically talented actor and I felt like his character was a hollow, generic ""bad guy"" with an accent that couldn't decide what country to be from. It felt like he had very little time to develop this character.The only saving grace was the genuine comedic chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L Jackson. It takes a huge screen presence to compete with Samuel L Jackson in a comedy setting but Ryan Reynolds took it in stride and stood out in his own right. But Jackson's character was the stereotypical ""hitman who doesn't play by the rules"" and some of his wacky, out of the box character moments were laughable, but not in the good way. This movie seemed like a hastily thrown together action/comedy movie to make a bit of money between Reynolds's and Jackson's other projects.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

He ends up having to protect an assassin who's testifying against a dictator. The story line is pretty good, and the characters have interesting backstories which often explains their actions and which make them all the more endearing.

I felt betrayed by the writers, luring me in with action and stars only to be let down by a story that insults my appreciation for both.It's this kind of movies that makes me wonder why ticket prices are not variable; let the audience rate the movies afterwards, so the theater can adjust prices within a certain margin of let's say, 30% up or down? My rating (5) is based on the fact that I did not leave before closing credits20% mark down would be justified.

We got ethnic cleansing and in Belarus is only one ethnic group - Belarussians - white Slovans - they have sometimes different religion but in this part of world it never was a problem really. Belarus is not in EU and its really hard for them to get visa to EU so how that many Belarussian mercenaries are in UK especially id they related to regime? Poland would never transfer them through their border. And how they get all this weapon? We do not have in Europe easy access to weapons. It's a miracle to get one without attention.

524,DavidDiemer,Endless chase sequences and next to no character development,4,14 February 2020,"I was really looking forward to a team-up between Ryan Reynolds (RR) and Samuel L. Jackson (SLJ), and so I really anticipated a great buddy movie. What I got instead was a buddy film where the two never become buddies, lots of action sequences in place of character development, and endless, boring, predictable chase sequences. In fact, I found them so boring, I was able to skip nearly ten minutes of chase scene (ten minutes!) in the final and I didn't miss anything that had any substantive impact on the movie!SPOILER: The romance between RR and his ex-girlfriend was simply a plot point for endless discussions with SLJ and eventually a forced resolution between RR and her.SPOILER. I was completely unimpressed and not surprised at all by the the movie's ""big"" reveal. This all goes to show what happens when action substitutes for plot and character.This movie's lack of subtlety undermines what should have been a blockbuster. Instead of the title characters complementing each other's weaknesses or working through issues, we get endless, meaningless, insubstantial dialogue to make the movie longer. SLJ outshines RR in nearly every scene: he's quicker, smarter, more street-wise, and continually demonstrates to RR what a lackey he really is. Unfortunately, the one time we see RR really showing his metal, SLJ later tells us he was completely aware of everything that was going on completely undercutting everything RR had done for him. What a disappointment.We should have expected these two pros to be on top of their game, masters at blending in, and getting past obstacles without being seen and winning the day. What we got was an in-your-face, everyone-knows-you're-coming final act which showed just how bad RR and SLJ were at stealth, an essential element of being a hit man or a bodyguard.If you want some popcorn fun, this is the movie, but you may walk away shaking your head thinking to yourself how much better it could have been, and maybe even shaking your head wondering why you paid for the rental!",The Hitman's Bodyguard

It really could've done without the romance side-plot with Amelia and Michael though. It felt forced, underdeveloped, and really seemed to be the central storyline throughout the movie, ignoring the actual plot. They should've scrapped it and focused more on the dictator and his background. But then again, most of the movie was going off into random details and backgrounds, which led to Kincaid and Michael being the only really developed characters (mostly because they play the same characters in their movies).

We are both fan's of action and comedy and went into this hoping it would be as good as we hoped from the actor's involved. I am a HUGE Sam Jackson fan and an equally big Ryan Reynolds fan. I'm glad to say that this movie did not disappoint! I would've given this movie a 10 if only voting on the action and comedy but there were a couple of plot points that were slightly predictable. I don't feel these couple of things hurt the movie much due to what the movie is being advertised as, which is an action comedy and this is by far where it shines. I laughed harder during some scenes of this movie than I've laughed in a long time during a movie. The last I remember laughing harder is last year during ""Deadpool"". If you like lots of action and great comedy with actors with plenty of chemistry and don't mind a significant amount of f-bombs, which if you're a Sam Jackson fan I'm guessing you don't, then drop some cash for a ticket.

The script is thinner than a G-string and Samuel L Jackson & Salma Hayek are both wasted. I've never been a fan of Ryan Reynolds and his dead pan expressions throughout the movie doesn't help either. The plot points are extremely stupid with childish behaviour shown throughout by the lead actors. None of the so-called comic scenes eek out a laugh and I was bored half-way through the movie.

From the opening scenes you love the characters with all their faults. Ryan and Sam just must make more movies as Hit-man and Bodyguard, the chemistry is undeniable.

I saw an early screening so I thought it might have been a weird fluke but nope... it's persistent in the trailer too. Besides just generally not being funny it was just hard to watch.

There is actually a scene where a truck full of explosives plows into a crowd of people.

Jackson and Ryan Reynolds can't make a great action scene in an action movie, sad). the only good thing about the movie is one scene that they used stun man. so don't watch the movie, the trailer is all you need, the hype fool us again. this is the third time i listened to Huy to watched a movie and it turned out to be bad, the other 2 was Wonder Woman and Guardians of the Galaxy 2. will not take his recommendation again.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

I am a big fan of action and looking at the showings it was too scientific and didn't interest me that much but nevertheless I ended up watching it because my first choice was? not available at a time. I liked that it kept me intrigued and almost was wondering how Samwell and the most respected body guard are going to cross their paths. It was interesting, entertaining, funny, memorable and full of action. Probably one of the few movies I would like to watch again. Big up to the producers.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

568,charles_m_burns,"Wanted to like it, couldn't get over the bad choreography",5,9 September 2017,"The only thing The Hit-man's Bodyguard has going for it is Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson's charisma, and the movie just isn't worth it, especially if Samuel L. Jackson is going to barely move in the action scenes. It was probably pretty difficult to cut together scenes that looked realistic in the slightest with him moving like that, it's almost as bad as watching Liam Neeson jump a fence. And the soundtrack to go with the choreography induces a bit of cringe.Watch a clip of what's probably meant to be one of the better fight scenes in the movie, this should be relatively easy to do, but still so many cuts used, none of the actions realistic, and really overplaying the effects of the hits happening. No spoilers unless you consider the trailer to be a spoiler, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11_vIa0Yk0U Apart from the choreography, the dialogue really overplayed how much of a badass everyone thought they were. Everyone just kind of sounded like a self-righteous smug asshole that kills everyone with shitty movie editing. The story to go with the dialogue makes even less sense, nobody has any realistic motivations for doing anything and the entire story is built around a ridiculous incident that doesn't make any sense. If the characters did do such ridiculous things, then they shouldn't in any way be acting the way they are now.But if you don't care about bad choreography, you don't think the music is that bad, you don't mind a little bad acting, and you really want to see Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L Jackson buddy up even though the story doesn't make sense, then you might like this movie.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

571,lyw24,The chemistry of Reynold and Jackson is the force carrying the film,6,7 November 2017,"While I love the humour and chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson, the movie unfortunately falls into the cliché trap in terms of the plot and execution. I would suggest that viewers do not have high expectations when watching this movie as it does not take itself too seriously. Though marketed as an action comedy movie, I applaud the comedy inside, but I am disappointed with the action sequences.As the title states, The Hit-man's Bodyguard (an oxymoron itself as hit men normally kill high value targets which bodyguards protect) is a story about Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds), a disgraced Triple A rated executive protection agent (by the way he emphasizes on this fact A LOT in the movie) being coerced to protect Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson), the most notorious incarcerated hit-man ever, from being slaughtered by henchmen of Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman), the power-hungry, ruthless and bloodthirsty dictator of Belarus, as they make their way to the International Criminal Court for Kincaid to testify against Dukhovich.Probably the best point of the movie is the chemistry between the two protagonists. It is noteworthy that they were enemies initially (According to Reynold, Jackson tried to kill him at least 28 times previously) and they started off by trying to kill each other, with only Jackson's leg injury standing in the way. Throughout the movie, this relationship between them grew positively as they banter with each other and surviving through numerous assaults. It is a good choice to put Reynold as the ""boring"", meticulous and strict bodyguard (instead of his profanities-laden jokes in Deadpool) and Jackson as the humorous, cool dude. Jackson was given the license to go over the top here, with some 122 expletives spoke by him throughout the film. Their characters when placed together, really created many funny moments as I spent time laughing at Jackson's crude jokes and the shitty circumstances that Reynold always found himself in. I also loved how the movie spent some time covering their backstories on how they came to their jobs, and especially how Reynold got disgraced from his elite status. The movie also introduces the ""sidekicks"" of the protagonists, namely the ex-girlfriend of Michael Bryce, Amelia Roussel (Élodie Yung) and the wife of Darius Kincaid, Sonia Kincaid (Salma Hayek). I have contrasting opinions over the chemistry between the couples. For Jackson and Hayek, I could feel the strong love and emotions between them, especially when the movie recalled how they fell for each other at first sight in a rowdy bar at Honduras. What is very striking was the portrayal of Hayek as an equally, if not more, passionate and vicious person than Jackson, where she single-handily severed the carotid artery of a man while staring at Jackson at the bar. However, the movie unfortunately does not devote much time to develop the relationship between Yung and Reynold, as they suddenly became from squabbling ex-lovers to an item at the end. I find that the film feels unbalanced between being hilarious or being dark and serious, which I disagree with. Granted, Gray Oldman performed very well (as usual) in his villainous role, though his portrayal of Dukhovich is of a sadistic and bloodthirsty dictator. We got to see him killing a child and a mother (off-screen) in cold blood to torment a captured scientist in Belarus. There was even a scene of Reynold being electronically tortured by Dukhovich's men to extract information regarding Kincaid's where-about. I found these scenes to be distasteful as they do not suit the comedic and light-heartedness of the movie. I would very much rather the whole show to be full of jokes and comedy, instead of such dark scenes.Another criticism I have is regarding the cliché plot-line. The moment I was introduced to the main characters and villain, I could guess correctly the whole plot. Every attempt made in the film to create suspense or tension would then not work out on me. In fact, the first third of the film was very draggy and boring, with a lot of narration and backstories, and I felt that the show could have been shorter by 20 minutes or so. Towards the end, both the plot and action picked up, which kind off compensated for the slow first third. However, the actions were not of Hollywood's standard as the direction and editing were lacking quality. There was this long chase scene in Amsterdam, but I did not find it impressive due to it lacking intensity. Long chasing sequences doesn't mean it will surely be good!In conclusion, if you just want to de-stress and relax after a long day, then you should watch this film as it is guaranteed to make you laugh. But if you are looking for great plot and action scenes, then I am sorry to say that this movie does not fulfill your criteria.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
572,narshybear,A Comedy and Action movie that left me wanting more!,9,22 December 2017,I have to say that the entire time I was watching this I was either on the edge of my seat or laughing so hard I almost fell out of my seat! With Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson in The Hitman's Bodyguard it makes for a comedy like no other. Reynolds brings a snarky attitude with him in any film and that paired up with Jackson's tough man facade makes me see the on screen chemistry and energy they play off of each other in this film.,The Hitman's Bodyguard
573,wal_2005,It just wouldn't shut the f*ck up,6,2 September 2017,"It would have been an enjoyable action movie if every scene didn't have an ill fitting song or that (absolutely) awful score playing in the background. Forget Ryan Reynolds, forget Samuel L. Jackson, the score is the real star of this movie, it manages, for example, to turn an intense boat chase scene into a looney toons turd flinging spectacle, and it keeps yammering and bombarding the viewer until the end, not one silent scene, it's almost nauseating. The score ruined the movie for me, because I couldn't concentrate on what was happening on the screen and it made the movie a chore to watch.",The Hitman's Bodyguard
574,yoyods-72650,"Fun Movie, Emphasising Style Over Substance",8,5 April 2018,"I would like to start by saying; yes the plot is trope-y and kind of predictable. But I think most viewers would be able to pick that up in the first 10-20 minutes of the movie.I personally enjoyed because it's the type of movie you watch if you want to have fun. much like movies like John Wick, The Nice Guys, or Redline (the anime), the movie chooses to emphasise other aspects that aren't a sophisticated plot told with very clever, subtle filmmaking techniques. It's a fun action comedy that chooses to highlight characters and the chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson in a light hearted action romp. I feel like a lot of the negative reviews expected the movie to be than what it knew it was.So if you like having a good time, you like to laugh, you like some gun shots, car chases and go-pros, you probably enjoy this film.",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Slightly predictable the movie seems fast paces only when Reynolds and Jackson share the scene. At some points though the banter got astonishingly close to my kids arguing over random irrelevant BS on a road trip...causing me to almost yell at the screen "" Shut up or get out"".. oh well... I'd definitely watch it again for the thrill of Samuel L Jackson and Ryan Reynolds dulcet tones",The Hitman's Bodyguard

In my opinion you should rate a ""great"" or ""fun"" movie with a 9 star or higher.What killed the movie for me were the cheap and unrealistic effects. You could see almost all of the scenes were captured via green screen. Some of the scenes were also just to unrealistic in my opinion. For example the escape from the police by jumping off the flatbuilding into the trash container. Just by doing that they escaped right away from like 100 policeman who surrounded everything. Just to simple, to me it just like the creaters were to lazy to think of anything else.Also the humor was not my thing and it seemed like a very standard and commercial movie. Without Samuel L. Jackson this movie would be empty as hell.
So it was a waste time for me for sure. The only positive things were the hot France cop woman and that many scenes played in Amsterdam (where I often come for my work).",The Hitman's Bodyguard

Recorded it and have watched it several time since then. Yes, a lot of killing and cursing. What do you expect when you put Deadpool with Pulp Fiction in an action comedy. Both are known for their sarcasm and foulness. Anybody who expects a Disney movie from Sam Jackson and Ryan Reynolds, together, really hasn't followed either of their careers.
