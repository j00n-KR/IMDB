0,Leofwine_draca,Very fine,9,5 December 2020,"DARK WATERS is another very fine true story of environmental pollution in America, and another feather in the cap for Mark Ruffalo, who with the likes of FOXCATCHER and SPOTLIGHT has made some of the best factual films to come out of Hollywood in the last decade. This one's quite similar to the John Travolta flick A CIVIL ACTION or even ERIN BROKOVICH, but even better, following a lengthy and complex case through to its conclusion. It's a dark and sombre production with a depressing subject matter, yet it's also very well acted and quietly gripping from beginning to end.",Dark Waters
1,SnoopyStyle,solid enviro drama,8,1 March 2020,"In 1998, Cincinnati lawyer Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) is a new partner in Taft which specializes in defending chemical companies. He's reluctant to show his West Virginia roots. Angry farmer Wilbur Tennant shows up demanding his services after getting referral from Bilott's grandmother. The Tennant farm is next to a DuPont garbage dump and his cattle are dying. Bilott decides to take the case despite being usually on the other side of the court. He discovers corporate corruption, dangerous Teflon, and a system rigged against the little guys.It's compelling. It's the little guy fighting Goliath. It's sincere. It's informative. It's engrossing. It doesn't stray from the formula and that's probably its main deficiency. It's safe. It's doesn't need the underground parking car bomb scene. That is following the formula too closely. It does have great actors which elevate the material.",Dark Waters

3,kosmasp,Muddled but clear,9,5 April 2021,"You know when you hear about a horrible story that happened to someone? The normal human reaction is to feel sympathy for the party that has taken damage. Most of the time that is an underdog, someone is being overlooked by the goverment most likely. It may not be the best time to have a movie about conspiracies being so accurate, but it is what it is.And it also is something that is not just relevant to someone else, but to all of us. When the enviroment gets polluted we can't just stand on the side and say ""well this does not happen where I live"". While some may still believe the planet is flat, the most of us know that anything happening at one end of the world is very likely to affect the other parts of the world too.This is as someone else wrote quite eye opening. And if you read the text at the end of the movie also very disturbing to say the least. Not a movie to cheer you up then, but that is not its purpose!",Dark Waters
4,classicsoncall,"""We should want to nail Dupont!""",8,9 November 2020,"This is the kind of stuff that makes your blood boil, doesn't it? Whenever I become aware of instances where products produced by large corporations are deemed dangerous or hazardous to one's health, I always wonder whether the executives of those companies have any trouble sleeping at night. In the case of Teflon or it's component PFOA, the summary of the story concludes that it can now be found in ninety nine percent of everything living on the planet. Seeing as how this includes those same executives themselves and their families, you have to wonder why they would willingly keep on poisoning themselves. It took real courage and a whole lot of persistence for the real live Rob Bilott, here portrayed by Mark Ruffalo, to take on the huge Dupont Chemical Company back in the late Nineties when he first learned how one of their dump sites was poisoning the ground water and streams in his former home town of Parkersburg, West Virginia. It didn't take long for Bilott and his law firm to realize the system was rigged to cover up wrong doing and avoid accountability for their poor corporate behavior. The film I'm sure can't possibly convey the frustration and anger experienced by his law firm and it's clients over the decade plus long battle to set things right, just as I'm sure no amount of damages can soother the families who lost loved ones to the hazards posed by a poisonous product. It might sound like a lot to hear that Dupont eventually settled for a six hundred seventy million dollar fine over it's use of Teflon, but if you break it down, it's just under a hundred ninety thousand dollars per case. Seems to me like the company got away cheap.",Dark Waters
5,lee_eisenberg,it's everywhere,10,7 September 2021,"Robert Bilott was a corporate defense lawyer in Ohio when in 1998, he took up a case for a farmer whose land was polluted. Over the next few years, Bilott learned just how much power the chemical companies have, and how much effect their products have had.Todd Haynes's ""Dark Waters"" focuses on this story, with Mark Ruffalo as Bilott and Anne Hathaway as his wife Sarah. In concentrating on Bilott's case against DuPont, the movie exposes just how widespread these chemicals are. Unlike ""A Civil Action"" and ""Erin Brockovich"" - both of which looked at pollution in individual towns - this reveals that certain pollution affects all life worldwide. The occasional reminder that the scariest stories are the true ones.Also starring Tim Robbins, Victor Garber, William Jackson Harper (of ""The Good Place""), Mare Winningham and Bill Pullman.",Dark Waters
6,jboothmillard,Dark Waters,5,15 March 2020,"I saw the trailer for this film inspired by real events a couple of times in the cinema, I was initially interested because of the good cast, but I became more so because of the subject matter, directed by Todd Haynes (Safe, Far from Heaven, Carol). Based on the true story, in Cincinnati, Ohio, corporate defence lawyer Robert ""Rob"" Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) works for law firm Taft Stettinius & Hollister. He is approached by farmer Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp), who knows Robert's grandmother, asking him to investigate a number of unexplained deaths in Parkersburg, West Virginia. Tennant connects the deaths to the chemical manufacturing corporation DuPont and gives Robert a large case of videotapes. Rob visits Tennant's farm, where he learns that 190 cattle have died with unusual medical conditions such as bloated organs, blackened teeth, and tumours. DuPont attorney Phil Donnelly (Titanic's Victor Garber) tells him he is not aware of the case but will help in any way he can. Robert files a small suit so he can gain information of the chemicals dumped on the site. He realises the chemicals might not be regulated by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) after failing to find anything useful in the EPA report. Rob confronts Phil at an industry event, leading to an argument. DuPont sends Rob hundreds of boxes, hoping to bury the evidence. Robert finds numerous references to PFOA, a chemical with no references in any medical textbook. He later discovers that PFOA is perfluorooctanoic acid, used to manufacture Teflon and used in American homes for non-stick pans. DuPont has been running tests of the effect of PFOA for decades, finding that it causes cancer and birth defects, but these findings were not made public. They dumped hundreds of gallons of toxic sludge in the river that flows through Tennant's farm. PFOA and similar compounds are forever chemicals, harmful chemicals that do not leave the blood stream and slowly accumulate. Tennant has been shunned by the community for suing their biggest employer, and, although advised by Rob, he refuses to accept DuPont's settlement, wanting justice. Tennant tells Rob he and his wife Sandra (Denise Dal Vera) both have cancer. Robert sends the DuPont evidence to the EPA and Department of Justice, among others. The EPA fines DuPont $16.5 million. But Robert is not satisfied; he knows the residents of Parkersburg will suffer the effects of the PFOA for the rest of their lives. He plans a large class-action lawsuit and seeks medical monitoring for all residents of Parkersburg. However, DuPont sends a letter notifying residents of the presence of PFOA, thus delaying any further action. Rob's team argues that PFOA is not regulated and the corporation is liable, as the amount in the water was a higher unsafe amount than stated in DuPont's internal documents. In court, DuPont claims their later study found that amount contained is safe. The locals protest and the news story goes national. DuPont agrees to settle for $70 million. Scientists need to prove that PFOA causes the ailments, so medical monitoring and date is required. The locals are told they can get their settlement money after donating blood. Nearly 70,000 people donate to the study. Seven years pass with no result from the study. Tennant dies and Rob is hit by pay cuts, straining his marriage with wife Sarah (Anne Hathaway). Rob collapses, shaking, after Tom Terp (Tim Robbins) tells he needs to take another pay cut. Doctors tell Sarah he suffered an ischemia (a restriction in blood supply to tissues), brought on by stress. Sarah tells Tom to stop making Rob feel like a failure, since he is doing something for people who need help. The scientific review contacts Rob and confirm that PFOA, or ""C8"" as it is also known, causes multiple cancers and other diseases. At dinner with his family, Robert is informed that DuPont is going back on the entire agreement. Rob decides that, one at a time, he will take each defendant's case to DuPont. He wins the first three multimillion-dollar settlements against DuPont, and DuPont settles the class action for $671 million. DuPont became defunct in 2017, but the ailments of these manufactured chemicals have made their way into the blood of 99% of all human beings. Also starring Bill Pullman as Harry Dietzler, Mare Winningham as Darlene Kiger, Midsommar 's William Jackson Harper as James Ross and Louisa Krause as Carla Pfeiffer. The performances are all fine, and the script was just about understandable for me, it does make you realise the severity of this contamination to humanity and the lack of care of powerful corporations, average a lot of the time, but dramatic when it needs to be, a good enough legal thriller. Worth watching!",Dark Waters
7,BA_Harrison,"Not exactly a laugh a minute. Unless you're sat in front of me, that is.",7,19 February 2020,"My daughter is just a little bit obsessed with Tim Robbins: she's seen virtually all of his films, many of them multiple times (she's even seen Howard the Duck more than once, which is above and beyond the call of duty). So I now find myself accompanying her to the cinema to see Dark Waters, a film that she's already seen by...ahem...'other means', but which she now wishes to see on the big screen to get the full Robbins effect.I can take or leave Mr. Robbins, and films about corporate law really aren't my thing, so I wasn't expecting too much, but I'm happy to say that Dark Waters is actually pretty good -- not nearly as funny as the people in front of us thought (they were old and probably didn't know where they were), but still quite absorbing, the film helped in no small part by a strong central performance from Mark Ruffalo (he's the real star of the movie; Robbins only has a supporting role as his boss). Ruffalo plays corporate lawyer Rob Bilott, who represents a West Virginian farmer who claims that U.S. chemical giant DuPont are responsible for poisoning his land and livestock. As Bilott investigates, he discovers the one thing that any sane person already knows: that big corporations couldn't give a flying rat's arse about the consumer and their well-being just so long as the dollars keep rolling in.What follows is a David vs. Goliath battle that sees Bilott risking all to get DuPont to accept responsibility for polluting the environment with 'forever' chemical perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), also known as C8, which can cause all manner of potentially fatal conditions. The film features a lot of paper-shuffling, people suffering from terminal disease, and a bad CGI cow, which might not be some people's idea of a good night out, but I say give it a whirl -- it's a damn sight better than a lot of the twaddle I've seen recently (Cats, Bombshell and Birds of Prey, take a bow).7.5/10, which I would have rounded up to 8 if it wasn't for a couple of 'jokey' moments where Bilott's kids say inappropriate things (yes, the old folk in front of me found them hilarious); to me, these moments of levity seemed totally out of place.N.B. Look out for a shot of the DuPont chemical works at the end of the film that sees the smoke being sucked back into a chimney (they must have reversed the footage and hoped that no-one would notice).",Dark Waters
8,Quinoa1984,"What to do when a Corporation is a 'Person', and that Person is the villain",8,19 December 2019,"I know this is basically A Civil Action 2.0, but it's a story told with conviction and pathos and a whole lot of anger at that most black-void-hole-evil a ""Person"" known as the Mega-Corporation. It does at times jump a little much ahead into the future hitting bullet points of history. At the same time, I'm not sure how else to economically tell this story in a little over two hours. The centerpiece of this, where Ruffalo's Robert tells one person (his wife) and then another (his law boss Robbins), the man who didn't believe him at the corporation, and then the ornery farmer who we saw earlier shoot a cow in the head in self defense(!), is a masters class in how to handle exposition and to do cross-cutting to create a sequence.And Todd Haynes, who hasn't helmed a film like this before (and normally I wouldn't think he'd go for it, and kudos to him for collaborating with Ruffalo), ultimately he does manage to smuggle in this greater idea that goes for these bottom-less-pocket-book-deep wells of money like Dupont, but it's also about power itself. The people in West Virginia poisoned and made to die can be a metaphor for any kind of institution (i.e. political) that hides and cajoles and yet those being hurt will support them... until it may be too late. If it has anything over Civil Action, it's the authenticity that comes with filming in the place (with several of the people from the case), and Haynes's unique eye (look at how he stages that medical scene late in the film).",Dark Waters
9,CinemaSerf,Man in suits v on the men in suits...,6,29 February 2020,"The problem with this recounting of the determined exploits of lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) is that it is dull. Based on the true story, this story of the little man working against the might of negligent - reckless - corporate greed in the US (this time it is Du Pont) will doubtless be compared to ""Erin Brockovich"". Unfortunately for Todd Haynes; I don't think very favourably. If I had wanted a documentary on the almost interminable legal-processes that truly did accompany his investigations, then perhaps this would go some way to delivering; but what we have gives us performances that are dry and soul-less. The obvious strains this work put on him, his marriage (to a fleetingly used Anne Hathaway) and family life are scantly regarded. The cast lack any form of charisma, there is no humour - not to trivialise the subject matter, but to inject some humanity into the process and to remember that we, the audience, need to feel we actually care about the characters. That could have worked, were we to get to know some of the victims as such, but we don't and I just felt underwhelmed by the whole two hours.",Dark Waters
10,evanston_dad,Straight Down the Line,7,16 December 2019,"I'm a sucker for a good ol' little-man-against-the-system movie (think ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Silkwood""), of which ""Dark Waters"" is the latest example. I was mostly intrigued to see what Todd Haynes would do with the formula, since he's explored such a unique creative touch in films I've adored (""Safe"", ""Far from Heaven"") and films I've felt more lukewarmly about (""Carol,"" ""I'm Not There""). Surprisingly, he charges straight down the line with ""Dark Waters."" This is an interesting if not engrossing film, and it feels like it could be directed by anybody.That's not necessarily a bad thing when you have an actor as good as Mark Ruffalo in the lead, because the movie gets out of his way and lets him do his thing. He gives a restrained, compelling performance and resists the urge to overplay the everyman-as-hero aspects of this story. This film is more ""Silkwood"" than ""Erin Brockovich."" As much fun as it was to watch Julia Roberts tearing around the screen giving everyone a what-for, she wasn't once believable as a working class broad. Ruffalo, on the other hand, IS believable as a modest attorney in Rust Belt America, and he builds a full performance out of subtle, quiet moments rather than any big, showy, Oscar clip ones. This is basically a one-man show, though he's given able support by Tim Robbins, who's worth the price of admission for the scene where he hands a young cocky attorney his ass, and Bill Pullman, gruff and hilarious and using an accent from God knows where. The weak link in the cast is Anne Hathaway as Ruffalo's wife, who, for all of her sweetness and goody-goodiness as an actress, is miscast as a wholesome, Christian mom.I can't think too much about ""Dark Waters"" because it will keep me up nights and will give me a phobia about ever drinking or eating anything ever again.Grade: A-",Dark Waters

13,gradyharp,'We protect us. We do. Nobody else',10,5 November 2020,"During this time when we all are questioning everything - the pandemic, social injustice, the disparity between the wealthy and the rest of us, the legal system, media information, environmental changes and so forth - along comes a brave film that substantially offers a sense of hope and positive change. Based on a true event as portrayed by Nathaniel Rich in a New York Times magazine article and adapted for the screen by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, this power play as unwound by a humble lawyer is obviously an important statement that captured the interest and commitment of Producer/Actor Mark Ruffalo. The result is an impressive film that is a wake-up call for many issues. Todd Haynes directs with sensitivity and authority.Very briefly, Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) is a new lawyer who signs on with major law firm headed by Tom Terp (Tim Robbins) and almost immediately is called into the service of a farmer (Bill Camp) in West Virginia (because of a relationship with his grandmother) and slowly discovers the terror of Teflon (the source of the C-8 chemical that threatens health) which has been secretly dumped by the maker DuPont at their factory site in West Virginia. The discovery process is slow, but as Bilott pursues the truth he is nearly submerged by the power of a big corporation able to deny and then elude the consequences of the tragedy. In the end it is the fortitude and passion of Bilott (aided by his firm and his wife (Anne Hathaway) that ultimately brings justice for the health-affected people of West Virginia over the course of twenty years from beginning to end!The cast is large and consistently excellent, including some of the actual people of the town of Parkersburg, WV. Mark Ruffalo delivers a staggeringly fine performance, and the additional elements at film's end underline his commitment to the story and the importance of telling that story. This is both a fine film and an important social document, one that should be seen by everyone. Grady Harp, November 20",Dark Waters
14,deloudelouvain,Good movie about a scandal that is still continuing thanks to the whole corrupt (in)justice system.,9,25 March 2020,"I'll give Dark Waters a nine star rating because it's well made and because it's a story that need to be heard by everyone. I absolutely hate big corporations, those companies that make billions of dollars whilst playing with our health. Those corporations think they are above the law, they probably make the laws themselves, that's how sick our society is. Capitalism is the cancer of humanity. Those people should be hanged on the town square, as should be their families just to set an example. Instead they get away with it like they always do. Bribes, media manipulation, lies and deception, it's all on their agenda. Those people make me sick, even more than their chemicals. Companies like Monsanto, Dupont and plenty of others all belong in prison or in a coffin, but corrupt governments will keep them safe. It's time people start revolting and make them pay, not with money but with their lifes. Dark Waters is the perfect example of how a company gets away with murder for years and even when they're proven guilty they continue their dirty games. Teflon is still available in stores so to me nothing changed at all, thanks to the whole failing and corrupted system. Mark Ruffalo did a good job playing Rob Bilott. i never heard of Rob Bilott before but i have an immense respect for people that fight those cases that are basically unwinable. I want to thank Todd Haynes for making this movie, maybe people will toss all their Teflon pans in the bin but I have doubts people will change their habits (humans are just sheep following the herd), that's what I just did.",Dark Waters
15,blanbrn,"Revealing, and soul searching truth for moral justice against hidden corruption!",9,8 December 2019,"""Dark Waters"" is without a doubt a touching and truth opening movie that shows a more than three decades legal struggle and fight against corporate greed and water and product pollution. Covering a time period from the late 80's to mid to late 2000's the film is timely and a long journey to show the affects of common people's lives. It involves Robert Bilott(in a fine turn from Mark Ruffalo) a Cincinnati, Ohio corporate defense attorney who after being contacted by a family member of his old hometown of Parkersburg, West Virginia to go check on strange problems that a local farmer is having it's like all of his cows are dying! Upon investigation and viewing of dead cattle parts and looking at the local water it's clear that pollution is the norm.One by one the locals become affected with various and deadly health problems like cancer and the drama that starts to unfold is tense as Robert chooses morality over loyalty and decides to defend the people in a lawsuit against the giant chemical company named ""DuPont"" as thru later research and reports and some sharp investigative work it's clear the chemical giant has a big history of pollution. Wow what about a big cover up as these crimes have crippled many ever day people. Most shocking was the discovery of the traces of the toxic chemical Teflon which started in many day to day household products only to now be present in most everyone's body.Along the way the drama and stress that unfolds takes a toll on Robert only his supporting love and need to live is found in family as his trophy wife Sarah Bilott(the sexy Anne Hathaway) is the strong and leading captain of the family ship. This movie was well done as it showed how dirty and corrupt that society can be as corporate greed and harmful corruption must be discovered and fought. Really ""Dark Waters"" is a very direct and truthful moral justice seeking film.",Dark Waters
16,Lejink,In Pharma's Way,7,17 February 2020,"""Dark Waters"" is the Hollywood dramatisation of the history and background of recent multiple law suits raised by crusading lawyer Robert Bilott against American pharmaceutical giant DuPont for knowingly allowing the contamination of water predominantly in Parkersburg, Ohio with horrendous side-effects on the neighbouring human and animal life. After several years of investigation culminating in long-time-processing medical tests involving almost 70000 local inhabitants, it was at last conclusively stated that there was a causal link between the reckless profligacy of DuPont in dumping waste materials into the local ecological system and the resultant incidence of all manner of illnesses and physical defects of inhabitants in the area, principally cancer.It all begins when a local farmer, himself in ailing medical health, his livestock ravaged by unexplained maladies including blackened teeth and cancerous tumours, approaches big-time lawyer Bilott, played by Mark Ruffalo and implores him to take his case and seek to lay blame at the door of DuPont, the town's biggest employer. Bilott, a newly created partner in the town's venerable law practice, is initially sceptical of the claims particularly as his own firm has amicable links to DuPont at the highest level, but the smiling condescension he initially receives both from his own company and DuPont's management changes as he digs deeper and uncovers a sinister conspiracy. By his own dogged perseverance, over a period of several years, assisted in this by a married couple in the neighbourhood who alert him to DuPont's underhand method to utilise the Statute of Limitations to kick the case out, he has to convince his fellow partners and his own wife even at the risk of his own failing health, to eventually submit a prosecution.The film is shot in natural, often murky light as befits the film's double-meaning title, emphasising the everyday background to the case. Only occasionally does director Todd Haynes resort to flashy technique, like an extended tracking shot of Ruffalo going into work, the shaky subjective scene when he suffers his mini-stroke and in particular a bizarre sideways/top-down shot of him walking along a passage which will have you almost falling out of your chair, instead rightly heightening the realism of the story and the characters.Once or twice, sensationalism does raise its unwelcome head, like when Ruffalo hesitatingly turns on his car ignition and the camera pulls back for the expected explosion shot which doesn't come, plus did DuPont really fire-bomb a house to attempt to murder hostile witnesses and some of the speeches err on the sound of grandstanding or sound-bites but in the main Haynes lets the story itself drive the film and it's plenty big enough to do that. Haynes also doesn't posit a single figurehead of hate in the DuPont organisation as an easy mark for the viewer instead emphasising the facelessness of the imposing corporate enemy Bilott is taking on.Ruffalo of course played a not dissimilar role as a truth-seeker in ""Spotlight"" and he carries off the part here of the solitary indefatigable crusader with commendable veracity. He gets good support from a similarly dressed-down Anne Hathaway as his initially reactionary but later fully supportive wife, while behind them there's strong, unflashy support from the rest of the cast.The latest in a long line of Hollywood documentary-realism movies exposing high crimes and misdemeanours, taking in ""The Post"", ""Spotlight"", ""Erin Brockovich"" and the grandaddy of them all ""All The President's Men"" ""Dark Waters"" is a solidly commendable addition to that particular pantheon.",Dark Waters
17,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Interesting, engaging real life thriller",7,20 July 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1998, Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) is approached by Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp), a farmer from the small town he grew up in in West Virginia. Wilbur is a friend of Rob's mother, and his cows have been dying in his fields, which he believes is caused by overspill caused by the local landfill, owned and operated by chemical company Du Pont. Rob mentions this at a charity dinner to DuPont attorney Phil Donnelly (Victor Garber) and is met with hostility. Determined to get to the bottom of the matter, he encounters a dark truth behind the existence of DuPont's signature creation Teflon, and how the whole town may have been poisoned by the chemical C8 over the years.Of all the thriller catagories that appear on screen, the 'legal' thriller is one that has never really gained much mass appeal. Whilst John Grisham's novels have enjoyed some favorable translation to screen, that may be on account of being derived from the source material, but generally they're inevitably laden with legal jargon, alienating those not caught up in that world, leaving appeal only to those who are. With this in mind, Dark Waters is further constrained by being trapped within the confines of a true life tale, reducing any overly dramatic exposition or theatrical behaviours.Ironically, the film finds itself detailing real life events from 1998, in which one of only a few other such films I can remember, in the shape of another true life legal thriller, A Civil Action, was released (and is referenced somewhere in this film) which covered pretty similar themes. Both films emerge much the same way, interesting, distracting but ultimately forgettable, covering interesting events told in not the most exciting way. Director Todd Haynes saturates the whole thing in dark, gloomy lighting throughout, adding to the dull, grey feel of the events. An impressive supporting cast, including Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins and Bill Pullman, ultimately overshadow a typically over theatrical Ruffalo, hamming it up a bit in the lead.It's a competent, decent thriller, while you're not likely to need to see it twice, the shocking true life events it depicts will leave you as shattered and cynical as real life often does over fiction. Oh, and being set in that town, John Denver's classic 70s country anthem (about being Taken Home) is of course treated to a full blast, right out Ruffalo's car radio. ***",Dark Waters
18,MOscarbradley,An important story but a dull movie...,6,24 January 2020,"""Dark Waters"" may not seem the most likely subject matter for Todd Haynes. We're in ""Erin Brokovitch"" territory here rather than ""Far From Heaven"" for this is another fact-based, crusading problem picture and it's a good one...up to a point. It's based on an actual case where a young lawyer, (Mark Ruffalo, looking glum as well he might), working for a prestigious Cincinatti law firm who sued DuPont on behalf of a farmer, (Bill Camp, excellent), who claimed DuPont were poisioning his cattle and that was just the tip of the iceberg. It was a classic David versus Goliath scenario and Hayes, working with his usual cameraman Ed Lachman and a very good cast, (Tim Robbins, Anne Hathaway, Mare Winnigham, Bill Pullman, Victor Garber), has made a serious picture rather than a thriller. Unfortunately, as a piece of cinematic journalism, it's not in the same class as ""All the President's Men"" or ""Spotlight"" perhaps because we've seen it all before in one form or another. It's intelligent and well acted but it's more of a civics lesson than a real movie. Sometimes having your heart in the right place just isn't enough.",Dark Waters
19,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Toss out the Teflon!,7,1 March 2020,"'Dark Waters (2019)' is about an issue that affects us all. Essentially, it focuses on corporate greed placing money above people once again and it truly is vexing. Beyond its resonant real-life story, though, is a narrative that's as exhausting as it is engaging. It mimics the drawn-out legal process that inspired it, being built of a series of cyclical successes and failures. It's frustrating, then elating, then saddening and so on. Because of this, though, it has a relatively uneven pacing. At its best, it's riveting. Often, it's ever-so-slightly repetitive and, even, dull. Still, its highs make up for its lows; it's probably the best way this story could've been told. It does a good job with its potentially 'dry' material and is typically entertaining throughout.

20,ThomasDrufke,Ruffalo is One of the Best,7,17 December 2019,"One of the more forgotten films of 2019 (especially during awards season) is Dark Waters. A very, very good look at an underdog story about one of the most powerful corporations in the world and how they wronged the world (and may still be) by poisoning the water we all drink. Mark Ruffalo, returning to this investigative sub-genre after 2015's Spotlight, gives another terrific performance, and he's supported by several other noteworthy actors doing great work. I think in many ways this film could have been more satisfying if it was made in a few years as the case(s) against Dupont is quite frankly, still going on.

He starts a big fight against this company and he has to figure out what is going on with them and how he can win them.I liked this movie very much because it has an amazingly good and interesting plot, some outstanding interpretations made by its cast and a good direction made by Todd Haynes who did an excellent job. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to mention the interpretation of Mark Ruffalo who played as Rob Bilott and he was simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tim Robbins' who played as Tom Terp and Bill Camp's who played as Wilbur Tennant. To sum up, I have to say that ""Dark Waters"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because every person has to be informed by this movie for this scandal. I also believe that ""Dark Waters"" is an equally good movie as ""Spotlight"" of 2015 and ""Deepwater Horizon"" of 2016, which were also movies that presented some other scandals that everybody should be aware of.",Dark Waters

28,eddie_baggins,A solid but quiet drama lacking in big payoffs,7,17 June 2020,"Famed for his impressive dramas such as Carol and Far From Heaven, Dark Waters is further proof that director Todd Haynes can handle a serious tale as good as anyone, even if this based on a true story effort lacks the energy or verve to enhance it to any level above solid lawyer drama 101.A passion project for its lead actor Mark Ruffalo, who delivers an impressively dialed back turn as stoic and almost robotic Virginian raised lawyer Rob Billot, Haynes and his leading man explore the real life journey of Billot, who by chance ended up spending the better part of his career investigating and bringing to light the shady dealings of chemical company DuPont, who were seemingly knowingly putting its workers and wider community at risk through a series of careless decisions and practices.Covering an extensive time-frame from the late 90's deep into the 2000's, Dark Waters has a lot of ground to cover in its exploration of Billot's mission to uncover the truth about DuPont's dealings after Bill Camp's struggling farmer Wilbur Tennant comes into his offices and tells him about the possible DuPont cover ups that have affected his land and stocks health and it's in this aspect that Dark Waters struggles too really bring its narrative home as the film lacks any of those big moments we would expect from such an incendiary true life tale.Filmed throughout in an almost exclusively bleak and grey hue, the film feeling like it was born out of the All the Presidents Men 70's era of this type of procedural film, Dark Waters has barely a moment of respite from its own depressive dealings that covers Haynes directional effort which lacks any type of flair or vitality, instead comfortable to let its characters talk it out, noticeable in the films most extended exciting sequence that inter-cuts Billot talking to Anne Hathaway's short-changed wife Sarah about the findings he is uncovering about the DuPont company and other situations.In many ways the plain and bland execution suits this sombre story well but as a cinematic exercise it doesn't always allow Dark Waters to become the experience it may have been had more energy and attention been placed on its final product, as while its thought-provoking and well-acted (especially by scene stealing performances from Camp and a best in years Tim Robbins), you can't help but escape the feeling that an overwhelming sense on keeping everything very grounded also held Dark Waters back from becoming the next big true life justice tale.Final Say -You will walk away from Dark Waters with a different perspective on modern day companies and a likely look through your kitchen's utensils, yet while Haynes film is at all times watchable and other times utterly gripping, its lack of energy or enthusiasm makes for a bleak viewing experience.3 ½ blackened teeth out of 5",Dark Waters

32,paul-allaer,Mark Ruffalo shines in David v. Goliath legal battle,8,7 December 2019,"""Dark Waters"" (2019 release; 126 min.) brings the story of Cincinnati lawyer Rob Bilott's long legal battle against DuPont. As the movie opens, it is ""1975 Parkersburg, West Virginia"" as we see several teenagers (one of them a young Bilott) go swimming in a lake that we later see being sprayed with chemicals. We then go to ""1998 Cincinnati, Ohio"", and Rob has just made partner at Taft, one of the large law firms in Cincinnati. Then a stranger shows up who is from Parkersburg and knows Rob's grandmother. The stranger, Wilbur Tennant, claims that chemicals have ruined his farm, he has the VHS tapes to prove it, and can Rob please represent him.... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all turns out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Todd Haynes, whose prior movie, the excellent ""Carol"" was coincidentally also filmed here in Cincinnati (where I live). But that is where the comparisons stop. Here, Haynes brings to the big screen the long legal battle that Bilott fought against chemical giant DuPont. The film starts a bit tentative in my opinion, but after the first half hour, the tension doesn't let up as DuPont is fighting with all of its might against Bilott. This movie is a labor of love for Mark Ruffalo, who stars and also co-produces. I've seen a lot of the films that Ruffalo has made in his career, and I don't know that he's ever been better, playing the almost mousy yet determined lawyer. Anne Hathaway seems underused as the supportive spouse but as the movie goes deeper, her role expands. The movie was filmed in early 2019 in and around Cincinnati, and the downtown area is featured extensively, including Fountain Square, the Queen City Club, the Hall of Mirrors at the Netherland Plaza, etc.The movie had a red carpet premiere here in Cincinnati in mid-November, a week before it got a limited theater release. This weekend it got a wide release, and the Friday early evening screening where I saw it at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati was attended okay (about 20 people). This movie will surely create strong word of mouth, and if it manages to pick up some award nominations (as it is expected), this could have a decent run in the theaters. If you are interested in a tense legal drama where Mark Ruffalo shines, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",Dark Waters
33,subxerogravity,A so so story about never giving up I guess.,8,23 November 2019,"A plus for the filmmaker is that he used the entire screen to tell his story(not really a good thing for someone who likes sitting close the screen but...)
I got more of a tv show vibe from this movie rather than a movie. It was long with a lot to say and it moved from scene to scene like I was binge watching something on Netflix.
It's biggest crime was that it was boring due to the feeling that the movie was never going to end. A bit ironic as the purpose of the movie was about a man who kept fighting a uphill battle on a steep road.
Mark Rufflo was that man, but his quiet warrior persona, though very amusing at times that needed it was overall lackluster. Not enough pep in the step.
Tim Robbins gives a speech in the film that they give oscars for and though I felt the passion, the way it was film was very low key and it lost something as I watched it.
Overall, I like it. I like what it gave to me I like what I got from it, but it was a little bland in delivery.",Dark Waters
34,jtindahouse,Quite dry ironically,6,15 March 2020,"'Dark Waters' has the feel to me of a film that was made in an attempt to win awards (namely Academy Awards), but that came up well short. There are certain scenes put in the film for no purpose other than to give the actors an opportunity to make their case for a nomination. About halfway through the film I thought to myself, how did they sign Anne Hathaway to this role that has given her absolutely nothing to do? Then towards the end she gets a couple of scenes of passionate dialogue that feel extremely out of place and forced, but I assume had to be put there and left in the final cut in order for her to do the film. There's a lot of that type of carry on in the film.This is one of those films that you're glad you've seen after it's finished, but you're also glad you'll never have to sit through again. You know the story now and that is enough. It's a very dry and factual retelling. There are never any ""wow"" moments. Mark Ruffalo puts in a solid performance but nothing more. He doesn't have a lot of charisma and so his longer scenes can come across quite dull and feel like they're dragging.'Dark Waters' is a stark reminder of why I would never in this life want to be a lawyer. It just looks like the worst job in the world to me. I'm glad there are people out there doing it because it has to be done. They need to be commended for the amount of work that goes into what they do. I didn't dislike this film, I just had a difficult time connecting with it. It never gripped me or demanded my attention. It just kind of floated along and was happy to exist. See this film if you get the opportunity, because it is a story worth knowing, but don't go in with your expectations too high would be my advice.",Dark Waters

This is based on a true story about a chemical company-in this case, DuPont-that was dumping chemicals into landfills and rivers, which was causing all kinds of health problems for the local residents. And it was all because of greed-DuPont was making mucho profits. Mark plays a corporate defense lawyer that gets involved with a farmer-who knew Mark's grandmother-and the movie covers the time period from the 1970's until 2015. Tim plays Mark's boss at the law firm and he doesn't want Mark to get involved-at first-because DuPont is one of their clients. But Tim changes his mind after Mark starts showing him evidence of exactly what DuPont is knowingly doing. Anne is Mark's wife and Victor is the head of DuPont. It is an eye opening tale which helps explain lots of things going on in the world today, such as increasing cancer cases, deformed births, and lots of other medical problems. There were even sick and dying DuPont workers-well, they did work directly with the chemicals-that DuPont covered up.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for disturbing images and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 6 minutes.

36,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Dark Waters,7,21 March 2020,7/10 - very interesting true story that deserves more attention transfers pretty well to the film format,Dark Waters
37,alindsay-al,A Good Important Story,7,20 November 2020,"So this film came out earlier this year, but never came to the cinema near me and then we got to the pandemic so I never got the chance to watch Dark Waters, but the film has just made its way to Amazon Prime and I watched it last night and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a corporate defence attorney take on an environmental lawsuit against a chemical company that exposes a history of pollution.Main Character
Mark Ruffalo plays the main character here and he does a great job here, the man is just a great actor and he shows it in this film. You do care about his character and you are behind him the entire way, he just conveys a movie star and he makes the story feel really large stakes and that is mainly due to a really quality lead performance here.Supporting Characters
This has a really great supporting cast in it, Anne Hathaway plays his wife in the film and she is good. I mean there are times when I feel like she is underutilised but when she is on screen she has strong scenes and I thought the relationship was well presented here. Tim Robbins plays his boss and he is really good, they have a good working relationship in the film and there is one scene in particular where he goes off and gives a really great dramatic scene. Bill Camp is the one who hires Ruffalo and he gives a strong performance, you can tell just how much the whole thing affects him and how frustrated he is by the whole situation. You really feel for him and want to see him do okay and you just want Ruffalo to help him out. Victor Garber & Bill Pullman are great in their smaller roles, especially Pullman who steals the show in his 5 minutes and provides some great moments.Story
The story is based on true events, though I'm sure the odd bits have been added for glamour but it feels like a story that needed to be told as I like a lot of people didn't know about this story before this film. The film does a great job in showing just how serious this whole situation was and how hard Ruffalo's character worked to expose the chemical industry and raise this very serious situation. However, I would say that this film struggled in terms of how it told its story, the film takes place over 13 years but it doesn't do a great job of showing that. In a few minutes years pass in the film but the characters seem to be in the same space and doing the same thing and it struggles to keep you invested especially in the latter halves of the film, also the end of the film introduces a new part of the story and then just ends, I felt like it would have been way more interesting but you never see it. It feels like to get this whole story told, this should have been a longer film or even a mini series to document the whole story.Script
The script is fine, there are some really good dramatic scenes in this film that make you care and make you realise the talent that is on show here. But there aren't really any humanising scenes here, and what I mean is that every scene is so dramatic that it feels a bit too much at times and makes these people not seem real even though the whole situation is very real. Also as I mentioned above, I don't feel the script was written particularly well in terms of the way it conveys the story and the plot.Style
The style of the film is very heavy and does a really good job in showcasing the horrors that are going on in this film and make you buy into the situation and fully support our protagonist. The film is interesting, but it also feels like important parts of the plot are glossed over, because they have to in order to keep the runtime down and it does hurt the pacing making it feel a slower pace which hurts the film.Overall
Overall, this is a good film with an important story and filled with great performances. If you are a fan of gritty, real films with important stories then this could be a film for you.",Dark Waters

When a company is making a $1 billion a year profit from just one of it's products then it will have deep pockets to defend itself. In 1998 Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) was a corporate lawyer who had been just made a partner in firm which specialised in defending chemical companies. Then a farmer neighbour of his grandmother called with a strange tale of dead and diseased cattle. Thus began a journey for Bilott both physical, moral, psychological and professional. It would consume his life for years, cost him money and almost his marriage. After the case moved on to the mass poisoning of people through water pollution, DuPont tried to bury him in paperwork and suborned the west Virginia State Government to change water Safety Standards.The narrative of this film is best explained through observing what happened to Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp) the farmer, His cows were developing tumors and dying, he was suffering from mysterious ailments. As the case progressed his house was burgled, records stolen, DuPont helicopters circled his house constantly. Becoming crazed he threatened them with a shotgun. Great performance from camp as he has to shoot a crazed cow which charges him.

42,masonfisk,A DESCENT INTO A COVER-UP...!,7,23 January 2020,"Todd Haynes' (Far from Heaven/Velvet Goldmine) latest is a standard little man versus a big corporation legal thriller involving the Dupont company & the lawyer who sued them. Mark Ruffalo stars as a company attorney who gets a case brought to him by a friend of his grandmother's played by du jour character actor Bill Camp. It turns out Dupont, the chemical concern, bought space on his land to dump waste from their plants as a result of the manufacture of Teflon, a compound most people know is used in nonstick pans but once the run off of this substance gets into the land & water, it can cause birth defects, certain types of cancer & most direly, death. A consummate purveyor of finer details, Ruffalo scrounges for the truth (Dupont at first buries him w/reams of documents hoping to discourage his investigation) uncovering the sobering fact Dupont has known about the effects for years but did nothing about it. Haynes, always a creator of interesting art films, plays it straight here (much like Gus Van Sant did when Good Will Hunting fell into his lap) & comes up w/a decent if altogether standard legal potboiler not unlike something John Grisham may've cooked up in his heyday. Nothing revelatory abounds here w/the supporting performances by Tim Robbins, Anne Hathaway, Victor Garber & Bill Pullman all aces across the board. I give kudos for the heroics on display but the over-familiarity of the material keeps it from rising above other stories of its ilk.",Dark Waters

Mark Ruffalo leads the cast as lawyer Rob Bilott, and provides quite an impressive performance. The film is also packed with a pretty impressive cast in general, with its supporting cast of Anne Hathaway, Bill Pullman, and Bill Camp providing the best of the performances. The script is very intelligent, conveying all its information with a brilliant adamant tone, that is truly inspiring. That being said, the film can be a bit dull to watch at times, with the pacing slowing to a crawl at times. However, even with its slow nature, Dark Waters is able to tell its story at an impressive feat, by keeping it well natured, well acted, and incredibly thought provoking, without ever shoving an overabundance of information down the audiences throats. In the end, Dark Waters can be slow at times, but it's an incredibly smart film, and impressive work from Director Haynes, Ruffalo, and all involved.

47,AudioFileZ,They (Dupont) Likely Killed More People Than Hitler's Regime,8,4 May 2020,"If there ever was a company that literally killed for profits Dupont would likely be at the top of that list. What is worse is their internal knowledge of the dangers to health many of their products had great potential to cause. Why would any entity do such beyond greed? Because with immense money comes hubris and grandiosity. In other words...""we're untouchable""/Dark Waters is an excellent drama based on the real legal fight to expose Dupont's deadly Teflon product itself as well as it's myriad disease inducing by-products. In the film you feel the sense of futility in taking on the behemoth corporation whose deep-pockets and callous maneuvering often seemed impenetrable. Mark Ruffalo is perfect as the reluctant, yet dogged, attorney who suffered through over a decade and myriad downturns to expose Dupont's criminal negligence. You feel a bit of the turmoil and pain just watching the man as he suffers his own declining health in the bargain. This is a screenplay sans Hollywood posturing and bombast. It feels honest as it shows the constant struggle to a finish line with the slimmest of chances for victory. The supporting cast is no slouch either. Tim Robbins as Ruffalo's boss is excellent. It should also be noted the producers have included some of the real people who suffered under the umbrella Dupont Corporation cast.In closing though there was a reckoning of sorts one might call an ultimate victory we're reminded Dupont made for years over a billion dollars profit from just Teflon. Teflon, a product I'd say almost 100% of us let into our homes using to our detriment unknowingly. The fact that most of us have elements of this product in our blood feels like a crime of unprecedented proportions. I can truly say this film made me disgusted with hate for Dupont.

A thrilling case that took years to build is given great detail to help explain everything happening, while also moving to keep you engaged. The acting and multiple aspects really do the film justice and give everyone the chance to act to their top game. It's true it still is subjected to overdramatization at times, but it's kept in check to keep things spicy and appeal to the drama seeking nature that is humanity. I'd have liked a few more elements added to give a better visualization of the corrupt companies, while also giving Anne Hathaway more time to shine, but overall I'm very happy with this. I feel this film will go under the radar, and to be honest, only the engaging story and acting will attract a theater watch for most. However, if you are able to catch this at home or Redbox take the 2 hours to uncover the revolutionizing story that is still going on today.My scores are:Biography/Drama/History: 8.0 - 8.5
Movie Overall: 7.0",Dark Waters
51,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Dark Waters,8,7 December 2019,"""You tell me nothing is wrong here"". Okay, it's true. Nothing is wrong with 2019's Dark Waters. Heck, it's one of the best and most monomania films of this year.""Waters"", while harboring a look of grubbiness and a subject matter that's equally as grubby, is a terrific true story drama, a naturalistic sort of documentary, and an effective, low key paranoia thriller to boot.In verity, if you like the dreary temperament of North Country, the investigative candor of Erin Brockovich, the exhaustion of A Civil Action, or 2015's Spotlight, then Dark Waters will effectively put you in cinematic harm's way. It's about a corporate defense attorney who brings forth a lawsuit involving the famed chemical company named DuPont. DuPont is a large corporation that makes Teflon and Teflon might be responsible for many unexplained deaths.Dialogue driven, perfectly acted, and maturely directed by LA native Todd Haynes, ""Waters"" runs 128 minutes and spans almost two decades.The towns of Cincinnati, OH and Parkersburg, WV are featured in ""Waters"" as they appear like dreary landscapes waiting for the hellhole slaughter. Cows and people are dying, snow and fall skies are evident, and teeth of animals/humans are staining. Yup, Dark Waters is not meant for your entertainment or your feel-good constitution. It's meant to seep into your movie-goer's central nervous system while staying there.As you view Dark Waters, you might adopt a fear of contaminated water. And I'm not talking about the kind of water where a certain great white shark is lingering or a trip to Mexico is calling. You'll also revel in the mesmerizing performances by Mark Ruffalo (he disappears into character via defense attorney Robert Bilott), Anne Hathaway (Bilott's intense wife), and Tim Robbins (Bilott's equally intense superior).All in all, Dark Waters will garner multiple conspiracies and multiple Academy Award nominations this coming January (that's my prediction). ""Hands (and hooves) across these waters"". Rating: 3 and a half stars.",Dark Waters
52,vengeance20,Good Film,7,29 February 2020,"While not amazing, it was a pretty interesting story about a one mans journey to uncovering a dark & sinister revelation regarding the water system being polluted by a chemical known as C-8. Which long story short, is a chemical found in everyday objects, home appliances, products etc. Etc. But because the company, Dupont makes 75 Billion they think they're above it all & think nobody can touch them, despite the 100's of thousands of cases against them for negligence.While the plot is thin & simple. It is alright given that the whole film relies on the edge of your seat aspect alone.A lot of interesting facts & revelations come to light in this film. It does lock you in despite its 2hr & 2min runtime.Overall a good film. 7/10",Dark Waters
53,valadas,A great fight,8,23 January 2020,"The powerful company DuPont that runs consuming water business with a plant in Cincinatti, Ohio, has been polluting water for many years with a chemical called PFOA that proves to be greatly dangerous to human health and has inclusively caused some deaths. The defense attorney Robert Bilott starts a fight against that company which includes judicial proceedings, The movie shows it with every detail in an excellent realistic way with all characters performed by excellent actors which galvanizes us as viewers till its end. One of the best 2019 movies.",Dark Waters
54,krocheav,Dark Waters - Fact Based Expose,8,30 May 2021,"If only half of this expose about a poisonous product is true, then it represents a shocking betrayal of any consumer trust - a direct result of the manufacture of Teflon coating for non-stick cooking - while poisoning people, is a shockingly serious subject indeed. Mark Ruffalo does well portraying prizewinning real-life environmental lawyer Robert Bilott, who spent 20years pursuing DuPont for its reckless dumping of highly poisonous; PFOA and PFOS, toxic chemical waste - as used in the manufacturing of Teflon coated cookware, paint, etc - alarmingly, 90% of people will have these chemicals in their bodies!The film is stylishly made and features an evocative music score by Brazilian Marcelo Zarvos. Well worth watching to understand just what corporate greed can produce in terms of human health and ultimate life-threatening contamination - not to mention corrupt governments and their employees! Several of the real-life victims are featured telling their own dramatic stories.",Dark Waters
55,Muhammad_Rafeeq,American ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10,10,10 January 2021,"Extremely important movie about one of the most important subjects today - the fact that companies are largely unregulated, and the motivation to make money results in them doing extremely unethical things that end up severely harming us all. This movie presented this in an appealing way, and demonstrated the extreme difficulty of holding companies responsible .",Dark Waters
56,arungeorge13,A moving legal drama led by a splendid Ruffalo and some solid writing! [+71%],7,5 April 2020,"Mark Ruffalo stars in a well-written, well-directed, and well-acted legal drama that's a shining example of how corporates treat people (and entire communities) like test-objects to satiate their financial objectives. Director Todd Haynes attributes a turquoise-ish color tone for much of the film, constantly reminding viewers how something as clear as water can slowly kill you from within when tampered with.The film is as much an account of the company in question's diabolical disregard for humanity, as it is Rob Billott's (an excellent Ruffalo). We get a deep-dive into the significant events starting in 1998 that lead to intriguing findings in the subsequent years, with sufficient drama packed in for storytelling purposes. Anne Hathaway, Bill Camp, and Tim Robbins deliver memorable performances. In the latter half of the movie, Rob starts to lose grip over his family life, and his case heads nowhere due to no fault of his. This stretch, while some may shrug off as lagging, was wonderfully portrayed in my opinion.For a legal drama, the courtroom scenes aren't exactly the most striking. What transpires behind the closed doors of meeting rooms and cubicles raises the thrills more often than the prosecution itself. A simple fact-check (on Google) can tell you how much of what's shown in the film is exactly how things went down in that gloomy West Virginian community. Knowing that can only make your heart weep - for yourself and for the world around you!",Dark Waters
57,martimusross,Dry As Dust Corporate Corruption Movie,6,18 February 2020,"Dark WatersI enjoyed this movie overall but it is a dry as dust biopic about a large drug company's abuse of power over many years, so it will not be everyone's cup of tea. Set in a small rural town in deepest Virginia these little guys had little chance against the might of an international conglomerate defending it's reputation with unlimited financial resources. This was a carefully constructed movie from start to finish, it breathed in all the right places, with strong central performances and we were spoilt by other strong cameo performances. I do object to overtly political movies, and this movie was careful not to be so, it was (I would hope) largely revealing an historical abuse of corporate power.I see a formula to these movies emerging, combined with a lack of action and repetitious scenes.small guy complains,
concerns brushed off,
someone champions cause,
mountains of paperwork,
long hours,
families under pressure,
court case,
finally wins in court,
compensation,
photos of real people.This is perhaps the 4th movie in 6 months unveiling corporate corruption, I'm getting bored.The acting was good, Mark Ruffallo is meticulous in his craft but his technical proficiency prevents an emotional attachement to the viewer, perhaps it is me, but he fails to move me and lacks charisma, and when this is juxtaposed with the performances of both Tim Robbins and Anne Hathaway who totally dominated their scenes, with suspressed anger, frustration and raw emotion, it just all happened behind the eyes the micro gestures. The movie is worth watching for Tim Robbins alone for his complex interpretation of a conflicted lawyer trying to support his friend and colleague.Of course, behind all these cases lies unchecked capitalism that followed from all the markets opening up under Reagan and Thatcher, this was a unique time in history when for the first time we had the beginning of globalised markets with companies truly spanning international borders without any effective external supervision of their operations. Let us hope that slowly scrutiny and regulation bites at the greatest excesses of these monopolistic companies but I am sure there is more to uncover.",Dark Waters
58,michaeltrivedi,Really Good Stuff Here,7,10 September 2020,"I enjoyed this movie. Really dark corporate thriller drama. Good stuff. The main actor plays his role really well. It's got a dark atmosphere which I crave in movies.Really good time. Got boring well into the film towards the end, but good.Recommended. Perhaps highly, I have to watch it again.7 stars",Dark Waters
59,antoniotierno,Excellent,9,19 October 2020,"Dark Waters is entirely believable, it is about the slow, horrifying discovery of what a chemical company has done for decades. Haynes pumps the film so that it becomes full of paranoia and isolation, so that it matches the sensations experienced by the real protagonists (it is based upon a true story). As Bilott, Ruffalo could have amped up the glamour by playing a hotshot in order to flatter his A-list activist credentials (he also produced the film). But here, he deflates himself. He's sullen and awkward in his movements - when the stress piles up, his hands starts to violently shake. He doesn't present Bilott as an hero, but as a man who's been awakened to the world of moral decency, only to be rewarded with powerlessness and ineffectual anger. A part of thr mission is driven by the loyalty to his small-town roots, though his enemies soon use it as a weapon against him. Overall a masterpiece.",Dark Waters
60,kevin c,a film for our COVID-19 times,8,8 March 2020,"Legal, procedural a la All The Presidents Men, Spotlght stuff. Slow, and very rarely looking to win the audience over. Loved it.A 20-year tale, but has the grainy 70's look throughout. This is murky, dimly lit office stuff. Washed out towns and bleak, desolate farms. Haynes' film is beset by paranoia and isolation.Ruffalo is very understated. Sullen and shuffling, with a stress-induced shaking arm. Hathaway is better than the ""concerned wife"" role, and Robbins does his best work in years.It never ends on the courtroom high you're expecting, but instead is a 20-year journey displaying the power of empathy.",Dark Waters
61,muamba_eats_toast,Equally terrifying as it is angering but oh so powerful,10,29 February 2020,For me whilst he's already a big name Mark Ruffalo is one of the most underrated actors around and this was just another example of why. Whilst many associate him with the hulk he is so so exceptional in so many other roles. Whilst the supporting cast was also great much like his character he carries the film emotionally from beginning to end a real powerhouse performance in a completely gripping film from beginning to end. Utterly terrifying knowing this is still happening to each of us today in the name of profit.,Dark Waters
62,drjgardner,Must See,9,10 December 2019,"Great acting and a great story - what more can you want. Perhaps a happy story because this story is over whelming. A large company knowingly uses war technology to destroy the lives of animals, people, and communities in the name of the mighty buck. We can take solace in the fight to expose them, but the facts of this case are so distressing.Mark Ruffalo, Tim Robbins, an d Victor Garber are exceptional, but the star of the film is Bill Camp in the performance of a lifetime.",Dark Waters
63,sergelamarche,"Beware, marvelous chemicals",9,14 January 2021,"Super film about the fight against Dupont, the maker of teflon, that caused so much pain because the production was getting rid of toxic chemicals unhealthily. We follow the lawyer that started the lawsuit up to the end. Gripping, with cameos from many of the people involved. Very serious matter treated very seriously.",Dark Waters
64,agmoldham,My Kind of Film,6,27 March 2020,"I have to confess a liking to this type of film. Dark Waters tells the story of a lawyer taking on a big corporation. The Insider is definitely one of my favourite films and Dark Waters has a very similar theme.Mark Ruffalo plays Rob Bilott who is the lawyer taking on the lawsuit in a seemingly small case. He realizes that the case is much bigger and more important than he originally thought. The big corporation has unlimited resources to win the case though, so it places Bilott under incredible stress.Whilst it isn't my favourite example of this genre I certainly enjoyed the movie. Anyone who likes the genre should enjoy Dark Waters.",Dark Waters
65,Danusha_Goska,"Gripping and Fascinating Glimpse into Evil, Virtue, and Our Own Bodies",10,1 December 2019,"Hey! I want you to see a movie about toxic waste and a deadly, manmade chemical that is, right now, inside your body, like a timebomb, and will possibly someday cause you or your loved ones to contract cancer or endocrine disorders!No, really, it's a good movie. ""Dark Waters"" had my attention throughout, and it wasn't depressing as one might think. That's because the center of the film is a real hero, Robert Bilott, a high-priced lawyer who sacrificed much of his personal and professional life, and his health, to researching the deadly chemical, DuPont's manipulation of the public, and to getting some financial compensation for victims.Bilott's own book is titled ""Exposure: Poisoned Water, Corporate Greed, and One Lawyer's Twenty-Year Battle against DuPont."" That title offers a good plot summary.Mark Ruffalo stars as Robert Bilott. Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp), a dairy farmer from Bilott's grandmother's West Virginia hometown, asks Bilott to discover why his cows are dying horrible deaths. Another lawyer might walk away, But Bilott, urged on by Tennant, does research and discovers that DuPont, as part of the manufacture of Teflon pans, produces a chemical that harms and kills humans, that never breaks down, and that is found, now, in the bodies of virtually all living things on earth, including humans.DuPont knew this but hid the information. Bilott's research uncovered DuPont's own extensive reports that detailed exactly how the chemical damaged human bodies. Bilott is shown meeting with DuPont employees who talk frankly about working on Teflon and giving birth to defective babies and needing to have hysterectomies.A few of the real people involved in this horror show appear in the film. These include William ""Bucky"" Bailey who was born with one nostril and a deformed eye. He had over thirty surgeries during his childhood. In a YouTube video, Bucky talks about his fears of fathering his own children. He was told he might pass his deformities on.I grew up near DuPont sites in New Jersey. Higher rates of cancer are reported there. Four members of my immediate family died from cancer and I've had cancer twice. Even so, I was compelled by and appreciated this movie. Watching the dedication of Robert Bilott and his tireless efforts was refreshing. The script and direction maintain a fast pace and I was never bored. In fact the film is a fascinating glimpse into power, the legal system, the rigors of research, evil, and virtue. I didn't have time to sink into despair.",Dark Waters
66,markthomassintek,if your pan was bought before 2015 throw it away!,10,5 March 2020,"REVIEW - DARK WATERSRecently we have seen a deluge of various horror films with varying degrees of scary but for me the ultimate scary movie is one based or actually telling a true story.This is such a film!In your kitchen cabinet you may have a Teflon pan which is none stick, if your pan was bought before 2015 throw it away!Watching this film is truly scary because 98% of all humans now have C8 in their bodies (no spoilers) but I really can't urge you enough to watch this film!Proof that companies put profit before the lives of 98% of all human and animal life!1 person can make a difference and we all owe so much to 1 man!A must watch, slow in places but very easy to follow and follow it until the end, the very end and read the writing on the screen at the very end!Rating 10 out of 10",Dark Waters
67,allanmichael30,Teflon Man,8,15 November 2020,"Just like the Teflon repels water, Rob Bilott stood up for the little guy and repels all the pressure from the giant corporation Dupont, he read 110000 pages of information they gave him by mistake and managed to prove they were to blame as it was full of information on studies and found out PFSO was perfluorooctanoic acid and used in manufacturing of Teflon. It does not matter what they did to try and stop him he still goes on, he managed to at least get some damages from the corporation after 100,000 plus people were affected. The United States Environmental Protection Agency blamed the farmer for animals ill health until full facts were public. What are PFAS? In the WORLDS WATERS? in our blood?
This film was a hard watch and an eye opener and not first time I have heard about these chemicals. I thought it's going to be sorted out but it's not, it took time to remove CFC and protect ozone. People used to drink water with bacteria that made them ill, but we today have high standards for water purification is what we believe. If we don't know where these chemicals are used or safe levels then the problem is just that and they are not regulated.",Dark Waters
68,pietclausen,Seen it all before,4,18 January 2020,"Dark Waters is a morbid version of a much more absorbing tale of fighting big corporations, who knowingly pollute water, causing illnesses, deformities and finally death. That movie is Erin Brockovich made in 2000.Dark Waters is actually boring to watch, especially the first hour, but livens up a bit in the last hour. Having seen it all before, the best rating I can give Dark Waters is only a 4.",Dark Waters
69,springfieldrental,Rare Hollywood Film Tackling Big Corp,8,8 December 2019,"There is a small group of films that have taken on big corporations who have destroyed a large number of lives. Count Dark Waters as being placed in that elite genre which describes a lone (ironically) corporate lawyer who takes on chemical giant DuPont.
In this semi-documentary dramatic work, the case against DuPont in poisoning the water, land and air in and near its facilities--and extensively throughout the world--is overwhelmingly strong. One thread going through my mind while watching Dark Waters is how DuPont will react to this onslaught of evidence against them (Apparently, according one PBS article, the company has a lot of ""legal folks"" looking into this movie, but it doesn't want to drive more attention to the story.).
It's tough to make a several-year span lawyerly-driven movie ultra-exciting, but the M.M. Carnahan script provides enough visual stimuli (like the massive document discovery provided by DuPont that fills a large room) to move the story forward. Mark Ruffalo's steady demeanor is countered by Anne Hathaway's occasionally over the top histrionics that show the emotional toll one man was undergoing in his battle against DuPont.
Well worth your while to know how much PFOA's (via Teflon, etc) we all are carrying inside of us because of DuPont's lack of honesty.",Dark Waters
70,kuarinofu,Important if a little boring and overly long,7,6 February 2020,"I've never heard of the events portrayed in the film (probably cause I live in the Eastern Europe). I was quite unpleasantly surprised to know that corporate conspiracy theories they love to turn into films are actually closer than I thought.I'm not sure that this film was helpful to me, but I'm glad that now I know a little more about state regulations when it comes to protecting your health in the modern world. I'm pretty sure that in my country my health is constantly in danger and there is no way I would ever be able to take any sort of legal action about it. Makes you really appreciate the rule of law when you see one (even with all the corruption that wasn't shown in the film itself for some reason).As for the film itself, it was a little too long and quite boring at times, Ruffalo's acting was confusing but Hathaway can't act at all so it was fine in comparison. I appreciate the fact that they've included real people who were involved, especially Bucky Bailey and Rob Bilott himself. I actually thought that Bucky was a character created for the screenplay but no, he is real.Sometimes you feel like you're reading a book and not watching a film, a less textual adaption would've been better in my opinion. Also, the motivations of other lawyers were too idealistic, I mean, Tim Robbins' monologue about duty wasn't believable at all. I mean, in the real world, money is still a thing. Also, the company (companies) are never portrayed as evil, which is both good and bad. A more evil huge company would've been better for the story, but in reality, they were only protecting their investments and profits they are making in total and complete disregard for the safety of the people. They also never felt that menacing or allpowerful.Overall, I'd recommend this film for at least one viewing. It's not super deep or groundbreaking, but it shows just how many things affect our health and some of these we aren't even aware of (yet).",Dark Waters
71,JohnRayPeterson,"As many other reviewers mentioned, it IS a MUST SEE bio-drama.",9,23 March 2020,"Like the movies 'Erin Brokovich', 'Silkwood', 'Rainmaker', to name the ones best known for corporate corruption relating to deadly pollution and cover-ups, this one is also based on a true story and delivered quite a punch.As a drama, it does deliver what dramas are suppose to, but it's also about a real story, that of lawyer Robert Bilott who took on the gargantuan task of sewing the giant 'Dupont' corp.; this was over a decade in the making. The horrific and perverted details of the company's wrong doing was laid out clearly and in detail. The film is about Bilott's journey, a courageous and passionate mission, one which could have and nearly did cost the man's career. What we discover is what Bilott did and in the sequence of how it was learned. Mark Ruffalo, playing the main character, did a splendid job conveying both his caring and his devotion for the little guy, despite being a corporate law attorney. The timeline was easy to follow and follow one does; you can't walk away from the screen. It was good movie and made my top ten list for 2019 motion pictures.It was an education as well; after it was over I was compelled to look up the chemical PFOA, one few people knew about before Bilott's diligence, not even the EPA. That agency as well as two other federal agencies dropped the ball after being put on notice by Bilott of the danger to the public health. Of course, he won the case few if any would have and we sort of expected that given the movie genre and the examples cited at the beginning here.Now I'll refer to the movie's epilogue stated facts; those are plastered while the movie credits scroll. Bilott won his first three court decisions against the giant Dupont company, for $1.6Million, the second for $5.6M and the third for $12.5M before the class action he championed was decided in the amount of $670.7Million for 3,535 remaining individuals. PFOA is now believed to be present in virtually every creatures' blood on the planet and certainly 99% of humans.PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) is what's called a forever chemical, you can't rid yourself of its accumulation. It's one of 600 identified such chemicals, toxic in as low as 70ppt (parts per trillion) and most all are unregulated because government health monitoring and regulating agencies can't keep up with the chemical companies.The movie hits us hard, it must make all of us ponder and it should motivate us all to take these matters seriously and to elect politicians who are not owing to the corporations because like the Dupont company was painted in this movie have the system rigged. I will not forget this movie any time soon, nor will you.",Dark Waters

73,virek213,Corporate Malfeasance That Borders On Corporate Homicide,10,1 January 2020,"In recent decades, particularly since the horror that erupted on 9/11, more than a few dramatic movies have dealt with real-life events and/or social issues in ways that are often so engaging that they supersede most Hollywood blockbusters. Some of the very best deal with the kind of rampant corporate malfeasance that goes on when there are few or no regulations in place to protect the people that these corporations have a tendency to harm with all-too-painful regularity. DARK WATERS is one of those films.Mark Ruffalo portrays Robert Billott, a Cincinnati-based attorney who is part of a law firm that represents dozens of multi-billion dollar corporations, the biggest not only in America but the world at large as well. But when he hears about a farmer in his own hometown of Parkersburg, West Virginia who has lost nearly two hundred head of cows because they drank from toxically polluted water, he wades into the situation (albeit reluctantly at first) and discovers that one of the companies he has represented in his time, no less than DuPont, is the corporation whose dumping of their toxic waste is responsible for not having only killed livestock, but poisoning and/or severely deforming almost everybody there in Parkersburg, nearly seventy thousand in all. Combing through documents dating all the way back to the 1970s, he learns that some of this poisoning may be connected to a very well-known product, that DuPont created back in the early 1960s (everyone will know all too well what the name of that product is), and is in practically everything in every home in the United States, including pots and pans. The toll it took on him and his family, including the relationship with his wife (portrayed by Anne Hathaway) was almost too much for him (he ended up in the hospital for a time); but he kept on fighting for the people in his town, getting blood samples from everyone tested to be used as evidence of DuPont's corporate malfeasance, which virtually bordered on corporate homicide.Based on Nathaniel Rich's article ""The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare"" that appeared in the New York Times Magazine in 2016, DARK WATERS is quite well directed by Todd Haynes (I'M NOT THERE; WONDERSTRUCK), and co-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan (LIONS FOR LAMBS; DEEPWATER HORIZON). Ruffalo, who portrayed one of the Boston Globe reporters in the much-acclaimed 2015 drama SPOTLIGHT, ably portrays Billott in a way that gives us a glimpse into his way of thinking that, just by having represented DuPont in his time, he himself may have been somewhat responsible for the years-long poisoning of his own hometown, even if only indirectly. The atmosphere conjured up by Haynes is not too dissimilar to what we saw in ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, SPOTLIGHT, or THE POST, one that is decidedly sinister, shadowy and arguably corrupting. Tim Robbins, well known for his highly liberal political beliefs, does a good job of playing Ruffalo's partner in the firm, who is initially extremely reluctant to take his side but then does when the facts about DuPont become too big to ignore. Mare Winningham is also good as one of Parkersburg's many residents who have to face what the town's biggest employer has been doing to then for decades.While it may seem all too common for movies to take what may seem like potshots at multi-billion dollar conglomerates, when they do the wrong thing (which seems to happen all too frequently, as it did with DuPont), then those wrongs have to have a light shone on them. This is what DARK WATERS does; and as a result, it was one of the best films released in 2019.",Dark Waters
74,SoumikBanerjee25,A film that everyone must see!,8,1 February 2021,"""Dark Waters"" is a communal Drama, that delineates a colossal deceit done by a chemical company named 'DuPont' that consequently bears amenability for the people afflicted by an array of emanating adversities. Contemplating lawyer Rob Bilott's contribution in this case; it goes on to showcase how arrant greed and plain ignorance can make lots of innocent people suffer endlessly.I simply adore it when films discuss real world issues. Every so often it needs the medium of entertainment to put through imperative information that must be relayed to us; the general public. It takes bravery, fortitude & an extensive fact-finding to support the claims that are being put forward!Based on a true event that brought on life threatening health complications to a section of people from the state of West Virginia. The story accompanies an engrossing journey of the lawyer Rob Bilott and his relentless pursuit of justice for over a decade.Exquisitely acted by none other than Mark Ruffalo; one of his career best performance indeed. We also become acquainted with Anne Hathaway as his wife Sarah Bilott; unmistakably another notable act from a well acknowledged performer!Aside from exemplary acts & a meritorious base material; the film also shines in its technicalities. Under Todd Haynes's keen supervision, it essays a gloomy, forlorn tonal treatment; aptly conforming with its overall somber & doleful setting.A tristful & nuanced Soundscore grasping upon our conscience right from its inception. Albiet the Screenplay was in need of a more appropriate alacrity, chiefly after the second act commenced. Where it gets a little bit enervated cause of trifling ineptitude that was deep-seated within its writing.Without going into much details about the incidents that took place in the plot; I must say there are some invaluable lessons for us to learn.
For instance, how we as commoners could join forces for the greater interest of our society.Inspite of any country you are currently a citizen of, you shouldn't think too little of the magnitude you have within yourself. It's your legal right to protest against such malfeasance, misconducts.

75,maccas-56367,An important film with strong Ruffalo performance,8,22 August 2020,"Gritty but effective in the way the story unravels over such a long period. Mark Ruffalo delivers an excellent performance (as usual) playing the determined lawyer Robert Bilott.This is an important film. You clearly feel the passion of everyone involved, and how they want to do the story justice. Its this passion and attention to detail which ultimately drew me in. Despite a sluggish start, I eventually found myself both engrossed and terrified as things unfolded. Tim Robbins also reminds us of his impressive acting chops with a particular board room monologue.Comparisons to Erin Brockovich are likely, and it certainly shares numerous things in common. This felt more ""international"" though, seemingly impacting everyone everywhere. It was that aspect, along with the plight of those directly affected in West Virginia, that really hit home the emotional stakes.The facts presented at the end were particularly alarming, and it leaves you wanting to research more (the story is unfinished after all). Despite its by-the-numbers feel and long length, Dark Waters still managed to captivate me on the back of strong performances and its important subject matter.Special mention of Bucky Bailey, for the best movie cameo I've seen in ages.",Dark Waters
76,0w0,8/10 For the movie. -3/10 for DuPont,8,9 February 2020,"DuPont actually changed the name of their company in 2017. Even right now, if you google 'DuPont' then the wikipedia page for their NEW company comes up and the wikipedia page is completely clean with NO MENTION of the evil deeds that they've done. You have to actually google 'old dupont' in order for the correct wikipedia page to come up with all the evil deeds that DuPont has done. It's all very disgusting tbh.Anyway... the movie is good. I wouldn't say it's as good as 'The Big Short' but it still gets the message across and delivers the information that you want to see. I hardly recognised Anne Hathaway though (they made her look ugly). Both Hathaway and Mark Ruffalo deliver good performances and they even have a few of the ORIGINAL people in the movie as actors, which I really like in docu-movies like this.Overall it's a fine film and it left me even more angry than I was previously at huge chemical companies and the evil things they've done over the years (like Monsanto, DuPont, Bayer, etc).",Dark Waters
77,RussHog,DuPond Chemicals = CANCELLED,8,4 January 2021,"I liked the first hour and half of this film a lot - when Mark Ruffalo's character was younger and first getting into the case against DuPont Chemicals. The story of the farm that was poisoned and how he uncovered the extent of the conspiracy was really interesting and informative. Made me realize just how much some big businesses abuse people. As the film goes on it stretches into several years in the future and a lot of stuff is covered really fast. Still, I enjoyed the movie a lot and I recommend it.",Dark Waters
78,Alexander_Blanchett,Important story.,7,29 January 2020,"Solid film with a very important topic and some rather shocking revelations that are not too familiar to the world. Todd Haynes created a fine film about a lawyer breaking all boundaries to get justice. A typical theme but still an new real case. The film is bleak. Very bleak. Fitting the mood of the leading character very well played by Mark Ruffalo... although you could blame him to be a bit too monotone at times.
He did have his moments though, especially towards the end. Anne Hathaway is okay but the role is a bit wasted for a huge star like her. She really tried hard for that second Oscar nomination, though. You could really see her acting wheels turning in her head. Not a very natural performance unfortunately. Tim Robbins was good but the best performance came hands down from Bill Camp. He stole every scene he was in and gave a very memorable turn. The score is good, the screenplay decent. I found the film dragged too much despite having those shocking revelations. Still important to see but not easy to sit through.",Dark Waters
79,apryla-58795,Kept me up most of the night doing more research,10,16 February 2021,This was such a great film. It was more like a very horrifying documentary. I cannot believe I never knew about this and that it's not being talked about more. I went through all my pots and pans the very next morning after watching this and threw out two of them...but at this late in the game it won't do any good in the long run as the damage has already been done. I stayed up most of the night feeling sick to my stomach.It's terrifying to know that DuPont is basically responsible for so many past and future deaths. How are they still in business?! For anyone who doesn't think money is truly the only thing that matters to corporations this movie will show you the reality leaving you with no doubt.Everyone did very well with their roles especially Ruffalo and Robbins. I cannot find fault with this film. This should be required watching. It's horrible what this company did. They should've been shut down. They basically poisoned the entire world and still are. It's just unfathomable and I think it was scary when they showed how far the company went to ensure loyalty. The employees and townsfolk were basically singing the praises of their killers/poisoners. They turned against the farmer and couldn't see what DuPont did even after they were given proof.Hopefully all the people who knowingly or actively participated in this massive decades long cover up had or have experienced the same health issues that they subjected their employees to. They literally used them as lab rats. Horrible and inexcusable!,Dark Waters
80,ronakkotian,Shocking!!!,8,24 February 2021,"Mark Ruffalo is someone who has consistently impressed me with his acting and he manages to do it again with Dark Waters.Dark Waters follows Robert Bilott, a corporate defence attorney who takes on a lawsuit against a huge chemical company that exposes a lengthy history of pollution.I actually knew nothing about this story so I was completely shocked while watching this film. There are many discoveries made in the film that frankly angered me. It's insane to see what the chemical corporation DuPont did and what they put at stake just for money. I love seeing a film where a person obsesses over a certain case or mystery and Dark Waters is exactly that. We follow Bilott through this case that spans many years and get an insight into his work as well as his personal life. It's incredible to witness how much time and work he put into this case, the toll it has on his life as he gets consumed by it and Mark Ruffalo's performance conveys it brilliantly as usual. Tim Robbins is also part of the film for a short time and he does a great job. Bill Camp is also terrific in his role. Anne Hathaway is not in the film as much I thought but she does a great job even though I wish there was more to her character in the story.The film doesn't try to be overdramatic in its telling of the story or its presentation. Director Todd Haynes keeps this story grounded and engaging through its runtime. The dark look to the film works really well with the story and adds a level of intensity to the film. The film also runs for 2 hours but I did feel the film starting to drag towards the end.It's sad to see a great film like Dark Waters be swept under the rug due to the bad marketing. The poster and trailer do not convey what the film is about well which is disappointing considering how important of a film this is. I think everyone should give this film a watch and see how DuPont managed to mess up everybody's lives.",Dark Waters
81,statuskuo,The Corporation Does Not Factor Humanity,9,7 December 2019,"There's nothing here that you have not seen. Go ahead and call it ""Aaron Brockovich."" But director Todd Haynes still makes it entirely engaging and painfully true that death is a number compared to liability and that is how you can sustain cold hearted industry. Made more gut wrenching is how they believed the ends justified the means.
Mark Ruffalo tackles the lawyer with the conscience wonderfully. Suffering under the weight of what he must do and what then envelops his small world. It's heroic in how much he does sacrifice and let's face it, these stories don't end well. What director Haynes does is put a face to the not-on-the-books crime. And though, it only is a civil case somehow you sense the frustration of the town. Not played as rubes but believing that a massive corporation who funded and gave perks to sustain the village wouldn't willingly destroy it. As we know now versus 1998, they knew...if not for simple morbid curiosity. Then sat on the information as it fed the machine decades later, we are now more informed and much more paranoid. Everything we eat or touch or...breathe we are closer to death.
I was in that area in 1998...and the news then spent less time on it then I recall. As a college bound student, I heard murmurs of DuPont and jokes were made of this. Now...it seems bitterly grim. How many lives were destroyed because of shady dealings. When you peel the onion, you do weep.
I love this flick. The flavor of that era is pitch perfect. The backroads of an industrial town, built under poor chemistry just sweats disease. And you walk out angered by it. The fight continues to this day.",Dark Waters

I did no research or read up on the specific story that this film illustrates. And I'm glad I did, because this film really opened my eyes to these corporations.It's a powerful film, as mentioned above, really opened my eyes to it all. However, a film should still be interesting and entertaining, as it is a film, and not 2 hours of ""corporations are bad"". And I personally think it did just that. It's really interesting and Mark Ruffalo's character is really likeable and you end up really relating. Speaking of Mark Ruffalo, he was absolutely brilliant in this. Really nailed the role. Tim Robbins was also excellent. Anna Hathaway was neither here or there unfortunately, but none the less it was great to see such good performances.Throughout the entire film, I was hooked about this case, I was wanting to know what happened next and it was just done really well. For a story that realistically doesn't sound like it would be interesting as a film, really delivers.The film does, in my opinion, go on a little longer than it needs to. It doesn't take anything away from the film, but you do feel yourself starting to stray away from concentration.Overall, it's a really interesting story and one I would personally recommend.",Dark Waters

87,acedj,"Even after movies like this, we the sheeple still sleepwalk",9,27 May 2020,"This is the true story, with minor embellishing, about a corporate defense attorney named Rob Bilott that took on the monster corporation that is DuPont. During a meeting one day, a farmer that knows Rob's grandmother stops in to enlist his help. It seems that all of his livestock has become mysteriously ill and he has put most of them down. Once Rob starts down the rabbit hole, we see how giant corporations like DuPont only care about themselves. DuPont ends up exploiting the fact that a chemical they use to create Teflon is not listed with the government as hazardous and have spent years dumping it into the area surrounding this farmer's land. A quick side not, when the EPA set up their list of hazardous chemicals they relied on the companies that made them to submit lists to the government. This movie does tend to drag a bit at spots, but where we end up in the end is that DuPont ignored their own findings and kept pushing out products with this chemical in it, C8, knowingly poisoning the world. This is because of the fact that they made billions from its production. They ignored a court mediation decision and refused to help the people of the town that they poisoned. It is disgusting to say the least. I knew some of this story before watching this movie and have long tried my best to boycott anything made by DuPont. I encourage you all to do the same and to dispose of your Teflon coated pots and pans. It is estimated that 99% of all life forms on Earth now contain this chemical, which never breaks down. In other words it lasts forever..... Think about that one.",Dark Waters
88,akcenat,Gripping legal drama/eco-thriller,8,5 April 2020,"No matter I did like it, I couldn't help but feel like I've seen this story before, just with a new evil corporation swapped in this time. Director also finds suspense in things where there shouldn't be suspense. The film, in general, gets audiences riled up, but it never makes one care enough to feel moved to action. On the other hand, Ruffalo skillfully portrays real life lawyer as a caring man who internalizes his feelings, there are no dramatic outbursts or polemical speeches while film features very good supporting cast that provide some solid performances that helps build and keep the tension throughout the film. For me, the only real let-down is Anne Hathaway. Also, the runtime is a little long (126 min). At the end, while the pace of the film might be laborious for some, movie is gripping indictment of corporate greed in modern America and if you have Teflon in your kitchen, it may well make you nervous too.Rating: 8-/7+",Dark Waters

An environmental lawyer, who has been fighting for more than two decades against Dupont, one of the flagships of the greedy and toxic societies which form the ""Poison Cartel"". Their poisons, the PFOA - also known as C8 - which is not produced by nature, lasts forever and is found almost everywhere, even into the Arctic, as well as the PFOS, which is an endocrine disruptor and a pollutant listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants are both components of Teflon, which has poisoned 99% of mankind and is the source of countless numbers of cancers around the world.Dupont's management has been aware of the toxicity and the damage caused by their products since the middle of the twentieth century, but they have knowingly continued to destroy the health and lives of entire populations ever since. They have kept lying and attempted to cover up and minimize their responsibility as cancer victims have been dying during this dragging trial.This wonderful man of justice - brilliantly embodied by Mark Ruffalo - has not stopped fighting for more than twenty years against what constitutes nothing less than crimes against humanity, perpetrated by white-collar psychopaths, and sends us this essential message: The worst is not even them, but those of us who systematically deny facts and refrain from condemning what destroys our environment and ourselves out of sheer hypocrisy and cowardice.",Dark Waters

12A
Director: Todd Haynes
Starring: Mark Ruffalo, Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Bill Pullman, Bill Camp, Victor Garber etcOverall rating 72/100Dark waters is based on the true events of the mass water pollution caused by the chemical company Dupont. Corporate defence attorney Rob Billot (Mark Ruffalo) must fight for the people of America who are having their water poisoned everyday. Dark waters was good and got its message across well, but for me was a slight down, and for me could have been structured much better. So lets talk about this more in detail.First of all the film had great cinematography and managed to execute a uncomfortable tone fairly well. The film surprised me at how beautiful its visuals was, it had stunning views of the city landscape, it had some really interesting close up shots in particular in the office with the multiple blinds, and largely the movie was just beautiful to watch with many interesting set locations as well. Also the film managed to execute a uncomfortable tone pretty well, when it did actually go into detail about the effect of the water being polluted the film did an excellent job at making the audience know just how bad the c8 was. They largely managed to execute this well with the use of graphic and disturbing imagery that really stuck with you when watching.Next I thought the film had a lot of pacing inconsistencies and I had a lack of connection to the emotion and conflict. For me the films pacing was just all over the place. There was parts that were really slow when and my interest was sadly not there throughout the movie consistently, but also I felt like they rushed some important parts of the movie as well, conversations between important people and what was supposed to be key emotional moments lasted a few seconds and then they moved on causing a disconnect emotionally for me in places. This is largely due to the fact that I think they stuffed to much plot into the movie and it didn't completely work. And the attempted conflict between the family just felt tacked on for me and they tried to add more to it, but for me this steered away from what should have been the main focus of the movie which was the poison in the water killing people and turning more into a melodramatic family drama towards the end which was a shame.Next I thought that there was likeable lead characters with great chemistry and the performances from Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway were fantastic. Both the characters of Rob Billet and Sarah Bilott were incredibly likeable throughout. You couldn't help but respect Rob for his passion at wanting to protect the people that were being harmed and the lengths he was willing to go in order for him to achieve this so this was well done. And Sarah was also very likeable, as due to the social context of the time still being fairly sexist, Sarah rose above the men that took advantage of her or didn't pay he attention and stuck with her husband and stood her ground in a fairly male dominated film. They also had great chemistry as husband and wife as well, with their relationship feeling organic and believable with its up and downs throughout. And the performances from both Mark and Anne were fantastic, with both putting on believable and passionate performances that really made you connect with their characters.My next two positives would the films good character development and its excellent themes on power. The films character development with Mark Ruffalo's character was excellent. He was so passionate and so willing to do whatever it took to prove he was right was executed excellently. Whatever push back e received he always came back with something bigger and better truly making you believe in his character. Also, the films theme on power was excellent and eye opening. The film tackled some big issues with the company Dupont, and the fact that this was a movie based off real events and a real company was scary. And the fact that they were so willing to put the blame on others or cover up their tracks in any way possible was a big reflection of the power system of today and other powerful companies and people.However my final two negatives that made dark waters a bit disappointing for me would be that there was to many characters with a lack of depth and development and I felt like they actually played it fairly safe with the films conflict and main issue of water pollution. The film just had to many characters that were just in the film for the sake of being there. It just made it slightly difficult to connect with the movie as there was so many characters that I just simply didn't care about so I thought this was a shame and could have been condensed to a certain amount of characters. And finally I actually thought the movie played it safe with its conflict and issues. For me it felt like they were holding back In showing the true effects of what the poisoning does to people beyond just being told which I thought was a shame and instead for me they decided to rely more on melodramatic and generic family drama as the film went on which I found really frustrating as they had the foundations of a great message to spread and it was well executed in places but it fell flat and the focus was taken to much of it at the ending for me.Overall dark waters, has excellent character development, likeable characters and is visually striking, and has two excellent performances from both Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway and manages to execute its message occassionly. But sadly is held back by its overstuffed plot and characters. Pacing issues and losing its main message by sadly playing it safe and going for a more family drama leading me to be slightly disappointed by the end result.",Dark Waters

97,movieman6-413-929510,Dark Waters shows shocking hidden corrupt actions.,7,25 January 2020,"Dark Waters is a new biographical drama directed by Todd Haynes, the director of Far from Heaven and I'm Not There.In the film, Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) has become a partner at a law firm. As a lawyer he starts a case against the American chemical company DuPont, because he has found traces that this chemical company is dumping toxic chemicals in nature and water. As a result of these actions, a local farmer has lost many good harvests and livestock. Later Robert also learns that through these actions of the chemical company their chemical waste has ended up in the drinking water, causing many pregnant women to become infected and thus giving birth to malformed babies. Robert must now come up with enough evidence to win the lawsuit over the rich corrupt chemistry company.This film shows how corrupt the world actually is, where rich business owners prefer a good income even if it is at the expense of the healthy lives of certain people or even an entire community. This film also looks a bit like the Oscar-winning film Spotlight of 2015, in which journalists also investigated the wrong action of a corrupt society. Mark Ruffalo even played a role in this film, but in Dark Waters he has to do his own handy research as a lawyer into the corrupt actions of another society.Because of all the research that the main character does in an almost unbeatable battle, the film does have an interesting story, but sometimes with a somewhat lengthy pace. All of the moving research scenes can happen a bit repeatedly at a time. For a somewhat better film, they could have summarized these research scenes a bit better, because then the tempo would have been a bit better.In this film, Mark Ruffalo only takes his character along with the evidence of the victims exposed to toxic chemicals against the corrupt richer company leaders. Mark Ruffalo knows how to wear the film independently.

Fair enough, the story ought to be compelling - after all, we all know what Teflon (TM) is don't we? However, the over emphasis of the 'difficult' relationship the lawyer has with his firm, the lacuna in the lawyer's memory about something it is claimed really mattered to him as a child. No sorry. Hits the too fake, backstory filling blah blah button. At times, the film drones on as you wait for these formalities to be gotten over with. No actor is especially outstanding, not a surprise as there is nothing to run with. Nevertheless, the film carries an important message though. Perhaps this film should have ended on the occurrence of a separate legal challenge with a different manufacturer elsewhere in the US over other pollution issues. There's thousands of them, and they continue to arise. Nothing is solved. Nothing is changed. The story is eternal.",Dark Waters

The fact that these events actually took place is concerning. It is the kind of thing that so many people tend to overlook, or ignore.The score, like the presentation, is so bland and boring. Marcelo Zarvos also doesn't seem like a very good composer, the score for wonder was just as uninspired and bland as the music in dark waters.None of the acting was bad. Mark Ruffalo was great casting as Rob Bilott is a role practically made for him to play. He still wasn't great though, in my opinion the last great Ruffalo performance was in eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, and that performance still isn't amazing.I've already touched on my main issue with this film briefly, the presentation. Dark waters is presented in a really uninteresting way, this caused an abundance of boring conversation scenes that became very representative. I don't have a problem with dialogue driven films at all, (just look at my ratings) but the presentation of these conversations was so boring I didn't want to know what was actually being said.I think you should watch this if you're not aware of the events that dark waters is inspired by as they are interesting.

Mark Ruffalo is Rob Bilott, a defense attorney for a company like DuPont who takes on the case that leaves him in a torn and conflicted state. As he digs deeper into the matter and fits the pieces of the puzzle the enormity of the situation overwhelms him altering his outlook and course for good. The resulting drama is an adept take on the David and Goliath struggle as the pendulum swings between power and righteousness.

Wilbur Tennant gives Bob videos of what he sees what the cattle died of. Tennant blames Dupont and wants a lawyer to help clear this up.This is probably the strongest and most powerful story about an industrial giant, Dupont, polluting the waters near farms. The Hazard material called POA -8 and is used to make Teflon and the run off of this material is poured into 55-gallon drums and dumped in rivers where the drums eventually leak. Tennant knows Dupont is responsible because because his cows drink the water and die.Bob Bilott's boss, Tom Terp (Tim Robbins), at first doesn't want to go against Dupont, but later gives in and lets Bilott run with it and is convinced they have a case.But problems arise and Bob Bilott's efforts seem to go nowhere. Even his wife Sarah (Anne Hathaway) is against him until he sits her down and reads her the riot act.The whole tone of the movie is set by Wilbur Tannant played by Bill Camp when he approaches Bob Bilott. I would give Bill Camp an Oscar as Best Supporting actor as his rage is felt throughout this story.Notables: Victor Garber as Phil Donnelly, a Dupont Rep; Bill Pullman as lawyer Harry Dietzler who gives a very good performance in court near the end that Dupont is totally responsible for the deaths from POA; Mare Winningham as Darlene Kiger, who was told by Dupont to have a hysterectomy and she and her husband Joe (Richard Hagerman) have cancer.You need to see this story because although there have been TV shows with this plot, this story hits home better than all that went before.At the end of the movie we are told that POA is ""still in the blood of 99% of life on earth, and thousands of chemicals are still unregulated."" In other words, this isn't over.This is a must see and all should question use of Teflon products. This movie should convince you of that. The is a very well told and well acted movie.

108,ariqakbar,to think about it make me really itchy,8,24 March 2020,The fact that this happened and tell really good was already catch my judge. the phase was really good. its a really long event and they serve it really good not to much not to fast at the time.mark seems really doing a good performance. i think if their can show more contra POV in the law firm it would be more power to the story. but off course the movie will become more long also.the ending was close really smooth. it can be better tho if their not mark to much event and make it more less. and yet that was my opinion. could be 9 for me tbh,Dark Waters
109,harrylosborne,Mark Ruffalo does a less impressive but more important Spotlight,7,23 January 2021,"O Dark Waters is scary. It's a story you want to ignore, but you know that turning a blind eye is even worse. Ruffalo is someone who's good at portraying the fear of the viewer, but his perseverance shines through as well. It's staggering that a story of this magnitude isn't more widely known, so credit to the direction for bringing it to light. There is a grey palette across the whole film, matching the mood: the story is not cheery, but in a similar vein to Spotlight, deserves its recognition. It is best to view it in almost the same light as a dramatized documentary (which maybe runs on a tad too long), doing its bit to disseminate information about the embarrassment that is DuPont.",Dark Waters
110,PetarNeo,It's powerful story,9,24 January 2020,"What an amazing story this movie offers. Main point of watching this magnificent movie is that story just keeps on giving and add Mark Ruffalo to that as we know Mark has a strong acting skills in dramas and performs like a genius you get an emotional ride.Big corporate lawyer coming down to small people and giving them attention they so much deserve and providing them with support that will tend to destroy his family life but amount of respect that he feels like those people need overcomes that to point of him losing it and coming back as strong as he did is profound.Dark Waters really dives into dark waters and just goes through them without stopping, filling you with emotional scenes and unfortunate events just makes you feel sick and caring for people that suffered. Greed, money and profit are worst things that will kill reasonable thinking but humanity will try to fight back and people are there to overcome all barriers. This movie touches all aspects of humanity and what means to care about something and someone and how much are individuals prepared to sacrifice to get all dark, bad and dirty things beaten.People making this movie absolutely understand how to dose information to be well presented and how to make you feel for everybody. They feed you certain thing and then make you watch how it destroy people so you just can't stay cold to that. Director Todd Haynes is fabulous in dramatic movies and he proves it over and over again.Even after movie ends if you haven't been so much in the theme and kind of forgotten how it went and what was going on at the time, you are so touched by things that big corporates are doing then and now also but there need to be someone like Robert Billot (Mark Ruffalo) that will bring attention and sacrifice his time to help others. His persistency is what brought us changes and facts about how we are being used in the most disgusting ways. 3.5/4",Dark Waters
111,Lewis_Heather787,Fascinating story..............that deserved a better film!,7,30 November 2019,"For some reason I wasn't fully familiar with this story. I had heard of the DuPont chemical company and that they had carried out some really bad work practises with chemicals harmful to humans and the planet! However I wasn't prepared for how bad and how much they really knew and for how long, stretching back decades into the past with some pretty horrific chemical trial testimony.The story to someone like me was extremely fascinating seeing it unfold before me, probably due to the fact that I really didn't know how it was gonna end. There are several really shocking parts to me that stick out. Firstly the amount of information that the company had and that they knew about the chemical in question. They knew that there were potentially negative effects to human health and due to the lovely fact that they were self-regualting meant that they could almost keep it to themselves and lie. It is surprising and not at the same time, of course a big company like this would do that............can you imagine the fallout from this if it came out in the 80's or 90's?? The other shocking part is how long it took to get anything done...........I don't know how faithful the film is to the real events but the fact that film more or less ends in 2015, is mind blowing considering it started in the late 90's. Makes wonder how I didn't know more about this??Mark Ruffalo is brilliant , prefect role for him to deep dive into and really sink his teeth into. He has got one of those traits about him as an actor, easily likeable......so it is no problem getting behind his cause. Im a sucker for any ""standing up for the small guy"" type of story and this one certainly delivers in that respect. Not Oscar worth probably but not every performance needs to be..........just a solid one.That sort of leads into my problem with the film, for such a complex, fascinating, heart breaking and shocking story.........this film feels a little under cooked. It needs more of everything.........not necessarily better actors.............but certainly a better script because it can get very clunky in places....I can imagine if your not enjoying this film it will get tedious. Potentially a bigger name director, not saying that Todd Haynes is not talented he is, directed one of my fav films ""Carol"", but maybe someone who is more inclined to this sort of story. There should have been more tension in the film or more driving force........something to keep you the edge of your seat, its called ""Dark Waters"" for crying out loud. I was maybe just expecting something a bit more like ""The Insider"" but unfortunately didn't get anywhere near.Overall though I did enjoy watching the film its a good solid film 70% of 100, good acting from everyone including Anne Hathaway and Mark Ruffalo.........directing was fine............maybe a little too slow on the pace now and then and certainly needed better script. I think its trying to hard to be Oscar bait and has fallen short of being a great film. None the less I would recommend it even if you do know the story.",Dark Waters
112,nidhunmoviebuff,"A compelling, must-watch legal drama based on real events!",8,27 September 2020,"#DarkWaters #LegalThriller #MarkRuffalo #AnneHathaway #SonyLivAnother compelling legal thriller after Just Mercy, Mark Ruffalo excels in the role of a crusading lawyer fighting for justice against Chemicals major Dupont who had been illegally dumping toxic chemicals in the waterways of a sleepy village for decades.The fact that it is based on actual events and the life of real-life hero Robert Bilott makes you take in the story with more authenticity and feel.The sheer audacity and apathy displayed by the chemical companies with legards to environmental safety is on full show here, making you re-assess your own neighbourhood and water bodies.That is the lasting impact the movie will leave on you and credit must go to Director Mark Haynes for this. He moves the story forward in an emotional but hard-hitting manner. Ruffalo is ably supported by Oscar winners Anne Hathaway and Tim Robbins, who captivated in what little screen time they got.Highly recommended See less",Dark Waters

118,diggnuts,"Right message, wrong audience.",4,8 August 2020,"The USA have given us many thing, but sometimes these things are polar opposites of each other. In this case the USA gives us quality food for thought about how we use and abuse the environment, how this impacts people and how in turn it impacts everybody. On the other side, this rampant unregulated hyper-capitalism is also a product from the USA, and judging by the political climate, I can only image that many people would applaud the first half of the movie and see it as a business plan.I saw some people commenting on this as if it was a warning against globalism! Are Americans really that far gone in their imaginary world that this uniquely American problem is caused by Globalism? The rational notion that in an ever smaller world, more countries have to work together to survive?Considering the reaction to the, in my opinion, clear message of the movie falling either on deaf ears or being misconstrued into something that has nothing to do with the subject matter, I can only come to one conclusion. Either the audience are thick and deluded lunatics who twist anything into a version that suits their needs, or the communication of this movie was completely unable to reach the audience. Seeing as this site reviews movies and not audiences, I can't give this more then a 4 for effort. A lot of work for practically nothing of value to show for it.If you can't get through to people, perhaps that effort is better spend elsewhere.",Dark Waters
119,gcsman,An obvious Oscar nomination for Mark Ruffalo.,9,18 December 2019,"Every year we seem to get a pretty high-profile movie or two in the genre of ""crusading, righteous (lawyer, doctor, journalist -- fill in the blank) played by big-name star takes on nasty (mega-corporation, government, the law - fill in the blank) "". Top examples include All The President's Men (1976), The Insider (1999), Erin Brockovich (2000), Fair Game (2010), Concussion (2015), Spotlight (2015), On the Basis of Sex (2018) -- the list goes on an on, and you probably have your own favorites. Dark Waters fully earns its place on this list for quality and impact, not least because of Mark Ruffalo's performance.One thing I like a lot about this film is precisely that it's not flamboyant. It's slow-burn but easy to watch even though the subject material (uncovering a legacy of synthetic ""forever chemicals"" in our environment) is not a happy one in any way. The pacing is steady and deliberate, and it's the kind of role that I think Ruffalo is well suited to. Not that he isn't pretty versatile (compare what he did in Spotlight as a gonzo journalist) but this just seems to be more centered for him, playing real-life lawyer Rob Bilott as a low-key but dogged guy who just can't give up on his pursuit of the trail. An Oscar nom is sure to come next year.All the other roles are secondary. Anne Hathaway is stuck with playing the Loyal Wife with only a few excursions into a bit of character development. And Victor Garber is stuck with being the evil DuPont CEO. But I thought in a way that the most interesting role of all was played by Tim Robbins, as the head of Bilott's law firm. He starts out grudgingly allowing Rob's crusade, but instead of staying in this stereotypical high-priced-lawyer persona he gradually turns into a staunch supporter for (wow!) reasons of right and truth.Too bad this one isn't doing well at the box office --- everyone should see it. I give it 9/10.Footnote: About chemicals. The subject of the movie is ""forever chemicals"" (in this case, C8) that are synthetic and never break down in the environment or the human body. But it would be easy to come out of the movie thinking that ""chemicals are bad"". Everything around us in this complex world is chemical and you have to ask what each one does. There's one small moment in the movie where a chemist consultant is talking to Rob about fluorides. He says (correctly!) that SMALL doses in the public water supply are good (and in fact a lot better than nothing at all) because they harden teeth and reduce decay. But BIG doses are bad. It's all a matter of finding what the right level is. The old saying is that ""the dose makes the poison"" -- not the chemical itself.",Dark Waters
120,MovieBuff11732,A Film That Could Really Scare You For A Long Time,9,5 April 2020,"Dark Waters is about a lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) who finds out that a big chemical company is poisoning the air and everything around them. His wife Sarah Barlage Bilott (Anne Hathaway) is trying to keep him away from going out because it is tearing him away from the family.Dark Waters was a movie I really wanted to see when it was in theaters in 2019. It sucks that I couldn't see it in the cinema. I saw it on DVD in 2020 and I was as impressed as I thought I would be. I enjoyed this film. It was funny and like the title says, scary. It wasn't like a bunch of jump scare, but it was a true story that scares you because it is real! I loved that about this film. There was only one thing I didn't like. That was the titles. When they would say the date and what was going on. I thought they just looked weird and they made it feel like you weren't really going where they wanted you to go. I just thought that it was a weird choice. That was the only thing I didn't like.The acting was outstanding. Mark Ruffalo gives one of his best performances to date. I haven't seen a bunch of his movies, but I think this performance will certainly be up on the list of some of his best. Anne Hathaway also surprisingly did a great job. She wasn't in the movie a whole lot, but when she was, she delivered. You could tell she had to do sort of an accent for this film too. Tim Robbins did good. He wasn't in the movie a whole lot. After Shawshank Redemption he hasn't really done much. Bill Pullman did basically nothing. He was barely in the movie. Everyone in the film performed their roles to the best of their ability.The story was fantastic. Like I said earlier, it would scare you because of the fact it was a true story. They did a great job of that. The way it made the chemical company feel was also fantastic. It made them seem like a big evil cooperation that wouldn't stop so they would get there money. They did great with that. I must say the lighting was fantastic also. Whenever you went to the town that was being effected it would always be dark and gloomy. They did a great job of the letting you now that something wrong was going on there.Overall, Dark Waters was a film that is defiantly worth a watch for anybody.",Dark Waters

So not exactly the best basis for an exciting movie. The story in general of the underdog fighting for people against the evil cooperation we have seen so often that we can predict how this goes and only question is will the lawyer succeed or not.Now the only thing that can make this more alive is the emotions! Why are there so little? This a story about poisoning a whole city for generations and the rest of the world. People dying left and right from chemical induced cancer. Ann Hathaway shoes some emotions but that is mostly because her husband is obsessed with this trial. Other than then that we don't really see suffering, sadness and grieve. Ruffalo plays it so small that you wanna scream at him like Hathaway does at one point.Like I said this story needed to be told but since this about poisoning people, about human lives it didn't need to told so clinical.",Dark Waters
129,punisherversion1,An important story and sadly one we hear all too often,6,22 February 2020,"Dark Waters
Directed by Todd Haynes. Written by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael CarnahanDark Waters is based on the true story of a lawyer who used to work for corporate defense going after Dupont and their harmful ways. This is a film that takes you into the details, into the minutia and wallows down in the time and the energy it takes to fight corporations like this. Sometimes it takes everything even for someone who understands how the game is played. He used to defend people like Dupont in lawsuits such as the ones depicted in this movie.This movie was directed by Todd Haynes which is highly unusual as this is not the type of movie he makes. This sort of real life courtroom drama is done by more journeyman directors rather than somebody who likes to burrow into the minds of his characters. It's a good thing that he got on board this film as his touch really allows even someone as internal as Mark Ruffalo's character bleed through the screen.This is a story that has been told before. It is very similar to what happened with Erin Brockovich. I understand that this is a true story so naturally it's not trying to copy anything. If you ever want to understand why we need regulations on corporations, stories like what Dupont was doing for decades and the story in Erin Brockovich or the crash of 2008 and many, many,many more stories like that. They can not be relied upon to police themselves. Nobody really can though.This is a heartbreaking story. It was these people's entire way of life not just the cancers they started to get or their livestock dying horribly. The town relied entirely upon Dupont to continue surviving. They sponsor everything. This can make people blind to the evils that they might do. They have more immediate concerns like feeding their family and keeping a roof over their heads. The town even turns against them for doing what they knew in their hearts to be the right thing.The fight though takes decades. It takes a massive toll on Mark Ruffalo's character and his family and even his boss who turns out to be more than a one dimensional character. They wear it on their sleeves.This is a simple and solid film. It hits the points and you come to understand and know who they are and what they're fighting for. It plays things close to the chest and it is a well made but fairly standard movie. I give this one a C.",Dark Waters

Dark Waters is what I would call an ""article film"" ie a film which reads out like an article like we saw in Spotlight and Hustlers.While the direction, performances, score, editing and cinematography all being good but nothing extraordinary the reason why this film stick out mainly is because it explains the content in such a manner that even a 3 year old would understand it and that too without engaging in spoon feeding.

132,cappiethadog,The science is in,9,1 December 2019,"Robert Bilott(Mark Ruffalo), a corporate lawyer-turned-informant against his firm's client DuPont, is in the intensive care unit, recovering from a transient ischematic attack. Robert was nowhere near a dry cleaners. He had a seizure at work, in his boss' office after learning from Tom Terp(Tim Robbins), the Taft, Stennius & Hollister CEO, that he'll be expected to take another pay cut, his fourth pay cut. Robert's three boys attend a private Catholic school. The wife will be furious. This chemical company has made Robert allergic to family life. ""Dark Waters"", directed by Todd Haynes, is an unofficial sequel to his second film, ""Safe"", which partly put the onus on the victim, not the culprit, because the filmmaker didn't know who the culprit was. Twenty-five years later, we know, and ""Dark Waters"" names names. The science is in. Modern life can kill you. Although the doctor(Terri Clark) explains to Sarah Bilott(Anne Hathaway), herself, a corporate lawyer, who met Robert at his law firm, that Robert's problem was neurological, brain-related. The wife, however, has reservations about the preliminary analysis, having witnessed, first-hand, so much corporate malfeasance, the former workman's comp assassin-turned homemaker can't help but ask if there is any possibility that her husband might have been poisoned. Wilbur Tennant(Bill Camp), a farmer, taught the couple to never take anything at face value, since every action and inaction, at the end of the day, is profit-motivated. Only a man with a twelfth-grade education would know this. A rich man with a law degree from an Ivy League school doesn't know or cares that the system is rigged, because the system never let them down. But Robert Bilott didn't attend Harvard, or Yale, or even Dartmouth. In Goliath's eyes, Robert is David, too, no different from the farmer with the dead cows. ""Dark Waters"" is about a changed man's crusade against a Goliath in the chemical industry, who knowingly contaminated a backwater West Virginia town's drinking water supply with chlorofluorocarbons. Outside her husband's hospital room, Sarah chastises Tom for making Robert feel like a failure. ""You and I may not know what that is,"" she scolds the law firm's main partner, which means that Sarah doesn't care about the little man, but she cares about what her husband cares about. The ""is"", the audience knows, is roots. Robert Bilott went to Ohio State, a ""no-name"" school, according to James(William Jackson Harper), a Taft associate. Wilbur knows Robert's grandmother. That's because the hotshot lawyer grew up in rural West Virginia.It's all in the head, people keep trying to persuade Carol White(Julianne Moore), a privileged San Fernando Valley trophy wife, especially her general practitioner, Dr. Hibbard(Steven Gilborn), who refers his patient to a colleague; a ""shrink"", because whatever is ailing this otherwise ""healthy"" woman, it's not showing up on her x-rays. ""Safe"", Todd Haynes' second feature, was a horror film disguised as a social satire about the consumer culture that defined the late-eighties. Set in 1987, Haynes, a filmmaker trained in semiology, updates Brian Forbes' ""The Stepford Wives"", adapted from the Ira Levin novel, by tweaking the role of the homemaker. In the 1972 original, the women were domestic automatons, obsessing over housecleaning products and pleasing their breadwinning husbands in bed. These southern California wives have maids. They never have to lift a finger. Furniture, the audience suspects, gets them off, because they're shopping addicts and money is the drug. These Hispanic domestics clean the beautiful stuff their employers have bought and curated, which transforms their luxurious homes into temples of 20th century excess. Carol was one of them. At home, and this is because of Haynes' mastery of the mis-en-scene, the audience sees how this privileged woman must always be the focal point; her maid, Fulvia(Martha Velez), a mere planet constantly revolving around the sun, her mistress, always threatening the maid's elliptical orbit, because of their tilted symbiotic relationship. ""Fulvia! Fulvia!"" Carol calls offscreen, even though Fulvia is preoccupied, showing the new girl how to polish silverware. Carol can't find the telephone book. Finding it herself, in this milieu, counts as hard work, and the delegation of work, that's what the missus does. Carol overexerts herself; she sits down and asks Fulvia for a glass of milk. Through the kitchen opening, we see two men at work, painting a wall. Although visual cues are aplenty, in which exposure to chemicals and air pollutants(like car exhaust) provide evidence for this woman's degraded condition, the cause and effect is compromised by the audience's disdain for this somewhat problematic protagonist. On Carol's haler days, Fulvia would fetch the missus her milk, regardless, because power over the help is the only power she holds. It's hard to root for the idle rich. The filmmaker knows this. Carol has to prove that she's one of us before the audience can get behind her. That moment arrives during the baby shower sequence. Carol goes on the fritz, similar to the woman during the pool party scene in ""The Stepford Wives"", who walks aimlessly among the partygoers, repeating: ""I'll just die if I don't get this recipe."" Haynes riffs on the concept of woman as malfunctioning human android into woman as alien. Carol, suddenly, feels like a stranger among the members of her very exclusive clique; an oncoming dread that blossoms into terror when she no longer can speak the shared language of her tribe. Carol knows the words, but not the music; she's still fluent, asking Linda(Susan Norman), her best friend: ""Did you wrap that?"" and, as if they're reading from a script, the self-aware knows the right way to respond: ""I've seen you wrap things."" These women aren't talking; it's a pitch-perfect speech performance. Improvisation in ""Safe"" is double-edged, because it's not just the actors who stick to the script, so do the characters they play. This rote memory of correct things to say wipes Carol out. The audience thinks it's the carpet. She asks Barbara(Ronnie Farer) for the whereabouts of her bathroom. Wrong word. ""Powder room,"" Barbara corrects her guest. Once inside, she stares at herself in the mirror, a foreshadowing of the film's final scene. The perm, the makeup, the pretty dress; these things, Carol thinks, is not her. A glass of tap water sits on the countertop. Carol returns to the fold, managing to play her role in the good life for a little while longer. Barbara's daughter sits on the alien's lap, watching the future mother open another gift. Carol's breathing becomes labored. The child is frightened. Carol breaks script; she improvises. The alien can't breathe, like the living room suddenly turned into Mars. The host calls 911. An audience in 1995 could debate about the trigger. There are several suspects; the little girl's permed hair, carpet, sofa. air conditioner. 2019 audiences will see something different; tap water from the bathroom faucet.Chorale music is used as a sound bridge when ""Dark Waters"" transitions from the intensive care ward to a Catholic church. Did TIA kill the lawyer? In the pew, Carol and her three boys sing a hymn, followed by a series of expository shots, which surveys the cathedral's geography and congregation density, before ending with Robert, who sits slightly apart from his family near the aisle, in frame. So the father was there all along, hiding in the negative space, during that first shot of the incomplete Bilott family, when for an instant, the audience thinks they're witnessing a funeral. It's a variation on a theme, linking the corporate lawyer with Carol White; a thematic match, depicted through mis-en-scene, which shows how Robert is simultaneously close and far away from his family. In ""Safe"", the homemaker talks to Greg, her husband, and Rory, her stepson, from a different room, the kitchen, where she had volunteered to serve coffee for two. Instead of returning to the dining table, Carol lingers in a blind spot, from the family's perspective, as if she lost her way back. Robert, like Carol White, feels disconnected from his milieu. The corporate lawyer, too, meets new people and doesn't know who he is anymore. Robert ingratiates himself within a lower socioeconomic class, the denizens of Parkersburg, West Virginia, his clients, whereas the San Fernando Valley girl loses touch with her fancy, high-maintenance jetsetter friends to live with other chemically-sensitive people on a secluded commune in the New Mexico desert. Fifteen years later, since Wilbur Tennant interrupted Robert during a meeting at his law firm with a rambling monologue in an inpenetrable Appalachian dialect and a box of VHS tapes, the corporate lawyer has changed, and Sarah, despite loving her husband, calls him out. His physical body may be present, but the mind housed in that body, it's somewhere else, probably rural West Virginia.

SYNOPSIS:
This is the story based on a real person named ""Robert Bilott"" and inspired by an article titled ""The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare."" Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) is a lawyer who primarily defends chemical corporations until a farmer from his old town of West Virginia asks for help to prove that there are chemicals being dumped in the water that is the cause of large amount of cow deaths. Although unconvinced at first, through excessive research and digging, Robert begins to find horrifying evidence of something much worse than just a deadly chemical to cows, but humans and all creatures alike.DIRECTION:
If I'm being honest, I don't have much to say in this realm. The direction by Todd Haynes was as technically solid as any other good film. Yes, just ""good."" The color palette was probably a little too dull even for the subject matter and really the film's strong points really lye in the writing and some strong performances. I feel almost any other director could've done the same job, if not better.WRITING:
The writing is definitely a step up from the directing. The writing isn't perfect as there are some scenes that almost seemed unnecessary and just had me thinking ""get to the story!"" Now, there is much to be said about how much time and effort it must've been to retrieve all of this information and translate it to script. Yes, it's been done before, ie: Spotlight, Zodiac, etc., but this is quite possibly one of the most important stories to be told today as this is something that is still affecting everyone... TODAY. It is based on the NYTIMES article ""The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare"" by Nathanial Rich, but obviously there was far more research than a 10ish page article.ACTING:
The acting is definitely where the juice is at. This is where you take your regular beef sandwich and baptize it (In case you're not american enough to know what this means, it means you dump in in the beef juice). Mark Ruffalo gives a similarly excellent performance as he did in Spotlight. WOAH WOAH, I didn't say it was AS good, I said it was SIMILAR. Cool it, Mary. It's expected, but he really makes the film what it is. Anne Hathaway is great, as usual, but her role as the wife wasn't integral to the story. I understand showing he has a life outside of work with kids and a wife and showing the kid's grow older and older gives substance to the prolonged journey Robert is taking, but these were the scenes I felt could've been cut or replaced. Tim Robbins is in this and some other people and some other people. All did well, just kind've interchangeable.CONCLUSION:
Mr. John ""The Sexy and Over-qualified or something Critic Guy"" Yanulis, you rated this film a 3.5/5, yet after reading your overly long review it seems like a high rating. What can I say? I like it Ruff and I'm a sucker for investigative films on important and interesting topics. Also, I prefer rating my films on a 1-10 bases, but I'm limited.

The scary thing about this film is I was so off course with what I thought it'd be about. The really terrible truth though it that things like this actually happened and not only in the west. Within my family there was a year i think it was probably in the 1930-1940's in Dominica, the Caribbean, there was a year where all the pregnant mothers were put on some experimental drug that caused complications with their pregnancies and the children born that year had mental and possibly physical defects. my grandmothers' niece was one of them and it has also had an affect on her children. The worst thing about this is it affects human lives too often without their knowledge till it's too late. And the kicker is how nothing happens to the devils perpetrating these deeds. The world keeps going round. In time they always get what's coming to them even if it be in the next life, it's still very painful and life changing to witness.

147,blackoutH,Greed continues to be the root of all evil,8,3 December 2020,"Corporation and human greed has no limits - something that we continue to see over and over again yet it shocks me every single time.When you have glimpses of good actions being carried out by humans and you slowly recover your faith in humanity, stories like the one in Dark Waters hit you right in the head with the cruel reality of the world we live in.
Rob Bilott is the protagonist of this real life based movie, a lawyer who works in a big law firm and who dedicated his life defending large corporations, gets himself caught in a major conspiracy that exposes a chemical company of poisoning a local town and possibly millions of other human beings throughout the years.It seems like a cheesy Hollywood script, but scary enough this is indeed real life, where large companies continue to put profit on top of everything including human lives - we tend to separate people and companies for some reason but ultimately companies are nothing more than groups of people, and in these groups of people we always have the ones in power so blinded by whatever personal desire they have, that not only are they ignorant to the problems that they cause, but even worse, whenever they do discover the negative impact that they had, they continue to hide or drown it out - with some major consequences most times.I think that we have normalized this behaviors but we should stop thinking that way, movies like this should work as a waking call for us to be really careful in the companies we put our trust in, and should also place us with a mindset that the society of consumerism where we leave in needs a change and it starts with us.
As a movie, it is well crafted, the message is delivered in a clean and concise manner, the chain of events taking place and the pace of the story are well put and the actors did a great job, as you would expect from Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway.
It's not a huge cinematic achievement however the story it tells has a very important role in awareness and this is why I've decided to rate it with such a high score, regardless of the accuracy of specific events this is a movie, not a documentary so everything will be dramatized of course, but this shouldn't take your attention out of the actual issue being raised.",Dark Waters

154,canadude,"Deliberately paced, but with a cumulative impact",7,19 January 2020,"Dark Waters is akin to Scott Burn's The Report: a true story about a massive scandal that prides itself on a surgical peeling of layers of evidence to get to the terrifying truth. Here, the subject is corporate malfeasance on a major scale and at over two hours, the movie definitely takes its time methodically documenting the investigation the hero conducts, including a montage that involves poring over mountains of evidence for months, then years.If this sounds boring then, well, it almost is. In real life, holding power to account is often a thankless task that involves serious mental labor of piecing together clues that don't make sense for a very long time - it is mind-numbing, repetitive work that involves paper and legalese.But at the same time, the film acquires a kind of magnetic pull as the scale of what Mark Ruffalo's character is unraveling begins to shine through its cold and still sheen. While I wish the story had more urgency - more momentum - the few scenes where a character delivers a powerful speech meant to provide that dramatic jolt feel false. Ultimately, Dark Waters is a good movie because for the most part it sticks to its commitment to documenting the burdens of public service as they really are - not grand and dramatic, but thorough, deliberate, and ultimately cumulative. The scenes in which the protagonist encounters and grows to know the residents of the areas most profoundly affected by the polluting Dupont chemical company, some played by the residents themselves, remind us of the human cost so often obscured by legal and bureaucratic language (e.g. ""receptacle"" stands in for ""humans"" in one of Dupont's pollution reports).In the end, Dark Waters is an account of the work corporations do to distance themselves from the human suffering they cause and of managing the excesses of capitalism through research and law.",Dark Waters

It's not a typical Todd Haynes movie, and I'm still wondering why it seemed to have caught so few people's attention. It was a similar story to that of Erin Brockovich, but instead of a busty, ballsy woman, the protagonist is a schlubby lawyer who is just trying to do the right thing. I also wonder if people are so inured by the awfulness of the world, with every day bringing a new horror, that the true story of DuPont purposefully poisoning citizens in West Virginia just can't find room to get on people's radar.

162,faroukgulsara,Know the two sets of Laws,9,2 May 2020,"One thing the lockdown has shown us is that there are two sets of rules for people. One for affluent, the one perched atop the highest branch and the other for those scrawling at the lowest branch or doodling on the ground. The one close to the ruling party will get just a friendly slap on the wrist while the brunt of the long arm of the law would descend upon the nobody.An 80-year-old vagabond who was waiting for his free food was slapped with a RM1000/= compound without much deliberation. He risks imprisonment. A minister was seen sharing meals with his supporters, and a deputy minister was enjoying his birthday bash without a care in the world of the MCO. The prowling digital spies did manage to capture the moment for the public to judge, but the law seems to be dragging its feet. This type of subservience by the authorities to the people of power is no alien to this country alone.Beware, there is a 2015 horror flick named 'Dark Water' (singular) which is different from the remake of Japanese movie with almost the same name.This 2019 film is based on real events. It tells the story of the fight of a lone farmer, Wilbur Tennant, who took legal suits against DuPont, a giant chemical company. It started in 1995 when the farmer discovered that his cattle, 190 of them, had died mysteriously with bloated organs and blackened teeth. He suspected that the cause could be due to the dumping of chemicals upstream. He tried to get the help of the authorities, but instead, he was slapped with a fine for improper farming.Living in dire circumstances, he approached an old friends' grandson, Robert Billot, a hotshot lawyer who makes his fortune defending multinational chemical companies. Initially, reluctant to waste his time on an unrewarding case, he finally caved in to investigate the farmer's complaint.He became interested when the environmental impact assessment report showed no contaminants, but DuPont's internal investigations repeatedly showed some unknown abbreviated compound. He also noticed that many dwellers of the town had an unusually high incidence of cancers. Everyone in the town looked at Tennant and Billot as trouble makers as DuPont had contributed so much in the upliftment and upkeep of that town, Parkersburg, West Virginia. Things had really changed for the better since DuPont set up a plant there. They thought their misery was a small price to pay for development.Using the tentacles of the law to his advantage, Billot came to discover that compound was indeed PFOA, a fluorated hydrocarbon, which was used to make Teflon coating in non-stick pans.It came to light that PFOA or C8 and PFOS had poisoned the land and their drinking water. Now, everybody wanted to join in the suit against the giant. It indeed became a David versus Goliath match. The mega-company used all the might of their finances to quash dissidence. Lawsuits were not affordable for the average Joe. Neither the legal fraternity nor the administrative bodies are laypeople friendly. Just like how flies are drawn to garbage, power begets influence.At the end of the day, the general public is left only with a loud public voice via civil society bodies, the fourth estate and an unbiased judiciary system.But wait, is the legal system here to carry out the law or to mete out justice?In real life, Robert Bilott went through many financial and familial turmoils pursuing the matter, for each and every defendant, 3,500 of them. After a long battle that spanned ten-over years (Tennant had died then), he won the first three multimillion-dollar settlements against DuPont, and DuPont settled the class action for $671 million. Du Pont, however, seems unperturbed. They are still going on business as usual with other joint ventures.For our own knowledge, Teflon is marketed as other variants and have made their way to our household in various forms - water-resistant furniture and carpets, wrinkle-free and water-repellant clothing, lubricants, pizza boxes, dental floss and many more.",Dark Waters

173,michaeldoud,"First Hit: An excellent portrayal of corporate malfeasance and arrogance, finally getting its comeuppance.",8,2 December 2019,"First Hit: An excellent portrayal of corporate malfeasance and arrogance, finally getting its comeuppance.Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), a corporate attorney, is a thorough pragmatic defender of corporations. He's just made partner in his firm and is a powerful asset to the company because he's so good at his work.During an important meeting, he's interrupted by Wilber Tennent (Bill Camp) and friend who come from a farm in Parkersburg, West Virginia. They come to see Bilott because Roberts's grandmother, ""Grammy,"" is a friend of Tennent.
They hand Bilott a box full of videotapes explaining that no local Parkersburg lawyer will help them with the problem of their cattle dying. They believe the animals are dying because the town's largest employer, Dupont, is polluting the water with chemicals from their facility.Bilott tries to deter Tennent and not get involved, but Tennent's plea knags at him, so he visits his Grammy, verifies she knows Tennent and then drives to Tennent's farm. When Wilbur shows him his field full of buried cows, ""190 of them,"" he realizes there is a problem.Although Bilott's firm doesn't have Dupont as a corporate client, they are reluctant to take on a nonpaying client that is going to end up suing Dupont as it will hurt their reputation with their own corporate clients.However, Tom Terp (Tim Robbins), Bilott's boss, supports Robert continuing his investigation even though his client cannot pay. There is a great scene when all the partners convene to hear and discuss Bilott's work.Finally, Dupont sends over all the discovery information that Bilott had requested, and it is massive. Hundreds of boxes of memos, reports, and other documentation. Being a team of one, dutifully Robert sits down on the floor and begins categorizing each document by year and subject. This is a great scene because it cements Robert's commitment to do the right thing no matter what it takes.His years of research comes up with proof that Dupont knew that they were poisoning people and animals through the creation, use of, and byproducts from POFA (C8), a chemical creation used in Teflon© the non-stick coating that everyone was using. C8 is one of those chemicals that cannot be broken down by nature, let alone the human body and therefore it stays in the body and slowly causes various types of cancer.The film takes us through this story as it develops over the years of difficult lonely hard work on Bilott's part. The filmmakers did a great job of showing the passage of time by giving the audience quick glimpse of his three boys growing up in front of him. He barely interacts with them because he's so clearly focused on this one case, this man is all in.In the meantime, because of the court's slow processes, Dupont's putting roadblocks at every turn, and the slowness of a medical testing company that was reviewing, over sixty thousand blood tests, people were continuing to be poisoned and die from being exposed to C8.We watch as the stress of doing the right thing for his client requires him to take reductions in pay because he's spending all his time on this case that has no paying client. We watch him feel the pain while watching his clients deteriorate because of the poison.His wife Sarah (Anne Hathaway) tries to keep their family together, showing undying support, even as she sees the deterioration of her husband because of the deeply committed compassion to see this lawsuit through for the people who are being harmed.One thing the film made sure of was the darkness of this subject. Every scene is dark in color or filled with gray skies.Ruffalo was excellent as the committed attorney who gave up almost everything, including his life, to find and fight for the truth. Hathaway was superb as his supportive wife attempting to keep their family together while Robert fights for the truth. Robbins was influential as Bilott's boss and senior managing partner of their law firm, showing support for Robert on this long trail to truth. Camp was terrific, and the driven farmer and rancher who committed his life to making sure Dupont was charged for their crimes against his community. Victor Garber, as Phil Donnelly, a senior executive in Dupont, was supreme in his portrayal of being the mouthpiece of corporate malfeasance. Mare Winningham, as Darlene Kiger, a Parkersburg resident, was fantastic. It was lovely to see her on the screen again. Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan wrote a powerfully detailed script. Todd Haynes did a great job of creating the feel corporate malfeasance and the difficulty of making wealthy companies pay for their crimes against humanity.Overall: This is an excellent story about the power of perseverance.",Dark Waters
174,northernpaladin,Enraging,7,1 April 2021,"Your first reaction at the end of this film should be, why aren't the Du Pont management behind bars? The second should be, corporate America is rotten to the core along with those who take my vote and pretend to represent me.But what of the actual screen drama?Mark Ruffalo can do ernest very well and here he delivers what is required but no more really. Tim Robbins and Ann Hathaway provide able support in underwritten roles and Hathaway in particular is a little flat in her portrayal of the loyal wife. The real acting credit goes to Bill Camp as the enraged farmer who brings the case of his poisoned animals to Ruffalo and is the needle that pricks his corporate armour; Camp puts over the anger, the powerlessness, the tragedy and the dignity of the character effortlessly and leaves an indelible print on the film.The pacing is slow, too slow really, about 20 minutes too slow and it made me think maybe this would have worked better as a mini series like The Looming Tower. Part of the problem is the nature of the story (17 years!) so for large chunks of time nothing really happens and supporting players, like Bill Pullman, come and go without you really knowing what they are about. Similarly with the stress on the main character, both in terms of his family life where his family goes from one baby to three teenage boys, and his job where he takes pay cuts to fund the case; these are just reference points, dropped in for dramatic post marking but not explored.The biggest problem is the lack of an engaging central character around whom the narrative can revolve and so make the audience stay the distance for the serious stuff. The most obvious comparitor is Erin Brockovich where the crimes of corporate America are no less heinous but it is the central character that makes you take notice. Viewers still talk about Brockovich now and remember the film was about cancer from poisoned water, in a similar number of years forward it is unlikely viewers will be remembering Dark Waters which is a crying shame.",Dark Waters

It has none of the glamour or excitement of Erin Brokovitch (the story is similar), and is all the better for that.Lots of people believe that there is a cure for cancer that's being covered up.

It feels like the really good movies with huge entertainment value get attacked and then something like this gets nothing but love. I guess people that watch this movie are into this type of content because it's obvious what it's about, big company bad and many poor victims injured.This stuff happens either thru ignorance, negligence or accident. Most corporations will try to cover up and minimize the losses. Some worse than others but it's not as rampant as people would have you believe. When it happens it is usually awful and most time the company behaves poorly after the fact as well as before. I just don't usually care to watch a fictional movie about it. I'd rathers see the actual documentary for this kinda thing. Fictional movies, based on a true story or not are trying to get across a message, trigger your emotions and entertain you not bore you. Most real life incidents are way more boring than the movie. But really a 7.6 not for me. But I guess for people that want to be angry about that happened years ago, there are plenty of movies for them.",Dark Waters

I am baffled at how my country's government never bother to alert the public about this when it happened in the US. Not a single media covered it.The movie itself is well made, and Mark is superb actor, no need to mention.

179,AxProductions,A Great story told in a great way!,7,10 June 2020,"This is the great story of how, essentially, one or two people can break a multi million dollar company. You can feel throughout the film that this is a project that is specifically made through passion, and not to sell, and that's what makes it feel so real.
The acting throughout is impeccable, and it engulfs you into the story like only the top 30% of films do. Loved Marks performance, and the Farmer felt real as well.
Cinematography was also pretty good, with some great shots that will soon be classics I believe. And that is most likely due to the combination of work from set designers, making it feel like the real place.There are only a couple hiccup that I feel this film had. one was in the one helicopter scene during the mid section of the film. It wasn't that it was a bad scene, it just didn't fit in the rest of the film and I feel cutting it out entirely would have made the mid to end point of the film have slightly better pacing.The second one, I'd say, is how Rob Billot explains everything about the situation. The scale of the things only set in place when he explains them to his wife, however, the way this is edited and scripted makes it feel more like a mash up, or a cop out by the script writer and director to develop all these story points faster. I feel like adding slight clues throughout the film, and showing them with visuals rather than audio would have made a way better film.
I do understand that this might be due to time constraints, and therefore for the first time, I feel like a film (this film) should have been made into a series, as a lot of the points made throughout need more explanation.Overall this is an decently good film, about a tough topic, however some issues make it feel dull at pointsI definitely recommend you watch this film, but if you don't, you're not missing out on much, as a couple 10 minute YouTube videos can explain the situation better.",Dark Waters

181,kmjnhh123,We Have No Idea,9,2 March 2020,"Some people will find this film boring as it does have a lot of talking but it is relevant talking & you have to keep interest on what is going on in the film & what clues are presented throughout to build the story of the film. It is a very powerful film with a deep meaning on what really goes on behind the big logos we see on a daily basis, no one knows the hidden agenda of these big companies & what there out for, its all about money & profit.The first half of the film is about building the story & finding out what is going on, a farmer is desperate to get a lawyer to pursue as to why his cows are dying, chemicals are the culprit. So Mark Ruffalo who plays Bob in the film, decides to take this case on & has to go through a insane amount of paper work & documents to find out what the company's have hidden, it makes for a really interesting watch as he finds out little bit of evidence here & there to help his case while mostly everyone is against him. The film keeps you so hooked on what the outcome is going to be & through the film the years pass with not much happening as it just shows how hard it is to pursue these companies.Couple of bloopers i found in the film, in 2012 Bob was still using a brick Motorola phone, I'm sorry but in 2012 we had the iPhone 5, also the same cars were used in the film throughout the years which again they would of changed, especially in the later years of the film but i won't nit pick.But overall it was a really good watch with a deep meaning on what the bigger picture is & till this day they are still fighting for cases & that this chemical is a forever chemical. Scary to think what else is actually going on behind the scenes.Age - 25

185,ReadingFilm,The standalone Hulk film we've been waiting for,10,8 December 2019,"The countdown to today means it has to end eventually, unless they go futuristic on us. But Ruffalo's hand, I couldn't not think of Hulk, and naturally where it leads is not going to be a transformation but the breakdown; so the direct parallel makes this a film about 'heroism'. ""Better not to feel like a failure."" Opposite! Greater than success: a hero. These chemical agents in the water impact the receptor and create mutations. Hulk. We even see the outcomes. It's a giant synchronicity, or it's intentional, or accidental--I say this about every artist is they bring their entire body of work with them and constantly it's the case. Also the same biopic movie wife as always, she overplays something better in small doses, but the small dose creates an impact. Her stare is the world's. So impress her with some great heroism. And movie wives are best when they're in on it--even wicked--as when she whispers ideas to him in bed. I laughed at his reaction to her big oscar-meltdown, because it's sort of a lazy husband, same time his message is constantly clear: this is the road, complaining is futile because it's the road. Often we get a frame and if it's proper you create a fully functional mechanism that informs itself, like a great work of engineering. The pile of boxes in the room come early, hopeless to organize, and he does. It builds into his heroism, mastering this impossible knowledge, leading to this weary actualization. He is 'so' ahead of the villains that everything they throw at him he can conceptualize as the response, even down to surprising him by not playing fair, which only delays things. That the system cant keep up with his mastery integration builds this cat and mouse leading to another act to best them, the blood sampling. Villainous obfuscation vs an even greater act of integration, means moving from past to 'now'. It's also why it takes so long, ages him, and tears him down. It's a superhero vs a supervillain. Lastly, Haynes can do the auteur's satiric reality, but what I admire about him is he can clearly do without it. Even his auteur works strive to earn it and avoid the 'brand', and that's cinema is you humble to the craft rather than the other way. It's an easy trap, but it also means we must look for the motivator, the frame. And I think maybe he was offered the superhero films and chose this instead, and there is what it is. Because the car almost exploding, we got that last week, we get that every week, it's more the way it blurs the line that he asks there, wait am I in a movie?",Dark Waters

Rob is relentless in his quest for justice for victims, risking his career, family, and best friend, and his own health, but he keeps doing what's right.
The first half of the film is rather depressing, and the final emotional shock is very powerful.

The performances are excellent and the insanity of how this country balances environmental health against corporate profits is laid out for all to see. There are over 80,000 registered chemicals that are for sale in the world and less than 20 percent have any health or environmental toxicological research associated with them. Why? Because the law makes it the burden of regulators to prove there is an adverse health impact rather than the entity that makes the chemical responsible for doing this work before being allowed to sell it.PFAS is one of these chemicals for which there was no toxicity research associated with it. It was a chemical of concern due to its chemical properties of environmental persistance and bioaccumulation. However, it was completely unregulated and could be disposed along with regular waste.There are tens of thousands more chemicals that are widely sold and used for which there is no data and unregulated.

I appreciate that it's an important issue for him and he produced it, but he couldn't carry the movie with screen presence.

The movie has a smooth plot development that helps audiences understand why 'Dark Waters' is a must-see spectacle.",Dark Waters

I think at least a lot more right shots and reaction shots because they're both just so amazing to watch! Most of their shots were so far away, I was straining to see them!! Maybe on a big screen, I could have seen more. Unfortunately, thanks to covid, I had to watch it on my 50"" about 10 feet away. The music was wonderful. The acting was all seem less. The story was congruent and made sense, in such a bad way! This is evidence of the sick mind set that says it is legal and right if we can get away with it.

219,diffguy,Shaking with rage,9,2 January 2020,"In terms of storytelling, Dark Waters' most close associate that I've seen is The Big Short. Tonally, these two are polar opposites, but they both illustrate their convoluted and complicated stories of corporate corruption well. Well enough for any non-chemist, non-lawyer, non-doctor to understand the injustice that corporate overlords have exacted upon the public.The film is constantly tearing down the spirit of Mark Ruffalo, followed by brief, hopeful moments that Dupont will be held accountable for poisoning tens of thousands of people. These hopeful and demoralizing notes begin small. The idea that the EPA will help Wilbur Tenant, the farmer who had his cattle herd die from poisoned drinking water, is followed by Ruffalo realizing that report was written in part by Dupont scientists who will, of course, be corrupt. And that demoralizing note is followed by bestowing the hope that Wilbur Tenant will finally get his long sought chance for a $ settlement, and that's followed by the soul crushing scene of his entire family drinking water out of the tap, still poisoning themselves with no other means to change their fate.That was the scene that made me cry with rage. That nothing could be done to escape their death. What could they do without water? They're thirsty, and stressed, and their kids just want to come home from school and live normal lives. All I could do was cry tears of rage. Wilbur was not being served justice.The notes continue swooping from high to low. Ruffalo is served mountains of paperwork during the lawsuit against Dupont. Like, a laughable amount that no one could ever finish reviewing. But he sets to work anyway and finds the smoking gun: Dupont has known about the poison for decades. The film makes the audience believe we have Dupont dead to rights, but they wiggle out of it with legal maneuvering. When it has been years after the public blood testing, and no answers are given as to whether Dupont is at fault, the public gets angry at Ruffalo. All this pressure builds into him having a mental breakdown/siezure, and we all feared he would quit. Then, after he recovers, the call finally comes from the science panel that he was right. Dupont absolutely poisoned these people and must pay for their health damage. This movie is like an emotionally abusive boyfriend.Finally, we won, right? No. Dupont rips up the mediation contract (one would think this illegal) and now says anyone who has health problems cannot take part in a class action lawsuit, but can do so individually.And that's when we finally leave on the highest of high notes that makes you curse with joy and unleash primal, guttural screams of victory: Mark Ruffalo starts representing each of those West Virginians individually, wins tens of millions of dollars in the first 3 cases, and DUPONT GIVES UP. THEY PAYOUT THE BETTER PART OF A BILLION DOLLARS. WHOOOOOOOOOOOOO YEAAAH SUCK IT.",Dark Waters
220,thesmythley,Shows the true consequences that chemical companies have on people's health,10,29 February 2020,"This film certainly opens people's eyes to how environmental destruction is detrimental to people's health. It is also a lesson to how the era of self-regulation has enabled a lack of transparency and accountability by powerful global corporations who, motivated by profit, continually aim to obstruct anyone who challenges them.There are some very powerful, moving and memorable scenes here. It is easily the best film I have seen in a while as it is based on a true story, even though some small scenes have been fictionalised). It isn't a film for the fans of gladiatorial-styled superhero filmic spectacles. It is about real people and how doing the right thing in a weary world. This often means no reward but, regardless, it must be fought for and the film determinedly drives that message through.If you know little about how people's health is affected by some of the things we buy out of a simple assumption that they are safe, you might be in for a shock after you've watched Dark Waters.",Dark Waters

Mark Ruffalo is ok, not outstanding. His wife in the movie is so unidimensional it's annoying. The portrait of the farmer is so over the top it misses the mark. Most of the character are shallow and undeveloped.The plot is predictable and handled with a poor sense of pace.It seems a lot of people are giving this movie praise for the moral stance it makes and overlooking the cinematography of it all.For a much better movie about a legal David vs Goliath story, I strongly recommend Flash of Genius (2008).

225,seghers,Watered Down,5,8 April 2020,"I really wanted to like this. It's worthwhile topic that deserved a far better movie.
Mark Ruffalo seems half-asleep during the entire movie, plodding around, failing to say anything but a few obvious platitudes. Perhaps if he mustered a little anger, or eloquence, the movie might have been better. Maybe it was the writing? The pacing? The direction? One scene shows a street, and some cars, and lingers there, like there's something there we should see. What is it? No clue.
These kinds of movies are sort of review-proof. The story is so worthy of a movie, and is enough by itself to make anyone angry. This movie just wastes the chance. In the last few minutes the film gives some statements about the devastating and longlasting effects of this ""forever chemical."" Those crushing statistics alone have about 100x as much impact as does this entire slog of a movie.

Huge Story, Huge Complaint, Renowned Actors: Disappointing Movie.
Todd Hayne's ""Dark Waters"", supported by a bad script by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, rushes to tell us the whole story from the beginning of the film, that is, in the first minutes we know the entire plot, leaving only pending to discover, whether the villains will be penalized or not. It is a very poorly told film, terribly flat, without any rhythm or climatic moments, it could have been a good thriller, but Haynes instead decided on a very long (126 min.) and boring melodrama. It is also, very unprofessional, that the director cheatfully tries to trick us with a false tension, during the scenes of the parking lot, trying to give some life to his dying film.
The crooked frames are chaotic and unjustified. There is no direction of actors, throughout the movie we see a totally expressionless Ruffalo and a wasted Hathaway. Natural themes such as ""the greed and insensitivity of corporations"" could be the ""leitmotif"" of the film, instead they were replaced by banal events of work and daily life, so that it too, little by little went getting polluted until it succumbed.

Instead we are swept up in a second rate, predictable drama, with very little to discuss at the end except for the poor acting performances, boring editing and anaemic script.Due to the subject at hand - DuPont's gross negligence and mass poisoning - many on here recommend this movie as vital viewing.

Unfortunately, the production process in making teflon caused enormous local environmental damage in the town where this process was based, and specific health risks to those on the production line, dangers which Du Pont knowingly concealed for many years. The film depicts the lengthy legal battle to first expose the scandal, then to fight for compensation for the victims. Mark Rufallo plays the lawyer who reluctantly takes on the case, then gets drawn in deeper and deeper, as he slowly uncovers the scale and depth of what is involved, despite the cost to his career and the strain on his marriage. Although Rufallo may be more earnest than charismatic in the role, this enables the case to be the story, rather than the film being a vehicle for the star. In a tale that is as complex and lengthy as this, there are inevitably going to be simplifications and short-cuts, of characters and events.

Mark Ruffalo gives a strong performance as Robert Bilott, a lawyer hired by a farmer who suspects that DuPont are responsible for the death of his herd of cattle because of dangerous chemicals they're putting in the water.The results Bilott finds are shocking, made all the more terrifying by the fact that this story is based on real life events. Ruffalo is surrounded by talented actors, not least Anne Hathaway, who owns a couple scenes as Bilott's wife. The pacing of the film is just right, never dragging but never rushing either. Overall, this movie is enlightening and you won't be looking at your pans the same way again.",Dark Waters

This is the world we live in and this is how we approach issues of magnitude that's just incomprehensible to the average Joe. With ignorance.Not the defence attorney who took on Dupont.

273,asdfqaz123,Thank you,9,15 March 2020,"We all grow up watching hero movies, they often look like superheroes or movie stars. In real life, most heroes are people like Rob Bilott, who becomes a hero by simply doing his job. He could've easily walked away from this case and live a normal life but he decided to take it on and fight for his clients for 20+ years, it's a determination few people possess. I also believe Wilbur Tennant is a true American hero by not accepting his fate and insist on justice. Without him, we'd still be thinking Teflon is harmless.I really think this film perfectly combined a real story with dramatization, great acting with great scripts and cinematography. It's both educational and entertaining.

277,alex_cohen,David vs Goliath,9,28 March 2020,"One might argue that filling David's shoes is a rather big law firm, but this argument is irrelevant - compared to the industry's giant DuPont, it's a David nonetheless.
The movie tells a story of a epic struggle of a corporate lawyer (and clients he represents) and a huge chemical company. It has all the components of a good drama: corruption, deception and manipulation, dedication and sacrifice. This subject is interesting in its own right, especially (as stated in the end of the movie, just before the end credits) it does concern all of us. But, moreover, this film is about one man's obsession. People get hurt and do die. Due to someone's greed and disregard to ""little man""'s life. Someone ought to be held responsible and be brought to justice one way or another. There are many good people out there to take on such task, but only a handful of those who's willing to stick to it for over a decade. At some expense, I must add - it nearly cost him his career, his marriage and health. It takes a real obsession - you can feel it: he can't just drop it. No matter how hard it is, he keeps on going. And this what made it for me a compelling story.
Mark Ruffalo is great in it. Kind of reminded me of a work he did in two other great movies about men on a mission - Spotlight (2015) and Zodiac (2007). Anne Hathaway has a very few scenes in this movie, but delivers the point being made by this film. I have a soft spot for both Tim Robbins and Bill Pullman. In my opinion, they both were fine in their small parts.

280,jimjamjames,Knowledge is misery,6,28 March 2021,"The saddening truth behind the affects of the man made chemical, Perflurooctanic acid aka C8 are unlocked in a timely investigation by lawyer Rob Biolott, played flawlessly by Mark Ruffalo. This is a chemical used on numerous consumer products, including Teflon pans (up until 2015 in the UK) which enable nonsticking. We learn that high exposure to the chemical can be linked to various diseases.This is all recent history, and one definitely worth watching. As corporation cover up movies go this is in the same league as Erin Brockovich and Quiz Show. I found Dark Waters a little too over dramatic, for my liking and a little unnecessarily stress inducing - 99% of humans have traces of C8 in their blood...aaahhh!!!! You can't end a film with scare mongering fact like that! Where's the disclaimer 'only from high exposure, it can be harmful' or 'worry not, everything highly exposed is damaging e.g. The sun' perhaps this is just a reflection of my current COVID brain disposition, that's making me react this way.Great casting, and surprising to see an aged Tim Robbins. It was a little plodding at times, but you're routing for Ruffalo, with admiration. The film somewhat even looked chemically, with a filter reminding me of the look of Fight Club. Had thoughts of the going zero waste movement whilst watching, being that you should be mindful of products you are purchasing (packaging) and consuming (is this acid going to make my head full off)",Dark Waters

I enjoyed it, especially knowing the subject matter is interesting to pretty much anyone who has heard of the issues with certain chemicals in our world and the detrimental effects it can do to us. It reminded me of the tobacco scandal and society's research into the harmful effects of cigarette smoking (think The Insider). There were a couple of things lacking in this movie though - the killer punch ending and the music.

If you're old enough to be reading this you're old enough to have personal knowledge of the villain here, the chemical components of ""Teflon"".

All lawyers and doctors should care enough about people more than their bottom lines. Nothing wrong with prospering in our nation but not at the expense of our own interests in societal wellbeing.

290,holcombes-87981,Absolutely Fantastic,9,8 December 2019,"Apart from being an amazingly informative movie, this film has so many characteristics I appreciate and applaud. First of all, the acting was phenomenal. Mark Ruffalo absolutely shined in his portrayal of Robert Bilott. Likewise Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Victor Garber, and all other actors and non-actors in this film were marvelous. Now, when I say non-actors, a select few of the characters being portrayed were played by the actual individuals. Likewise, the actual Robert and Sarah Bilott made cameos which are revealed at the end. Their presence made the issue hit home that much more, especially that of Bucky Bailey, but you'll have to see the movie to understand exactly why that is.I left this movie fully acknowledging that it's the scariest film I've ever seen. There were no demons or ghosts or jump scares, but there was a brutal honesty that I myself was unprepared to face.I do want to be blatantly honest about the captivating nature of this film. It is an informational film and it is deeply involving legal proceedings and the like. In other words, it's a slow-paced film that will likely be best appreciated by mature viewers. If you're looking for a movie that will be loaded with action or suspense, this probably isn't the movie for you. Even so, I found myself invested in every moment of this film and you may just surprise yourself with how much you like it.",Dark Waters

305,benjaminbuss,"An eye opener, which shocks and drags in equal measure",7,28 March 2021,"This conspiracy drama is the shocking true account of a chemical company's coverup of its polluting of public water sources, and the damaging health implications inflicted on its victims.Mark Ruffalo convincingly plays the reluctant corporate lawyer approached to uncover the corruption, with the case taking over his existence for a number of years until its conclusion. Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins and Bill Pullman supply the very credible support, in gritty but relatively minor roles for their reputations.Director Todd Haynes is a dab hand at creating a picture with stunning visual credentials and Dark Waters is no different. The beautiful cold blues and yellow tones applied to the lens filter provide a real murky atmosphere in fitting with the story. Dark Waters leaves no stone unturned in its attention to detail with the plot, as paperwork after paperwork archives are sifted through and more and more evidence emerges in the quest for the truth. This prolonging of thread lines actually proves somewhat of a negative aspect of the film in certain regards as things burn far too slowly in places. The apparent lack of a prominent sound score is also amiss, with a feel of intensity and urgency lacking from the piece as a whole. As a powerful drama based on such profoundly shocking occurrence this production is highly credible. The movie cannot be faulted for its gloriously bleak visuals and flawless character portrayals. Whether or not the movies duration could've been shortened to its advantage is a question worth pondering. The spectacle does tend to drag at times leaving an overall sense of disappointment that Haynes' stunning visual account isn't quite as impactful as the severity of the scandal.",Dark Waters

And the really sad and scary part is it is based on true events, and their are still fighting to stop producing those extremely poisons chemicals.I think media should promote this movie more because then people get to know this well known civil and criminal cases, countless deaths, DuPont's own records they tried to hide, and on and on.Todd Haynes makes it entirely engaging and painfully true that death is a number compared to liability and that is how you can sustain cold hearted industry.",Dark Waters

336,reney-96617,A bit too mechanical,6,17 March 2020,"This is the Rotten Tomatoes consensus on Dark waters: ""Dark waters powerfully relays a real-life tale of infuriating malfeasance, honouring the victims and laying blame squarely at the feet of the perpetrators."" Sure, it is an incredible real-life tale; it does honour the countless victims and does blame the horribly guilty parties. But, geez, it was quite a dull ride.Sure, a film such as Erin Brockovich is sensationalist - a bit cheesy, but it was a hoot to watch, and I am still referring to it 20 years on. I bet, five years from now, when faced with someone else's Teflon pan and the evil legacy of the coating - the subject of Dark waters - I will be squinting and frowning, trying to recall even the name of this film.Take The big short as another example. It also told a real-life tale, also honoured the victims and pointed out the guilty, and dealt with very serious subject matter to boot. It was a thrill ride from beginning to end, with larger-than-life characters and quirky interviews. It also broke down very complex information into totally understandable bits of information.The miniseries Chernobyl was slow-paced and rather heavy, but riveting to watch, even though you knew what the outcome would be. You still hoped it wouldn't be so. In other words, you can go various routes when telling a real-life tale: you can be funny, you can be serious, you can be quirky, if you are entertaining.Perhaps this is not director Todd Haynes's forte, the real-life tale told in a straightforward manner. The man has quite the Rotten Tomatoes CV. In between Far from heaven (2003) and Certain women (2016), there are quite a few fresh tomatoes thrown in. Let's face it, the fact that he did not win an Oscar for Carol was an affront to mankind. I cannot quite explain what went wrong with Dark waters. I mean, even Mark Ruffalo was rather bland in this. And when was Anne Hathaway relegated to playing a teeny-weeny part as the boring wife? The only interesting character was Bill Camp as Wilbur Tennant, and he doesn't feature a hell of a lot.It is a fascinating story of corporate greed and environmental disaster. I did not feel the outrage.",Dark Waters

This is based on decades of documented and well known civll and criminal cases, countless deaths, DuPont's own records they tried to hide, and on and on. This isn't another ""liberal agenda"" film as some often state as a means of dismissal - this is about all of us and knows no political bounds.

Anne's acting was mesmerizing as always, also Mark was so convincing I'd believe he's really Rob. The screenplay was so natural and yet, not boring at all unlike most films in this genre.However, I'd say if it's not based on true story, it wouldn't make this much impact.

359,mdhaliwal-02125,Excellent and Disappointing at the same time!!,10,15 November 2020,"The movie is well made: good pace for telling a true story, complex scientific topics are explained for the everyday person, Anne Hathaway gives a great performance as the supportive wife who lives in an sexist world, Mark Rufalo portrays a passionate lawyer (rarely seen in the real world) together with a supporting cast that amplifiers the main characters and the overall story.Unfortunately the disappointing thing about this movie is the story itself - how can America have so many severe incidents that affect their own people, it's as if the American people are their own worst enemies. I mean - everyone loves money but to go out of your way and destroy the lives of thousands of residents is just psychotic - if the government / law isn't going to step in and help people immediately then don't be surprised to see so many anti-government/legal movements.This is definitely a must watch - hopefully someone will be inspired to stop these types of incidents from happening again.I'd also recommend checking out - Civil Action (John Travolta); Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts); Fahrenheit 11/9 (Michael Moore); and, Chernobyl (HBO TV Series).",Dark Waters

But I got to say if it wasn't a real case and concerning a huge amount of people it would be a pretty boring movie. The case although it took a pretty long time to come to an end end, it was pretty straight forward and without any twist or great set back whatsoever.
I think Mark Ruffalo's performance was ok but not great and Anne Hathaway's performance was good but her character simply didn't add alot to the story, besides that one scene in the hospital where she confronts her husband's employer.In conclusion I liked the movie for its informative part and I think everybody should see it just to know the case, but it could have been way better.",Dark Waters

This man really needs to go down in the history books. We need more people like Rob!As for the filmmaking itself, the movie is slow paced with a rough around the edges feel - hard to tell if it was the projection at my cinema or the cinematography itself but there was a few naff flares in the darker scenes which where off putting. It does have an independent look and feel rather than a polished Hollywood film. Some questionable editing in parts.Mark Ruffalo gives his usual performance. I was really surprised to see Anna Hathaway play such a tiny roll - but she was spectacular especially in the more tense/emotional scenes.I'll be telling everyone to watch this movie.

However, I tend to evaluate movies on three critical pillars : the story, the way it is told, and the people who are telling it. In short, the screenplay, the cinematography, and the acting.Dark Waters is a great story, a subpar screenplay that, I repeat, MUST BE SEEN. However, a documentary form might've been the way to go on this one.Acting was passable at best, and cinematography was nothing to write home about. As a movie in the artistical sense, Dark Waters was forgettable.You won't forget the story and message it carries anytime soon though.As I previously said, wouldn't made for a killer documentary.10 for the story, 2 for the movie - Let's call it a 6!",Dark Waters

The actual EPA investigation that happened was on perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, or C8), which was once used as a surfactant in the manufacture of Teflon, although most manufacturers have phased out its use.

390,sianmccann,Call yourself woke? This will wake you up!,10,26 January 2020,"Mark Ruffalo is amazing and the film will highlight the unjust lengths people have to go to for the freedom to be heard.
Just like Spotlight, If this does not wipe the floor at all the awards ceremonies. I will be amazed. Rob Bilton is an all American hero.",Dark Waters
391,tquilla,Disturbingly relevant AND eye opening!,9,23 December 2019,"This movie has me pondering every product I use now. Excellent storytelling. Fantastic casting. I even loved how some of the real characters were actually in the film as well. Good cinematography. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because it was slow in some parts. Overall, a must see that hopefully changes your life.",Dark Waters
392,farrowpeter,Superb! Scary but enlightening.,10,24 February 2020,Well done Mark Ruffalo for portraying a real life superhero in Rob Billot and for helping to raise awareness of just one example of a huge corporation putting profits before ethics.This movie and its subject matter should have received a lot more media attention than it has.Not the movie for those who wish to live in blissful ignorance tho. Unfortunately ignorance allows the type of behaviour exposed in this film to continue.,Dark Waters
393,fmouligneau,A MOVIE THAT YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY WATCH,10,28 January 2020,A great movie about a mass poisoning going on for years and that everyone should watch for its own sake and the sake of the next generations.

397,elviajove,Let's face the truth,10,24 February 2020,A somber but true story about the abuses of huge corporations. It's time that we the people rise up and face the evil of profit over lives. I had been wanting to see this film since December and luckily our Landmark Theater in St. Louis still has this awesome film playing - EVERYONE should watch it. I was not surprised that the Oscars totally ignored it - shameful!! Mark Ruffalo puts his money where his mouth is. I salute this true artist and human being.,Dark Waters
398,izdogshanghai,Incredible,10,15 March 2020,"Acting is brilliant, Anne Hathaway and Mark Ruffalo need Oscars for this the emotion they manage to portray is simply phenomenal! The entire story is so well crafted and no scene feels out of place or distracting. Given the climate emergency facing us, this is a film that is a must-see to underhand just what we are up against.",Dark Waters
399,PJ215,See this movie and share with everyone,10,19 April 2020,"PFOA may have been 'phased out' but what they replaced it with (GenX & PFBS chemicals) is still just as toxic to humans! Although US no longer produces PFOA/PFAS, it is still manufactured in other countries and ends up in products that are imported... Latest 'safe' levels are much lower than mentioned in movie - 7-11 parts per TRILLION!These forever chemicals and compounds disturb our immunity and endocrine system among others and cause countless types of ailments, including cancer - most of these substances claim they ease our lives by being stain proof, waterproof, nonstick etc but is convenience worth your life?The movie did a great job in unraveling this tale in a meaningful and riveting way and cannot believe such injustice is STILL right under our noses - I still can't believe DOJ dropped the investigation. We ought to criminally prosecute the DOJ for the negligence!It's convenience over life, people. Our only voice is our buying power - let's avoid the trapping of quick convenience over health of our earth, including ourselves. We are not only poisoning ourselves but our children and future generations with these synthetic compounds dubbed 'hand-me-down poisons' - what are we doing to change this?The low gross on this movie and failure to have such lackluster box office performance undoubtedly has to do with powers trying to silence the spread of being informed.Get the word out there everyone - humanity's future depends on it!",Dark Waters
400,wlwolfeinco,I was born in Parkersburg and the chemical industry used the rivers as their chemical sewers,10,5 June 2020,"My family moved from there when I was 11 in 1965 because of the pollution. My uncle worked for DuPont at the Washington Works and lived on the family farm a couple of miles downriver. My cousin died from an inoperable brain tumor at age 25 in 1983. We always suspected it was due to the chemicals, but there was no proof. The devastation left by DuPont, Union Carbide and others was sickening. My grandfather told us about swimming across the Ohio when he was a boy. We wouldn't even touch the water because of the pollution when I was a kid. This is a story that is way overdue, thanks to Rob Billot for having the strength and courage to pursue the story.",Dark Waters
401,ira-62,Accurate timely and extremely well portrayed,9,26 April 2020,"From the start, the movie begins by introducing the real people involved in this ordeal. Mark Ruffalo plays the real life lawyer who drowns himself into the case to lengths unimaginable especially when I think of lawyers that I know and what they are willing to sacrifice. As we see today, corporations whose main concern is profits and earnings are willing to do most anything . This movie shows what many of us suspect of corporate ethics - greed, manipulation of the truth and a ruthless pursuit of power at whatever the cost. Everyone in the movie seems driven to deliver a grounded truthful representation of what really happened,. From articles I have read the characters are shown in the movie are true to life. As for the facts the movie is based on the actually writings of Rob Bilott. He also helped make sure the film was faithful and accurate to what transpired over the years this case took place. A well written, well paced and well acted movie. I am glad I watched it and I have recommended to others.",Dark Waters
402,quuqmdag,Tense until the last minute,9,12 November 2020,Dark Waters tells a gripping story that is very informative. Despite its lack of action scenes it never loses its tension. It's nice to see that you as a small man can win a seemingly unwinnable war.,Dark Waters
403,neilsuzie,Disturbing,8,19 November 2020,"Had never heard of this movie but Mark Ruffalo plays the lawyer with such conviction. It made me cry in parts and very angry at how yet another corporate disregards human suffering and lives in pursuit of profit. And no one person is brought to account. Disgraceful. A definite ""must watch""",Dark Waters
404,raekwon-85947,Holly smokes,10,4 February 2021,What a great movie.... I can't believe I never watched this. This is a great movie about actual events that took place and probably always takes place in corporate America.,Dark Waters

406,elduffie-44489,THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FILM IN A DECADE!!!!,10,28 February 2021,This is a travesty. It is not shocking that this film did not get much traction. They are just too powerful. This is what you get in this country when you allow companies to get too rich and too powerful.,Dark Waters
407,shyamalabalram-93705,Excellent,9,5 July 2021,"Dark Waters is the best film I have seen last week
I liked the same sincevery good acting, story based on whatever happened in America, has good message for Americans, I think everyone living in America should watch it at least once
A corporate attorney (acted by Mark Ruffalo) fights with a very big Chemical company on behalf of a farmer (to start with and extends to many others who were also impacted) for the atrocities by the company resulting in health hazards including cancer, disfigures babies , but not limited to due to certain chemical materials being dumped into the neighborhood and / or certain chemicals added water, cooking utensils , soap etc
Though the end is predictable, it is still gripping , considering the fact that the attorney has to spend more than 15 years to win the case against this companyMark did wonderfully well supported by all others.",Dark Waters
408,fthpjqz,A MUST WATCH!!!,10,30 May 2021,"Great movie! Mark Ruffalo plays an astounding part. And the topic of the movie hits home by not only showing what corporations do and get away with. No only in the states, but imagine what is happening overseas with no EPA or other govt agencies to control this if they are not already bought off. American companies overseas love lack of regulation as they do not have to make the same capex investments to control their pollution. As an O&G worker, I have been to the west coast of Africa and seen the flares burning gas 24/7.",Dark Waters
409,summernolan,A must-watch,9,30 June 2021,"Dark Waters brings to light the corruption and manipulation companies like Dupont participate in daily. It is truly terrifying to think that we are still being sold products with Teflon today, simply because it is economically beneficial to Dupont.Mark Ruffalo's character, Rob Bilott, demonstrates the sacrifice it takes to personally involve a case like this into your life. We'd all like to think we would do the heroic thing and attempt to tackle a company like Dupont. In reality when it puts stress on your health, family, and seems impossible to beat, I'm not sure all of us would pass the test. It's heartbreaking to see small-town innocent people being exploited to benefit a large corporation like Dupont, and hits close to home for many of us. Everyone should watch this movie to understand more deeply the corruption occurring in the US between our government, judicial system, and large corporations like Dupont.",Dark Waters

419,mshellmowery,"Astounding movie, acting. Great drama,",10,19 January 2020,"This was an astounding movie on all levels. The acting was superb. Mark Ruffalo should have gotten an Oscar nod. Bill Camp should have gotten a nomination for his role (and A win) Viewers could easily believe that his character was played played by an authentic WV native. He was astounding. Mare Winningham, never disappoints. The only negative was Anne Hathaway. I think someone forgot to tell her that she was only playing a supporting role. Is it possible to over act in every scene? YES, she did. She wasn't believable in this role...it's like she kept trying to upstage her fellow actors, the script, ....truly hard to watch.
The movie was not nominated for any oscars.....not one. I couldn't quite understand that....Then....thanks to IMBD...I pulled up the cast. No diversity. Really Hollywood? It's a true story. But, since there was not enough representation from all people groups in the Appalachian foothills of a small rural West Virginia town....Hollywood looks the other way. They did know this was a true story, right?",Dark Waters
420,badmanchoper,Story Worth a Movie,10,30 March 2020,"I only knew that some sources say teflon is not healthy, but I don't know that the story was this HUGE. I was a little bit bored on the first 20 minutes, but when it come the struggle Rob faced, time flies and suddenly the movie was finished. The story is definetely worth shared, and this kind of movie should be encouraged to be made, so I give 10/10 for the story.",Dark Waters
421,rws-at-studio6-613-558413,"A must see for storytelling, acting and wrting.",9,23 February 2020,"Mark Ruffalo is great as lead in this important docudram about Dupont's chemical contamination and poisoning of a city where the plant is located. I think that the most shocking thing revealed was the information about testing done on employees that resulted in sickness and permanent injury as early as 1961. Early on, corporate executives knew of the hazards to the environment and willfully chose to exploit the ignorance of the community and chose to defy government rules for self reporting hazardous chemical discoveries. Just awful that anyone could do these things to other people. It looked more like mass murder than negligence.",Dark Waters
422,chesteve45,Mark Ruffalo Can Do Much Better!,4,29 November 2019,"I am sorry to say that this was a dreadful movie, a copycat of Civil Action that we come prepared to like because of the theme and our knowledge of the issues.
At least it could have been cut 30 minutes with nothing missing whatsoever. It was sloppy. Here is just one example: Anne Hathaway delivers a lecture to the CEO, whose good-guy motives defy explanation, after she is told she can go see her husband in the emergency room. She stands there giving a five-minute lecture? That highest-ranking guy, head of a company who defends chemical companies, suddenly and inexplicably supports our protagonist throughout the movie. The whole thing was, sadly, insulting.
And the role of the children? C'mon, Mark. You can do much better. We are on your side.",Dark Waters

When the movie started I assumed its a typical story of a cooperate vs little man story. But turns out this is THE story of Cooperate vs little man.
I'm in my twenties and this was the first time I heard about this. Thanks to Todd Haynes, Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway, I got a glimpse of the real life of a true-to-heart lawyer Robert Bilott, and his family's sacrifices, for the sake of saving all humanity from its own greed.
Cooperates will try to keep this unnoticed, please make many people see this as possible.
