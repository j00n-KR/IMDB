0,Leofwine_draca,Ghost train ride put on film,10,16 May 2013,"The Spielberg-produced haunted house horror POLTERGEIST is one of those perennial favourites, one of those classic 1980s films that survives down the years, my appreciation growing as each decade passes. It's one of those films I saw and loved as a kid, although I found it very frightening; THAT bathroom scene has to go down in history as one of the most purely disgusting ever put on screen. It's highly stylised, and Hollywoodised with it; if you're looking for something more realistic and disturbing, go check out THE ENTITY instead. This one's all about the spectacle, a fairground ghost train ride put on film.Elsewise, POLTERGEIST works very efficiency. There's the slow, creepy build-up, kept realistic and almost-believable, especially the effective stuff with the sliding chairs; intrigue builds upon intrigue, with some nice comic relief inbetween, and then everything lets rip for the pyrotechnic shriek-show in the second half. This latter stage is a masterwork of special effects technology, from miniatures to superimposed imagery and prosthetic effects work; I don't usually care for films that rely on FX too heavily but I'll make an exception for this one.And what a cast, too! Heather O'Rourke must be the epitome of the innocent young American girl caught up in a world of evil, and both Nelson and Williams excel as the exasperated parents who gradually become more deranged as the tale progresses. Of course, Zela Rubenstein's scene-stealing medium is remembered for a reason, and there's a nice little cameo for RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD's James Karen, too. Come the ending, with those graves popping out of the ground, well just wow: this truly is a great little film, that stands proud among the rest of the classics of the '80s.",Poltergeist
1,SnoopyStyle,"Funny and scary, one of the best ghost story",8,1 November 2014,"Steven (Craig T. Nelson) and Diane Freeling (JoBeth Williams) live in a Californian suburb with their kids Dana (Dominique Dunne), Robbie (Oliver Robins) and Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke). He's a real estate agent for the development that they're living in. Carol Anne starts hearing the TV people. There are strange things happening in the house. At first, it's just fun and games. Then it becomes more sinister when Carol Anne disappears. They invite a group of paranormal researchers from UC Irvine Dr. Lesh, Ryan, and Marty Case. More strange things happen and they call in spiritual medium Tangina Barrons (Zelda Rubinstein).This starts off with a traditional family, a cute little girl, and some funny moments. Then there is the superior acting, the scary stuff and the great effects for its time. It is one of the best ghost story horrors. There is just something about a little girl in danger. Effects have improved over the years but few have been done better.",Poltergeist
2,Hitchcoc,A Very Good Ghost Story,9,23 March 2006,"This is one of the first movies I ever taped. I had gotten cable and this was on HBO. It was utterly captivating. The neat transition from the household ghost that moved chairs to the ugly, vengeful ghost that must be approached to save the little girl (""They're here!"") It is so neatly set up with the housing development and the graveyard. The terror as the house begins to put forth the energy of these spirits. The scene when the heavy rain begins to wash the bodies up from under the yard is absolutely horrifying. This family is under assault, but until they know what is going on, they can only deal with the symptoms. This movie gives real estate developers a bad name (oops, that's redundant). To conclude, there are about six different scenes that will stick in my memory forever. That's a lot for a movie. I also loved the very last scene which I won't spoil. See this if you can.",Poltergeist
3,claudio_carvalho,A Classic of the Horror Genre,7,22 September 2015,"In the Cuesta Verde suburb, in California, the real state agent Steve Freeling (Craig T. Nelson) lives a comfortable life with his wife Diane (Jobeth Williams) and their children Dana (Dominique Dunne), Robbie (Oliver Robins) and Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke). Now Steve has decided to build a swimming pool for the family. One night, the Freelings witness Carol Anne talking to the static in their television set and telling that they are here. On the following days, the family witnesses weird events in their house and Carol Anne vanishes. Steve and Diane visit the parapsychologist Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight) from the university and she goes with her team to the Freelings' house. Soon she realizes that the family is living a poltergeist phenomenon. Further, Steve has a conversation with his chief Mr. Teague (James Karen) and learns that the community was built on a former cemetery. Will they be capable to retrieve Carol Anne from the demon that is holding the little girl?""Poltergeist"" is a horror movie written and produced by Steven Spielberg but directed by Tobe Hooper due to the contract of Spielberg of exclusivity while making ""E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial"" film. ""Poltergeist"" can be considered a classic of the horror genre, with an original story of haunted house. There are two sequels and one remake of this movie but none of them comparable to the original film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Poltergeist: O Fenômeno"" (""Poltergeist: The Phenomenon"")",Poltergeist
4,mark.waltz,The horror here comes from what you don't see.,8,28 October 2020,"This was destined to be a classic from the moment Steven Spielberg began putting this down on paper. He doesn't direct, only write and produce (still not an easy feat), and the direction of Tobe Hooper is outstanding at keeping Spielberg's vision alive. It's the story of a modern southern California home built over a gravesite which leads to the ghostly experiences occurring that result in young Heather O'Rourke disappearing inti the abyss. Mom JoBeth Williams and pop Craig T. Nelson bring in a group of paranormal experts (lead by Beatrice Straight) but it's poltergeist expert Tangina (Zelda Rubinstein) who seems to have the power to deal with it and get O'Rourke's Carol Ann back.For anyone who's ever gone into a park late at night and thought that the trees looked like evil beings, that began to believe that their toys were possessed or found old cemeteries fascinating, this is a magical ride of good vs. evil that they won't soon forget. There's a legend already behind the making of this, and in nearing its fortieth anniversary, that legend is as powerfully spooky as the film itself. Every moment of this film is powerful and feels so modern in the realm of the spirit world and in its making. The timeliness of this hasn't ages at all.With growing tension from the moment that O'Rourke sneaks downstairs and tries to engage with something in the TV's static (following the end of the broadcast day, the one untimely reference in the film), this builds to something that in spite if the evil involved is breathtakingly beautiful, almost like a ballet in how it is presented. Every prop in the film becomes an element of evil vision, and you'll never look at a clown doll or a walking robot toy or an empty swimming pool covered in muck the same way again.I only looked away once upon seeing this again for the first time in many years, knowing what was going to transpire with one of the paranormal experts when he went into the kitchen to make a steak. The acting is very natural yet intense with Nelson and Williams play and parents who are actually real people beyond their role as dad and mom, and Oscar winning Straight is quite touching. But the ground breaking performances by O'Rourke and Rubinstein are the heart and soul of the film, although it's haunting for the memory of teen actress Dominic Dunne whose tragic end was just one obstacle the film faced after the conclusion of the filming. The music by Jerry Goldsmith is a plus, and the special effects are simply glorious. This is one horror classic, a triumph in modern cinema, that is worth seeing over and over.",Poltergeist
5,classicsoncall,"""Y'all mind hangin' back? You're jammin' my frequencies.""",8,27 September 2018,"I much prefer the kind of horror in movies that slowly build with a degree of credibility rather than the slasher/gore stuff that so many fans seem to go for today. ""Poltergeist"" is that kind of film, though it did get a bit carried away with itself as it headed toward the finale. Back in 1982, my wife and I used to hang out with a couple in which the woman was a clairvoyant and seer, and I had to chuckle when Tangina Barrons (Zelda Rubinstein) made her first appearance in the story because she resembled our mutual friend at the time, only a smaller version. Otherwise I could picture 'Marcelle' in the movie because both had similar traits. The film grabbed me in other ways as well. As a kid, there was a tree behind my house that the neighbor boys imagined could reach out and grab you with it's branches. I always kept a wary eye on that tree, especially in the winter when our sleigh ride path would bring us dangerously close. The stuff you imagine as a kid can really frighten you; there's a house now on the spot that tree stood, and to my knowledge, it's not haunted. When I wrote my review of the Twilight Zone episode ""Little Girl Lost"" some eight years ago here on IMDb, I said I'd reserve judgement on whether that story might have influenced ""Poltergeist"" until I saw it again. Well I watched the movie last night some thirty six years after seeing it in the theater upon initial release, and there's not much doubt in my mind that Rod Serling's TV drama could have influenced this film, though there's nothing in the credits to suggest that, nor does the trivia page for this film. Still, there are a lot of similarities in both stories, though in the Twilight Zone episode, a little girl is 'stuck' behind the wall of her home in what's described as an opening between two dimensions.What I did find interesting on the trivia page was mention of actress JoBeth Williams (Diane Freeling in the movie) having a supernatural experience relating to her work on the film. Arriving home after filming, she would note that the pictures on a wall were crooked and would have to be straightened. The same thing happened to me with a number of original art pieces I had framed and hung in a workshop area of my home. In a month's time, I'd wind up straightening those sketches just about every day until they finally remained in position.But the better personal experience relates to that clairvoyant friend I mentioned earlier. About to transfer as a store manager to a new location in my company, I inquired what I might find on my first day there. She responded that she saw something dark and a lot of water. When I got to the store the next morning, about a dozen employees were waiting outside the store. When I asked why they weren't inside, one of them responded that there was a fire! When the store was finally cleared by the fire department, I entered a building that was smoke filled (dark) in which the sprinkler system had been activated (lot of water). Needles to say I was pretty amazed, but relieved that no poltergeists were to blame; it was a stack of papers that caught fire when a refrigeration unit began it's exercise cycle and got hot enough to ignite the material.",Poltergeist
6,gavin6942,Spielberg and Horror... A Different Kind of Film,6,29 May 2009,"The daughter (Heather O'Rourke) of a family (headed by Craig T. Nelson of ""Coach"") encounters the ""television people"", spirits she can hear talking inside the television's static. One night the house shakes and the spirits come loose... can the family live with their new house guests, who may be more than merry pranksters? This film is Tobe Hooper's other big hit, following ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" (though the under-rated ""Funhouse"" is far better). Allegations persist that he is largely undeserving of credit, being guided almost entirely by Steven Spielberg. True or not, this does not take away from the film, which is nothing short of legendary... from the theme song to the iconic phrase ""They're here""...Now, I can see the Spielberg influence... this has a very ""E.T."" vibe to it, and is for the most part not nearly as dark or gritty as Hooper's other work. No excessive violence or torment. Sure, maybe some scenes are disturbing or creepy... but not much beyond a PG rating. (Of course, PG does not mean a bad horror film... look at ""The Gate"".) But one has to sympathize with Hooper -- with Spielberg writing, producing and storyboarding, what wiggle room is left for the director?I do not have much to say in the way of criticism for this film. It has stood as a classic for over twenty-five years, and with good reason. I do not see much sense in my saying what others have said, and even if I were to trash it -- which I will not -- it really deserves to be seen simply for its place in horror history. If nothing else, enjoy the beautiful score.",Poltergeist
7,lee_eisenberg,That's the '80s!,10,4 January 2006,"More than simply a horror flick, ""Poltergeist"" also functions as a relic of the early '80s: the book about Reagan, the ""Star Wars"" merchandise, and most importantly, the move to the suburbs. The plot of course portrays a suburban household where some very ghostly things start happening, and how the Freelings - who live there - have to cope.Among other things, this may be the only horror movie that begins by playing ""The Star-Spangled Banner"". You'll probably have a very different impression of the TV after watching ""Poltergeist"", mainly because of the movie's most famous line. And I don't know whether or not it changes anything that Dominique Dunne (Dana) died while the movie was in the theaters, or that Heather O'Rourke (Carol Anne) died six years later.All in all, this is a top-notch movie. The special effects, more than just being ""cool"", actually do give one a sense of fear. The cast does a great job. Craig T. Nelson as dad Steve is fatherly but can blow his top. JoBeth Williams as mom Diane puts a real spin on the image of the suburban housewife. Beatrice Straight as Dr. Lesh looks weird but keeps her cool. James Karen as developer Mr. Teague plays his usual mealy-mouthed character. And that one scene with JoBeth Williams (you know which one I mean)...well, let's just say that the teenage boys must have liked it the first time that they saw it. Oh, and this movie may make you wonder whether your house was built somewhere where it shouldn't have been. Perfect.",Poltergeist
8,jboothmillard,Poltergeist,8,12 December 2005,"From producer and writer Steven Spielberg, and director Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Salem's Lot) I had always heard about this from many sources and seen clips from the film, so I was definitely wanting to watch it. Basically the Freeling family: father/husband Steve (The Incredibles' Craig T. Nelson), mother/wife Diane (Stir Crazy's JoBeth Williams), teenage daughter Dana (Dominique Dunne), young son Robbie (Oliver Robins) and sweet little daughter Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke); live a happy normal life in the peaceful Californian suburban neighbourhood Cuesta Verde. One night though Carol Anne acts strangely after waking up and seemingly talking to the television transmitting static, and this becomes a fixation, to the point when an apparition emerges, creates an earthquake, and the little daughter says ""They're here!"" (number 69 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes). Then strange things start happening in the house, such as glasses and utensils breaking or bending, chairs moving and stacking, and a spot on the kitchen floor that moves something forwards towards the wall. With these things going on it becomes even more apparent that the phenomena is getting dangerous, and Robbie ends up being attacked and almost swallowed by the outdoor old backyard tree, and Carol Anne is sucked into a portal from the closet door. The Freelings can still hear her voice coming from inside the television, so they invite a group of parapsychologists to investigate the paranormal activity, and Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight), Ryan (Richard Lawson) and Marty (Martin Casella) are just as shocked as the family are. After a little while they also bring in eccentric dwarf spiritual medium Tangina Barrons (Zelda Rubinstein) who says the spirits are in some sort of limbo and not at rest, and one particular demon has been identified as the ""Beast"" who is restraining Carol Anne. The paranormal team eventually conclude the entrance to the other dimension is through the portal in the bedroom closet, and the exit comes out of the living room ceiling, so Diane with rope tied around her passes through to try and bring their daughter out. After Tangina has left, claiming ""this house is clean"", the Freelings prepare to move out and go somewhere else, and during the last night in the house the Beast and other spirits return with a vengeance, coffins with rotting corpses emerging from the ground and many things attacking. Steve realises that his house construction colleague Teague (James Karen) built Cuesta Verde over the cemetery, with the bodies left behind and the gravestones moved, and in the chaos the Freelings race for the car and drive away, while the house implodes into another dimension, and the end sees the family check into a hotel, and the television shoves outside the door. Also starring Michael McManus as Ben Tuthill and Virginia Kiser as Mrs. Tuthill. The last time I watched this it was absolutely terrifying, the second time it did still have some great scary moments, and it is certainly a film to recommend, with a good build up of creepy things all the way to horrifying and grisly moments with some terrific special effects, a fantastic horror. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Music for Jerry Goldsmith, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. It was number 84 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!",Poltergeist
9,ccthemovieman-1,A Shocker 25 Years Ago,6,17 February 2008,"It's funny how you can view the same movie at different times in your life and feel totally opposite of how you viewed the same thing years ago. Like most people, I loved this film when it came out and enjoyed it both at the theater and on VHS a handful of times. However, after a long absence and watching this a couple of years ago, I went the other way.On the last viewing, I got totally turned off in the first 20 minutes thanks to Jobeth Williams' character, ""Diane Freeling."" A foul-mouthed, pot-smoking Mom is going to be someone we are going to root for? Not me. She's a main character in here and way too abrasive. By now, she and the film look too '70s. For something that many people thought was a kids' movie because it was the same year as Stephen Spielberg released his ""E.T.,"" it was certainly anything but kiddie fare.However, I cannot deny this wasn't another entertaining Spielberg effort with some wild, memorable scenes. Who can ever forget little Heather O'Rourke sitting in front of the TV set and saying, ""They're here!!""",Poltergeist
10,Tweekums,A classic haunted house story,9,27 September 2018,"Diane and Steven Freeling live in a growing suburban community in Southern California with their three children. Life seems pretty good for the family but then strange things start to happen. Five year old daughter Carol Anne gets up one night and starts talking to the television; this is after broadcasts have shut off. Soon after items start to move on their own; at first this is seen as rather fun but it isn't long before it gets scary. Their son is attacked by the spooky tree outside his bedroom window. While this is going on Carol Anne disappears into a bright light emanating from her closet. The family are sure she is still in the house as they hear her voice coming from the television. The family call in the experts and they work to find out what happened and how to get her back.This is a classic haunted house movie; it may have been made in 1982 but it still provides some good chills and impressive special effects. It isn't surprising that the story was written by Steven Spielberg; in many ways it can be considered ET's scary cousin... instead of a young boy befriending a friendly alien a young girl, from a very similar family, is kidnapped by a malevolent entity. Director Tobe Hooper, of 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre' fame adds to the films scariness with plenty of scary moments but little real gore. The cast does a fine job; notably JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson as Diane and Steven. Young Heather O'Rourke makes Carol Anne one of the most memorable child characters in any film and Zelda Rubinstein who is also unforgettable as Tangina Barrons, the medium who works to rescue Carol Anne. The explanation for the events are a little cliché as is the end where we get more problems after it is stated that the events are over... this isn't really a problem though. Overall I'd say this is a must see for horror fans as it is a classic of the genre.",Poltergeist
11,ma-cortes,Likable family is suddenly horrorized by otherworld spirits in its house of terrors,7,16 March 2009,"This known story deals about the suburban Freeling family(Craig T Nelson,JoBeth Williams,Heather O'Rourque and Dominique Dunne,Griffin Dunne's sister) that encounter its house invaded by weird ghosts who abduct their six years old little girl named Carol Anne(Heather O'Rourke). The parents hire a psychics(Beatrice Straight, Richard Lawson and Zelda Rubinstein) to resolve it.Excellent terror story plenty of screams,chills,thrills and a little bit of humor. God and dazzling though primitive special effects by Richard Edlund. Suspenseful, frightening musical score by the master Jerry Goldsmith. Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti.This hight budgeted movie is surprisingly written and well produced by Steven Spielberg. Director Tobe Hooper puts accent on suspense and atmosphere as in terror happenings. What transpires in the two hours longtime is a thriller that will leave you physically and emotionally drained. Horror fans should be entertained.Followed by two inferior sequels with little common sense and coherence, as Poltergeist II(1986) by Brian Gibson with similar casting and Poltergeist III(1988) by Gary Sherman with Tom Skerrit, Nancy Allen, Lara Flynn Boyle and Heather O'Rourke who died after the movie's release at 12 age, while his sister Dominique Dunne died at 22 years old killed by her boyfriend.",Poltergeist
12,BA_Harrison,Enjoyable popcorn horror from Tobe Spielberg.,8,15 June 2010,"Although Tobe Hooper is credited as the director of Poltergeist, it's common knowledge that the film's writer/producer Steven Spielberg had more than a little creative input: the film's content and style—the suburban setting and scenes of familial domesticity, lavish Jerry Goldsmith score, and flashy Richard Edlund effects—are much more redolent of the man who gave us ET than the one who unleashed Leatherface on an unsuspecting audience in '74.But even if Hooper was nothing more than a puppet for an exceedingly busy Spielberg (who was also directing ET at the time), it doesn't change the fact that Poltergeist is a solid piece of mainstream horror entertainment—a tasty concoction of spooky supernatural occurrences, sudden shocks, touching emotional drama, nail-biting tension, and even a little gore, all wrapped up in a satisfying, shiny, big-budget blockbuster package.Whilst it would have been extremely interesting to see what Hooper might have done with the film had he been left to his own devices, there are no guarantees that the end result would have been as impressive (after all, the director has had his fair share of turkeys): let's just be grateful for what we've got—a damn fine film that still stands the test of time (and which features not only one of the freakiest clowns in cinema, but also one of the finest movie MILFs in the form of JoBeth Williams).",Poltergeist
13,moonspinner55,Grab-bag ghost story...,6,8 March 2009,"Opening to theaters at about the same time as Steven Spielberg's ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"", this much-nastier supernatural story was quickly seen at the flip-side of that commercial release. Everyone in the know was aware that Spielberg conceived this film as well, and his homey sense of humor and penchant for carnival ride-type scares is evident in the direction (particularly at the beginning and near the end), although Tobe Hooper receives the official credit. An ordinary family living in sprawling suburbia is initially tantalized--and then, quickly, terrorized--by ghosts in their home (the smallest child's closet seems to be the poltergeists' entrance into the abode, although they first make contact via the television). Hooper gets a good, jovial rhythm going which may feel somewhat slight or derivative, and yet is also amusing at the same time. By the mindless third act, with bodies piling up, the film ditches originality for ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-styled effects, and one is distinctly aware of the plagiarism. **1/2 from ****",Poltergeist
14,paul_haakonsen,This 1982 classic is the best ghost movie ever made...,10,1 August 2014,"I believe that ""Poltergeist"" was the very first horror movie that I saw at the age of about 7 or 8. I have very fond memories of the experience, and to this day I am sure that this movie is the movie that kindled my romance with the horror genre. I remember being scared out of my socks the first time I saw it.And now, some 32 years later, ""Poltergeist"" is still one of my all-time favorite horror movies and always have. I can't count how many times I have watched parts 1 and 2, but not overly keen on part 3.Right, well, for those not familiar with ""Poltergeist"", then the story is about the Freeling family; Steve (played by Craig T. Nelson), Diane (played by JoBeth Williams), and their children Dana (played by Dominique Dunne), Robbie (played by Oliver Robins) and Carol Anne (played by Heather O'Rourke). The Freeling family live in an idyllic suburban place named Cuesta Verde. The youngest daughter, Carol Anne, starts talking to the TV and soon after, harmless events start to occur as chairs are moved about by their own. But things quickly take a turn for the worse and what started out as harmless events become life threatening, and the five year old Carol Anne becomes taken into a ghostly realm, trapped within the house. The Freeling family call in parapsychologists for helping them get their daughter back.The storyline is so well thought through and there is a great build up of suspense and scares through the movie. It starts out idyllic and simple enough, then escalates to harmless paranormal pranks, up until the Freelings are fighting an unseen force who has taken their daughter from them.For a movie from 1982, then ""Poltergeist"" manages to keep up its own right even today in 2014. The effects are still great today. Of course by today's standards they are considered crude and obsolete. But I still enjoy the movie tremendously.The movie is very well directed and helped so greatly along by the vibrant camera-work. And the production value also really helped the movie in the right direction.""Poltergeist"" wouldn't be this impressive if it wasn't because of the great cast. And the people were doing wonderful jobs with their given roles. And especially Heather O'Rourke, she was just a star in the making, and she was taken away far, far too soon, and may she rest in peace but her memory will always live on.One of the most impressive things in ""Poltergeist"" is the haunting soundtrack scored by Jerry Goldsmith. This is without a doubt the most disturbing and scary soundtracks I have ever listened to. It is so outstanding that I had to invest in the soundtrack on CD, and just listening to it causes the hair on your neck to stand on end.""Poltergeist"" is an important milestone in horror cinema, and it is without a doubt one of the best ghost movies ever made to grace the screen.If you haven't already seen this 1982 classic, then you owe it to yourself to get to it. ""Poltergeist"" is a MUST have for all fans of the horror genre.",Poltergeist
15,Quinoa1984,and the moral of the story is... kill your TV (maybe),7,19 March 2015,"An idyllic family. Typical football games with friends for the dad (sometimes with remote matches with the; fun arguments at the breakfast table with the kids; goofing around between parents at night when the kids are (supposedly) tucked into bed, maybe with a little pot, hey, why not; and the kids having their little 'I'm afraid of this' in the dark sort of thing. This is what writer/producer/sorta-director Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper concoct as the set-up here. And it's terrific, for the most part. And then the scares happen, the roller-coaster of a haunted-house that they've constructed. That's fine as well, especially given the effects hold up for today. Then comes Zelda Rubinstein as the resident Exposition-cum-Ghost-Slayer, really awesome climax. And then there's climax number two. Hmm...Poltergeist is a Steven Spielberg production first, Hooper film second (maybe we should call this a 'Hoopberg' film). If there is any trace of Hooper - in that sort of hapless, halfassed 'Auteur' explanation - it may be in some of the quick, gotcha-sty;e horrific editing (think those shots of Marilyn Burns' face and other montages in Texas Chainsaw). But everything is else is Spielberg, no matter what anyone says on the production, and of course most say it was him doing most of the creative heavy-lifting. If E.T. was his A-side work for 1981/1982, this is the B-side - no less filled with high-manipulative orchestral strings and chorals, albeit Jerry Goldsmith (though it's no less merited than Williams if less iconic), and playing to the family audience. Yes, the family audience, so what? It's enjoyable, popcorn fare as far as a kind of super-charged, intense, sometimes very well acted film (Jobeth Williams is really good here, never less than believable and showing heartbreak and joy and humor in equal measure, Craig Nelson too, the kids, well, that's another story), and it's not to slight that it can be enjoyed ""for the whole family"". My A-side B-Side comparison is not being facetious, it is what it is: if the kids want their spirits to soar, they can fly with the bug-eyed alien across the moon. Or, if they want to see lots of cool s*** flying around and spooktacular savings, look no further than Poltergeist.It has such a fantastical set up and mostly enjoyable mid-section, and dynamite special effects that hold up, that it's easy to forget the biggest liability: it has two g*ddamn climaxes. That might not be terrible, except that after you're done with one crazy horror roller-coaster, and you think things are about to wrap up, you're taken very soon after on another, and there's not much actual surprise for this given the once-again slow build-up to it. Adding to this, it's the only time, in the last ten minutes, that I was befuddled by the characters decisions - spoiler, I dunno, Don't GO BACK IN THAT HOUSE ITS FRIGGING EVIL! But, all in all, Hoopberg have at least got more on their minds creatively and character-wise than the horror flicks of today; ironically, Spielberg would later consult on the first Paranormal Activity.",Poltergeist
16,BandSAboutMovies,Still scary!,8,29 April 2018,"F a movie is a great film, does it matter who made it? I come from advertising, where it's hard at best to figure our credit and uncouth to loudly demand it. So the controversy about this film - whether Spielberg or Hooper directed it - doesn't really matter to me Because the important thing is that it's a great movie.Steven and Diane Freeling (Craig T. Nelson from TV's Coach and the voice of Mr. Incredible from The Incredibles and JoBeth Williams, Stir Crazy) are living the American dream. After all, Steve is a successful real estate developer. They have three great kids. And they've recently moved into a planned community called Cuesta Verde. Sure, the newer houses in the plan look much better. And you can't even watch a football game without losing what channel you're on because the houses are so close together. But it's the American Dream, right?That TV is the fixation of America in this movie, starting with the National Anthem and continuing with the people inside the TV that fascinate their youngest daughter, Carol Anne (who would sadly die at the age of 12 of cardiac arrest and septic shock caused by a misdiagnosed intestinal stenosis). The connection between the hand that emerges from the TV and the young girl is so powerful that it shakes the entire town before she announces the film's best-known line, ""They're here."" All hell breaks slowly loose over the following day. A glass of milk breaks out of nowhere, drenching daughter Dana (Dominique Dunne, daughter of writer Dominick and brother of Griffin, she would be killed by her stalker ex-boyfriend John Thomas Sweeney at the age of 22). The son, Robbie (Oliver Robins, Airplane 2), has his silverware twist and turn after he uses it. Furniture slides and rearranges at will, even in front of more than one person.Here's the beauty of this film. These teases start slow and you expect the Val Lewton jump scare model, where the pressure will be let off after a minor scare. But once a tree emerges from the backyard to crash through the window and pull Robbie outside, the movie jumps onto a rollercoaster track. While saving their son, Carol Anne disappears into the closet and can only be heard through the TV set.They turn to parapsychologists Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight, Chiller), Ryan (Richard Lawson, Scream Blacula Scream, Sugar Hill) and Marty, who discover that there is more than one ghost. That info is confirmed when Steven finds out from his boss Lewis Teague (James Carren, The Return of the Living Dead, Invaders from Mars) that Cuesta Verde was built over an Indian cemetery.Dana and Robbie are sent away and Tangina Barrons (Zelda Rubinstein, Teen Witch, Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon), a spirit medium, is called in for help. She explains how they have to get Carol Anne back from spirits that are not at rest. There's also another ghost, the Beast (which uses the same sound effect as the MGM lion roar), who has their daughter restrained. Diane enters a portal to the beyond to bring her daughter back and they both emerge covered in ectoplasm as the house is said to be clean.Steven believes that it's anything but, so he gets the family ready to move. On their last night there, he goes to quit his job while Dana goes on one last date before leaving town. The Beast attacks, turning Robbie clown doll into a demon and pushing Diane all over the walls of her room before throwing her into the backyard hole that is due to be a swimming pool. The bodies of the dead begin to explode from the ground, some in coffins, some just covered with filth and rot. Steven screams into his boss's face that he may have moved the cemetery's headstones, but the bodies were left behind. Finally, the house collapses within itself as the family drives away. As they stay in a Holiday Inn, unsure of their future, the TV is pushed outside.Poltergeist is really a must see horror film. It sets up so much so effectively and does a great job of paying off each scare. It'd be followed by two sequels and a TV series, which we'll definitely be getting to.",Poltergeist
17,Coventry,Horror or pure Marketing ???,4,26 December 2003,"To me, Poltergeist is the perfect proof that you only need a big name to create a successful movie. Do you honestly think Poltergeist would have reached the status it enjoys now if the name Steven Spielberg wasn't attached to it? I seriously doubt it because the story is average at his best and contains no groundbreaking elements what so ever. It's a childish ghost story about a house that was built on an ancient burial ground. The restless souls make contact through a little girl and make her vanish, eventually. The entire production is a Spielberg project and therefore, it received a lot more credit and praise than it actually deserves. Even though Tobe Hooper is credited as being the director, it is Spielberg's style that overrules the film at all times. Don't watch this film if you're a Hooper fan and you're expecting to see another raw, brutal and low-budgeted film like his masterpiece, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. In his own production, Hooper proved himself to be a innovating and creative storyteller who makes the most out of a simple topic. He has the ability to build up an atmospheric tension without much use of special effects and that's why he fails here. Hooper clearly couldn't handle the overload of visual and sound effects. Poltergeist contains too many sentiment, drama and morality to appeal to horror fans. It might manage to impress young children or inexperienced fans of the genre, but the more developed horror buff will laugh hysterically with this plot line. There are many decent (and overlooked) ghost stories out there to discover, don't waste your time on this fairy-tale. And besides, if you take my advise on this one...you'll be saved from the utterly annoying Zelda Rubinstein. This midget-actress looks like the ideal cast for about 2 minutes, then she becomes a real bore and very annoying to listen to.",Poltergeist
18,hitchcockthelegend,We know it as the beast.,6,4 March 2008,"The Freeling family are happy and functioning perfectly well until one night their youngest daughter announces that thru the TV, the supernatural are here!Poltergeist divides the horror crowd big time, the gore fans are simply not impressed by the events in the film, while ghostly supernatural fans such as myself see it as a wasted opportunity. But strip away the flashy production and you start to see the core joke of kids infatuation with the goggle box, so yes, the film could easily be titled under the banner of being a Black Comedy. But be that as it may, and lets not be under any illusions here that, Poltergeist is not a knowing wink wink horror film of substance, the film really could have been a truly terrifying piece of work to cater for all tastes, and I firmly believe that that was the main intention of the makers from the off.Thus lies the chief problems with Poltergeist, it tries so hard to cover all bases it gets that confused to the point it veers from tedium to shock and back again before you have time to digest, and it kills what should have been a genre masterpiece. There are moments in the film that chill the blood, the sense of creeping menace hangs heavy during a storm, a toy clown becomes evil personified just by being lit in the stormy light, and then? Well it violently switches to something involving a tree that wouldn't be fit for Creepshow 27! On the film goes, suspense with chairs and pieces of meat, and then BAM...monster time! It just doesn't work, it's a collage of genre splicing that both director Tobe Hooper & producer Steven Spielberg are firmly to be held responsible for, because it's obvious that both their signature's clash to create an uneasy bedfellow.Yet as uneven as it is, and as blatantly plagiarised as it is of Twilight Zone episode Little Girl Lost, I still find myself enjoying watching Poltergeist, with its slick production and some memorable moments; the clown, poor darling Heather O'Rourke saying ""they're here"", the first chair sequence, and the always creepy Mrs. Tuthill, all things that help to make it a frustratingly enjoyable nights viewing. 6/10Just don't go into the light afterwards I guess...",Poltergeist
19,Theo Robertson,Genuinely Creepy Horror,8,2 August 2013,"This was a very popular film amongst myself and my peers when it came out in the early 1980s . One major reason for its success is melding the mundane setting of middle class middle America with a supernatural premise similar to THE EXORCIST from ten years earlier . This is summed up with the scene as Steven and Diane Freeling knock on their neighbours door and as they are bitten by mosquitoes they ask if their neighbours know of any supernatural occurrences at their house . We can all relate to our homes and our homes becoming resident to evil spirits is a bit too scary to contemplate . It also touches on child abduction which is a parents worst nightmare The director probably doesn't have too work too hard in scaring the audience with this movie . All he has to do to keep the camera still cut the sound then when he's safe in the knowledge that the audience are settled he turns up the sound full volume and shows a scary image . It's a cheap trick but done perfectly with POLTERGEIST and I would have liked to have seen this on its initial release in the cinema where the audiences popcorn would be hitting the roof There is some debate as to who the real director of the film with many people stating that they believe Spielberg is the true creative force behind the movie . This seems slightly disingenuous to credited director Tobe Hooper and the scene where the man looks in to the mirror , about the only scene where there is genuine gore in the movie , does have the Tobe Hooper trademark as does the use of sound mix and swirling which he used to very great effect in LIFEFORCE three years later Some people might think POLTERGEIST has a rather dated tame look but this is to miss the point as to how films were made 30 years ago . Nowadays everything is a CGI carnival where every film you've seen just looks exactly like the last film you've seen where film makers think creative sequences involve sitting in front of a computer screen . Some of us the good old days whenever that was and POLTERGEIST reminds us of the good old days",Poltergeist
20,Scarecrow-88,Poltergeist,8,17 April 2009,"I remember catching a special inside look to the making of POLTERGEIST in one of those 15 minutes clips introduced from Turner Classic Movie's vault and you could get an idea how involved Producer Steven Spielberg was in the overall production of the movie. After watching it again, POLTERGEIST is distinctly a Steven Spielberg picture, just without his name under the director's credit. I feel bad for Tobe Hooper..it's the THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD all over again with Hooper taking the Nyby credit, not leaving an indelible mark that defines his style at almost any point(..perhaps the face peeling away to reveal a skull or the graves bursting at the end were partially his, but I figure if this were his film, the family wouldn't have escaped intact). Despite that tiresome debate, I felt that what excels in this movie is the superb acting from about as good a cast as you could ask for. From top to bottom, the cast is uniformly excellent..the film establishes a family you can identify with, and the suburbia backdrop is ideal for the fantastic twist at the end. It's perfectly 80's as, at one point, you see Realtor Craig T Nelson reading a Ronald Reagan biography while wife Jobeth Williams spokes a dooby. The supporting cast is simply divine with particular work from Beatrice Straight and Zelda Rubinstein adding an incredible amount of value to the film. Straight's work opposite Jobeth Williams is impeccable.The plot is infinitely Spielberg..a middle class family discover that their home is being invaded by poltergeists who kidnap daughter Heather O'Rourke holding her due to the spirits wishing not to depart into the light. The reason the spirits are restless is uncovered at the very end in quite a hair-raising finale as the bodies of buried dead rise from the earth ""seeking revenge"". James Karen's limited role is of vital importance in that he represents corporate greed, lacking any kind of conscious in his decisions on starting neighborhood projects on ""hallowed ground."" Zelda Rubinstein, of course, bursts onto the scene in an unforgettable portrayal of a ""paranormal house cleaner"". Beatrice Straight is a psychologist who operates a small paranormal group whose interest lies in helping those who are supposedly haunted(..or to prove if clients are making bogus requests). I can not praise the performance of Straight enough and her character so emotionally invests in this victimized family, there's such warmth in her moments on screen with Williams..you believe this woman genuinely cares for them. O'Rourke is adorable in her iconic performance as Carol Anne, just a beautiful girl who stirs your heart which is important for the plot because you need to wish for her safe return from the place between the world of life and death. Richard Endlund's team really provide some stunning set-pieces with what were state-of-the-art effects at the time as we witness the series of paranormal activity which plague the Freeling family. Wonderful melodic score from the late great Jerry Goldsmith. Some terrific supernatural monsters, wonderful light effects, and great use of skeletons all provide visual eye candy. Some thrilling sequences include the tree which wishes to swallow Oliver Robbins(..as well as the scene with the creepy clown doll which attempts to strangle him with it's arms), Jobeth Williams being pulled across the walls unwillingly, and O'Rourke's room being sucked into the closet where a vortex exists. Dominique Dunne(RIP)has a minor part as the older sister in the Freeling family, but makes the best of it with such an independent attitude, a cynicism that is expressed in scenes like when O'Rourke buries her dead bird and when she flips off construction workers ogling her.",Poltergeist
21,Doylenf,Still scary to watch...but ultimately over-the-top and preposterous...,6,19 June 2005,"POLTERGEIST is an original haunted house movie that offers some real chills along with some good performances. Craig T. Smith is especially good as the head of a household who has to deal with supernatural happenings of the wildest sort. But there is one major problem with the script.The storyline would have us believe that when the child disappears, the parents wait for a day or so before calling in a poltergeist and then a clairvoyant to find their child. They never once think of calling the police or detectives about the strange disappearance of their missing child after a complete search reveals the girl to be missing, not to mention the horrific happenings within the house itself.However, worrying about credibility is something the viewer can put aside once the happenings start. The award winning special effects are enough to convince you that things really are startlingly real and the tension builds nicely as the film spins to a dazzling climax involving graveyards and tombstones.Nice work by JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Smith, aided by a sterling supporting cast--especially Beatrice Straight as a frightened out of her wits clairvoyant and Zelda Rubinstein as a determined, no nonsense poltergeist. The weird happenings are more than a bit over-the-top, even for a story of this sort. Amityville's horrors seem mild by comparison.Years ago, a little gem called THE UNINVITED, told a more graceful ghost story with just as much horror and twice as much subtlety without all the graphic special effects. There is nothing subtle about POLTERGEIST. All the way you can detect Steven Spielberg's influence on script and direction.",Poltergeist

The family fights to get her back.Sounds silly but it all works. You're given a very likable family, fantastic special effects, taut direction (supposedly Tobe Hopper directed but I have my doubts), a good script and some enjoyable shocks. Also the film is saying something about TV--I'm not sure what it is but it's in there!The acting is just great--Craig T. Nelson is good as the father, JoBeth Williams is great as the mother, Oliver Robbins very believable as their son. O'Rourke and Dominique Dunne are OK--sadly, this was Dunne's final film (she was killed by her boyfriend shortly after the film's release) and O'Rourke died a few years later while doing ""Poltergeist III"". Also, Beatrice Straight and Zelda Rubinstein are lots of fun as ghost busters.The direction by Steven Spielberg is also good. I know it's credited to Hopper but come on! This looks, feels and plays like a Spielberg film. Scary, funny, absorbing--still a great film 20 years after it was made.Warning: Some of the film is pretty gruesome. It originally got an R rating until Spielberg requested that they drop it to a PG. This film taps into childhood fears very well...not for small children.",Poltergeist
23,poolandrews,Classic haunted house horror.,7,25 December 2005,"Poltergeist tells the tale of the Freeling Family, mom & dad Diane (JoBeth Williams) & Steve (Craig T. Nelson) plus their three children, the eldest Dana (Dominique Dunne), Robbie (Oliver Robins) & their youngest Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) who live on the newly developed Cuesta Verde estate. They are a very happy family who appear to have a nice life, that is until one night it all began. The night Carol Anne sat in front of the TV & started to talk to it, from that moment on their lives would change forever as the house in which they live is full of evil poltergeist & Carol Anne discovers she can communicate to them. Spooky things begin to happen, objects move on their own, rooms vibrate, the TV goes nuts & cutlery begin to bend. At first these odd occurrences seem strange but not really dangerous, however during one stormy night an old tree outside Robbie's window comes alive & grabs him, while Diane & Steve help Robbie the other poltergeist inside the house take Carol Anne into their world with the intention of keeping her. Diane & Steve are distraught as they can hear Carol Anne's voice plead for help, they call in paranormal investigators Dr. Martha Lesh (Beatrice Straight), Dr. Marty Casey (Martin Casella) & their assistant Ryan (Richard Lawson) in a desperate attempt to get Carol Anne back...Directed by Tobe Hooper Poltergeist is a fine haunted house horror although generally speaking I don't really like this sub genre as they tend to make for dull films. The script by Steven Spielberg, Michael Grais & Mark Victor is a bit patchy, there are long periods where things slow down considerably & then it will liven up again with a burst of paranormal action. I'm almost certain that this approach was deliberate as we have to care for the Freeling family for any of this to work & by the end we do care for them. As a whole Plotergeist works very well although there are a few lapses in logic like it's never explained that clearly why these poltergeist want Carol Ann or how an entire estate of houses could be built with any of the builders digging any of the coffins up (I mean they're only six feet under the ground, right?).Director Hooper was apparently overshadowed in the creative department by Spielberg which is not wholly surprising. There are some effective jump scenes & some nice atmosphere with the huge tree that comes to life, constant thunderstorms, a creepy clown that comes to life, ghosts, monsters, maggot covered meat & a gory bit where someone rubs the skin off their own face plus a garden full of rotten corpses. He even manages to make an ordinary TV seem almost eerie.With a supposed budget of about $10,700,000 Poltergeist was a well funded film. Technically the film is good, I would imagine most of the money went on the special effects which are decent enough but I get the impression that they would have impressed a lot more back in '82 than in '06 when compared with todays CGI driven effects. The acting is strong by all involved although the pint-sized Zelda Rubinstein as Tangina annoys. Actress Dunne was strangled to death by her boyfriend before the film premiered & O'Rourke died of intestinal stenois several years later.Poltergeist is a good film that works on several levels & is an absolute must for any horror fan out there & anyone who likes a decent scare. Thus far two lame sequels have emerged, Poltergeist II: The Other Side (1986) & Poltergeist III (1988) but the original is far superior to both of those. Definitely worth a watch.",Poltergeist

Genuinely scary and not at all predictable at times, it does put most of today's horror movies in the shade.The special effects haven't aged well, unfortunately, looking quite sloppy at times.Good performances all round, but especially from Jobeth Williams and Heather O'Rourke (as the youngest daughter).",Poltergeist
26,Boba_Fett1138,My favorite horror movie.,10,7 October 2003,"It's not the scariest movie I have ever seen but it certainly is the most fun to watch.Unlike many other horror movies this movie has very little gore but that doesn't mean it's not scary. It has lot's of sounds and visually scary moments. The tree and the clown scene are two of this very scary scene's!Also unlike many other horror movies this movie is in a way fun to watch. The movie also have seem to be made with lot's of fun and there are some typical Spielberg comical moments and dialogue. Just one of the things that proof to me that Spielberg was more then just a producer/writer. Other things that proof this are the characters and the way some of the scene's are shot. Even the atmosphere is the same as in ""E.T."" that Spielberg made the same year. I don't know what Tobe Hooper did for this movie but it can't have been much.The cast is excellent. Rarely have I ever seen such a great realistic and natural portrayal of a family. I especially like Craig T. Nelson as the father of the family. The characters that aren't part of the family are mostly extremely entertaining such as the neighbor Ben Tutthill or the pool workers who have to take at least one bite out of everything that's in the kitchen. But also of course Zelda Rubinstein as the extremely small but smart and wise Tangina Barrons.Another wonderful thing about the movie is the cinematography, the editing but especially the music by Jerry Goldsmith. It's too bad he didn't won an Oscar for it but if you have to compete against John Williams score for ""E.T."" you just don't stand a chance and then it's no shame to lose.The special effects are typical 80's like and can now days be described as with all respect; campy. They can be compared with the one's used in ""Ghostbusters"". But for some reason it adds to the charm of the movie and I extremely like it.Wonderful movie with some scary moments that still is very fun to watch.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Poltergeist
27,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Great effects, but a better script could have done wonders",7,29 September 2004,"Not being a big fan of supernatural horror/thriller, I may be somewhat biased against any movie that has a theme like this, with haunting and ghosts and all, but I have to admit, I really enjoyed this film, despite not being able to pay attention to the whole thing and thinking that the script was somewhat poor. I have never really believed any of the supernatural/more-between-heaven-and-earth stuff, but this film actually managed to make it scary and exciting. The plot is decent, but it drags too much for too many non-effect scenes, especially just after the first hour has passed, and most of the scenes involving the clairvoyant. The pacing is decent, but as I said, the film seems too slow after about one hour or so, and I couldn't keep watching attentively. It surprised me, actually, as I had enjoyed pretty much everything leading up to that moment. The acting is decent, but nothing special... not a big surprise really, as most of the actors are unknowns. This didn't really hurt the film, though, as they seemed credible enough. The characters are well-written and credible, though I found the character of Dana, the teenage daughter, to be an almost entirely redundant addition to the family/group of main characters, as she really didn't do anything in the film... at all. The special effects are extremely well done, I didn't find a single one to be poorly executed. The direction is pretty good, but not good enough to manage to keep my attention for the just less than two hour runtime. The script is somewhat poor, and the story seems to be made up to showcase the - admittedly great - special effects. The film also seems to try a little too hard to provide comic relief, possibly to reel in a bigger audience; not to say that it didn't work... I laughed at just about every piece of comic relief that the filmmakers sent my way. However, I think that they just made us, the audience, laugh a little too much for us to take it seriously, in the end. Maybe that's what brought the movie down... or maybe it was the so-so direction in the last half of the film... but most likely, it was just the script. I recommend this film to fans of supernatural horror, and possibly fans of Spielberg and Tobe Hooper, seeing as they both had quite an effect on the final cut of this film(though, according to the rumors, Hooper did far less than Spielberg). I give this film a 7/10, just for entertainment value. If I hadn't found it so damn funny, intense and well done special effects-wise, I probably would have given it a lower score. 7/10",Poltergeist

All of the special effects are pretty nifty, and hold up well considering the film's age. And there's a terrific score from Jerry Goldsmith.

31,AlsExGal,This scared me to death at age 24,7,20 June 2021,"I left the lights on the night I saw it. Because this does not take place in some classic looking haunted house, with some scary mythology attached to it. This happens in a modern house in a typical suburb. It looked like a house in my neighborhood. That nobody could afford to own at the time because of 18% interest rates in 1982, but that's another story.It involves a typical family. The wife is a homemaker. The husband sells new houses in the same neighborhood that the family lives in. It must have been a slow work day for him because who could have afforded these houses in 1982 with 18% interest rates? But I digress. There is a teen daughter from some unmentioned first marriage because she only looks 15 years younger or so than Jo Beth Williams who plays the mother. There are two kids age 7 and 6 that belong to the second wife. The youngest, Carol Ann, was born in the house.So the horror starts with harmless stuff like the kitchen chairs rearranging themselves when you're not looking but escalates quickly. And the movie tag line ""It knows what scares you"" turns out to be so true. Remember when you were a kid. What scared you? Lightning storms? Big leafless trees that looked like some kind of being with lots of arms? Clown dolls with macabre smiles? It all plays into it.Stephen Spielberg ""ghost"" directed this one. You could always tell by the preponderance of wind machines and seemingly meaningless close ups - hallmarks of 80s Spielberg.The one thing that really dates this - The poltergeist originally gets into the house when the husband falls asleep in front of the TV late at night, the Star Spangled Banner plays, the channel signs off, and then there is no signal. Cue the poltergeist. Today, channels never sign off. There is always some infomercial, with the set dressed like the old CNN Larry King Live show to add credibility, yelling at you how you can have product X for only 19.99 a month. The poor poltergeists of today are trapped listening to this nonsense, waiting for a chance to escape that will never come! Oh the humanity.It doesn't hit me like it did when it first came out, but it is still good enough with a very shocking ending that it is still worth a a look.",Poltergeist
32,Uriah43,An Excellent Film which Stands the Test of Time Fairly Well,8,15 September 2020,"This film essentially begins in a quiet subdivision in Southern California known as Cuesta Verdi with a real estate developer named ""Steve Freeling"" (Craig T. Nelson) having fallen asleep in front of the living room television with nothing but a test pattern now showing. He is then suddenly awakened by his young daughter ""Carol Anne Freeling"" who appears to be having a conversation with the television even though it is emitting nothing but static. The next night she again comes downstairs and while she is talking to the television a ghostly hand comes out of it followed by an earthquake that rattles the entire house. Not long afterward several bizarre things begin to happen in the house which initially startles everyone but as they continue their shock turns into amusement at the playful antics of what appears to be a friendly ghost of some sort. Unfortunately, things take a much more sinister turn one night when an evil force suddenly appears and not only terrifies the entire Freeling family but also abducts Carol Anne through a portal in her bedroom closet. It's then that her voice is heard through the television which prompts Steve to immediately contact some people at a nearby university who are researching paranormal activity. Sure enough, they rapidly agree that there is an evil spirit residing in this house and after an extremely terrifying incident they request the services of a spiritual medium named ""Tangina Barrons"" (Zelda Rubinstein) with the hope that she can exorcise the spirit and rescue Carol Anne before it is too late. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I remember watching this film when it first came out on VHS and was delighted by it. Admittedly, it isn't nearly as horrific as some of the other films which focus on the paranormal but even so it has its own charm none-the-less. I especially enjoyed the performances both JoBeth Williams (as Steve's wife ""Diane Freeling"") and the aforementioned Heather O'Rourke as well.

34,kannibalcorpsegrinder,One of the greatest haunted house films of all time,10,12 October 2016,"Moving into a new house, a family finds that their suburban home is built over the unmarked graves of a burial ground and are subject to a series of increasingly violent ghostly attacks and forcing them to rely on paranormal helpers to stop their antics.This is one of the best haunted house films. Among the better qualities here is the fact that the film really manages to play quite well with the ability to generate a viable atmosphere which quite a few films in the genre never quite manage. This starts with the fact that the house looks creepy to begin with, which always helps, but the inside isn't so it looks like a normal house and this one looks like it could happen to a normal everyday family. That's what makes what happens at first such a nice twist in that the poltergeists don't want to harm and instead want to play. The early set-ups here where they initially get possessed by the spirits in the house of the electrical charge floating across the room from the TV set to the wall socket leading into the earthquake that signals their arrival to chair-stacking and the the great scene in the kitchen where instead of picking up the chair and throwing it across the room at the characters the poltergeists have fun by sliding it across the floor, which is a little creepy and the false sense of security is just right to lure you off track all give this a solid sense of eeriness in these segments. Once the film gets going and their true nature becomes apparent, it has one great chill after another when they bring in the paranormal team by bringing in these high-tech equipment and other gizmo's is shocking because that starts in on the more thrilling scenes. From the crew's first experience in the haunted room or the chilling sequence of the hallucination of the one victim pulling his face apart and their spectral encounters seen on the video monitors, there's quite an impressive amount of enjoyable scenes here that really pick the action up in this section. Once we learn of what has happened to the house, it just becomes a roller-coaster ride through to the end as it takes that creepy backstory and flows together nicely with the ending. That action-packed ending is another spectacular sequence full of new ideas about not only battling the demons but also the different way of battling the house itself which creates quite a thrilling and spectacular sequence that leads into the fine finale. Not only is there yet another truly engaging and spectacular confrontation with the main ghost in the bedroom which is exceptionally thrilling but after escaping the spirits the family gets out of the house and into the front yard when dozens of skeletons begin to pour out of the ground. That is such an action- packed ending that it just makes the beginning of the film seem like nothing really much happened and definitely sends this out on a high note. Alongside the chilling effects work done on the ghosts, these here are the film's positive points and hold this up over it's minor flaws that don't really have much detrimental issues with. The main issue of contention here is simply a point of getting kind of tired of having the house be haunted by having it rest on an ancient burial ground. It's way too clichéd and falls into the same lack of creativity that so many use and really sticks out as being clichéd. Otherwise, there's not much wrong here.Rated PG: Violence, Language, mild drug use and children-in- jeopardy.",Poltergeist

36,Aaron1375,Rather good ghost story.,8,11 April 2003,"This movie was a rather good horror ghost story from 1982.  In fact, it was a pretty good horror movie considering it was rated PG.  The story has a family who experience some strange going on's in their house.  It starts off small enough with little things happening like chairs being rearranged and objects sliding across the floor.  Unfortunately, these seemingly harmless happenings turn more horrific as a tree tries to eat their son, but this is just a distraction as the ghosts take the couples daughter to the spirit world.  The couple has to turn to experts to help them get their daughter back.  For some reason the daughter can be heard through the TV, especially on channels with static.  This movie is good and fun to watch.  Sure, none of the things depicted here are probably possible, but it is a movie.  The finale is a bit over the top, but like I said...it is a movie, just have fun with it.  The first part of the movie has rather good comedy as well and there are some more laughs scattered here and there through the movie. There is also a rather cool scene of a guy tearing off his face.  What gets me though is the people who say this movie and its sequels is cursed.  This is because four of the stars in the movie died.  In the end though the gal who played the daughter was murdered, the Indian and the really old man were, well old, and the little girl died of complications of some illness. All these was just coincidences.  If either Craig T Wilson or JoBeth Williams had died during these years instead of any one of the others you may have had a point.",Poltergeist
37,zetes,"Okay ghost story, but a little too loud and obnoxious at times",7,2 November 2008,"I guess there's no objective reason for it, but, in my mind, ghost stories should be subtle. In general, I think all horror films should be subtle. Poltergeist is anything but subtle. It's a loud, flashing, exploding horror film. The basic story: a suburban family is terrorized by ghosts. It starts innocently enough, with a young girl hearing voices come out of a television, forks bending and chairs being moved. Three minutes later, though, ghostly hands are shooting out of televisions, beefsteaks are crawling around like slugs and giant demon heads are popping out of the closet. It's all too much, too fast. Watch the scenes in The Exorcist where objects begin flying around the room, then contrast them with the scene in Poltergeist where the paranormal investigators open a door and see the objects there flying around. The film was directed by Texas Chainsaw Massacre auteur Tobe Hooper, but the marks of its screenwriter and producer, one Steven Spielberg, are all over it, and not generally in a good way. That's not to say I didn't like the movie. In all honesty, it has a lot of memorable moments, from the iconic ""They're here!"" to the chair stacking sequence. There's a really good use of a false climax, which I imagine caught people off guard at the time.",Poltergeist
38,Sylviastel,A Hollywood Classic Thriller Just in Time for Halloween!,10,19 October 2006,"Poltergeist became famous because it had a stellar star cast featuring Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams as parents in a California suburban home in a new development. Their children are played by Dominique Dunne and Heather O'Rourke who both sadly died before their time. Anyway the cast also features Oscar Winner Beatrice Straight as a parapsychologist and Zelda Rubenstein as the psychic. The story begins with little strange occurrences in the house. It isn't until O'Rourke's character, Carol Ann, gets trapped in the bedroom closet that we don't get to understand that she is being held hostage by a poltergeist and how to get her back. As a student of the paranormal, it is highly unlikely that this event would ever occur but you can't be too sure. Anyway, O'Rourke will always be Carol Ann Freeling to us. She died tragically during the making of Poltergeist III from an illness. If she had lived, she would have been a beautiful woman but she is timeless and trapped in our image as the blonde child. Her older sister Dana Freeling played by Dominique Dunne was murdered by her boyfriend. They are both buried in the same cemetery. While the other cast members have moved on, their loss is still felt now watching the film. It's a good entertaining film. When I was a kid, we all pretended that we were Carol Ann in the closet.",Poltergeist

Possessed trees, swimming pool skeletons, free-roaming kitchen chairs . . . and those Goldsmith strings aren't doing anybody any favors.

When he was a child he hated lightning and thunder and there was an old tree that use to rub against his bedroom window and caused him many problems trying to go to sleep. Steven also looked at television and thought that people were watching him. While this film was in production, Spielberg was busy making another film ET and therefore he gave Tobe Hooper the opportunity to direct this picture. As we all know, Carol Anne Freeling, (Heather O'Rourke) was a young girl in this picture and she started seeing people in her TV and started talking to them and some of them started a great deal of trouble to her mom, dad and older sister. Craig T. Nelson, (Steve Freeling) was the father in the household and JoBeth Williams, played the role as Diane Freeling the wife. This is a very scary film and it started a series of other films.

'Poltergeist' is unsettling, it questions you the thoughts, it raises. You witness a family breaking, you witness the supernatural take over them. It's a difficult story to make and comment upon.What also stands tall in this cult-hit, is the acting. Late Heather O'Rourke delivers a splendid performance, and evokes the intuition within the viewer each time she appears. Craig T. Nelson suits his part and performs with sincerity, while JoBeth Williams is flawless.

42,StevePulaski,The most elegant film of its genre I have yet to see,9,21 May 2015,"Even more than three decades after its original release, Poltergeist remains the most elegantly made supernatural horror film I have yet to see. Unconcerned with payoffs delivered through the drudgery of jumpscares or convoluted setups that do nothing but squander the inherent simplicity of these kinds of films, Poltergeist so flawlessly weaves through storytelling components, atmospheric attention, tension, and pleasantly controlled chaos, creating the complete package of a film that proves that blood need not be shed and ghosts can be included in a good horror film.The film revolves around Steven and Diane Freeling (Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams) and their three children, Dana (Dominique Dunne), Robbie (Oliver Robins), and Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke), who encounter an unrelenting supernatural spirit when Carol Anne, the couple's youngest, finds herself able to communicate with the family's Television set when it's tuned to complete static. Strange events begin to occur in the Freeling home - everything from glasses breaking and furniture altering startles the family. The culmination of these strange events happens when Carol Anne is sucked into the Television set one day by an unknown apparition, who continues to haunt the Freeling home whilst holding Carol Anne captive. The family must find a way to get Carol Anne back to safety along with either finding a way to rid the spirit of the home or finding a new home themselves.Much has been made about who actually directed Poltergeist, as Steven Spielberg, who was also directing E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial at the time, couldn't have his name as director on both projects due to contractual obligations, sought assistance from Tobe Hooper to bring his vision to life. The relationship between Hooper and Spielberg was said to be less a cooperation and more a monopolization by Spielberg, who found Hooper to be more-or-less a ""yes man,"" excited to work on a mainstream project and simply trying to remain an active positive on the film. While the film bears a campiness in its videography similar to Hooper's known style in both The Funhouse and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, there is a Spielberg- level scope on display in terms of capturing a cacophony of action with his evident clarity.Spielberg has a way about his shooting that reveals an uncommon amount of professionalism within his work. He can take a few million dollars, as shown here, and turn it into a creative spectacle, or he could take hundreds of millions of dollars and turn it into a blockbuster. Here, Spielberg and Hooper work to give Poltergeist just the right amount of leverage visually to make it easy to take seriously, but infuse just the right amount of camp and low budget horror in certain scenes (specifically the ""they're here!"" scene in addition to the end sequence) to make this a collaboration of different styles fit for the horror genre.Poltergeist remains entirely clear in its visual scheme, even when the action turns wild and arbitrary circumstances begin to take place. Being one of the first of its kind for a mainstream audience, the stigma of ghost movies being childish and relatively ""kiddy"" in nature was something that had to be surpassed and forgotten with the creation of Poltergeist if it wanted to succeed and be hailed as a great film. Thankfully, the talent on display here assures competence with every turn thanks to Spielberg, Hooper, and the trio of writers (Michael Grais, Mark Victor, and Spielberg himself). This, at times, is a legitimately terrifying film that thrives on slowburn suspense and unique visuals rather than the bare-bones inclusions of low-budget horror films. Rather than a momentary diversion, an experience and a frightening world was created within Poltergeist and that among its visual scheme, simple-but-effective storytelling, slowburn tension, and pacing contribute to its elegance not only within its subgenre but its larger genre.Starring: Craig T. Nelson, JoBeth Williams, Beatrice Straight, Dominique Dunne, Oliver Robbins, and Heather O'Rourke. Directed by: Tobe Hooper.",Poltergeist

And it is very disturbing and a very cool story. But I was never really into the ghost stories per say. They're just not too appealing to me. And you have to admit that the acting and lines are beyond cheesy. The old lady was a little over the top.The special effects though were very cool. And the whole story over all was original. But like I said, the acting and the lines just can't get out of your head. You don't know wither to laugh or scream at certain moments.

44,Rainey-Dawn,Fond Memories,9,30 June 2014,"I was born in 1972 and lived out in the country where we had no cable TV. I recall we had 4 major TV stations and that was it - all 4 of these stations would go off the air at a certain time. It was not unusual to go to sleep while watching TV and wake up to pure static! I also recall flipping through the TV channels and would sometimes see ""ghostly images"" from the antenna that could barely pick up the distant station -- as a kid being 4 to 5 years that scared me - but my parents explained to me what those ""ghostly images"" were. In 1982, I was 10 and Poltergeist came out. Seeing Carol Anne in front of a staticy TV set reminded me of my very early childhood which made Poltergeist a bit more frightening for me at the time.The movie is pretty good - scary in a lot of places especially when you are 10 years old and see meat crawling on the counter top then spilling out with maggots *shivers*. Anybody hungry for steak?! And the old tree outside of the window gave me the creeps as a youngster along with those toys which reminded me of a few I had when I was about 5 or 6 years old.Even though I was 10 when I first saw the film I was freaked out - very scared watching the movie. It reminded to much of some things that creeped me out when I was around the 5 year old mark. Oh yes - one more thing that gave me the shivers back then was the Poltergeist Theme (music) by Jerry Goldsmith! I had a copy of it and would play it over and over because I love being scared and I found it haunting! I have fond memories of the film and I do recommend it for a good Halloween haunted place/ghost story!

46,OllieSuave-007,They're here!,9,7 May 2014,"Poltergeist is one of the first ghost/horror movies I've seen, where a family of four are visited by spirits in their home. At first the ghosts appear friendly, but soon turn menacing and monstrous, terrorizing the family and kidnapping the youngest daughter into their world.I remembered seeing the scenes with the daughter pressed against the TV and the dreadful tornado sequence. As I watch it again years later into the 2000s, being a movie made in the early 1980s, it still holds a great amount of horror, as its elements will grip you and send chills down your spine. This movie doesn't rely on gore and violence to make it entertaining, but rather relies on the appearances of the ghosts and the frightening powers that they are able to unleash onto the unfortunately family, highlighted in very polished and keen special effects.The screenplay and story by Steven Spielberg, Michael Grais, and Mark Victor were well-written, giving us a compelling plot, and the direction by Tobe Hooper is top-notch, making the movie brilliant and original. The acting was superb and the family (Craig T. Nelson, JoBeth Williams, Oliver Robbins, Dominique Dunne, and Heather O'Rourke) gave a stunning and heartfelt performance.I have always been fascinated by the supernatural and become excitingly scared when listening to eerie and frightening ghost stories being told. Putting a ghost story onto the big screen that embodies just the right touch of horror elements resulted in a movie that is a must-see for any ghost-genre movie fan.Grade A",Poltergeist
47,Red-Barracuda,Mainstream 80's ghost movie,5,16 March 2010,"Poltergeist was one of the big horror hits of the early 80's. It showcased what was then groundbreaking special effects and combined the talents of producer Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper. The story is extremely simple. A family begins to experience intense poltergeist activity in their home. It begins innocuously enough and then spirals out of control in increasingly more deadly ways. Paranormal specialists are then brought in to record and explain the nature of the phenomena, which turns out to be related to an old disturbed graveyard.Looking back, it's quite difficult to see what all the fuss was about with this movie. While it doesn't exactly take long for spooky supernatural events to occur, they aren't always executed for maximum effectiveness. A case in point involves the single best moment in the film. The scene in question is when the mother is in the kitchen an turns her back for a couple of seconds only to then turn back and see all of the dining room chairs perched up on the breakfast table. It's an extremely simple and brilliant idea; a very scary way to show a supernatural presence. However, instead of building on this tension, the film proceeds to next show the mother placing her daughter in the middle of the floor in an American football helmet, and laughing joyously as her little girl is propelled across the floor by some unknown supernatural force. It just deflates the tension and doesn't ring true. And to a certain extent this happens too often in the early stages of the film, where the threat is dealt with in a far too unconcerned manner. It's really only when the film-makers decide to treat their poltergeists as a genuine malevolent threat that the film starts to pick up momentum. And everything does eventually end in a crescendo of otherworldly mayhem.Much debate has ensued regarding whether Poltergeist is primarily a work of Spielberg or Hooper. Certainly on the face of it, it seems more indebted to Spielberg's style, with its story of an everyman family battling the odds against evil. It certainly doesn't seem to bear too many of the hallmarks of the director of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. But I guess we shall never know, and I suppose ultimately this is an example of a collaborative effort where the producer is a hugely powerful film director in his own right. But forget those two creative forces for a minute because in many respects the real star of the show is the late Heather O'Rourke who is perfect as the little girl who is a conduit for the evil spirits. Her real-life early death is well documented but it is nevertheless a terrible tragedy.Overall, this is a decent enough horror film; it's just that it hasn't aged as well as some others from the same time. This may have something to do with it being so indebted to its special effects, which by today's standards aren't anything remarkable. If you're a fan of mainstream 80's movies though, then this one could be of interest.",Poltergeist
48,sddavis63,A Great Ghost Story That At Times Goes A Bit Too Overboard,7,10 October 2011,"""Poltergeist"" is surely one of the best ghost movies ever made. It's suspenseful most of the way through, and at times (and I'll say several times) it's downright frightening. It introduced into the lingo one of the greatest and most memorable lines ever - the two simple words ""they're here"" (spoken by Heather O'Rourke as she stared at the white TV screen) and the performances throughout are excellent. The only thing that really detracted from this, at least in my opinion, was a decision to at times take the whole thing a little bit too far. Sometimes (not often, but enough that I felt it anyway) this seemed to delve into the realm of silly fantasy rather than frightening ghost story, when it really needed to keep the focus on the latter, which was its great strength. In particular, I thought that the last 20 minutes or so really went way too far. I would have been quite happy and finished the movie completely satisfied if this had ended with Tangina (played by the diminutive Zelda Rubinstein, who really worked in the role, if only because of the contrast of this very tiny woman taking on this horrible presence) simply declaring the house to be ""clean."" That last 20 minutes offered an explanation for what had been happening - although we had already been given enough information to be able to guess at what was happening. In some ways it seemed like a fast forward replay of everything we had already seen (the strange force coming from the children's closet, etc.) and it just added things that to be seemed ridiculous and unnecessary, such as the pool full of skeletons and coffins popping up all over the place with the house eventually being swallowed up. That ending didn't become the climax of the movie for me; it was anti-climactic and I spent most of that time wondering ""why add this on?""Still, if at times a bit too much, this was - I say again - a really good ghost story. You can't speak about this movie without mentioning Heather O'Rourke. She was brilliant. For such a young actress (I guess she would have been 5 or 6 when this was made) she made the part of Carol Ann her own. Her terror was absolutely believable. Her story (she died suddenly at the age of 12 soon after filming ""Poltergeist 3"") must surely be one of the great tragedies in Hollywood history. Based on what I saw in this movie, it's so sad to think of the acting career she might have developed, because she didn't seem like a typical child actor who'd never be able to break out of that image. I think she'd have gone far in the business. Such a tragedy, which has led to all sorts of silly stories about the 3-movie Poltergeist series, with some people speaking of a curse on the project. There was no curse - just a very sad tale that attached itself to the series; a series that began with a very good opener. (7/10)",Poltergeist
49,cherold,A Classic Spielbergian Ghost Story,8,1 December 2017,"Stephen Spielberg claims that while he produced Poltergeist, he did not direct it. If that's true, then official director did an amazing job of channeling Spielberg's 80s style. He captures Spielberg's ability to portray children as both natural and distinctly alien and mysterious. He captured his swooping camera shots and his slick use of special effects.Whether Hooper did all that, decided he didn't like it and never did it again, or whether Spielberg was the puppet master, the result is a terrific, fast-paced thriller full of terrific moments, suspense and humor.It was also a movie I was shocked to learn my girlfriend had never seen. When I asked her what I thought she had a whole analysis of the movie as a commentary on suburban culture. It made sense, so I guess it's deeper than I realized.The only scene I don't like is the one I feel certain is all Tobe Hooper's; that face melting thing. It's gross and feels out of place.

It's got some really spectacular effects, but a nonsensical and silly script, as well.

51,ElMaruecan82,"If not flawless, an effective supernatural-horror landmark, that set the template for the Paranormal subgenre...",8,9 August 2021,"The word 'curse' is often associated with ""Poltergeist"", most notably for the deaths of Dominique Dunne (Dana Freeling) shortly after the film's release and Heather O'Rourke in 1988. If that shouldn't interfere with the appreciation of the movie by itself, it says something about the unsettling effects of uncontrollable forces. Somehow the film and the eerie aura that surrounds it form the very whole that elevates it to the level of classic.If Spielberg wrote the screenplay with Michael Grais and Mark Victor, produced the film and let ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" director Tobe Hopper be the man behind the camera, but Spielberg was the 'poltergeist' that brought life to the whole project and is regarded as the true director, his constant interferences with Hopper and his presence in the set backs up the theory that Hopper was just a contract obligation, for Spielberg was making ""E. T."" a rival studio. And you can tell it is the Spielberg touch all right: a suburban house in Los Angeles, kids riding on bikes, a happy neighborhood and an All-American family.Though unfair to label Craig T. Nelson (Steven) and JoBeth Williams (Diane) as unknown faces, they weren't exactly established stars and that contributed to establish the very reliability of the Freelings. But you can see the fear being set up from the start, with the ominous death of the canary, Carol Anne's reluctance to see it flushed in the toilet, leading to the solemn burial of the bird in a cigar box with licorice (how Egyptian!) There's the room too where a big giant clown is staring at little Robbie (Oliver Robins) on the perfect spot so the lightning can make him even scarier, and a creepy tree harboring its tentacle-like branches right behind the window. It's noteworthy that Robbie has a full room of Alien"" and ""Star Wars"" posters making the setting as normal as it can be.Spielberg, a born-prankster; used to scare his sisters with scary pictures put in strategic places, in front of their bed or in a closet. He's obviously got that fascination and repulsion for fear that made him understand its peculiar mechanisms with kids. I myself could relate to it for various reasons. I was scared of clowns, for more details, read my review of Fellini's ""Clown"" film. I used to check under my bed or near the window if there weren't any 'intrusion'. In fact, I'd go as far as remembering when TV stations used to stop the broadcast and concluded with my country's national anthem and then the static screen came abruptly, as if it was telling me in telepathy ""now, it's really time to go to bed"".""Poltergeist"" does a great job at exposing the family with the exception of a little remote duel that might be too corny. Then, once Tweety dies, a series of slowly unnerving phenomena breaks the domestic harmony. The most iconic moment comes surprisingly early, Carol Anne is strangely attracted to the blank screen with a sort of fascinated look that would be creepy if she wasn't so damn adorable, and then a long flashy hand gushes over the screen and bedroom starts shaking, the 'punchline' takes in one simple quote that plays the pronoun game: ""they're here"". It's not much the words than the intonation that is downright creepy and would make us suspect Carol Anne to be possessed by an evil demon.What is remarkable in ""Poltergeist"" is the way it reassembles many tropes from previous classics, the unknown presence in ""Alien"", the house built over a cemetery ground in ""The Shining"", the cursed children in ""The Exorcist"" and yet Spielberg used these familiar ingredients to make a whole new recipe by making a clear distinction on hauntings and poltergeists. When little Carol Anne is 'kidnapped' by the mysterious spirit after the night that provides the film's first real thrills, they call a team of paranormal investigators conducted by Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight) and two guys who might have inspired the future ""Ghostbusters"""". In a way ""Poltergeist"" is the middle-link of a whole chain of horror and sci-fi blending classics that spanned two decades until ""The Sixth Sense"", before half the cast of ""Stranger Things"" was born.I could go on and on on the special effects, the use of lightning and practical effect but I think the achievement that sealed the film's legacy was the acting. Apart from the Freelings, Straight delivers a remarkable speech about the power of the mysterious light reminding us it took a five-minute scene in ""Network"" to earn her an Oscar, there's Zelda Rubinstein as Tangina, the psychic lady with the high-pitched voice and whose arrival have the same resonance as Max Von Sydow in the exorcist, the height aside. And there's that scene where Nelson (quite underrated) tries to trick Zelda, the pay-off is funny but comforts us with the knowledge that we deal with smart protagonists.Which makes rather unfortunate the moments where they're not so smart and act in a way that would make us scratch our heads. The film has a share of silly and corny episodes but that shouldn't distract from spectacular effects such as the recreation of a sort of portal looking like monster's oesophagus with a vacuum-like mouth, jump scares like skeletons emerging from the muddy pool, Diane sprinting toward the corridor that keeps getting away thanks to a beautiful vertigo effect, awesome one-liners ""Now let's get your daughter"" ""Don't touch my babies"" and moments of genuine warmth and complicity that make it believable Nelson and Williams are a couple. These moments are so first-rate that it's difficult to accept the bit with the car keys that looked like it belonged to a spoof movie.Apart from these itty bitty details, ""Poltergeist"" is one a hell of a classic with many names attached to it but there are two that stand out: Spielberg and Heather O'Rourke who forever in the hearts of movie fans... will be there.",Poltergeist
52,bowmanblue,The original (and best) supernatural haunting movie,9,28 May 2015,"Ever since (roughly) the U.S. remake of 'The Ring' Hollywood has tended to follow the same template for its horror/supernatural movies. This revolves around a family (sometimes single parent, sometimes not) moving into a house. Strange things happen. These are ignored. Then they're taken seriously. Help is sought via a convenient 'expert' who is easily located within the town. Resolution/confrontation with the evil presence.I haven't seen 'Poltergeist' since the eighties when I was young and actually managed to forget that, despite it being one of my favourite supernatural movies, it actually follows this template pretty closely. The difference is... it still feels original to this day.I've pretty much summed up the plot (and hopefully haven't given too much away!), but the family in question lose a daughter to the presence and have to work out a way of getting her back. Yes, some of the effects look a little dated (like they've been hand-drawn on in post production), but for every blatant bluescreen effort there's another special effect that's as creepy now as when it was first conceived (the meat/flesh scene springs to mind!).The cast is largely (and deliberately) unknown, as the producers didn't want famous faces distracting the audience from the film's vibe. But, don't let the fact that they're not recognisable make you think that they can't turn in excellent performances. Poltergeist has given us some of the most memorable performances that have stood the test of time (the 'medium' for one), not to mention some of the most chilling lines (and you all know what the girl says when she announces the spirits' arrival!).Normally, this is where I say that a film made in the eighties will probably only be appreciated by those who lived through the decade and have a particular nostalgia for the period. Besides, today's audiences are only interested in 'jump scares' and CGI effects, aren't they? Possibly, but I'm kind of hoping that 'Poltergeist' is the exception to the rule. Yes, us 'oldies' will like it more, but I reckon anyone with an appreciation for supernatural-horror should definitely give it a go. It's damn creepy. And it's damn good. And you'll probably never laugh at another clown again.",Poltergeist

I'm not sure I can pinpoint exactly when that was with Poltergeist, which has a tone that feels too packaged from beginning to end. Early on we're hit with a glossy soundtrack, cute kids, and excessive product placement, and when the haunting starts, it lacks any sense of real danger. Do we really fear for the children in any of these scenes? The acting of JoBeth Willliams (the mother) is awful and definitely doesn't help; her reactions to a child missing are almost comically far from grief-stricken. I appreciate the film's place in the history of the genre and it may work for younger audiences (or for those looking for something lighter), but to me it's not nearly dark enough, which removes almost all of its tension. There are a few nice special effects, e.g. Williams on the ceiling and the little boy and the clown, but they start getting tossed in like the kitchen sink at the end. It's a family film, and I guess I was just not the target audience.",Poltergeist

All of the characters in this film feel so real. I especially love Heather O'Rourke. Now, this movie has become infamous for a number of reasons. Shortly after it was made, the actress who played the elder sister, Dominique Dunne, was strangled to death by her ex boyfriend.As if that weren't enough, the skeletons used in this film were actually real. Hey, that's two confirmed rumors that appeared on Snopes! Anyway, for the most part, the visuals were great and they seemed to hold up quite well. I really do feel sorry for this family and all that they're going through. My only complaint is that there's this scene at the beginning where these guys watching football complaining about watching Mr. Rogers. Never speak ill of him! ***1/2",Poltergeist

Then the young boy was starting to be experiencing something fishy in the house such as the clown staring at him and the unexpected storm. After thinking that something was gonna, nothing didn't!I honestly thought there would be even at least something exciting during the beginning, I suppose not.

57,callanvass,"I wouldn't call it a classic, but it is very adroit and highly entertaining",8,20 January 2014,"In a suburban area, The Freeling's lives are shaken when objects in the house start doing peculiar things. It gets even worse when their daughter Carol Anne is taken by the Poltergeists. They hope they will go away, but they seem to be omnipresent. They call on paranormal investigators to help. This is a damn good film, make no mistake about it. You can definitely tell Steven Spielberg is involved. Nobody can create a movie quite like he can. The story is simple but extremely effective. The scares are delivered (That eerie clown, brrrr) , the suspense is always there, but the most important element of this movie is the cohesiveness of the Freeling family. Not only are they a very strong unit but everyone is likable. They band together during the time of adversity, no matter what. That is what family is supposed to be all about. Hell, even I would help this family. It delivers great buildup, until the finale is turned up several notches. Speaking of the finale, I do think it went on a tad too long. It was never boring and always exciting, but it felt a bit contrived after the false ending. Part of me wonders if they should have stopped there. They went for one too many climaxes. Spielberg pulls it off extremely well, I just wonder if he got pressured to add more thrills and scares. I'm probably being too picky. I really did enjoy the last 15 minutes. It is actually the scariest part of the movie, it just felt needless. Craig T. Nelson makes a terrific Dad. Vulnerable, yet strong-willed at the same time. Jobeth Williams is sexy and a great actress. This woman conveys all her emotions perfectly, especially the trauma she endures with her missing daughter. Heather O'Rourke is fantastic as Carol Anne. She sadly passed away, but she is one of the best child actors I've seen. Oliver Robbins is solid as Robbie. Zelda Rubenstein annoyed the hell out of me. I'm sure that will be vehemently disagreed with from fans of this movie, but I couldn't stand her. I couldn't stand her voice, her style of acting or the sight of her. James Karen has a part as well. He played a good slime ball. The only gore we get is some weird jelly goo, as well as somebody ripping chunks off their faceAdditional NoteThere are very weird circumstances involving this movie. Heather O'Rourke died during the filming of Poltergeist III from stomach issues, and Dominique Dunne was murdered by her ex boyfriend. It is kind of scary to think about. Final Thoughts: Not a classic, but very, very good. Even though Tobe Hooper is credited with directing this movie, this reeks of Spielberg, not that I'm complaining. The man is a genius.

Although directed by Hooper, this has all the earmarks of a Spielberg film. Spielberg co-produced and wrote the story, and it's the funniest material he has ever written. Unfortunately, all the laughs are unintentional. It's meant to be scary, but it's utterly ridiculous, with no rhyme or reason to the proceedings. The sets are cheap looking and the special effects are cheesy. The acting is uniformly bad, not helped by the pedestrian dialog. On a poignant note, it's hard to watch this without thinking about the tragic short lives of O'Rourke and Dunne, who play sisters.",Poltergeist

62,tomgillespie2002,"Clean, enjoyable horror",6,14 July 2012,"Successful realtor Steven Freeling (Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Diane (JoBeth Williams) live peacefully in their suburban community with their two daughters and son. Falling asleep in his chair one night, Steven wakens to find his youngest daughter Carol-Anne (Heather O'Rourke) talking to the static TV screen. She does the same thing the next night, only to announce to her parents that ""they're heeerre!"". Strange things start to happen around the house, until one night Carol-Anne is sucked into her closet which seems to be the conduit for the 'white light'; a light that the dead must walk into if they are to achieve peace. With their daughter missing, Steven and Diane call in a team of paranormal investigators, along with a creepy old woman called Tangina (Zelda Rubinstein).Although it says 'directed by Tobe Hooper' in the credits, it has long been debated who in fact directed Poltergeist. All of Hooper's usual traits of screaming women, a masked or disfigured killer, grisly deaths, lots of blood, all with a Grindhouse feel, are noticeably absent. Instead, the film feels something much more Speilbergian, with the industry's biggest Jew listed in the credits with production and writing duties. Spielberg was heavily involved in the production, working on it almost back-to-back with E.T. - The Extra Terrestrial (1982), and it does have the same atmosphere as his family-friendly alien blockbuster. This works both for and against the film.During this era, Spielberg was arguably at his best, and was one of the finest craftsmen of blockbusters and sheer entertainment perhaps ever. One of the key attributes to his 70's/80's films was his realistic portrayals of often broken families, and the characters of Steven and Diane are fully-realised, and more importantly wholly believable. The characterisation here is better than most horror films care to give, and these joint-smoking liberal parents are funny and real, and give a much- needed heart to the story.Yet when Spielberg (sorry, Hooper!) gets over-excited and insistent on giving the audience something spectacular, I felt the film failed. Flying household objects and static tentacles I can deal with, but giant tree-arms, demon heads and a computer-generated monster take it many steps too far, and crushes any real feeling of atmosphere. The film is just too ridiculous to be remotely scary. Perhaps a more low-key approach would have been more effective, and as entertaining as the film was throughout (although it does have a climax too many), the theatrical effects make the film look dated and suffocate any chance of real scares. A clean, enjoyable horror, but hardly a memorable one.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Poltergeist

64,poe426,Little Girl Lost in Hell House...,3,25 October 2014,"As I pointed out in print at the time of this movie's release, POLTERGEIST comes across as an ode to the late Richard Matheson. His name appears nowhere in any of the credits, but his influence is there. In LITTLE GIRL LOST, an episode of the original TWILIGHT ZONE series, we have a little girl who disappears, apparently, under her bed one night. It turns out that she's actually disappeared through her bedroom wall. The parents can HEAR her, calling to them from The Other Side, but they can't see her. At one point, her dog goes through the Doorway and eventually leads her back. In THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, a team of paranormal investigators that include both a physical and a mental Medium tackle ""the Mount Everest of Haunted Houses,"" the dread Belasco House- a.k.a., Hell House. If one were to combine these two scenarios, one would end up with- viola!- something very much like POLTERGEIST. Throw in a couple of dope-smoking One Percenters and a trio of really Bland suburban kids and you're all set. While most people contend that it was Steven Spielberg calling the shots behind the scenes and not the credited director, Tobe Hooper, I can't really say it matters much, one way or the other.

66,leplatypus,Striker-movie (tv),10,2 February 2014,"I remember to have seen this movie as a teen on an evening we weren't allowed to watch TV, maybe because Spielberg name was strong enough to bend the rule! I found it so great that as i asked my bookseller to read the novelization of the movie in which evil spirits terrorizes a family, he gave me instead ""the Exorcist"", which was quite a hard reading! Now, i watched it again a quarter of century later and I'm amazed to see that the fantastic here is that the movie is still totally actual, albeit it's dated historically as the boy is a great fan of Star Wars merchandising. I can read that Spielberg was more at the helm that it seems: if i can't tell what really happened, this movie is for me the house next block to the Elliot's one. In other words, ""ET"" and ""Poltergeist"" share the same world, the same feeling, it's the same Californian suburb, the same family meeting supernatural and they have both excellent soundtrack! The only difference is the first is about light and the second is rather darkness. Now, i don't find the movie really frightening (see my review for ""Prince of Darkness"") but I'm rather moved by the family: great home, liberal and caring parents, sweet kids. The cast is just amazing and for sure, little Heather facing the big screen (her TV as well the movie one) is just happiness, innocence, childhood incarnated (helped with big brother Oliver) and her late fate (as well as big sister Dominique) just make me cry... I would like very much to hear Spielberg about the ""movie curse"" and the use of real skeleton in the movie! If that's true, we just fall then into a nauseating abyss because greed and disrespect for dead ones is indeed the story of the movie!NB: finally, i become more afraid by the ""curse"" than by the movie itself. In some way, this movie has really made a connection to supernatural: during a scene, you can see on a TV screen the original franchise of Spielberg's ""Always"". Already in 1982? Already about ghost? But, the creepy fact is really the Superbowl 1988 poster! When i watched the movie on TV, it was so really evident (up the boy's bed) that i have to check the Web to confirm it was done in 1982 and not 1988! And reading the discussion, i discovered this chilling fact: Superbowl 1988 was indeed the place (San Diego) and the date (01/31) of passing of beloved Heather!

However, for the time, it was pretty damn good.The script is really easy to follow and it is not complicated, but the word Poltergeist is misplaced in the title as compared to the script. While parts of the movie do represent the German word for ""noisy ghost"" the reset of the script goes much deeper than a ghost causing some disturbances.I really like the static on the television being used, especially in a dark room. It is a genius move by Spielberg. Along with all the new technology which was coming about during this period of ghost hunters.This movie makes use of old stop motion special effects, which work quiet well. They provide just enough for the viewer to see abnormal moments when the ghosts are doing strange tricks.The casting is awesome, from the main to the supporting cast. The use of the variety of actors is brilliant because they are visually pleasing to the viewer per the script.

71,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Spielberg's updated haunted house film is suspenseful and intriguing,7,23 August 2010,"Some will say ""Jaws"" and other will say ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" but the 1982 ""Poltergeist"" offers the Exhibit B for of the longevity of Steven Spielberg's magic. Written and produced by the legendary filmmaker, this supernatural horror film evokes the imagination, despite the thin layer of cheese and the now-dated special effects. Standing unfairly in Spielberg's shadow is ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" director Tobe Hooper, who makes ""Poltergeist"" eerie and suspenseful enough to keep the film engaging when the special effects are full-blown and the lid has been popped off in terms of realism. The subtle and effective camera movements at various moments will keep you on edge, some technique that draws slightly upon Hitchcock (as well as Spielberg, who undoubtedly had a hand or two in much of the production seeing as he was on set most of the time).""Poltergeist"" tells the story of a young family in California living in a development who experiences supernatural activity in its house starting with the youngest daughter hearing voices in the TV set and continuing with moving kitchen furniture. At first it seems like some fascinating paranormal activity, but soon it becomes anything but subtle.Despite the film's full-on embrace of the supernatural instead of sticking with minute suspense, there's still a strong curiosity factor that makes the ghostly mayhem intriguing rather than scattered and unnecessarily chaotic. Much of the events happen before we have any true sense of what's going on, which draws us in to figuring out what the events might signify and of course how they'll be resolved. In this sense, ""Poltergeist"" remains suspenseful throughout, making it effective through the excessive use of strobe lights and wind machines.The cast also possesses an anonymity which keeps the focus on what's happening in the house and suggests that this could ""happen to anyone."" Horror films started casting unknowns mostly to keep costs down, but the tradition certainly has value in films such as this because big-name stars would draw too much attention to the performances and not to the events. Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams as Steven and Diane are a fairly simplistic couple and they don't overcompensate when it all goes down by freaking out any more than they have to freak out.Haunted house films have always had some old-era Victorian feel to them, but ""Poltergeist"" brought the classic concept into the modern era by brilliantly crossing something as ordinary as a house with something as extraordinary as a supernatural terror.~Steven CThanks for Reading!

73,GOWBTW,The best horror Steven Spielberg ever made!,10,1 November 2005,"Based on experience, yet made for the big screen, ""Poltergeist"" is one of the best ghost films I've ever seen. It really wants to reach out to the audience and say, ""BOO!"" But wants that? That's child's play! Here You got a family in middle class suburbia, the house in a big valley in California. The perfect life. YEAH RIGHT! The other side lurks in the home of The Freeling family, and little Carol Anne(Heather O'Rourke,1975-88) gets herself sucked in. Losing a child to the supernatural is worse than losing it to a child predator of any sorts. The Freelings are more than determined to get Carol Anne back by all means. I liked the part where the brother Robbie(Oliver Robins) has all the Star Wars memorabilia in his room, and the scene where that clown doll attacks him from behind and tries to kill him. Diane(JoBeth Williams) was great looking in the movie when she and her husband Steve(Craig T. Nelson) were getting high. But Diane almost got disrobed by the poltergeist when she was moved all over the place. And Steve was completely outraged by his boss when he finds out why these occurrences where happen especially when he's building phases on a cemetery. At least he didn't blame the descendants he blamed the company he's working for. Steven Spielberg deserved a lot of credit for this movie, the cast is great, the plot and the story is outstanding. And I'm glad he made two more sequels. Sadly, the success had it's price for the first one. Dominique Dunne as the eldest sister did her best in this movie. May her memory live on!

74,FiendishDramaturgy,Alarming realism,9,10 September 2003,"Regardless of who actually directed this movie, I have to say it's one of the best true horror movies out there. Other people have mentioned being disappointed in the DVD and I must admit that I, too, was disappointed that they used the last, bad cut of the movie to transfer this one to DVD. The scene change between the kitchen scene and where Diane and Steve (JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson) are standing on the neighbors' front porch, is deplorable. I GOT the DVD version in the hopes of ridding my collection of what I consider a botched dubbing job, and ended up punctuating it with ineptitude, instead. That set aside, the DVD quality itself is horrendous. The film is grainy, you can see dust all over it and the sound fades in and out. I do not suggest you buy the DVD until they come out with a (hopefully) special edition/director's cut. There are no extras on the DVD. Just the movie. (Note: there IS a recent re-release of Poltergeist 2 & 3 on the same DVD...of course the only way to GET you to buy 3 was to give it away with 2...who would want to actually pay for it? There are no extras on that DVD, either. There is one disk, with 2 on one side and 3 on the other and that's it.) While both Hooper and Spielberg are now credited as the directors, it's Spielberg who wrote the original work, the screenplay and is credited alongside Hooper as the director. They say this movie is a product of Tobe Hooper's direction, but I have to wonder about that, myself. If you ask me, it's classic Spielberg, through and through. It feels like Spielberg was sick and laid out a week of production and Hooper got credit because he was just...there.Compared to modern-day epics (the Mummy, Mummy Returns, Jurassic Park, et al, etc), this movie pales. But in its class, there are few out there who can best it for true horror. The effects are good, if perhaps a tad unbelievable (only just a tad) and the story is a great story. Zelda Rubenstein and Beatrice Straight are wonderful as mediums/clairvoyants and this movie is where I first saw and came to love Zelda Rubenstein. She's marvelous! ""This house is clear,"" is HER line! This movie has earned its place in the Horror Hall of Fame, so I won't bother with the storyline or plot synopsis here. But I must say that the direction, whom ever's credit is deserved, is absolutely magical, the acting is some of the best, most believable acting I've seen in a long time (and possibly the best of JoBeth William's career), and the settings and props were very well done. I would've liked to have seen the ""Other Side,"" but it's almost better that they didn't muck around with that and left it to your imagination.

75,Captain_Couth,A horror classic from the unlikely team of Tobe Hooper and Stephen Spielberg.,10,29 June 2004,"Poltergeist (1982) was the first of the horror trilogy. An old fashion ghost story told through the use of modern day technology. Stephen Spielberg wrote and produced this movie and he had horror director Tobe Hooper direct for the most part. For Mr. Hooper besides it being a paycheck, it was a chance to work within the Hollywood movie studio system (he would be a sucker if he didn't take the chance). Sadly he would become a victim of the Poltergeist curse because he never worked on a major studio production again.Poltergeist is a tale about a haunting that terrorizes the Freeling family. The Freelings are your typical All-American family. They're living in a new community that the husband (Craig T. Nelson) is helping developing. One night, the youngest daughter is drawn to a t.v. that gets no reception. That's just one of the strange things that has been going on in the household. But it gets a whole lot worse (and very interesting) from this point on!Stephen Spielberg and company created a truly frightening film. Not only did this spawn two sequels but it became a part of American pop culture. Poltergeist has become a fixture amongst the horror film genre as well. Spielberg used his pull (which would later work for Saving Private Ryan) to secure an R-rating.Even though Spielberg wrote and produced this film I feel that Tobe Hooper should get the credit he deserves for directing this film. Poor Mr. Hooper, his career was never the same after this one. Hollywood should give him another chance.Highly recommended.",Poltergeist

Though, why didn't the spirits attack that capitalist's home instead?! Why the innocent buyer not the criminal entrepreneur?! Moreover, how could those very spirits come back after the confirmation of the great medium - in the second movie's end - that ""This House is CLEAN""?!!Then, the supposed substance.

When money became more important than soul; the dead became more life than the living? This is like more than one ball in one match!

Although Poltergeist does have a similar issue that effects The Shining, I kept thinking of the parodies.Poltergeist was produced and co-written by Steven Spielberg and even though he didn't direct his presence was felt. The film had some of his tropes like setting the film in the suburbs and having a focus on a family. The family focus was key to why the film worked because it was about a loving family who gets tortured by the supernatural. It gives Poltergeist a heart because we care what happens to do them. When the film turns into a paranormal investigation film and I can see where The Conjuring series got its ideas.",Poltergeist
78,strong-122-478885,Not Scary! Not Scary! Not Scary!,2,20 June 2014,"When it comes to the likes of horror flicks, Poltergeist has got to be one of the all-time, most over-rated pieces of movie-junk that I have ever seen. There's no ifs, ands, or buts, about it.From start to finish, Poltergeist is nothing but an over-blown, thoroughly obnoxious mess of a horror movie. Its story escalates (at break-neck speed) into one of the stupidest 'hauntings' imaginable.There's absolutely no subtlety, or artistic restraint in evidence anywhere in this flick. We, the viewer, are literally bulldozed to death, and then buried alive by an onslaught of preposterous special effects that are only there to distract us from the plain, simple truth that - ""THIS FLICK REALLY SUCKS!!"" Just like The Shining - I cannot figure out, for the frickin' life of me, why so many people continue (32 years later) to still make such a ridiculous fuss over this one. Let's face it - Poltergeist isn't that good. It isn't! For one thing - Not only are all of the kids in Poltergeist totally revolting and worthy of being slaughtered within the first half hour of this flick, but the adults are definitely in need of a good decapitation, too. It's true. One can't help but loathe every last one of them.And on top of all of that - Would someone please tell me - What sort of a Property Development Company builds a subdivision of homes right on top of a goddamn graveyard, and only moves the frickin' headstones to another location, and leaves the actual coffins still buried there in the ground? Eh? Who?? Like, am I expected to accept, without question, that during the initial excavation of all of this property (laying sewer pipes, creating basements, building swimming pools, etc., etc.) that not a single, solitary coffin was ever dug up at this point? And - Am I also supposed to believe the the entire construction crew working on this project were actually all in on this conspiracy not to move any of the graves, and so they just built everything around them? C'mon, now! That's just plain preposterous and idiotic.When you seriously consider the illogical aspect of it all - Poltergeist simply comes out as being just a really dumb horror movie. Its story is an absolute insult to the intelligence of even the most average-thinking person.So, there! As some sort of compensation for my attitude towards this flick - It gives me the greatest of pleasure to know that behind the scenes of this flick's production, Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper were at each other's throats constantly over the direction of Poltergeist. Things got so nasty between these 2 that Hooper was eventually removed from his directorial duties, and Spielberg, himself, took over the show.",Poltergeist
79,dee.reid,"""Poltergeist"" - Horror for middle-class America",10,17 October 2016,"""They're here,"" and they're ready to stay.1982's ""Poltergeist"" is widely regarded as one of the greatest horror films of the last 35 years, and certainly one of the most popular and widely imitated. I've caught ""Poltergeist"" many times over the years, but I have never actually sat down and watched the whole thing in its entirety. It's a gripping film, with a great cast, great story, high production values, and great direction.""Poltergeist"" is one of those great cinematic collaborations that everyone dreams about: it was directed by horror veteran Tobe Hooper (of 1974's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""), but it was produced and co-written by Hollywood director Steven Spielberg (""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""). I've read that there's been some debate over who was the true director here - Hooper or Spielberg - but there's no denying that the film bears the marks of both of its principal creators: Hooper's unique ability to shock the viewer and make people physically ill with what they're watching, and Spielberg's eye for human drama and ground-breaking special effects (courtesy of George Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic - ILM).""Poltergeist"" involves an American middle-class suburban family's battle with malevolent spirits. But this film was like no other haunted-house movie before it. While films concerning themselves with evil spirits haunting human protagonists in isolated locations like large foreboding castles and mansions, or small cabins in the deep forest are all too common in the horror genre, ""Poltergeist"" brought that very same ghost story to middle-class America - forcing the film's protagonists (and the audience) to confront a supernatural horror right in their own homes. You can probably read all sorts of socio-political subtexts in this story - like the idea of how people escape to the suburbs to free themselves of the dangers prevalent in the bigger cities, only to find themselves the victims of something far more dangerous than anything there (in this case, ghosts, or ""poltergeists"").We're introduced to the Freeling family, who live in the picturesque suburban Southern California community of Cuesta Verde. There's Steven Freeling (Craig T. Nelson), his wife Diane (JoBeth Williams), their oldest daughter Dana (the late Dominique Dunne, who was murdered by her boyfriend a few months after this film's release), Robbie (Oliver Robins), and Carol Anne (the late Heather O'Rourke, who tragically passed away six years later from septic shock caused by intestinal stenosis, while filming this movie's second of two sequels).Like William Friedkin had done on ""The Exorcist"" (1973), Hooper takes his time in introducing us to the Freelings so that we get to know each of them as people and see them going about their daily lives. But soon, strange occurrences begin happening around the house. At first, they're benign, even if understandably unsettling. Eating utensils appear bent out of shape. Chairs move by themselves. And Carol Anne can hear voices talking to her through their living room television set.This strange phenomena soon starts to turn terrifying, and violent. Robbie is nearly eaten alive by the old tree outside his bedroom window. And tragically, Carol Anne is abducted by the ominous forces that seemed to have taken up residence in the Freeling's house and dragged her off to the spirit realm. Steven and Diane waste little time in contacting professionals - in this case, university parapsychologist Dr. Lesh (the late Beatrice Straight), who regards her profession as one with little reward but who soon sees that what the Freelings are dealing with is the real deal, and Tangina (Zelda Rubinstein), a medium who explains to everyone that the Freeling house is haunted by a malevolent supernatural entity known only as ""The Beast"" that is holding Carol Anne hostage on the ""other side.""""Poltergeist"" is a bold marriage of talent and special effects. For a film that was released 34 years ago (as of this writing), its practical special effects still stand up to the test of time and beat out many of its more modern-day CGI-laden counterparts. Only someone as gifted as Steven Spielberg and Lucas's ILM could have been capable of doing this.""Poltergeist"" is one of the great modern ghost stories. The unique collaboration of director Tobe Hooper and producer/co-screenwriter Steven Spielberg is one of the great collaborative efforts in the history of film.10/10",Poltergeist

This does a great job of standing the test of time,9,27 September 2021,"Poltergeist (1982) is a movie I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a father who works in real estate and recently moved his family into a new housing development to help promote the community. Shortly after moving to the home weird things start happening. What seems just odd at first quickly gets out of hand and puts the entire family's life at risk. This movie is directed by Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and stars JoBeth Williams (The Big Chill), Heather O'Rourke (Happy Days), Craig T. Nelson (Coach), Craig T. Nelson (Police Academy) and Oliver Robins (Airplane II). The storyline does a fantastic job of setting up the family dynamic and rationale for why the events may take place so you genuinely care what happens and to whom. The horror elements start off brilliantly subtle (the chairs, TV, tree, dog, etc) and build their way up to some of the best exorcism scenes ever created. I can't say I loved the cartoon-like ghost sequences, but they were good for the times. Zelda Rubinstein is legendary for her performance in this movie and she does brilliant in creating the elements and intensity by her mannerisms and unique voice. The props in this are fantastic as are the environments. This is an all time classic and must see for horror fans of all ages. This does a great job of standing the test of time and I'd score this an 9/10.",Poltergeist
82,estebangonzalez10,Not as scary as I thought it would be.,6,8 July 2015,"""They're here!""I'll probably get a lot of backlash for this, but I wasn't really a huge fan of Poltergeist. I know many consider it to be a classic in the horror genre and some have even regarded this as the scariest movie of all time, but I simply can't find the appeal. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that it hasn't aged well or that countless horror films since have imitated it, but I found it rather predictable and silly at times. The movie does begin by setting up the characters in an interesting way (this is where Spielberg's influence as a producer is felt), but once the horror elements begin to take center stage I felt disengaged. I can imagine those final fifteen minutes must have haunted audiences during the 80's, but I just found it a bit convoluted and silly. I wanted to check out the original before I decided to see the remake, but considering I wasn't such a huge fan of this film now I probably won't even get near it (the only appeal right now for me is getting to see Sam Rockwell who is always brilliant). Poltergeist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are Tobe Hooper's most revered horror films, but at least the first doesn't seem to have aged well. I was disappointed and when compared to other horror classics like Halloween, Psycho, Alien, and The Shining, I don't think Poltergeist deserves to be considered among that group. Steve (Craig T. Nelson) and Diane Freeling (JoBeth Williams) seem to be enjoying their peaceful lives in the suburbs along with their three children: Dana (Dominique Dunne), Robbie (Oliver Robins), and Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke). That is until strange events begin taking place: their youngest daughter, Carol Anne, begins sleepwalking and having conversations with the TV set, the house begins to shake but only they seem to experience it, bent dinner forks are found at the table, the chairs are placed in bizarre positions, and finally a terrible thunderstorm destroys the house and mysteriously makes one of the trees come to life and snatch Robbie from his room. It is evident that the house is haunted by some strange presence, but while everyone is distracted by trying to save Robbie, Carol Anne is sucked into the closet and disappears. However the family can hear her voice through the static TV screen and that is when they fully understand that they are dealing with supernatural forces so they hire a parapsychologist, Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight), to help them find and save their daughter. The film is at its best when it's setting the atmosphere and introducing us to the family members. I did enjoy the first part of the film, but once the strange events begin taking place the film lost most of its appeal. I didn't find it scary, but it wasn't disturbing either. I know that the premise has been imitated hundreds of times now so perhaps that hurt my overall enjoyment of this film. I wish I could've experienced it back in the 80's to see if it would've had a different effect on me, but I can't simply give it a pass for it because I've seen many other classic films that are older than this but have aged much better. The greatest thing about this movie is Heather O'Rourke, who played the cute little girl, Carol Anne. That scene where she tells her family that ""they're here"" is probably the best moment of the movie. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Poltergeist

84,drownnnsoda,Excellent Haunted House Film.,9,27 July 2006,"""Poltergeist"" is a film about a normal American family, The Freelings, who live in a normal suburb, who live normal lives. But everything that is normal begins to change. Their youngest daughter, Carol Anne, comes downstairs one night, and puts her hands on the TV, watching the television fizz, and seems to be communicating with something. The second time this happens, strange events begin to occur. Storms build outside their house, chairs stack up themselves in a matter of seconds, and strange lights come from Carol Anne's closet. One night, Carol Anne is sucked into her closet by a forceful wind, and is taken to another dimension. Not knowing what to do about their daughter's disappearance, the parents hire a team of parapsychologists, and they begin hearing Carol Anne's voice speaking around the home, coming from the television set. The parapsychologists believe it is the work of a ""poltergeist"", and explain the difference between a ghost and a poltergeist. The family then begins a battle between two worlds to save their innocent daughter.This movie really isn't perfect, it has some cheesy special effects and isn't particularly scary by today's standards. I would say it's a little bit light for a Tobe Hooper film, but it has it's moments and I enjoyed it. It's PG, so there isn't a lot of intense violence or anything, the movie is probably appropriate for pre-teenagers (although there is one scene where a man tears his face off). The acting here was great, JoBeth Williams was the most convincing house-mom I've seen in a movie, and young Heather O'Rourke was a living doll. The story was unique, and was much different from your normal haunted house film. There have been numerous legends about a curse surrounding the movie, as there have been a number of cast and crew members who died after the making of the film. Heather O'Rourke, who played Carol Anne, died at the tender age of 12 from a cardiopulmonary arrest after suffering an intestinal problem during the filming of ""Poltergeist III"", and Dominique Dunne, who played the smaller role as her sister, was murdered during the year of the original film's release. Whether there really is a ""curse"" or not, these sad but strange events add the to the mystique surrounding the film.Bottom line- ""Poltergeist"" is a well made, original ghost story, and holds your interest the entire way through. While it isn't completely perfect, it's nearly close to it. Out of all of the haunted house films that are out there, this one ranks pretty darn high on the list. Recommended. 9/10.",Poltergeist

So that is one positive, impressive creative special effects and visuals! Also, the cast did well with their source material. But the big issue I took with the movie, was the bad script and boring pacing and how terribly non scary this is. It's so true that this movie has no scared at all, I did not jump once or feel scared or tense. Also, I just became bored many times throughout the movie, I was catching myself checking the time, and wishing it would hurry the heck up! Just goes to show you that good acting and special effects cannot be the only good things in a film, it must have a well put together script and the pace must be timed correctly.

I didn't watch a single Jason, Freddy, or Michael film my entire childhood. For some reason, I watched Poltergeist repeatedly. It was THE scary movie of my youth.

Director Tobe Hooper makes the implausible plot work excellently as he maintains a fine balance between the comedy (which is very funny), the drama and the thrills. And of course the f/x team produce some convincing apparitions to suitably spook us.Final word however must go to the actors and actresses, who really put on a fine show.

One of the most enjoyable rainy afternoon movie days was spent in the luxurious Paramount Theater Sydney with 1200 screaming others laughing and rolling about as we all shrieked in breathless unison through this terrific film. In 2008 with 100 CGI boo-fests behind us, POLTERGEIST does seem more than a little Disney but there are several key factors as to why POLTERGEIST still mostly works: It has a terrific script, quite moving in explanations of the undead and their suburban wanderings; also the family (casting) is completely real. The laugh breaks in the most tense scenes are genuinely uproarious and elicit tremendous reaction (especially if with a large group watching). I dislike re-makes but I will admit that if the same script and story line was re made as a 3D CGI extravaganza, POLTERGEIST might just be the right remake for the new century. If you were lucky enough as I was in 1982 to have seen POLTERGEIST in a huge gorgeous packed cinema as I did then POLTERGEIST would remain in your memory as one of the best fun frights of your life. For those too young, get the DVD onto a huge TV and invite 20 of your best friends over and settle in for a genuine scream-a-thon. As with other comments on this site, I too seem to remember other snippets missing from the DVD I watched.

Then Carol Anne is taken by the forces that live in the house and outside help is required in the form of shrink Beatrice Straight and company.  They can only do so much, so Zelda Rubinstein is brought in for the real job. She pretty much steals the movie when she arrives. All this I can handle.  Its the third act that is unnecessary.

I adore a lot about this film, from the cinematography, the casting, the creepy practical effects and so much more. Better yet, it does prove to be a bit of an interesting social commentary on suburban life and what corners were cut for that to even be a possibility. Its main flaws consist of problematic tone with its music and its acting- both not fitting the films vibe at times- but still being campy fun nevertheless. I just feel with a bit more effort and retakes they could have made something even more brilliant- but instead it still sits good as it is. Craig T. Nelson and Zelda Rubinstein are easily the film's biggest standouts and truly encompass the craziness and honesty that the film is going for. It feels nostalgic and honey while also remaining sinister and full of a fun sort of creepiness. No other film quite matches its vibes, nor its excellence of a concept.

93,ShootingShark,"Brilliant, Terrifying, Jaw-Droppingly Spectacular Haunted House Flick",7,24 February 2008,"The Freeling family live in the pleasant neighbourhood of Cuesta Verde. All is well until their young daughter, Carol Anne, starts hearing voices coming from the TV static and strange ghostly episodes begin to occur. Are they living in a haunted house ?Poltergeist is probably the best example of the contemporary ghost story movie - it's fun, extremely well-made, and is packed full of terrific scares. It takes the opposite approach from normal; there's no big old spooky house or gruesome back-story of some patriarch walling people up in the tower. By contrast, the Freelings are the most normal family you could imagine and Cuesta Verde could be any middle-class suburb anywhere. The movie uses this backdrop of ordinariness to really bring the hauntings and monstrous visions to life; they seem somehow more real and shocking because these people and this place seem real. The movie perhaps segues a little too fast from the minor phenomena to Carol Anne's disappearance into the spirit world, but Williams and Nelson are so good that they make it work. Here are two actors who are asked to react to the most insane and bizarre situations but they jump right in, play it straight, keep their characters grounded, and both deliver sensational performances. Both Rubinstein (who is four-foot-three) and five-year-old O'Rourke are truly iconic; Rubinstein's hair-raising whispered speech about the evil spirit is a highlight - ""It keeps Carol Anne very close to it and away from the spectral light. It lies to her. It says things only a child can understand ... "", and O'Rourke is sweet, haunted, funny and touching, one of the most memorable child performances. Paramount as ever in a good horror movie are the fabulous tracking-in photography of Matthew F. Leonetti and a super-creepy score by Jerry Goldsmith which alternates the numerous nail-biting sequences with unsettlingly pleasant nursery-rhyme lullabies. It also has some of the most startling effects in any ghost movie - both Richard Edlund's amazing spirit-light creatures and some sensational floor effects (a set of chairs that stack in an uncut shot, a dizzying elongating corridor effect done in the camera, a scene where Williams is thrown up a wall and across the roof) contribute greatly to the scares and the atmosphere. Too often nowadays filmmakers just get lazy with CGI (see the remake of The Haunting), but this has original and imaginative effects which really work. There is some controversy over the authorship of this film; Steven Spielberg wrote the original story, co-scripted and co-produced it, and is rumoured to have supervised the direction, whatever that means. All I know is that it's beautifully made and Hooper (the auteur of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and several other great but critically lambasted films) is the credited director so he's the guy I tip my hat to. He's made a classic ghost movie which is scary as hell despite the fact that it takes place in the here and now and nobody even gets killed. Tragically, both young actresses in this film died far too young; Dunne (the sister of Griffin Dunne) was murdered in 1982, aged 22, and O'Rourke died of complications from Crohn's Disease in 1988, aged 12. Followed by two sequels, which, as usual, are not much of a patch on the original. A fabulously enjoyable horror film.",Poltergeist
94,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Classic Haunted House Film with Amazing Characters,10,8 April 2020,"To start us off, this was a film that I first watched at a young age and I was a big fan of it. I've rewatched this film actually twice recently, once to show an ex-girlfriend for the first time and then the other was in my local theater on a 35mm. The official synopsis for this film is a family's home is haunted by a host of ghosts.For those that do not know, this film follows a family that lives in a housing development. We get a good establishing sequence where the father, Steve Freeling (Craig T. Nelson) has dozed off in the living room watching television. We get the sign off that was used back in the day where it shows American monuments along with the national anthem before going to snow. The family dog moves room to room where we see the mother, Diane (JoBeth Williams), their eldest daughter Dana (Dominique Dunne), their son Robbie (Oliver Robins) and the youngest daughter Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke). Carol Anne wakes up and talks to the snowy television where she wakes everyone up.What I love about this film is that the haunting in the house becomes progressively worse until Carol Anne disappears into the spectral realm. There is an odd part where Diane is intrigued by what is happening and messes with it. This film though is powerful in how heartbreaking it is to watch this family fall apart trying to get their daughter back. A group of paranormal researchers come to the house to help. They believe in ghosts, but do not expect what they get coming into this house. The mystery of why this happens is presented in an interesting way as well.Something that I really noticed after this last viewing was how modern this family really is. They watch quite a bit of TV. They have multiple sets. They smoke marijuana as well as are progressive in their way of punishing their children. Dana has an odd interaction with the men that are working on putting in a swimming pool. Diane watches it play out, but doesn't really say or do anything.The editing of this film is really good. The film for being almost two hours doesn't feel like it. It doesn't take long to get going and then when it does, it builds tension all the way until the finale. I like how the film ends, but I think what happens to the house is a bit much. Also along with this, I do question some of the characters and what they do, but it doesn't ruin the film either. Something else interesting about this film is the speculation on who really directed it, Tobe Hooper or Steven Spielberg. Upon this watch, it does feel at times there were two directors as some scenes feel like the one and at times the other. It works together seamlessly though in my opinion.For a film like this, it does need some good acting and we get that. Nelson is great in his look. He and Williams are the cool parents and everything seems to be great. When O'Rourke has been gone, Nelson looks disheveled and they both look like they are just exhausted. Dunne is having a breakdown and it is underrated how strong she was for this role. Robins is interesting, because he is scared. He doesn't fully comprehend what is happening. I thought the researchers were great in their roles, especially Richard Lawson. He has the only bloody scene and it was great. I also want to give a shot out to horror regulars Zelda Rubinstein as the psychic they get to help and James Karen who is the jerk boss of Nelson. Both were great in their roles.Something else this film is known for are the effects, which surprisingly still hold up for me today. It is surprising that this film was made in 1982 and the early CGI that was used for the ghosts looks better than some that comes out today. The only time it really doesn't is when they go into the children's room and items are flying around. The other is a tornado we get early in the film. It doesn't really bother me too much. The practical effects that are also used in the film are really good as well as the cinematography. Just how things are framed really helps to build tension and convey what needs to be, especially that early introduction to the family sequence.The soundtrack for the film I also thought was good. It isn't grand, but for the most part is quite subdued. I think that this is something that the film needed. It does ramp up the tension when a scene needs it, but a lot of times it is just there to help, but never took me out of it which is exactly what I wanted.Now with that said, I think that this film is a great film. It has a really good story that is quite horrific. There are some times where the characters or their motives aren't the greatest, but it doesn't completely ruin the film. I thought the editing was solid to build tension toward a satisfying climax. The acting for the film is also really good and it is fun to see a couple of horror regulars tossed in as well. The effects were on point as well as well as the score of the film. This film is interesting that it was one of the films to help institute the PG-13 rating. I think this is a classic and deserves a viewing if you haven't. This is also a good film to help get people who aren't into horror as well.",Poltergeist
95,Samiam3,"Loud and Grim, but visually strong",6,20 June 2009,"I think Spielberg took this film a little too personally when he wrote it. It is supposed to reflect what scared him as a kid growing up, so his intention is to make the audience feel equally uncomfortable. Poltergeist as a horror film is poorly crafted for generating suspense. It is too loud and chaotic, with Spielberg and Hooper, trying to force haunting visuals into your head till they reach the point of obnoxious. As a result, the story collapses under the weight of its violent energy. What we have here is a dopey ghost story which offers some accomplished special effects and an occasional sense of humor.The story centers on a normal American suburban family whose house becomes haunted. After the ghost inhabitants take the youngest child with them back to their world, the family hires an exorcist to deal with the problem.Poltergeist starts off rather nicely. It gives a quirky introduction to our characters and their neighbourhood before launching into terror mode. All sorts of crazy things happen. We get living trees, killer clowns, flying furniture, and lots of skeletons. As ridiculous as it sounds, the movie never takes itself too seriously. Sometimes it even intends to make us laugh. Unfortunately, this good spirit only lasts for part of the picture. The climax on the other hand is nasty, violent, and too over the top, giving way to an equally poor ending.Poltergeist is worth checking out, but there are more fun horror flicks out there.",Poltergeist
96,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"Like by many,...but it's really not that strong of a horror film",6,7 September 2020,"Tobe Hooper will always be known for injecting a shot of fear into viewers after he released The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). Fans also remember him for The Funhouse (1981) and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 2 (1986), but he still managed those projects himself. What was probably more surprising was when he decided to collaborate with Steven Spielberg on a movie between those entries. While Spielberg did make his own horror film with Jaws (1975), the director was known for more wonder and adventure type themes going on in his stories. So to have an actual horror director work with him may have seemed like a mismatch. Turns out though many enjoyed this film, however it's not as scary as some may say; especially those who have seen much darker stories.The story is about an average family who ends up being visited by some spirits and capture their youngest child into their dimension. Then they bring in some paranormal specialists to investigate and help recover their lost child. With Hooper directing, Spielberg, Michael Grais and Mark Victor wrote the screenplay. The cast of actors playing the family is Steve (Craig T. Nelson), Dianne (JoBeth Williams), Robbie (Oliver Robins), Dana (Dominique Dunne) and Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke). The paranormal investigators are Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight), Marty (Martin Casella), Ryan (Richard Lawson) and Tangina (Zelda Rubinstein). The unfortunate thing is, while the use of these actors was a strategic choice, they're just not that interesting as characters. Craig T. Nelson is just a grab, now that people know him from Pixar's The Incredibles (2004).The character that is interesting to watch is Tangina. In a way, the story feels like what James Wan's Insidious (2010) drew inspiration from. Tangina is the know all of spiritual infestations. What probably makes the viewer pay attention is Zelda Rubinstein's voice alone; it's so light in pitch. However, that's it for characters. She may provide more exposition to the story, but at least she provides context in a captivating way. Not even the understanding of how Carol Anne communicates with the specters is explained in much detail. Yet, she's constantly quoted as the staple of the franchise. What the script does do correctly is not following the usual clichés horror films contain in terms of death. That's a nice change. Sadly, this doesn't help with how the viewer will perceive the horror on screen.While the horror elements on screen would be scary to anyone in real life, the way they're used here is half and half. The real disturbing imagery doesn't really come about until later in the film. Initially, the ""scary"" activities start very mild and do very little. The moments are more eyebrow raising than anything else. The real scary thing is that this franchise has its own curse. Both Dominique Dunne and Heather O'Rourke would not live long after this film was made. For an improperly rated PG film though, there are moments of blood and gore. Martin Casella would have one of the most shocking scenes in the entire franchise, which would also be parodied in other media. The practical effects used are well done, considering the film crew used actual skeletons on the set without telling their cast. Talk about something that makes your skin crawl.Adding to the visuals is the camerawork provided by Matthew F. Leonetti. The shots captured are dynamic enough to show different portions of the house and the creepy spooks that end up terrorizing the Freeling family. One of the best shots featured was of the cemetery located on top of the valley, it is a gorgeous view. Leonetti also filmed for Raise the Titanic (1980), Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), Commando (1985), Hard to Kill (1990), Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997) directed by his brother John R. Leonetti, Rush Hour 2 (2001), 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) and Dawn of the Dead (2004). Lastly the film score composed by Jerry Goldsmith was entertaining to listen to. Carol Anne's theme is the most recognizable using a children's choir but there are other tracks that work. One thing that never made sense was the US national anthem....why was that a thing?This film is liked by numerous people, but for those who don't, it's apparent why. The scares are not really there, things are left unanswered about one of the main characters and the rest except one are just there. That doesn't take away the music, camerawork and practical effects looking good though. It just slightly above average.",Poltergeist
97,PredragReviews,"""They're heeeere!""",7,21 January 2017,"Sometimes to judge a film fairly you really need to consider the time at which it was made and what film-making technology existed at that time. This was the first big budget film to really tackle the subject of paranormal investigation, and at the time it was made it was seamless and sleek. It would be easy for people today to put it down for some of the early 1980's effects, but let's flip this perspective around and consider that no CGI what-so-ever was used. But at the same time, ""Poltergeist"" has a strangely family-friendly vibe. It was directed by Tobe Hooper, but it has the unmistakable fingerprints of producer/writer Steven Spielberg all over it. It focuses on an ordinary, harmless suburban family living their usual lives (their biggest problem is the death of a pet bird), which is suddenly thrown into chaos by outside forces. And unlike most horror movies, there isn't even a lot of violence... well, except for one grotesque hallucination.Don't expect the usual gore and typical shocks you see in all modern horror films these days, Poltergeist is not about that. With all of the elements of visual effects, sound, acting, directing (Tobe Hooper) and writers (Steven Spielberg) this is one film that achieves everything you want to see in a motion picture. Anyway, Jo Beth Williams and Craig T. Nelson are great in this film. They have real chemistry. You believe they love each other and are a team. The kids are pretty great, too. It's actually quite a thoughtful movie and even has an odd warmth to it. Though there are a few scary moments. The final fifteen minutes are played out to such effect, that one could call it pure horror.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Poltergeist
98,pc95,Still has some Spook/Energy,7,18 January 2021,"I'd watched this a long time back, and decided to rewatch, as I'd forgotten much of it. Definitely a 'popcorn' movie that still manages to captivate over much of its runtime. Late director Hooper and reportedly Spielberg (taking majority writing credit) have brought in a movie that seems to evoke some visual aspects of Close Encounters, a bit from Raiders of the Lost Ark, and with ET's external shots. It also seems akin to the 'Twilight Zone' in plot. So then, visually it certainly influences later Ghostbusters. The best parts of the movie are its wonderful conversations and explanations about lost souls and Ghosts sleepwalking in reality. One of the best scenes was the rendering of the Ghosts on camcorder playback with hinting look at people from a bygone era (20s,30s?) behind the glimmering lights. By the end of the movie things become a bit excessive and silly, but there's enough spectacle throughout both for nostalgia's sake and horror-fantasy, that Poltergeist manages a solid energetic watch.",Poltergeist
99,philip_vanderveken,They're good!!!!!,8,23 February 2005,"Normally I'm not a fan of horror movies, because most movies in the genre lack realism and are completely over-the-top (with hundreds of zombies crawling around, blood splattering all over the place,...). But not every horror movie fits that description and ""Poltergeist"" is certainly one of the more original ones.We see a middle-class suburban family, living in an average family house in a very nice neighborhood. So far, nothing abnormal, except for one thing. Through a dead channel on the television, their youngest daughter, Carol Anne, seems to be connecting with ghosts or spirits. Soon the creatures show themselves by coming out of the TV and entering the house's walls. In the beginning it all seems to be innocent and harmless. The ghosts do some tricks, much to the amusement of the family, but don't harm them. At least not in the beginning, because later on they start terrorizing the family with an angry tree and a murderous doll and finally even abduct Carol Anne into her bedroom closet, the entrance to the ""other"" side.The special effects may look a bit dated, but you have to take into account that this movie was created in 1982, so long before the time of the excellent computer animated graphics that we know now. The story is very good as well, but it is the acting who makes a real difference. All actors did a fine job, but especially Heather O'Rourke is very good as the platinum blonde Carol Anne Freeling. Despite her young age, she is very convincing and did an excellent job in this movie.If you want to see a very good horror classic, without ridiculous amounts of blood or gore, than this is definitely the movie to see. I give it an 8/10.",Poltergeist

The only thing I find more bizarre then the movie, is the fact that real skeletons were used in this movie.I am surprise how Steven Spielberg worked on both productions of this movie and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, at the same time.It is so sad to see that such a beautiful,talented and intelligent girl as Heather O'Rourke,(the girl who played Carol Anne) died by cardiopulmonary at such a young age of 12. (Not to mention Dominique Dunne, who plays Dana Freeling, that was killed by her boyfriend with only 16 years old)And if Spielberg wasn't paying attention to the actor Oliver Robbins in the set, in the scene where he is strangled by the clown's arms, we could had three deaths instead of two.An ordinary family has their lives turned upside down when strange events starts to happen in their house. Carol Anne, the youngest of the children, become connected to the spirits by the television. What looks only strange, starts to become bizarre when Carol Anne disappears with the ghosts and terrible events starts to happen in their house.Ps: Since Spielberg and George Lucas are friends, you can see a lot of references to Star Wars in this movie in Robbie's toys.",Poltergeist
101,Screen_Blitz,"Scary, chilling haunted house thriller makes for an exciting spookfest",8,15 December 2016,"Horror films centering on ghosts haunting an average American family have dated back to the early age of Hollywood, arguably during the silent film era. Ever since then, many Hollywood directors have tried emulate the effective scare factor in films dealing with a family fighting against evil spirits. Some attempts have prevailed, others have fallen victim to dull, unscary duds. This haunted house horror flick directed by Tobe Hooper, the man behind the legendary 70s horror flick 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' is not only far from the latter category but still manages to hold up it's scare hallmark to this day. In this stellar 80s horror film, Hooper maintains a helping hand from legendary filmmaker Steven Spielberg who not only serves as the screenwriter but also a co-producer with his frequent collaborator Frank Marshall to bloom a spine-chilling supernatural film that leaves you scooting at the edge of your seat. This film follows a family living in a suburban California neighborhood, the family consists of Diane Freeling (played by JoBeth Williams), her husband Steven (played by Craig T. Nelson), and their three children: 16-year old Dana (played by Dominique Dunne), middle child Robbie (played by Oliver Robins), and their youngest Carol Anne (played by Heather O'Hourke). When the family is unexpectedly visited by evil spirits and the youngest child is subsequently abducted, the family must acquire the help of an expert parapsychologist Tangina Barrons (played by Zelda Rubinstein) to save her.When Tobe Hooper made 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' in 1974, he proved to have more than the potential to establishing a nerve-wracking atmosphere without feeling the need to rely heavily on gratuitous gore and stock characters; both of which made major trademarks in the horror genre during the 80s and 90s. Instead, he preserves a scary atmosphere not only through spooky imagery including a tree in the background that springs to life in a malevolent manner, and a sinister clown doll (though not with the scary facial features as Chucky in 'Child's Play') but also through effectively building suspenseful gravitas. And he successfully accomplishes this without relying on contrived jump scares. From the opening minutes of the ghost terrorizing the family, to the loud, hair-raising climax following the full-scale paranormal invasion of the house; the emotions of the characters can greatly be felt. Straight-out spook scares along with a grotesquely gruesome hallucination sequence in a bathroom are all Tobe Hooper has under his belt, he gracefully offers a few tongue-in-cheeks to deflate at least some of the horror. In terms of performances, the cast gives some alright performances as the Freeling family, but perhaps the most top-notch is the emotionally chilling portrayal of the parapsychologist Tangina Barrons by Zelda Rubinstein who provides some chilling substance and fear as the helping hand in their unpleasant predicament.Poltergeist is an astonishing horror film achievement by Tobe Hooper, a heart-stopping horror flick that makes for an honest scare experience. Children are in danger throughout the picture, there is an explicit sense of terror that pushes it's PG-rating far over the edge (and possibly the PG-13 rating), and there are plenty of moement to make an average child (and teen) struggle to go to bed at night. Calling the horror film of the decade may feel a bit of an overstatement as it doesn't quite touch the pinnacle of the 80s horror genre. Nonetheless, it is a solid supernatural thriller that really works even to this day.",Poltergeist
102,Maciste_Brother,Over-the-top bi-polar haunted house movie,6,29 October 2003,"SpoilersPOLTERGEIST is an over-the-top (OTT) haunted house film which sorta suffers from ""bi-polarism."" We all know the controversy about who really directed the movie. Oddly enough, IMDB has included Spielberg as ""co-director"" of the movie, adding more controversy to the whole thing. Personally, I don't think we'll ever know the truth behind the making of this movie (unless an actor comes out and spills the beans) but by just looking at it, it's obvious the movie was directed by Tobe Hooper. You only have to watch all his films to see his unique style of filmmaking in evidence throughout POLTERGEIST. With that said, POLTERGEIST also contains a ton of typical Spielberg treacly bits and ideas which gives this film a particular bi-polar character. Some moments are total Hooper (the Tangina character, the attempt to go through the other side, the ever extending corridor, the overall chaos, etc) while others are total Spielberg (the suburbs, kids in jeopardy, cue-in the clever one-liners, the constant whispering, the showy special effects, etc). Fortunately, the movie NEVER suffers from this ""bi-polarism."" In fact, I think it added a lot of odd character to the film.The real problem with POLTERGEIST is the ridiculously over-the-top horror elements, most of them during the ending. The film should have ended after they rescue Carol Anne. Up to that point, the movie is steady and even if there are some OTT moments (the tree attacking the kid), it's still pretty much fun and sorta credible. But the ending, after they rescue Carol Anne, feels tacked-on and suddenly the film's credibility is literally thrown out the window. For instance, the kids are back in the room. If those kids were real, they wouldn't have returned to that room, with that closet and that clown, for anything in the world. It just doesn't make any sense for them to be there again after what they went through. Then there are the coffins popping out of the earth, the numerous attacks on JoBeth Williams, the odd monsters appearing here and there (what were they?). But the most ludicrous thing in the movie is that huge vagina-like monster appearing in the closet and trying to suck the kids and Williams. I mean, come on! What in hell was that? It's the goofiest monster thing (I don't know what to call it) ever conceived for a movie. I always laugh out loud whenever I watch that moment. It's not scary or terrifying. It's just over-the-top silly. Had they come up with a less cheesy monster, I think the film would have been a classic but for now, the OTT ending sorta keeps POLTERGEIST in the silly category.If you're a huge Tobe Hooper fan like me, watching POLTERGEIST is a no-brainer. Just remember that this is a Steven Spielberg produced movie.",Poltergeist
103,baumer,GET OUT!!!,7,21 August 2001,"Poltergeist is a slightly entertaining, mildly frightening film that suffers from a horribly written final fifteen minutes.  And that is too bad because the rest of film is quite good, it's just that what happens at the end of the film seriously hinders what you feel about the rest of the movie.  If Brody went under water with a knife and some flippers at the end of Jaws to try and kill the shark, would it have been as good?  If Michael Myers pulled off his mask at the end of Halloween and said "" surprise!!!""  would Halloween have gone down in history as one of the best horror films ever? If Leatherface just gave up half way through the forest while chasing Sally through the woods, would it have been as revered as it is?  The answer to those questions are most certainly NO!!  What happens at the end of Poltergeist is just awful.  I like Spielberg and consider him to be one of the best directors in the world, but his botched explanation at the conclusion of Poltergeist is abyssmal.  It is on par with any number of dim-witted teenagers venturing into a dark barn and calling out hello 12 times before they get hacked with a machete by Jason.  We'll get to this later.What is good about Poltergeist is some of the basic primal fears it makes us deal with and comprehend.  This is the story of a suburban family and suburban kids that are afraid of things that really have no basis of fear to them.  But large, ominous trees are foreboding and evil looking.  Clowns have evil smiles and look mischievous.  Night lights are always on and there may always be something under the bed.  Most of the time in life as in this film, these are all irrational fears.  But the one time they are not just fears, the one time they become deadly entities, they can kill.  This is what Poltergeist is great at.Spoilers ahead.Poltergeist is about a house that was built on an Indian burial ground. When the company excavated the ground, they removed the headstones but not the bodies.  So the house wants to extract some revenge for this blunder. Freaky things begin to happen.  For instance, the young Carol Anne gets kidnapped by the TV people.  The family spends a great deal of time and probably money to get her back.  And when they finally do, they decide that it is time to move out of the house.  So instead of moving out immediately, instead of getting someone else to pack up all their things and perhaps stay at a relatives house or a hotel while this is being done, they decide to stay one more night and then leave the next day.  Now I don't know about you but if I had just seen my daughter kidnapped to a different world, watch ghostly skeletons appear from that porthole, watch my daughters room whip things around like a 24 hour temper tantrum, have a spirit lady help us get our daughter back by ""cleaning"" the house, then having to go into that porthole myself and get my daughter back and watch as many other ghostly things happen, I'll tell yo this.  I am not staying another minute in that house.  I am getting the hell out.  Not only do they not leave right away, but they send the kids back into the same room where all of the pandemonium started.  That is just ludicrous.  That is the acme of stupidity.  And this left me feeling bitter towards the film.  Of course this sets up some of the better scenes in the film but what a silly way to do it.  Couldn't Spielberg think of a better way than that to do it?6.5 out of 10-- The film is tense in some parts but laughable in others and it is not the film that everyone seems to think.  There are other better horrors out there, even from the 80's.  Check out April Fools Day, The Changeling and Angel Heart for a good chilling experience.  Poltergeist is worth a look, but don't expect a masterpiece.",Poltergeist
104,gedikreverdi,It's not haunting. It's an invasion of poltergeists,8,8 October 2021,Some poltergeists invade her their house and abduct her daughter and she takes her back from their realm and an old tree wants to swallow her son.The mother: let me dye my hair in the very house and take a long bath one last time.Their house was actually a cemetery and they only moved the headstones so they were furious and abducted the kid. The psychic that found the passageway between the closet and the ceiling with a rope was such a fun character. (And this seems to have inspired Insidious a lot). And then the dead bodies in their coffins started to come to the surface. The moment when the mother fought the dead bodies in the muddy waters of the pool in construction. The man dreamed of himself peeling his face off with his nails in the mirror and this was the most gory scene in the film. They left the newly constructed town and checked in a motel where they took television out of the room.It was really fun to watch but I think it should have been some twenty minutes shorter. And I'll definitely watch the sequel to this.,Poltergeist
105,mentalcritic,Better than the MPAA rating would have you believe,8,21 April 2005,"At first, the PG rating on the Australian DVD cover put me off. I need not have worried. Poltergeist is one of those films that, were it made today, would probably face a more restrictive rating. Parly because its content has an untapped potential to disturb, but mostly because the MPAA and its equivalents in other English-speaking countries have become more nanny-like as time has gone on. Not that Poltergeist is a soft film by any stretch. It is a two-hour testament to the fact that it is not the quantity of kills or scares that count so much as the quality. In spite of the fact that it has more than its fair share of silly moments, and not a single character dies during the running time, it keeps the viewer in a heightened state of fear throughout.Part of the winning combination for Poltergeist is in the casting. JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson fit the ideal parent archetype perfectly without becoming nauseating. Dominique Dunne works wonders in the minimal screen time she has, making it all the more tragic that she would not live to see a sequel, or any future performances for that matter. Oliver Robins is competent, but Spielberg wisely decided to minimise his screen time. He is incapable of emoting in a believable, human fashion, or so his performance here would suggest. The big surprise in this cast is Heather O'Rourke, who, like any good actor, manages to milk a line consisting of a few words for all it is worth. Indeed, the signature warning ""they're here"" would not have become such without her creepy intonation.Part of the film's problems lie in the confusion over who is really directing here. Tobe Hooper, fresh off such fare as the TV version of Salem's Lot, and with the mother of all slasher films on his resumé, should have been trusted to deliver a masterpiece on his own. For the duration of Poltergeist, however, one can clearly see the arm of Spielberg protruding from his buttocks. Whether Hooper would have made a more explicitly violent film without being puppeteered is debatable, given that he supposedly shot The Texas Chainsaw Massacre with a PG rating in mind. But this is where Hooper excels as a director. Rather than brutalise his cast before the camera, he shows enough to get the viewer's imagination going, and lets said imagination do the rest. This is the one touch in Poltergeist that gives it bite. Without this Hooper touch, it is doubtful that it would be remembered as such a classic.Unlike Tobe Hooper's other most well-known classic, Poltergeist has not aged that well. The special effects look very dated, as do the sets and costumes. Most films bear a mark of the year they were made in to one degree or another. Classics like RoboCop, for example, announce that they were made in the late 1980s through their political tone. Poltergeist, on the other hand, might as well have had ""this film was shot in 1981 or thereabouts"" stamped on every frame. Even the clever placement of Star Wars toys, obviously insisted upon by little Steven Spielberg, dates the film mostly due to the fact that the toys seen have not been in production since the original Star Wars films went to weekly rental at the emerging video libraries of the times.Still, when all is said and done, Poltergeist is a film worthy of an eight out of ten. If nothing else, it proves that one cannot judge the quality of a film solely by its rating, at least not where films from the 1980s or before are concerned, in any case. It is well worth seeing once.",Poltergeist
106,vip_ebriega,Classic 80's horror.,10,9 February 2007,"My Take: A sometimes confusing yet wonderfully-told ghost story.I was warned before that this was too scary for me. While it wasn't that scary the way it was when it was released in 1982, ""Poltergeist"" is a must-see horror flick. It still keeps the interesting story, neat special-effects, colorful script and maybe even some scenes that would give you the creeps. This film is tells the story of a family forced to fight evil forces from beyond the grave when they invade they're subtle home. Steven Spielberg wrote the story, so expect it to be as good as it can get. Tobe Hooper directs, so expect it to have classical touches of horror and some mixes of humor. And, as written by Steven Spielberg (who was, at the time, also working on the similarly Suburban-set E.T.), the movie follows the exploits of some very interesting characters. Think of it as CLONE ENCOUNTERS with supernatural forces. While there is not much gruesomeness in this horror film, it tends to give you the creeps in a different, but effective way. Instead, Spielberg makes us care for some colorful characters in plight of some imaginative, often mind-boggling, horrors. The result is another classic that brings to mind the cliché ""they don't make 'em like this anymore"". Still a must-see. Rating: ***** out of 5.",Poltergeist
107,one9eighty,Dated but classic supernatural film,7,8 October 2018,"Poltergeist is the story of how building on an ancient burial ground, and not caring for the vessels of the dead, can come back to haunt property developers (and property sellers).A family move into one of the houses, that the father of the family's employer builds. All seems to be going OK until one day weird things start happening. The youngest daughter, who is able to hear and see things in TV screens which just display static, announces that somebody has arrived. The weird and sometimes supernatural events start to escalate; cutlery bending, the dog listening to invisible commands from shadows, chairs on tables, freak storms, things moving across the kitchen as if pulled by an invisible rope - and ultimately, the young daughter is sucked into the TV. It turns out the families house is haunted by ghosts, and after a team of scholars investigate it's soon recognised that these aren't just any ghosts, they're poltergeists. An experienced 'cleaner' is called in to help the family try and get their daughter back, and rid the house of the supernatural spirits. This is a 1982 film written by Steven Spielberg and directed by Tobe Hooper; starring Craig T Nelson, JoBeth Williams, Zelda Rubinstein and Heather O'Rourke. This was always marketed as a horror film but I never felt that scared when I watched it in the 80/90's, I found it as much of a supernatural suspense and thriller film as I did a Horror - just with a lot more special effects thrown in. There are horror parts in it, but then no more scary then what you could find in films of the same year, such as; ""Creepshow"", ""ET"", and even ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"". In fact it's probably fair to say, that, with other notable horror films out the same year, this film was relatively tame in its horror theme. Films such as; ""Basket Case"", ""Friday the 13th, Part III"", ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"", ""Amityville II: The Possession"" and ""The Thing"" all delivered more horror to audiences. Despite this, it did quite well at the box office - it was the 8th highest grossing film of the year, so it obviously affected some people the right way. That's not to say I personally don't, or didn't like this film - I do/did, but it retains a place in my heart as a great cult film, rather than one that I love and would go out of my way to re-watch regularly. The story is relatively straight forward and easy to follow - taken directly from many an urban legend about building on ancient burial grounds. My main gripe here would be how some things seem mixed up and unexplained. Why has it taken 7 years for poltergeists of the dead, whose graves have been disturbed, to wreak their vengeance on the living? How is the devils supposedly linked, according to narrative relayed? Why did the tree turn evil and try gobbling the son? Why are the supernatural events isolated to one house despite the whole neighbourhood being built on the same burial ground? How big was the burial ground, considering the one shown later in the film is big and also contained behind a fence. Why is a second floor bedroom cupboard then portal to evil, when a graveyard wouldn't have had a second story in the first place? Why oh why, did the mum let the children sleep in the same room of evil - despite not wanting to spend another night in the house towards the end of the film. And why - for heaven's sake, didn't they cover the swimming pool hole over with some kind of tarpaulin to prevent falls. These are just my own irks, and these are only likely to come from dedicated film/horror fans - because the most part, regular film goers wouldn't be too bothered about these kinds of things - because the story itself is entertaining enough.The acting is decent, everyone from the younger cast members to the more experienced actors do a believable job. I don't like the dumbed down moments the cast have to advance the plot, but that's a typical Hollywood thing to allow audiences to feel engaged and get information. The special effects may look dated by today's standard -but they were good at the time. It's a harmless film with a decent pacing which gets quicker as the events of the film unfold. I'd give this a 7 out of 10.",Poltergeist
108,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Classic horror with notable special effects.,7,5 August 2019,"Some movies have spoilers, and then some movies have so deeply-ingrained themselves in the popular culture zeitgeist that it's nearly impossible to not have some knowledge of them before actually sitting down and watching the film itself. Poltergeist (1982) is just such a film for me. I've seen it referenced on many different lists and other places that claim it to be a great horror film. I've also seen it referenced and parodied in several places (like The Simpsons). The combination of its notoriety and its parody meant that I had pretty much already seen this film before actually watching it.Since I already knew the ""big reveal"" that caused the main characters' house to become haunted, I had to watch this movie with a slightly different focus. Mainly: how and why has this film stood the test of time? Sure, it dates itself sometimes with its early-1980s style; however, the special effects for its time were particularly top-notch (all things considered). While only one of these special effects doesn't seem that realistic by today's standards, the rest of them make me wonder how they pulled them off at the time.What's refreshing with Poltergeist is its ability to be scary (albeit in a family-friendly way, ironically enough) but not resort to jump scares or gore like modern horror. Of course, its two sequels and 2015 remake apparently never lived up to its original creativity or timelessness. Still, while it's been referenced to death (har har) in popular culture, I can now honestly say that I've seen this movie all the way through. Although this also means that I don't likely need to watch it again.Classic horror with notable special effects, I give Poltergeist 3.5 stars out of 5.",Poltergeist
109,jluis1984,Terrific!,8,27 June 2006,"I will start saying that I have very fond memories of ""Poltergeist"", as this was one of the few films that terrified me as a kid and among those films that started my interest in cinema in general. Those very good memories of it made me doubt of re-watching it as many movies I enjoyed as a kid have been turned out as disappointing now that I'm older. To my surprise, ""Poltergeist"" was an exception, and more than 20 years after its release it still holds up well and manage to give good scares.The plot is the classic story of a haunted house tale, a young family is attacked by ghosts that inhabit their home, things go wrong as they kidnap the youngest of the family, little Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke). The story follows the basic outline of this kind of ghost stories, with the family going from disbelief to terror as the poltergeist activity increases. Sure, not the most original plot ever, but the magic of ""Poltergeist"" is in the execution of the film.Many controversies arose about who exactly directed this film, as apparently, producer/writer Steven Spielberg was in charge of most of the artistic decisions leaving only the actual shooting to Hooper. This is the most plausible scenario as Spielberg's influence shows up through the movie and it could be easily referred as ""E.T.""'s scary brother. This is for both good and bad, as ""Poltergeist"" exemplifies the two most important characteristics of a Spielberg film: its imaginative compositions and its shameless excess of melodrama. As usual in his stories, children are the focus of the story, Carol Anne's kidnapping and her brother's haunting experiences with the ghosts become the central events of the movie in a similar, albeit opposite, way to Elliot and her sister meeting with the extraterrestrial in ""E.T."".Spielberg's story takes the haunted house story from the dark ancient castles of Gothic novels to the suburban landscape of 80s society. Contrary to old school haunted house movies, ""Poltergeist"" makes a good (and extensive) use of special effects to portray the haunting, and despite looking a bit outdated by now, the visual effects still are effective. Despite everything pointing to the contrary, one is left to wonder if Tobe Hooper had a hand in the many action-set-pieces that take place in the film, as its over-the-top action is very reminiscent to Hooper's style in horror movies.The cast is another important element in ""Poltergeist""'s success, every member in the cast is simply perfect. The parents, played by Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams are excellent and have very good chemistry; their believable performance is what gives the movie a heart, as the fear is based more on their reactions than in the overload of special effects shown. The children of the family are very good, but even when they are the focus of the film, their role is somewhat small. Completing the cast are Beatrice Straight as a parapsychologist and Zelda Rubinstein as Tangina Barrows, the Clairvoyant; both of them very effective and appropriate in their roles.Still, ""Poltergeist"" is not a perfect film, the script is filled with action-set-pieces that while look very cool and completely terrifying feel somewhat out of place in the film. The characters at times make very illogical and out of character decisions that serve only to move on the plot. Spielberg has claimed that the movie contains most of the things that gave him nightmares as a child and this is possibly the reason of the many disjointed scary scenes placed on the film. However, one has to recognize that this little details only come out when one gets picky on the movie and that at first sight come unnoticeable. After all, the movie is written more as a surreal nightmare than as a realistic portrait of a poltergeist.""Poltergeist"" was a favorite of my childhood and still is a haunting experience. I would not say it is a perfect film, but it probably will become a classic in the near future due to its unforgettable scenes and its entertaining plot. Definitely one of the best horror movies of the 80s. 8/10",Poltergeist
110,tbills2,Poltergeist is One of the Great Scary Movies,8,7 July 2013,"Poltergeist isn't quite a horror picture, more a generous scary movie, but one of the great ones. Poltergeist is too commendable for cheap scares. It's got a good scary story and sharp editing, simply great overall production value with excellent special effects. Poltergeist lives off its spooky effects. Poltergeist has some of the best special effects ever seen. All the best moments happen with the poltergeist, and Carol Anne, and the rest of the story is laid out very nicely. Heather O'Rouke is the Poltergeist's poster child. Heather O'Rouke dying at the tender age of 12 gives Poltergeist an added dimension of spooky. Poltergeist is a chiller. Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams are very good in their respective roles. Neither were major stars, but both were terrifically cast. Craig T. Nelson is more in the supportive role, while JoBeth Williams is Poltergeist's great star. She is the focal force of the movie. JoBeth Williams is completely capturing and very excellent. Poltergeist has such a distinct identity to it. It surely had a preset following in place that allowed people to quickly pick up on it, immediately loving it, an easy cultural niche. Poltergeist has significant depth stemming from its existential nature. Poltergeist is a great scary movie as it is, and always will always be a classic, surviving the test of time.",Poltergeist
111,The_Movie_Cat,"""No more!""",4,12 November 2000,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SLIGHT SPOILERS.
My sentiments exactly.There's still, amazingly, some doubt about whom actually directed this movie. I think it's quite clear, even the continuity announcer introduced it as being by Stephen Spielberg. Where's the argument? Did the man behind The Texas Chainsaw Massacre direct this film, or the man who would follow this with E.T.?Only two scenes show anything like a Tobe Hooper influence; a scene where a man rips the flesh from his face (which then turns out to be an illusion, which doesn't make sense), or another where the mother of the family (JoBeth Williams) contrivedly falls into the swimming pool and gets confronted with dead bodies.The rest of the way it's a sickly-sweet tale of cute pets, light family comedy, Disney-style ghost animation and a spoilt brat that can't act being sucked into a television set. Okay, this may have reached a ""horror-lite"" PG audience in the states, where it fulfils its function well  to scare six-year-olds. But in Britain you had to be fifteen or over to get into see what is about as scary as a teddybear's tea party.Whoever was behind this  and I fully believe it was Spielberg, he has no idea of a lot of things  has no concept about what is scary. Silly giant heads, flashing lights, special effects... its all such nonsense. Two sequels followed, both of which are improved by not being as long. They're still as irritating, but at least they finish quicker. The Other Side is probably the pick of the bunch, a mediocre offering enlivened by Julian Beck's spirited characterisation of the Priest.The final part of the trilogy saw a decrease in special effects and a more psychological approach to the hauntings. Unfortunately, it was about as interesting as a bag of sugar. Now living with her Aunt and Uncle (including a worryingly tactile Tom Skerritt), the constant ""mirror"" motif this one flags up is unsettling at first, repetitive after the first fifty billion times. And how often does someone scream ""Carol Anne!"" in this movie? The dialogue coach must have had an easy time of it. The only other attempt at spooking the audience is by having Carol Anne's Speak and Spell ominously playing by itself. Though this is lost on the family who think it's Stephen Hawking come round for tea. The film also nicks one or two riffs from The Exorcist, though if horror movies were rock and roll then this would be less Hendrix, more Leonard Cohen.A turgid end to a turgid series, a non-stop boreathon trilogy that can't see past the dollar signs and the patronising derivative banality of its lazy premise. I really, really disliked these cheesy films and would rather have root canal surgery than have to watch any of them ever again.",Poltergeist
112,SmileysWorld,Now THIS is a horror movie!!,8,6 October 2001,"There are two types of ""horror"" films:There are the scary ones, which is what the word ""horror"" means in the first place,and then there is the bloody,gory kind.Perhaps the latter kind should be categorized under another name.At any rate,Poltergeist is a good horror film.It goes beyond the idea of typical ghosts in sheets jumping out of nowhere and saying ""boo!"".Most of the adventure takes place in their world rather than ours,although we cannot see what is going on there.This is a very thrilling movie.It has great special effects and all of the scare elements that make a horror film what it is supposed to be.The clown in the chair at the foot of the boy's bed was a particularly tense moment for me.This is the only movie I went to see 4 times at the theater,partly to watch others' reactions.I have often heard that the film,and it's two sequels,were the victim of some type of curse,as after each film was released,a member of the cast passed away,including Heather O'Rourke,who played Carol Anne, after the 3rd film.She was only 10.Curse? Coincidence? Who knows? I guess anything is possible.All in all,this is one of the best films ever for the horror genre.",Poltergeist
113,gregsrants,One of the best horror/thrillers of the decade,8,3 March 2004,"In 1982, Steven Spielberg pulled off an incredible feat.  In June of that year, Spielberg released two films only weeks apart that were both highly successful yet diversely different in both subject matter and their target audiences.  One went on to become the highest grossing film of all-time (E.T.), the other spawned a franchise (Poltergeist).  Poltergeist had a screen credit of being directed by Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), but history has revealed that it was Spielberg's vision, editing and overall command of the shooting that was really behind the making of this extraordinary film.   Poltergeist brought back the traditional haunted house genre that lay dormant and restless since The Amityville Horror in 1979.  The story surrounds a family's house that has been punctured by the spirit world that seem keen on the youngest daughter of the clan  Carol Ann Freeling, played by newcomer Heather O'Rourke.  At first, the family meets the strange happenings in the home with playful pleasure, but in an instant the poltergeists intentions turn against the Freelings, and their daughter is captured and taken back to the supernatural world where communication is possible only through the bedroom television.The Freelings waste little time and soon contact a paranormal group, well over their heads, to help them rescue their daughter from the unseen captures.  It becomes clearly evident however, that the group is over matched, and they call in a poltergeist expert, Tangina Barrons (played with relative enthusiasm and wit by Zelda Rubinstein) to assist with the phenomena.   Tangina then leads the Freelings through the unknown, both calming their fears and eventually finding a portal that may be the key to retrieving their daughter.Poltergeist works as both a horror and a thriller.  The cast, lead by O'Rourke, Jo-Beth Williams, Craig T. Nelson and Oliver Robins have real chemistry and are believable as a family unit, and unlike most horror films, they make sound judgments and know their limitations.  When Carol Ann's bedroom becomes overtaken by the ghostly spirits, they lock the room and keep away rather than trying to fight something they cannot contain.  And when things begin to look bleak, they call for help and look for experts in the field.  This is an intelligent horror that doesn't have people running up the stairs when they should be running out the door.Put together with a modest budget of less than $12 million, Poltergeist stretched it's dollars to provide us with an incredible array of special effects that still hold up well after 20 years of viewing.  Sure, the scene where a scientist literally pulls his face off or when the bedroom is opened and we see items flying at random as if in a ghostly tornado, might be better served with CGI if made today, the effects still keep the story progressing with a sense of credibility.  Probably what keeps things so rooted in acceptability is how simplistic some of the special effects were in the larger scenes.  A closet full of strobe lights are all that is required to convince us that it is a portal to another world and a fan gently blowing the hair of mother Williams' is believable as the spirit of her child flying past her.    Simple plausible.Whatever the reasons, Poltergeist works.  One of the few screenplays written by Spielberg from one of his own stories, Poltergeist has all the elements that we now associate with the master director.  There is a strong family unit, a child as the central character, above average production values and most notably, not one fatality in the entire film despite all the jilts and jolts.  The closing scenes of chaos including a pool of skeletons (later revealed to be authentic), is pure movie magic with frantic pacing and edge of your seat suspense.  Since it's release, a lot has been made of the back stories and the curse surrounding the production of the franchise.  Heather O'Rourke tragically died at a young age due to an internal infection and Dominique Dunne (who played a smaller role as her sister) was murdered the same year as the films release.  The subsequent sequels have also included characters that died shortly after their films completion. Truth or fiction, lore or legend, these stories add to the mystique and mystery surrounding the film.  Having knowledge of the curse' makes it even scarier and gives it kind of a feeling like Naomi Watts' character must have experienced in The Ring, as if just by watching, you are contributing to the ongoing haunting.Like most movies successful in the late 70's early 80's, there were sequels that were made with considerably higher budgets but less than stellar results (Superman III anyone?).  Neither of the Poltergeist sequels or subsequent television programming could come close to capturing the essence of the original.  Besides, how can you top what is now one of the most famous movie tag-lines of all time `They'rrreeee Here'?Strong recommendation.",Poltergeist
114,fernandoschiavi,"Featuring some classic scenes involving a gigantic tree and a scary toy clown, Poltergeist still holds its place as a classic",8,23 October 2021,"When we think of epoch-making horror movies, some names always pound our heads. We remember Alfred Hitchcock's natural talent for films of the genre and also for good thrillers, we also think of Kubrick's genius in The Shining. Many other names are also evoked, such as the grandiose The Rosemary Baby, The Exorcist, Bram Stoker's Dracula and some contemporaries such as The Call and the recent Invocation of Evil. It is impossible not to make reference to the explosion that was Poltergeist in 1982.Film and television have always lived a love-hate relationship. In the United States, a good part of the technicians who put television into operation came from the cinema (in Brazil, technicians, including screenwriters, presenters and artists, were recruited from the radio). In the mid-1950s, cinema began to feel competition with television when it lost a large part of its audience and, trying to invert this picture, it sought to innovate technically, as was the case with the invention of CinemaScope. One of the most acidic criticisms of television came in the early 1980s, by one of Hollywood's ""golden boys,"" Steven Spielberg, with the film Poltergeist (1982). The simple story of a family disturbed by the poltergeist effect (which brings to reality beings from another world) gained sensational aspects on screen.How did the spirits get into the house and take care of the little girl? Through the most prized appliance in the 20th century, television. The spirits appear, not terrifying but seducing, as in one of the countless television shows. The beauty constructed by the spirits to seduce hides the horror, as television normally does: the beauty constructed by the medium is to seduce, yes, but it is also to hide the great horror of the social ills of the viewers' lives. The film presents the critics, but does not totally condemn the conditions - after all, how can one disregard such an expressive phenomenon as television? Let's live with it, whether we like it or not. But the film suggests that it is necessary to find ways of living with television that do not result in intellectual blockage, that is, it is always necessary to maintain a dialogue of the intellect with the world and also with television itself, which, almost always, seeks to create only a hypnotic relationship about the viewer, as we can see in most people who watch certain programs.The director Tobe Hopper, famous for the anthology The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was overshadowed by the presence of Spielberg (screenwriter, screenwriter and producer), who set the tone for the film: the contrast between the quiet life of a typical North American family and the horrors hidden about it (many of the criticisms of the film depart precisely from this aspect ""a united family can overcome all obstacles"", which is common in Spielberg, but rare in Hopper), between the beautiful landscape and its underground black (the beautiful houses in the village where the characters live were built over an indigenous cemetery, where only the tombstones and not the bodies were removed), between the innocence of children and evil.Spielberg's argument is quite simple but extremely effective. Steve Freeling (Craig T. Nelson) is a realtor. He lives with his family in a village, and is a model for the American family. The family consists of his wife Diane (JoBeth Williams), and their children Dana, Robbie and Carol Anne (Dominique Dunne, Oliver Robins and Heather O'Rourke, respectively). However, strange events in the house cause the family to be disturbed. It all starts when Carol Anne wakes up one night and starts talking to the television, referring to them all the time. Little by little, strange things happen in the house, like furniture moving and trees attacking. Until, in a storm, Carol Anne disappears, and the Freelings have to deal with the supernatural to get their daughter back.Without major delays in its presentation, in the film we know the daily life of the Freeling family, composed by the couple Steve (Craig T. Nelson) and Diane (JoBeth Williams) with their three children, newly arrived in the new house, designed by the company where Steve works as a broker. Already in its opening, we see the youngest of the family, Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke, fascinating with her long blonde hair) establishing a strange interaction with some voices that apparently seem to come out of the television. From this point on, objects in the house start to move on their own and cutlery becomes crooked, until everything culminates in the disappearance of Carol Anne, whose voice begins to be heard coming out of the television set. With the help of experts in the study and capture of the so-called Poltergeist, the Freeling family begins trying to find a way to bring Carol Anne back.""Poltergeist"" into one of the main and most popular cult films from one of the heydays of Hollywood horror movies, but while he is a major and cult figure within paranormal horror, he has become It's hard to classify this classic Tobe Hooper production as one of those especially ghastly films that cause nightmares, chills or unease among the vast majority of viewers, even though it has one of the most bizarre and frightening sequences in the history of the genre. What is important to mention is that although it is not faultless in this respect, especially because only in its final part does it put aside the subtleties and definitely take off for action without limits, ""Poltergeist"" still manages to stay in the memory of those who see it. , because he always bets on a certain environment of fear and uncertainty that makes the complicated struggle that a typical North American family has to fight against sinister spirits that invade their home and kidnap the youngest and most innocent element of the household exciting and pervasive. .But Hooper re-engages near the end, and throws the viewer into a tangle of scenes and events that are strong enough to hold attention until the end, where the director allows himself the freedom to create an apparent ending to play with our expectations, with the script building an interesting and even humorous dynamic about the fantasy elements of the story. And this is one of the main merits of Poltergeist, as there is the presence of humor inserted in the midst of scenes of greater trash appeal, but these never sound out of place or break the mood of the scenes. On the contrary, they act as an unexpected and welcome fun factor.The great insight of Poltergeist, a title that alludes to the supernatural forces that surround the drama of the Freeling family, lies in its development, technical quality and good casting choices. Despite presenting a well-resolved horror, the film brings good strategies present in the suspense and comic scenes that do not clash with the rest of the film. The visual and sound effects also stand out, earning Poltergeist three Oscar nominations and a BAFTA. In the cast, a special caveat for JoBeth Williams made Diane Freeling the concerned and willing wife. One scene in particular, in which she tries to communicate with her missing daughter and receives a message through the girl's aura, wins over the audience. The father, played by Craig T. Nelson, is very much alive in her actions and this matters a lot in the load placed on the experience. Unbelief and skepticism are also well explored. As a counterpoint to this lack of faith, we have the expertise of veteran Beatrice Straight and an out-of-this-world comedy, brought by the great Zelda Rubinstein. Finally, among the three children of the junior cast, who stands out is the youngest Heather O'Rourke, the innocent girl who manages to contact the spirits that haunt her house. Her naiveté manages to soften the hardest hearts, and her sweet, fearful cry is enough to transport the audience into the film's setting. Their looks and their mouths were essential in creating the characteristics of little Carol Anne.Also featuring some classic scenes involving a gigantic tree and a scary toy clown, Poltergeist still holds its place as a classic, but it's unlikely to frighten the new generation who are now learning to appreciate the various carnage and then see the thriller obtained. In the horror of the 70s and 80s. But the influence this work had on future films about spirits that haunt houses, move furniture and disturb souls is undeniable. Watch the movie and realize how many mysteries and suspense of current scripts have a Poltergeist edge in the middle. A clear example of this is the new horror, Supernatural by James Wan, which copies the situations from Tobe Hooper's movie until it can't. But that's not bad, it's just a show of the value of the old terror acting on the current cruelty exposed in explicit torture and death.",Poltergeist

(both are from the same year), as this one is a horror film and quite a strong one...'Poltergeist' has elements characteristic from the 70's and 80's, yet it manages to be surprisingly modern and its impact is still deep. Like I said, it has elements from the 70's and 80's - for example, the house looks like the house from 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'E.T.', besides, there are ghost-like special effects not unlike 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'.On the other hand, it has very strong content which is so common in the 2000 generation, making it some 20 years ahead of its time. Not only strong, but disturbing and not recommendable for more fragile people.For something that is nearly 30 years old this sure is scary and freaks me out, with stuff such as: a little girl communicating with ghosts, spirits sucking the little girl through the TV and the extremely difficult and risky attempt to save her (which turns out to be successful but only after a long nightmarish experience), some absolutely terrifying spirits that could give you horrifying nightmares, a possessed tree winning a life of its own and grabbing that poor little boy through his bedroom window and nearly swallowing him, the terrifying swimming pool scene with skeletons, coffins and skeletons erupting from the ground throughout the neighborhood and in the house, the house possessed by dark and evil forces and even being collapsed into nothingness, the immense stress that this family faces because of these terrible events... as you see, a large number of creepy paranormal episodes.An interesting film but not necessarily a good one. It's not that there is that much of wrong with it (even considering it's far from being a masterpiece) but it's a very disturbing and frightening film. It ain't for everyone.

She was a very pretty little girl, she looked like a little doll or even a little angel. I think it's adorable the way she says the famous line «They're here» with her cute voice. Sadly she died ill and way too soon.Dominique Dunne stars as the older sister Dana in a minor role that unfortunately doesn't bring much to the movie because of that. A role that should have been bigger. Plus, she talks very little during the whole film. As such, I can't say much about her performance. But one thing I know: she was so beautiful.

The story revolves around a suburban Southern California family's dealings with noisy spirits (or poltergeists) that have invaded their home. Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams are the heads of the household who must resort to thoroughly unconventional means to get O'Rourke back when the poltergeists abduct her.  It is then learned that their house, and others like it built in the Cuesta Verde Estates, are built over what had once been a massive graveyard.Eschewing blood and gore for a combination of parapsychology, sci-fi-like special effects and suspense, POLTERGEIST ranks, with Kubrick's THE SHINING, as the premiere horror film of the 1980s.  Hooper, best known for his all-too-effective 1974 shocker THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, gets a lot of mileage out of the story and the cast.  Jerry Goldsmith's great score is the capper.  After nearly twenty years, two vastly inferior sequels, and a lame TV series that had nothing to do with this film, POLTERGEIST is still effectively suspenseful, as well as a clear influence on the more recent THE SIXTH SENSE.",Poltergeist

126,jp_91,One of the best horror films of the 80's!,10,26 June 2019,"Poltergeist alongside The evil dead are two of the best horror films of the 80's. I'm going to talk about Poltergeist, the most creepy film about a haunted house ever made! Haunted house genre is usually full of jump scares, but Poltergeist goes beyond, literally! The script is not the typical one, something wrong is happening at the Freeling's house, this evil Entity is playing like a kid but soon it becomes into a devil, unchaining a lot of suspense and horror! JoBeth Williams acting is amazing, really touching! She's is great. Beatrice Straight, Craig T. Nelson and Heather O'rourke bring to us great acting roles too! The special effects are cool and credible, specially chilling!A must see. They're here!",Poltergeist
127,rossrobinson,fantastic,10,14 November 2003,"I think Poltergeist is a fantastic movie. This was made in 1982, and this was the first ever Poltergeist movie in the series. I give this movie 10 out of 10 because i just think it is a fantastic movie to watch. Everyone who starred in this movie were fantastic",Poltergeist
128,Peach-2,Hooper or Spielberg?,8,21 January 1999,"The age old debate for me has always been that I can't figure out who directed this film. Poltergeist is an awesome ghost story and a truly entertaining film. It makes very few mistakes and is ahead of its time in special effects. I just wonder how much Spielberg had to do with the way this film was directed. Now Tobe Hooper has talent, if you have ever seen The Texas Chainsaw Massacre of Lifeforce, then you know what I mean. This film doesn't seem like a Tobe Hooper film. There are scenes that remind me of Spielberg, but not Hooper. If anybody else feels this way, write me if you know something. It's a mystery I would like solved.",Poltergeist
129,raybennetthays,"Not perfect, but feels perfect",10,26 July 2021,"The most important things are all here, a plot, a story, good acting, and a few actually good scares.To start off, the acting in this film is top-notch, when the little girl said, ""they're here"", I actually was scared, and Oliver Robbins as the son gives a seriously good performance, and Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams are also excellent.And it also has one of the best horror scores of all time, and the stretching hallway scene is such a well-directed sequence, and I was terrified at that scare with the clown, it was truly terrifying.And there was also well done tension.And once again, the little girl is so good in this, she can be creepy and adorable all at the same time, and I love it.Poltergeist is gripping, it's one of the best horror films of the early 80's, and it absolutely deserves an A+",Poltergeist
130,RossRivero99,A very well done horror movie,10,2 November 2014,"Tobe Hooper's Poltergeist was a movie that totally redefined the horror movie genre like that of The Shining (1980). The movie tells the story about a family whose house is haunted by ghosts when at first they don't even realize it until about an hour or so into the movie. Hooper and Spielberg were really good while making this movie especially with Spielberg's intelligent screenplay, and Hooper's Hitchcockian direction for the movie. But not only that the movie has a very good cast which includes JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson as the parents, Heather O'Rourke as the youngest child who says the most famous line in the movie ""They're Here!"", Dominique Dunne as the oldest child Dana (who unfortunately gets murdered a few months after the film's release),Oliver Robins as the middle child and only son Robbie who steals the show throughout the entire movie. the movie also has an intelligent supporting cast that includes Beatrice Straight (who won an Oscar for Sidney Lumet's Network (1976) as one of the scientists who is trying to help the Freeling family solve their problem, and Zelda Rubenstein who gives the best supporting performance in the entire movie as the lady who helps the Freeling parents save their youngest daughter. This movie goes on the list as one of the best horror movies ever made along with Kubrick's The Shining (1980), Psycho (1960), Alien (1979), and Silence of the Lambs (1991). One of the best movies of 1982.",Poltergeist
131,ronakkotian,Entertaining but doesn't hold up as well,7,31 October 2020,"There are some horror films like It that I don't find scary but still really fun to watch and Poltergeist is one of them.Poltergeist shows a family whose home gets haunted by several ghosts.An absolute classic, Poltergeist is one of those movies that is still watched to this day and inspired countless other horror films that have since tried to recapture the magic of this film. I can't begin to imagine how scary this film may have been to some when it originally came out and even to this day some people are still terrified of this movie. For me, Poltergeist was more entertaining than scary and it's mainly because this film hasn't really aged well. Looking at it now, some of the CGI looks really outdated and that has made the film less scary to me. Despite that, the film does use quite a few practical effects which still look good in my opinion. It may not hold up well but at the same time I enjoyed it. I loved the build up to all the spirits slowing taking over and the third act especially which gets really crazy is a lot of fun to watch.Despite being Tobe Hooper's film, the film has more of a Steven Spielberg mark to it which makes sense since he co-wrote and produced it. I really liked the family dynamic. Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams do feel like a couple that have been together for a long time and their relationship with their kids feels very genuine. The show stealer is young Heather O'Rourke who plays Carol Anne with such skill. It's an iconic child performance that really stuck with me during the film.All in all, Poltergeist is a great horror film. Its special effects don't hold up so well now but apart from that I had a fun time watching it.",Poltergeist
132,Aylmer,"traumatizing for kids, weak on scares for adults",5,8 May 2003,"Poltergeist unsuccessfully attempts to hide its true status as a Steven Spielberg film.  Even though Tobe Hooper injects some of his usual style into this film, the final product looks so patently Spielberg-esque that it's hard for me to even digest it as a horror film. That said, Poltergeist is typically juvenile as Spielberg films go, with a heavy degree of emphasis on a family coming together through a rough situation (much like E.T., Jaws, or Empire of the Sun) and a lot of the stuff as expressed through the point of view of a child (much like Jurassic Park or A.I. Artificial Intelligence).  I'd have to say that this came much to my dismay, as this film certainly works best children or adults who have somehow retained a childlike innocence all through their years. 
Spielberg's best two films were his first two `horror' films: Duel and Jaws. Most of his subsequent work is so excessively juvenile in execution that it's hard to understand how he maintains his status as perhaps the only celebrity director.  It's a pretty sure bet that he called the vast majority of the shots in Poltergeist, with Hooper placed mainly as a stooge to do the more technical stuff and to take all the blame if the movie tanked.  In a sense, this totally ruins what could have been a really good movie.There's certainly some good effects put to use and some genuinely frightening concepts such as the killer tree, living door, the imploding house, and giant mouth opening up in the wall, but overall they fail to really instill any real horror as they never really seem too menacing.  This is probably due to Spielberg's hesitance to show the world as anything less than totally `goody-goody', as best expressed by how he makes old people seem all ethereal and all knowing (compare the presentation Tangina to all the old folks on display in Spielberg's ultra-corny segment on Twilight Zone: the Movie).  Real horror could have been accomplished had anyone ever actually been harmed or killed over the course of the movie.  The best chance would have been with James Karen's character, who's clearly the villain and the most deserving of a horrible fate (at least as would be most foreseeable in a typical Spielberg flick  as Spielberg always has to take some `old white guy' and make him the only evil character).  The ending fails to even kill him off, even though he's just standing around pretty much just waiting to be killed.  It's so infuriating that I almost wanted to climb into the film and just slap the `poltergeist' in the face.  Not only does it fail to kill anyone, but it doesn't even seem to have the ability to injure people, making me wonder what the hell all those characters were scared of in the first place.Had Tobe Hooper really been in charge and in full Texas Chainsaw-mode, this could have been a lot more functional of a horror film, well at least something as effective as say, Funhouse.  A little bit of a sense of menace and a lot less of Spielberg's cutesy-poo vision of the world would have helped this movie in providing more than cheap, superficial scares, and might have been one of the scarier movies ever made.",Poltergeist
133,AvionPrince16,A little bit old now,6,27 October 2021,"The movie is, i think, pretty great for his time but now its feel a little bit outdated and we are not very impress by the special effects. They feel not very reel except the part where the poltergeist moved the furnitures: these scenes feel very reel and very well made. I enjoyed it. It didnt scared me really but i found there are some great scenes and some intriguing moment but the monsters feel not very believable in my opinion. They look pretty strange and i didnt feel any scare with their presence. The movie can still be quite entertaining but nothing more in 2021.",Poltergeist
134,Darth_Osmosis,A fantastic ghost story!,9,12 June 2018,"This movie has some of the creepiest and most disturbing scenes you can imagine, yet it retains the warm feeling of a family movie somehow! The story makes you feel and care about the characters, and the great practical effects keep you on the edge of your seat. When it comes to buildup and ""using your scares wisely"" this movie could be used as a textbook. Basically when something happens in this movie, you will remember it! See it, you will not regret it.. and you will definitely not forget it!",Poltergeist
135,jhaggardjr,Spectacular ghost story,10,9 August 2000,"""Poltergeist"" is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. It's definitely the best ghost story ever made. This movie still makes me jump today. Steven Spielberg co-wrote and co-produced this rollercoaster ride of a movie and it's directed by Tobe Hooper of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" fame (rumor has it that Spielberg actually directed some of this). ""Poltergeist"" is about a suburban family whose home is invaded by supernatural forces. It all begins when the youngest member of the household Carol Anne Freeling (wonderfully played by the late Heather O'Rourke) begins communicating with the ghosts through the television set. Then strange things start happening. Furniture moves around by themselves, silverware is found bent, etc. This is followed by a shocking occurence. Carol Anne mysteriously disappears, but her family knows that she's still alive because they can hear her voice through the TV set. Carol Anne's father Steven (Craig T. Nelson before TV's ""Coach"") and mother Diane (JoBeth Williams) call on some psychologists (including Oscar-winning ""Network"" actress Beatrice Straight) and a diminutive psychic (Zelda Rubenstein) to try to get her back. ""Poltergeist"" is one hell of a scary movie filled with outstanding special effects, a creepy music score by Jerry Goldsmith (who received one of his many Oscar nominations for scoring this film), and splendid acting from the cast. Plus it has a good sense of humor. And just when you think the movie is over, more terror follows. The recent ghost story ""The Sixth Sense"" may be a good movie, but ""Poltergeist"" is better. It's excellent in every way.**** (out of four)",Poltergeist
136,AKS-6,Entertaining,7,23 July 2000,"I probably haven't seen ""Poltergeist"" for more than ten years. It's not as good as I remember I thought it were, but then I was just a kid when I saw it last. However, even though the film is rarely -- maybe even *never* -- scary it is always entertaining and the script is original. Recommended. (6/10)",Poltergeist
137,bsinc,A PG rated horror movie,6,10 March 2003,"I was expecting ""Poltergeist"" to be some ""Exorcist""-ish movie, but besides having a similar plot there isn't much to compare. Instead we get a great first hour, filled with funny and entertaining moments and the other half of the movies which left me with a really bad after taste. It's not scary, it's not explained, and it looks like it was written in two minutes. Plus it features Zelda Rubinstein, a woman with the most irritating voice ever, and she just can't stop preaching and ruining every scene she's in. Did I mention she's a really bad actress. Well, the children aren't much better either, but the real gem of this movie was JoBeth Williams, who, besides being very attractive has a character who's really hip and cool and with Craig T. Nelson gives the best parts of this movie. Most of the effects are really spectacular(like the house being sucked into vacuum), but some are very sloppy and unbelievable(the tree scene, the guy's face when it falls off). A PG rated horror flick that for the first hour or so looks incredibly like the first hour of ""Jaws"" (Spielberg, coincidence) but is ruined by a truly unimaginative and unsatisfying ending.    6/10",Poltergeist
138,DavidSim240183,They're here!,10,31 July 2006,"It's been almost 25 years since Poltergeist hit cinema screens, and it's lost none of it's power. A deeply chilling and often disturbing horror film for the way it takes place in the normalcy of suburbia, pulls the rug out from under us, builds the scares and shock effects steadily and effectively until all hell literally breaks loose.Although credited as a Tobe Hooper film, it's quite clear Poltergeist is one of Spielberg's. It has his trademarks all over it. The vision of suburbia coming into contact with otherworldly beings, fantastic special effects, and at the heart of it, an all-American nuclear family. (It was even filmed on the same street as ET. Watch them back to back and you'll see). The Freelings live in Cuesta Verde, and have lived there for five years without incident. Until one night, they're youngest daughter, Carol-Anne, wakes up, goes downstairs, and is drawn to the TV set. At this late hour, the channels have been replaced by static. To us. But to Carol-Anne, it represents something else. Something that she is in tune with, but the family aren't. It's quite a creepy scene really, with Carol Anne's figure reflecting off the static. A very eerie beginning.The rest of the family, Steve Freeling (Craig T. Nelson), Diane (JoBeth Williams), Dana and Robbie are quite happy in their home, and are completely none the wiser to anything else. But the next night, Carol-Anne is again drawn to a TV set, and this time when she reaches out to it, something reaches back. An ectoplasmic vapour that drifts out the screen and makes its mark on the Freeling house.Strange events start occurring. Chairs stacked on top of each other. Furniture moving by itself. These scenes are quite effective because they portray the spirits haunting the Freeling house as playful and mischievous. But the film is setting us up for a fall. Because things suddenly turn nasty when the tree outside Robbie's window tries to eat him (this is not as silly as it sounds). But this is all a distraction. Because the spirits at work here have a bigger agenda. Carol-Anne. Her bedroom cupboard suddenly turns into a portal, and sucks her into another dimension.As the disturbances intensify, trapping the Freelings in this appalling situation, they bring in parapsychologists and a midget medium to contact Carol-Anne and bring her home.Poltergeist is one of the most effective horror films ever made, because of the way it gets under your skin, and resonates on many different levels. There is something almost psychological to the terrors at work here. The dark cupboard becomes a doorway to another dimension. The scary clown doll becomes a monster under the bed. The gnarled tree outside your window is an entity that's alive and hungry. All childhood fears that stay with you, and something that Spielberg utilises to great effect.Having the spirits kidnap they're daughter is ingenious, because it means the Freelings can't leave. And it means Spielberg and Hooper can draw more and more scares out of this scenario. If it had just been a simple haunting, the Freelings could have left and the film would be over too soon. It would have wound up working less effectively. The way Spielberg and Hooper prevent that from happening is inspired. The visual effects are really quite dazzling and hold up well. The scene where one of the scientists sees his face dissolve right before his eyes is shocking and lingers with you long after the film is over. Items flying about the kids bedroom is a scene that really takes one aback. The beautiful scene of the spirits manifesting in the living-room fills one with wonder and awe. And the ectoplasmic creature that guards the bedroom is brilliantly realised and very scary. It doesn't look like a special effect at all. It looks 100% real!Some of the film's best moments are not always because of the special effects. Some of the scarier scenes are achieved through simple atmospherics. Like when Diane gently opens the kids bedroom door, and an unearthly, beastly roar is the reward for her nosiness. Its a very unsettling and unnerving scene. It scares you without ever using a single visual effect. And its all accomplished by implication alone.Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams convey stellar performances, and give some of the best work of their careers so far. Beatrice Straight makes an impression as Dr Lesh. Her very presence makes you feel better. But Zelda Rubinstein is the stand-out as psychic Tangina Barrons. She is occasionally a little irritating but she always conveys a startling presence. We're never really quite sure what to make of her. Spielberg makes her motivations interestingly ambiguous.Something that pays dividends in the final scenes. It's a point where everything you know is wrong. And the fact that it's so unexpected makes the ending so satisfying. Hooper & Spielberg really pull out all the stops and deliver a grand finale that's a whopper of a shocker. I wouldn't dream of spoiling the ending for those who haven't seen Poltergeist, just that the Freelings get their daughter back, but it comes at a high price. Its an ending that elevates Poltergeist from a well above average scare show to a timeless horror classic.Some of the explanations as to what's going on are unsatisfying and don't quite fill in the blanks as we hope, but the film is so genuinely creepy and entertaining that by the end, you feel just as drained as the Freelings.The greatest horror film of the 80s, and scary enough to make even the most hardened individual sleep with the light on.",Poltergeist

It is supposed to be one of the horror classics.Now, I like Poltergeist. I have seen it at least a couple of times, but I have to say, I'm not totally convinced. I don't find it scary. I find that the pacing is a little off, also the cool/not cool balance of the spooky haunted-stuff that happens, is a little on the not-that-cool side.When it comes to ghost horror, I think the actual ""haunty"" things that happen makes or breaks the movie. In this they didn't quite make it for me.By all means, it is rather effective and absolutely entertaining, but I don't think it is as great as a lot of people are saying. Maybe my expectations were too high when I saw it the first time, and maybe I'll see it again and like it better, if so, I will delete this review and write another. But this is my current thoughts on it.I do like the sequels rather well, and I actually like the third one the best. (I'll probably get some down-votes for that!)",Poltergeist

143,buckikris,You SOB! You Moved The Head Stones; But Not The Bodies.,10,28 April 2020,"Welcome to Cuesta Verda, a middle class neighborhood where The Freelings live. Steve Freeling( Craig T. Nelson), a successful real estate developer, his wife Diane( Jo Beth Williams), a house wife live with their three children. One night Carol Ann( Heather O'Rourke) begins communicating with the T.V. late at night. At first, no one thinks anything of it. Carol Ann shares a bedroom with her brother Robbie( Oliver Robbins). The house has this dead tree that by the window of the kids room. It is creepy and it is dead. Diana( Dominique Dunn) is the oldest is a teenager. Robbie is a little older than Carol Ann, hates that tree and is terrified of his stuffed clown.In the morning strange things begin to happen when Stephen is at work. Robbie notices his spoon bending and while doing dishes Diana sees the chairs have stacked themselves on the table. When Steve come home, Diana tells him what happened to Carol Ann while he was at work. Carol Ann slides across the kitchen floor. It is so bizarre and the whole family sees this. At night a big storm comes through the area. It's a tornado which is uncommon in California, wrecking havoc to their home. Robbie is torn from his bed by the tree; and Carol Ann disappears. They look around for her and hears her voice coming from the T.V.. The only way they can communicate with her is VIA T.V.. The whole family is upset and Steve takes time off from work.The first thing he does is go to see some paranormal researchers at a university. Dr. Lesh( Beatrice Straight), Marty( Martin Casella), and Ryan ( Richard Lawson). They discuss what is happened and Dr. Lesh describes that it could be a poltergeist. They agree to come to his home to investigate. What they uncover is very bizarre. Some of it benign and some are malevolent forces, that scare the s**t out of Marty and Dr. Lesh. Dr. Lesh tells the Freelings after what they saw they think they need the help of Tangina( Zelda Rubinstein), an exorcist. Dr. Lesh and Ryan will return, Marty will not return due to his experience. Tangina is the best exorcist and has a history of cleaning houses of demonic forces. When she arrives at the Freeling's home, she will do an exorcism that will help get Carol Ann back. It isn't easy but they do get their daughter back. After this ordeal they believe it is best to sell the home ASAP.
Steve tells everyone to get packed up because they are leaving in the morning. In the meantime, he tells his wife he is going to tell Teague( James Karen) his plan.Steve meets with Teague and tells him his plan. He also gives him some BS story about not feeling well. He has missed so much work, but Teague tries to get him to change his mind about leaving. Teague shows him a new phase they are building in Cuesta Verda, Phase 5. The best part Teague will let him have the first pick, by moving from phase 1 to 5. The project is in the works, but the problem is the view shows a very crowed graveyard.That night when everything is packed and ready, strange stuff begins to happen again. This time more violent than before. Robbie is attacked by his clown, Diane is tossed to the ceiling while drying her hair, and Carol Ann is almost taken again when a massive opening opens up in the bedroom. Diane is running for her life when she breaks free. This time she is in the backyard and slips into the hole made for the pool. The caskets begin to shoot up and bodies are everywhere. They come underneath the house, and it seems like their is no escape. When Steve comes home he sees his boss staring at their house, and Steve confronts him. They moved the headstone, but left the graves. It isn't long after that that Dana comes back from her date, and sees the house destroyed. The Freeling's leave with only the clothes on their backs, finding refuge in a Holiday Inn. This time the T.V. goes out the door-good ending BTW.This movie is a classic, and still has that chill factor to it. It is one of my favorite horror films w/o the blood and gore. The late Heather O'Rourke was awesome in this film. She and the Late Dominique Dunne were take too soon. I hope her ex-boyfriend got the book thrown at him for killing her. As for the curse of Poltergeist, it's creepy. A lot of strange stuff happened with the original/sequel. I don't think it could ever be explained. Poltergeist is one of those movies I highly recommend. A classic that will make the hairs on your neck stand at attention.",Poltergeist
144,DeBBss,They're Here!,7,31 May 2020,"Poltergeist is one of the greatest horrors of all time, being written by Steven Spielberg and directed by Tobe Hooper. Poltergeist is such an impactful horror, as it plays a huge part in pop culture. Poltergeist created so many horror cliches too, because of how great it is as a horror movie.The plot is the classic haunting story. It's difficult to make a memorable haunting film, as it's been done too many times to count. After so many decades since Poltergeist was first released, it's still not forgotten. Since Steven Spielberg helped write Poltergeist, there's not a lot to complain about. The pacing is great; it never gets boring and the movie gets straight to the point. The screenplay is incredibly clever, and because of that, Poltergeist was truly unique for its time. Poltergeist is also surprisingly funny. Comedy in horrors always feel forced in, but in Poltergeist, it's lightly added in. I also love how the comedy isn't introduced in through dialogue, but the objects that the ghosts haunt.The visuals are also really great. The practical effects were realistic and smartly added in, not showing all of the effects in daylight; to help mask the practical effects. The tree attacking the little boy is one example of adding in practical effects smartly into a movie. There was one scene where the practical effects looked really bad, and that's the scene with the guy's face being pulled apart. It was in 1982, so I can't really hate on it too much.The sound mixing and sound design was amazing too. I loved the little laughs added to the objects when they were possessed, it was funny and creepy at the same time. The whispers added in when Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) would speak to the spirits were great. The whispers were so good that many movies copied that technique to add a little more scare value.Poltergeist is an excellent horror that masterfully blends everything great in horror movies into one film. It's funny and creepy, the screenplay is very clever, and the practical effects were well done and smartly added in. Poltergeist is definitely in the top 10 horror films of all time. I just hope there's no more remakes of this awesome movie.",Poltergeist
145,jayjaycee,They're here ... and they know what scares you...,9,12 January 2020,"""Poltergeist"" is a 1982 horror thriller directed by Tobe Hooper starring JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson. There's without a doubt no movie in the history of cinema more mysteries revolve around. Not only is it to this day questionable that Tobe Hooper actually directed this flick and wasn't used by Spielberg as both an alibi to avoid damage to his career as a (mostly) family friendly director and to have a bait for the horror film audience to go to the cinema (as the director of the hit ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""), it's also said to be literally haunted. In both cases, I can't really tell what to believe in. As someone who believes in the supernatural, the existence of both good and evil forces, it's horrifying. This curse is reportedly caused by usage of real corpses in the infamous pool scene. Scarily, this imagination isn't even far-fetched. Next to the tragic early demises of two of the younger actresses, several accidents and disasters happened on the set that the people involved can't explain to themselves e.g the deletion of footage and the sudden falling of set lamps. The fact that the line between reality and fiction is overlapping adds a certain kind of threat to the film.
If it wasn't for that, the film would be a lot less creepy, still unnerving, but not that threatening. From the first time the American national anthem is played in the beginning this specific feeling of unrest starts to set in. If I can tell one thing, it stayed throughout the entire course of the film. Next to the lifetime performance of the sweet Heather O'Rourke as Carol Anne both Williams and Nelson give their best. In all this horrifying atmosphere there's still this uncanny Spielberg-esque character constellation that makes the family so sympathic. Or is it just the vast amount of Star Wars merch that jumps in one's eye literally every single scene? I guess both. Anyways, the atmosphere is mostly created by the deliberately subliminal dialogues and ingenious sound score. There's this extreme level of suspense, because it's not overall graphic horror as you'd expect it from some film such as ""The Evil Dead"", most of it takes place in the viewer's own head (like in ""Jaws""!) and this is where the greatest horror is created. Just that the paranormal activity is referred to as ""it"" is unnervingly bone chilling. Several scenes sent shivers down my spine and gave me goosebumps. If there's anything to seriously criticise about the film, it's the instances when it draws on practical effects. While the visual effects are (mostly!) acceptable, the make up etc. are massively antiquated and even for the then standards obviously fake and pretty mediocre, thus at times making it look unintentionally hilarious. But that's just a small flaw. Ingenious writing and shocking twists make up for that. All in all, this classic flick is a suspenseful and terrorising example of a unsettling horror experience, it has the well balanced amount of great writing and genuine acting and this specific touch of spook, mostly created by the real life curse that haunts this film, that make this film undeniably horrifying and angst-inducing. It's not graphic, but powerful and definitely will keep you up for a few days. Or weeks. Or months. Regardless, it's a gem I consider as one of my favourites of the genre.

147,jmbwithcats,The Best Horror Film Ever Made,10,12 November 2012,"One of few I have rated a perfect 10 on IMDb, the others being Rosemary's Baby and a couple others out of 3000 or so titles I've rated. I saw Poltergeist in theaters in 1982, and watching it any time since then it's just as good... emotionally, maybe more so, knowing the tragic end of Heather O'Rourke... she was so adorable in this movie. My friend Mike really sums it best when he said, ""The television has an interesting role in that movie. Perhaps the first time that a TV was utilized almost as a main character/antagonist. There are other more subtle subversive themes going on as well, picturing suburbia and the American Dream as an encroachment upon sacred elements."" Poltergeist has some of the most heartfelt, honest, heartbreaking, wonderful dialog, you just don't get such honest and stirring dialog like that anymore. The music is haunting and beautiful, directing is amazing and immersive, the horror is palpable, but never over used, the other side never shown too much to destroy the mystery, tension or fear... incredible pacing, with one of the best comedic levity-filled endings that just works out of any horror ever made.

148,disinterested_spectator,"Comparisons to ""Jaws""",5,16 February 2015,"In producing the movie ""Poltergeist,"" Steven Spielberg employed the structure that worked for him in ""Jaws."" In the latter movie, there is an Everyman, Sheriff Brody (Roy Scheider), and his family, corresponding to Diane Freeling and her family in the former. The shark is a monstrous creature terrorizing Amity Island just as the demons terrorize the Freeling household. In ""Jaws,"" we have the mayor who lets the expected revenue from tourism jeopardize the safety of those who plan to swim in the ocean, while in ""Poltergeist,"" Steve Freeling's boss jeopardizes the safety of the Freeling house and the entire neighborhood in an effort to save money by not moving the bodies of a cemetery before building houses on top of them.Once the shark proves to be too menacing to ignore, a scientist, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), is called in from the Oceanographic Institute, just as three parapsychologists are called in to investigate the weird happenings in the Freeling house (one gets the feeling they inspired the movie ""Ghostbusters"" (1984)). But science alone cannot do the job. Therefore, someone with personal, practical experience is needed. In ""Jaws,"" this takes the form of Quint (Robert Shaw), an old salt who has been a sailor all his life and has dealt with sharks many times. In ""Poltergeist,"" we have Tangina, a woman with psychic powers, who knows how the other world operates.Ultimately, however, it is Everyman Brody who kills the shark, when science and practical experience fail, just as Diane must save her children herself after the parapsychologist and the psychic have failed to completely do the job.Unfortunately, the final attack by the demons after everyone thinks it is safe is a little too much. It would be like having the shark make one more attack after Brody thought he had finally killed it.",Poltergeist

Everything seems perfect. Except for the fact that their youngest daughter keeps talking to the television in the middle of the night. This is one of the better horror films of the 80s, and one of the best in the ""haunted house"" genre. I watched this movie countless times as a kid, and was always horrified by several scenes (almost everything that happens to poor Robbie). Watching it as an adult, I was bummed to see that these scenes were more amusing than scary, and that some of the effects have become dated. But the movie is otherwise visually stunning, the atmosphere is chilling, and the performances are top-notch.***bit of spoilers***One thing that always got me is that the viewer is lulled into the false security that the horror is over after the ""rebirth"" sequence (ick!). That could very well have been the climax. Nope, these ghosts are PO'ed. Each actor has her or his own little moment of ""horror movie"" brilliance at this point in the movie: JoBeth Williams' transition from sheer desperation and terror (""Stay away from my baybays!"") to a woman who ain't gonna take no crap from a ghost as she bounds down the growing hallway, Craig T. Nelson losing it at his boss while his house is swallowing up his family, Dominique Dunne with her blood-curdling ""What's Happening?!"", and finally Heather O'Rourke, frowning in her bed as her closet door starts opening, uttering a helpless and tired ""not again.""***end spoilers***There are some pretty powerful themes here that I didn't catch as a kid, the main one being a couple coming together and refusing to allow their family to be consumed (literally!) by their material possessions (the TV, their toys, and ultimately their new perfect house).

Directed by Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and produced by a young Steven Spielberg (fresh from E.T), Poltergeist starts out promisingly, but gets more ridiculous with its fair share of scares. One cannot be helped but feel that the movie is merely a showcase of 1980s visual effects.Though Poltergeist is consistent with its scares and thrills, it's neither shocking or disturbing. So it is kind of scary to see it dominate the box office when it was released. The cast were screaming so much throughout the entire second-half of the movie that they were probably taking the chance to vent their anger at the filmmakers weak effort. And some of the cast actually went bonkers too, signing up to do the sequel, which was just about as useless as a submarine in Sahara.Poltergeist is a horror movie that could have been better. And I stress, could have been better if the filmmakers were more focused in their task. It pales in comparison to standard bearers such as The Shining, Halloween, and The Exorcist. In a nutshell, Poltergeist is a movie that deserves to be forgotten.SCORE: 6/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",Poltergeist
151,I_Am_The_Taylrus,"A Very Good Horror Film, But It Is Flawed (SPOILERS)",8,5 July 2007,"SPOILERSI have finally seen Poltergeist. I can not believe I have not seen it ready. I mean, it is supposed to be one of the greatest horror films ever, right? Well, this is a great film. It is spooky, the special effects are quite good for the 80's, and JoBeth Williams' acting is great. The rest of the acting is a bit over-the-top, especially Zelda Rubenstein. That voice shall haunt me for the rest of my life. This film is flawed, of course. Some scenes are more funny than scary, like I said, some of the acting is weird, and some scenes are just boring. With all that being said, here is the summary.The Freelings are your normal suburban family. There is the mother, Diane, the father, Steve, the oldest child, Dana, the second oldest, Robbie, and the youngest, Carol Anne. Then, strange things start to happen in their house. Carol Anne starts to hear voices in the television, calling them the TV people, who are actually ghosts, chairs start to move around, and forks bend. Then, Carol Anne goes missing. The family then hears Carol Anne through the television. It turns out that the ghosts took Carol Anne to their dimension. The family hires three parapsychologists to the house, who are shocked of what they see. It turns out that the ghosts in the house are a poltergeist, not a regular haunting. They find out that the ghosts have not gone into the light yet, so they took Carol Anne because she gives off the most light force. Not only is there ghosts, there is also the Beast, a mean spirit that uses Carol Anne as a distraction from the other ghosts. They hire a medium, Zelda Rubienstein. She discovers that the entrance to their dimension is in Carol Anne's closet. Diane saves Carol Anne, and all the ghosts go away, except for the Beast. The Beast wants Carol Anne back, so he attacks the family. The family escapes, but they found that the whole problem started because the neighborhood was built on top of a cemetery.Overall, this is a flawed horror film, but it is also one of the best and the most frightening. I mean, come on, who is not afraid of the scene in which the clown attacks Robbie? Clowns are frightening either way. Still, probably the most mysterious part of this whole movie is the aftermath of Poltergeist. I think you know what I mean. Anyway, some scenes are cheesy, some are scary, but either way, this is truly a great horror film.8/10Recommended Films: The Amityville Horror.",Poltergeist

I just think I'd of found it more visceral without seeing the remake first. Besides that, this film delivers a real punch in its depiction of a family's fight against forces they cannot comprehend or manipulate. It's like a thoroughly delightful nightmare, one that you know that you can always wake up from, and one in which, in the end, no one has permanently been damaged.

Relying on the cast and practical effects to drive this ridiculous story, ""Poltergeist"" becomes far more impressive than it should be. I loved Poltergeist almost to the point that it has become one of my favourite horror films, however, I am not too much of a fan of how off-the-rails it goes towards the end of the film. I liked leaving everything to my imagination. I jumped, felt the pain, and I was scared for the parents in this film. Every good element that a horror film should have is present here.

157,hasosch,Signs without expedients,10,26 September 2009,"When I knot together my handkerchief in order to make a sign out of it, I am the expedient of this sign because like any other signs it serves for the purpose of communication and thus presupposes besides an expedient at least a channel and a percipient. However, there is a special class of signs which obviously have no expedients, e.g., the icy flower-patterns that appear in cold mornings on glass-windows, a sudden pain in my body which I did at least not purposely send to myself, the thunder which is caused by a physical law. These and many other examples have occupied the fantasy since the early time of mankind, assuming that there actually are expedients, but hidden ones. So, the sky, the areas underneath the earth and on the mountains, in the forests, inn ravines, etc. have been populated by ghosts, demons, fairies, witches, reckoning that these expedients are supernatural. Therefore, it is not so much the physical part of these well-known, but still unexplained phenomena like the nightly cracking in the walls, step-noises in the attic, murmuring in the cellar, etc. which attracted the interest, but the possibility that these noises are caused by intelligent creatures which communicate in this way, i.e. as semiotic and not primarily physical phenomena.""Poltergeist"" (1982) is possibly the most famous horror film which has exactly these ""natural signs"" to its thematics. It is interesting that the Polstergeister survived Illuminism and Rationalism like so many of their relatives, although they have been forced in the world of fairy-tales, legends, myths, horror-films etc. which serve as their asylums. Psychologically, they represent an early stage of the human spirit which is not too far away from animism. Whenever someone cannot explain a recurring phenomenon, the recurrence implying systematic events, there rises a vacuum, and it is this vacuum which prevents these early projections of our mind from dying out. Hooper (Spielberg?) has used the full power of the technical possibilities in this movie, made at the beginning of the eighties. Like the ghosts that are portrayed, it is an evergreen.",Poltergeist

159,AndreiPavlov,"My first ""vision""",10,12 May 2008,"I watched this one in 1989. It was my first ""video"" watched in a ""videozal"". Quite luckily it turned out to be one of the greatest movies, which I appreciate even more as the time passes.It has fantastic scenes - they can be called ""groundbreaking classics"". Among them are: the crawling meat in the kitchen, the attacking tree that grabs a child and tries to swallow him alive, the menacing TV-set which opens doors to another dimension (to hell maybe?), the dilapidating face of the scientist who takes a look in the mirror, the ominous clown that assaults the boy, the dead bodies floating in the mud and grabbing the woman, the ghost walking down the stares, etc.It has light-hearted humour that for a few seconds lets the viewer forget that it is a serious horror film. One of the best such scene is the beginning, when the man on the bicycle is being fooled by a band of boys with a remote-controlled toy.Finally it has food for thought. I know examples when in our modern heretic world the multi-storied buildings are being erected right near the cemeteries, the careless adults are buying dangerous toys to their beloved children (what is the new trend - ""Bratz"" or something?), the easy-going mothers and fathers are going to mediums for help instead of putting the ways straight and in the right direction, and the list can go on.Nowadays I look at this movie as at a colourful snapshot of our hectic world. It is often treated as the old-school special effects fest only. My point is that it's a mistake to come up to this film with such an easy attitude. It's definitely not another ""Gremlins"" or ""Star Wars"" (no offence implied here but ""Star Wars"" to me is just a cute balloon of a movie).A brutal 10 out of 10 - a rare mark for a horror flick.

That being said, the movie tries its best, there is well-timed comic relief here and there. The actors do their best with what they have and the little girl has some good lines.

161,ryan-10075,Excellent Ghost Story from Hooper and Spielberg,9,11 November 2020,"It has been put into question exactly who directed POLTERGEIST. Was it Tobe Hooper or did Steven Spielberg in fact over step his duties and direct this film? Since ET was yet to be released he was not allowed to direct any other picture in the mean time. Personally I would say both Hooper and Spielberg directed this film as at times it definitely has a very Spielberg-like feel to the film. Hooper was learning how to use effects in film from Spielberg (who did the story, co-wrote and produced) as well as Spielberg himself went out and got Hooper who had scared audiences earlier with great flicks like THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and SALEM'S LOT.The Freeling are nicely nestled in their fairly new home while dad Steve (Craig T. Nelson) is out selling homes in the neighbourhood. Problem is things aren't exactly what they seem. Their youngest, cute and also at the same time creepy Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) seems to be completely drawn to the TV after it has finished its programming for the day. Only to find that the house is haunted bysome real supernatural powers.I love the film, because it does not use the customary ways to tell the story and is plopped right in the middle of America. The acting as well is top notch, Nelson is great as the father, but personally I think JoBeth Williams as the mother Diane hits one out of the ballpark with her performance. The music by Jerry Goldsmith is excellent and also was nominated for an Oscar. The visual effects were nominated as well and while some by today's standards are no longer near the top bench in effects (like the dude ripping his face off) some are still quite effective almost 40 years later. I do look at some of the effects as a stepping stone towards what they did in GHOSTBUTSERS a couple years later.Also starring Beatrice Straight as Dr. Lesh who comes to investigate the home after the Freelings believe it is haunted, the perfectly cast Zelda Rubinstein as the medium Tangina and James Karen as Steve's boss Mr. Teague.On a final note this film is said to be cursed which lead to the deaths of Dominique Dunne who played the eldest child Dana and Heather O'Rourke. It all may add to the fact you are watching a horror movie, but there is quite a bit of info out there if you wish to look into that.In the end if you are into ghost stories to me this one is a must watch.

The music is blurting out during all the scary or spooky or action scenes, and this feels more like a kiddy adventure like 'The Goonies' than a tale of a house haunting.I'm not sure what people are seeing in this movie to rate it so highly, I could rattle off a list of 10 or more horror movies that dwarf this movie; a selection older and newer. There isn't really any good cinematography here, but there are some interesting shots like the hallway that keeps growing longer; then after 6 seconds it's over and we're back to comical colours, stains, blobs, shapes, and tentacles.There wasn't anything in this at all that made me scared, and watching the characters talk to the TV set was hilarious as with several other scenes with the actors flopping around the sets.4/10 completely missable, the music choice drops the rating lower than a 5.",Poltergeist
164,HelloTexas11,a trendsetting spookfest,9,13 February 2008,"'Poltergeist' was released virtually simultaneously with 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' in the summer of 1982 and there has never been any doubt in my mind which Spielberg production is superior. To me, 'E.T.' is a nice little fairy tale with some cute moments, a two and one-half star film. But 'Poltergeist' is perhaps THE great modern horror flick, a trendsetting movie and one of those which pays homage to to its predecessors while raising the bar for all that follow. I won't get into the who-really-directed 'Poltergeist' argument, Tobe Hooper or Steven Spielberg, other than to say it has Spielberg written all over it. This time, that's a good thing, as the material plays to his strengths and minimizes his weaknesses. He loves telling stories that revolve around a family, which 'Poltergeist' certainly does, and his childhood love of horror flicks stands him in good stead to deliver the scares several times during the warm-hearted yet spooky adventure. Casting of the actors was certainly a key factor in the film's success. Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams were hardly household names at the time, but the two of them have never been better, as Steven and Diane Freeling. Dominique Dunne, Oliver Robins, and especially Heather O'Rourke each provide exceptional performances as their kids in the film. O'Rourke is a natural child star, adorable beyond words but just as importantly, absolutely believable. There are several ways 'Poltergeist' could have gone terribly wrong. Spielberg manages to rein in his cutesy side just enough; it's still there, but in tolerable doses. It must have been tempting to simply make the ghosts mischievous and funny. Fortunately, one of them isn't, and there is a very real aura of menace and fright as well as concern for what might happen to Carol Anne (O'Rourke). Likewise, the spiritual medium brought in at the end, Tangina Barrons (Zelda Rubinstein) has her share of funny lines but thankfully isn't played just for laughs. Even though it's a horror movie, 'Poltergeist' is one of those films you wish you were in. The Freelings are such a likable family that you think, ""I wish that was my family."" Sequels followed (the second 'Poltergeist' is a very decent and scary film) but inevitably they ran out of steam and ideas. The first one however is the real thing and has taken its place among the great horror movies.",Poltergeist

The characters are fantasic and the effects for the most part still hold up today.The tention building in this movie is fantastic and it manages to keep you interested through out the run time with its fantastic story and iconic moments like when the main character Carol Anne says ""There Here"" it's a chilling moment that is an iconic scene In horror.Carol Anne is a great character and her performance is incredible as are the rest of the cast in this movie.
The effects for most part still hold up with the use of practical effects it's amazing I especially like the design of The Beast at the end of the movie he still looks fantastic to this day and its such an odd creepy design that works for the movie.My only real issue with the movie is it can be little slow at times but it does manage to keep you interested with its story and characters.
Also some of the effects are dated the one that stands out the most is the guy ripping his skin of it looks a little dated now still a great scene but just looks a little dated compared to the other effects in the movie.There some great creepy scenes In this movie the clown scene for example still creeps me out to this day and the tree scene is creepy as hell.
Great story and awesome characters make this a Horror Classic that has always been a favourite of mine.The ending is awesome aswell I really like the family escaping and it not really been solved completely weather or not the Poltergeist is over.
And the last scene when the dad puts the TV outside is hilarious and really subtle Its great.Verdict 9/10 just a classic horror movie that as always been a favourite of mine great Characters and some iconic moments and still moments that creep me out to this day its an absolute classic.
Great effects for the most part and the design of the beast is incredible in my opinion.

Then the youngest kid Carol Anne begins to talk to their television when it is static. The house is actually haunted by poltergeists, a type of spirit that could move things or people physically.It is not a typical haunted house story with quiet ghosts and possessions.

So much more than a ghost story - in the middle of its whirlpool of shocks and scares, is one of the best entertainment movies of all time, regardless if the supernatural is one's everyday cup of tea. Well-known fact by now is that this is by far Steven Spielberg's work, despite the director credit going to Tobe Hooper, and this can clearly be seen in its look and feel: The colorful production, frantic pace and an absolutely gobsmacking fireworks of special effects (remember, this is early '80s we're talking here!) adorn and enhance its story that creates that uniquely magical mini-universe all of its own, with countless classic scenes to make one's spine shiver: the TV-dimension, the attacking tree, the rip-apart face, the hiding clown, the moving chairs... aah! Jerry Goldsmith's ominous score certainly sets the mood for things to come.Astonishingly well-written, it has the biggest of hearts, as no characters feel left out: The Freeling family is SO likable and believable (not to mention superbly acted) in their loving relationship ties- without the cheeziness - amidst the horror- & fantasy elements that surround them. I still can't watch Jobeth Williams in the ""She went through my SOUL!""- scene and keep my eyes from watering up! The paranormal investigator team is also depicted with warmth - Beatrice Straights's endearing team leader has a wonderful, moving speech about the spiritual world. And who can forget Zelda Rubenstein's legendary exterminator with the strangest of cleansing methods?! One of the best assets is also the laugh-out-loud humor (both slapstick and in dialog) galore, that allows the audience pauses to breathe between the stirring eruptions of supernatural chaos.Even after 27 years, it's one of those movies that I can watch repeatedly and not find a single weakness... and I refuse to even refer to or compare its sequels in the same league!10 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",Poltergeist

172,FKDZ,Paranormal Adventure,7,24 September 2021,"If i'd had to describe this movie it would be a sort of paranormal adventure drama. I'd leave out the horror. Especially this day and age.I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, though looking at the tags (horror, thriller) I expected a much more ''adult'' film than what it actually is. It reminds me of so many 80s family movies. There's odd characters, there's comedy, melodic music. It's got a bunch of ''fun''. In general it's a movie that really doesn't take the scariness of paranormal beings heavily. Especially the wife, I love how curious she was. And the kind of role reversal, where the husband was flustered and not the wife.I have to say, the main characters and most importantly their writing was superb. They made smart decisions, were rational, and didn't make stupid choices that we see in most horror movies. They were likable, and felt human. It's a key reason this movie works well.The paranormal stuff at first I liked, then there's more and more CGI which simply has not aged well at all. There are still some fantastic scenes though throughout the movie that are not CGI.What really finished this movie off perfectly was the entire ending sequence that just throws you for a ride. Some fantastic scenes there.How the paranormal stuff all works... it's vague and personally I didn't like how they solved their problem, it felt a bit too simple.Aside from that the movie does have some slow parts and takes its time, and some scenes felt unnecessary. Also the teenage daughter should've been left out entirely, because it was very odd suddenly seeing her pop up at the end when she was mostly ignored. She simply didn't have a role to fulfill.All in all a solid fun movie. I could see this being a amazing movie to have seen back in the day as a teen or a little younger.",Poltergeist

This movie signified the end of Spielberg's filmmaking magic. It was the beginning of his making brainless, soulless fare like this and ""E.T."" It was at this point that he became more a manufacturer of ""entertainment"" than a creative director of it.""E.T.,"" also in 1982, is essentially a dumbed-down version of ""Close Encounters"" for children or for those who want all the edges polished away. No need for characters you could believe exist in the actual world. Instead they're replaced by mannequins who have little to no dimension.The 1980's was all about that, following the Reagan call to give up on humanity, give up on dreams, and just crank out lifeless stuff and make the most money possible.And so, ""Poltergeist"" is one of the most perfect examples of this. It is sort of entertaining in its thoroughly stupid way, but that's about it. Tobe Hooper, who had directed ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" went on to direct something much closer to his fairly perverted sensibilities with the great, and thoroughly nuts, ""Lifeforce"" in 1986. Here, he's more gun for hire, technically being the director, while it is said that Spielberg was on the set more than Hooper, and shot most of the movie. You can tell!If this movie accomplishes anything, it is an accomplishment for the Visual Effects and Practical Effects teams. Creating an atmosphere of horror is out of reach to a vast majority of those who worked on this.The one person in the cast who hits the mark is Heather O'Rourke, who out acts everyone else by a good margin. Jerry Goldsmith, as expected, turns in an excellent score, and contributes what is easily the most artistic component to the film.**** (4 Out of 10 Stars)",Poltergeist

I remember so many of the scenes being just terrifying--the tree, the eerie slime, the closet portal, etc.Today I watched this movie for the first time since I was a kid, and I was stunned by how different it is as an adult. I had remembered this movie being a Stephen King book turned film, as so many of King's works received such treatment in the 1980's. To my surprise, this film is actually a Steven Spielberg movie--he wrote the screenplay and produced it, while handing the directing role off to the guy who did Texas Chainsaw Massacre. As such, Spielberg's influence is evident throughout the film. As an adult, it's now impossible for me to see ""Poltergeist"" without thinking of ""E.T."" or ""The Goonies"", as the characterization and the style of the film is very similar.Ultimately, it's this same style that makes the movie not all that dramatically scary. It's certainly eerie at certain points, but there's nothing here that makes me look over my shoulder on my way off to bed. Indeed, it's as much fantasy driven as it is horror inclined.All that said, I'm giving the movie 7/10 stars.

178,hoernkeem,"Poltergeist review (1982, Tobe Hooper) Good nostaligic, classic horror, but is dated and lacking somewhat",6,25 March 2021,"Poltergeist (1982, Tobe Hooper)
This is a supernatural horror film from 1982 directed by Tobe Hooper of 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' fame and produced by Steven Spielberg. The story revolves around a normal suburban family whose life gets thrown into turmoil when they are targeted by seemingly malevolent spirits. Spielberg envisioned this originally as a companion piece to 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', however, I think it is more of companion to another famous Spielberg film, 'E.T.' In one you have a kind alien who is friend to the family and in 'Poltergeist' it is an angry spirit that targets the family. Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams star in this film that was a commercial and critical success nabbing three Academy Award nominations and since has been lauded as one of the best horror films ever made.
Nelson is a successful real estate developer in a planned community where he and his family occupy one of the original houses. The film starts slow with the youngest of the three children Carol Anne seemingly talking to people in the TV on the snow screen that appears on channels with no signal or after the station has signed off for the evening. The action ramps up as things begin to move in the house of their own accord, and things get deadly serious when Carol Anne is actually abducted into some other realm although her spirit seems to still remain connected to the house. That is when the Freelings bring in outside paranormal experts to aid them. They in turn bring in a spiritual medium to help them find and return their daughter.
I thought this was a decent film if a bit dated and excelled more in its quiet moments of impending horror rather than anything special effects based which seem rudimentary now. The little girl's back and forth with an entity only she can hear carries more weight than a room with objects flying around which comes across almost comical rather than scary. There are also narrative decisions that just seem to make little sense like how the medium clears the house but the spirits are still there, or some of the family's decision making near the end that defy logic. The film does throw you for a loop with a false climax, but then doubles back for an even more intense finish which I would have enjoyed had the execution been a bit better.
The movie has a few moments of fright and one scene that is downright intense for a movie that was awarded a PG rating which required an appeal at the time to secure. Despite those moments overall the film feels dated and not intensely scary. In fact the scenes with a medium can be downright hilarious if you don't buy into the ghost premise of the movie, and out of context can sound like some serious mumbo jumbo. While some may have nostalgia for it, 'Poltergeist' is not a film that holds up tremendously well after 40 years.

The acting was really good and Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams did great jobs as the parents. Now there is a poltergeist going after O'Rourke's character and you never get to really see him so it is creepy. There are many really crazy scenes as well that will leave you terrified.

181,DeuceWild_77,A cult-classic ghost tale who was 'ghost directed' by Hooper,9,6 November 2017,"Even with all the rumors about the Poltergeist movies' curse that victimized some thespians from the cast, one of the greatest unsolved mysteries about it, is how much it had Tober Hooper's contribution in the making of it or he was just a director-for-hire (in this particular case more of a 'ghost director') and the movie was, in fact, solo directed by Steven Spielberg.Well, some of the cast and crew alleged that Hooper ""was just there"", the others said that, in fact, he directed it under strictly supervision by Spielberg who was always on the set. Which of the sides are right, probably we'll never know, but one thing is true for sure, the movie looks and feels more like a Spielberg directed movie than having Hooper's creativity touch in it.From the emotional tone to the uneven, relatively slow pace; the engaging, but a bit corny storytelling; the evolving camera-work; the skilled staging of the sequences (totally 'Spielberg-ish'); the dark humour inserted; the naivety on the children's point of view; the over-exaggerated allusion to ""Star Wars""; lead character first name, Steven or the over-the-top / campy horror sequences, ""Poltergeist"" sweats Spielberg from every skin pore. It's Spielberg's baby, only got the ""directed by"" credit from someone else (Hooper was chosen due to his work on ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre""), because he was contractual obligated to helm ""E.T."" for Universal. The only contribution from Hooper may have been on those thrilling horror sequences involving the skeletons, the rescue of Carol Anne or the escape from the house, but even that, i have my serious doubts, because Spielberg have done something similar a year before when Indy and Marion were trying to get out from the Well of Souls.As a movie which relies too much on its storytelling and the visual side of it (the mastering of suspense, the jump scares, the special effects that may look cheesy for today's standards, but were frightening back in the day...), most of the cast were recruited as 'jobbers', but JoBeth Williams (even if she looked way too young for her role as the desperate Mom) and Craig T. Nelson did OK in their roles. Zelda Rubinstein and the Academy Award Winner, Beatrice Straight offered strong support, even if the real stand-out was one of the cutest child actors that ever appeared on-screen, the then 6 years old Heather O'Rourke, who was absolute brilliant, captivating and haunting as Carol Anne. Ill-fated Dominique Dunne (the younger sister of actor Griffin Dunne), who unfortunately didn't live to attend the premiere, wasn't much of an actress and her scenes were cut short (on purpose or not...).In short, ""Poltergeist"" is for an old-fashioned ghost story, what the future ""The Goonies"" is for a pre-puberty daring adventure, both penned by a director who based it on his own dreams (& experiences) from when he was a young boy, full of imagination & creativity, and avid to become a filmmaker.

183,kclipper,haunted house thrills combined with Spielberg fantasy charm,9,5 October 2014,"The 1980's was such a significant time for what set the stage for the horror genre.

It seems that poltergeist activity is directly linked to the essence of their little daughter, Carol Anne and the presence will stop at nothing to capture her spirit and in the meantime wreck havoc on the family's happy home life. Introducing 4'3"" character actress, Zelda Rubinstein as the psychic medium, Tangina in a role that defines quirkiness. This is the film that earmarked the combination of classic haunted house thriller with the fantasy/family fun and scary sentiment that will later on bring us the 1980's box office hits such as E.T., Gremlins, and Indiana Jones. This is one of the classic films that paved the way, and there's no denying its originality, great storyline, effective Jerry Goldsmith music and breakthrough special effects that defined a special era in film-making history. The talented cast together with ahead-of-its-time supernatural elements and entertaining fast-paced humor and eccentrics make this a tour-De force of all our suburban childhood traumas, including a ghostly tree, thunderstorm paranoia, a creepy clown-doll, and other various toy artifacts that are embedded into our psyches and plague our fears of the unknown and overall uneasiness with innocent curiosities. Tobe Hooper, Steven Spielberg and producers seem to know what touches our deepest fears as well as our insight into life-after-death, and they translate it onto the big screen into what is a non-stop action-adventure horror/fantasy for an audience that can appreciate the American dream and the American nightmare of what might be in the closet or under the bed.

184,moviemattb,Definitely A Film That Knows What Scares You,10,29 October 2018,"""Poltergeist"" is a film that tells about an everyday family as they lived in the suburbs, where they happen to be normal as no one is rich by having expensive stereos, fancy cars, or living in a mansion. It features a mother and a father, as they have three children, where everything seems to go well and all; however, a beautiful little girl name Carol Anne talks to a TV Set, and something strange happens as they enter from another dimension by taking over the house, and kidnapping their only child. Now the Freeling family calls in a group of parapsychologists and a spiritual medium as they try to do whatever they can to save Carol Anne, and deal with their ghost problems. I have this one memory that pops in my head, where there was a scene that the Freeling family are trying to leave the suburbs, and get the TV out of their hotel room. That was the only clip I've seen for a very young age. Also, I did try to watch this movie on TNT; until toward the end, I stop because the movie was going too far and was really scared by it. Years go by, I begin to look back at the movie, and appreciate it for what it is. I never experience a movie like or even its genre, but that is the point for a movie like this. I'm a man now, and have no fear of watching horror movies. Of course this was rated PG, and really does have an edge to it; it features faces peeling off, an evil clown, a scary looking beast, skeletons coming from the grave, and a tree. This is definitely a film that knows what scares you. This was my first Tobe Hooper movie, before seeing the first two ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" movies. Yes, there was a controversy on who directed the movie, whether it was Tobe Hooper or Steven Spielberg as he co wrote and co produced the movie. Watching the movie, I do get a Spielberg vibe as it features suburban area, and some of that whimsical music which that is definetly Spielberg. I'm sure there are some moments that is Hooper's, but if I had to say who directed the movie; I say the movie is both directed by Hooper and Spielberg. Spielberg couldn't receive a co directing credit, because he working on another movie that was also as famous as ""Poltergeist,"" and that is ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial."" Both films that were well received, and successful at the box-office, but ""E.T."" was making the big bucks. Nevertheless, they're both great movies. Although, to be honest, I do like ""E.T."" a bit more than ""Poltergeist,"" but that is a whole different topic. ""Poltergeist"" is a fantastic horror movie, and both Spielberg and Hooper have done a terrific job on collaborating the movie together. The story is very well told, and love the suburban area as you do get a sense of atmosphere going on; the family themselves act like a real family. JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson have done a great job for portraying as the Mom and Dad of the movie. The child actors all did great, but the one child actor that became the heart and soul of the movie is Heather O'Rourke. She is cute, and really a child that you fell in love with. Yes, I cannot forget during the moment, as the ghost enter their world; she really speaks the movie's most memorable quote ""They're here."" As I'm watching her, it really is sad that she is no longer with us, and wish she would still be alive and have a successful career. Things happen in live, and yes can't forget by Dominique Dunne as this was her only movie and it really does sucks about what happen to her, which is really tragic. With that said, the special for the most part are indeed special, and ILM has done a marvelous for making the ghost looking more threatening. They're about as threatening as the ghost from ""Ghostbusters."" Jerry Goldsmith has made a memorable score, and really one of his best that he has ever done. The film's suspense is top notch, and very well filmed. The movie does have its emotional moments, especially for Carol Anne, and you do want her to be reunited with her family. I don't know how much I can say about ""Poltergeist,"" but its a classic movie. If you haven't seen ""Poltergeist,"" then feel free to check it out. I'm giving it a 10 out of 10.",Poltergeist
185,ray-280,My favorite film experience,10,20 March 2007,"I noticed that IMDb lists the release dates for films, and laughed here because I could never forget Friday, June 4, 1982, my last day in tenth grade, and about my tenth date with the exceptionally pretty and wonderful young lady I dated throughout most of high school. The weather was perfect, and I took my ladyfriend out for a nice lunch and a walk down Broadway in search of a movie. ET had been the hyped Spielberg film of that summer, but this one was already out, and the thought of a horrified hottie clinging to me for dear life (or vice versa) was irresistible. Poltergeist it was.Like all Spielberg films, one will not find many weaknesses. The plot will be engaging, the visuals stunning, the acting excellent, and the overall experience first-class. This film did not disappoint.The restrospectively amusing casting of Craig T. Nelson in the lead. Notable supporting cast include the late Dominique Dunne and the late Healther O'Rourke, both of whom would die tragically in 1988 and 1982, respectively, the earlier by domestic violence and the latter by illness. The loss to Hollywood is still felt to this day as each would likely have Oscars by now. The cast of competent, moderately known talents provided a strong yet muted substance to the special-effects stylings for which Spielberg became so famous.As I settled in with my date to watch the film, I was equally enthralled both by her touch and the screen. From the moment O'Rourke uttered the to-this-day-chilling ""They're here!!,"" through the amusing plot twist that explains the hauntings (a certain home developer forgot to do something with the gravesite that had previously existed on the land and apparently ticked off some spirits), though the death, destruction, and absolute terror experienced by the hapless protagonist family.I will never again be fifteen, never again experience the deep cuts to the heart that come with teenage desire, never again wonder if maybe those horror movies could happen in real life, never again will experience the thrill of not having school or any other responsibilities for the next three months, and will never again be as vital or physically capable as I was so effortlessly back then, but to have had that even once, all at the same time, in the greatest city in the world, was absolutely awesome.Whatever might have been wrong with my life at that age simply did not exist in that theater, during that film, with that date.

Back in 1982 this picture was the other horror thrillride to come out along with John Carpenter's re-make of The Thing. I saw the Thing again a couple of years ago only to find it a little dated and flimsy though the SFX and some suspense scenes still had impact.Poltergeist? Nothing has held its impact with this film, a cheap carnival ride that the years haven't been kind to. The SFX is shoddy, the suspense non existent, and it amounts to little more than Spielberg (and Toby Hooper too as the story goes) hurling everything including the kitchen sink at the screen in an attempt to scare the audience.In 1982 I was young enough to not care about a structured storyline, set-up and hadn't yet seen films like Rear Window to teach me that horror and suspense pictures don't require a shock a minute, gory slime, and a lot of noise and flickering lights to make you squirm in your seat. So naturally I ignorantly came out of the theatre with my friends awe-stricken at what I'd just seen. Spielberg went with the visceral over-the-top approach, the glossy blockbuster with his usual gimmicks hopeful for a McDonald's tie-in, and any value this film had as a result has long since faded. It's just not scary or shocking anymore. If anything it's ridiculously overdone and tiresome. I'm surprised he never shot it in 3D what with all the flying objects and in your face effects.I love most of Spielberg's films, many of them go over the top as well, but this one was Spielberg in overdose mode, out of control with no regard in any way, shape or form for self restraint.",Poltergeist

191,Sunsphxsuns,THIS IS THE HORROR COMEDY MOVIE ALL OTHERS WANTED TO BE,10,16 September 2021,"I was already a Steven Spielberg fan long before Poltergeist (1982). Yes, Toby Hooper is listed as the director of Poltergeist, and he has been frequently quoted as saying ""no problems existed between (he) and Spielberg."" Nevertheless it is still widely agreed that at some point Spielberg took over the direction of this breakthrough film. For me, the most convincing example is that Poltergeist truly has the complete ""look, feel, and pacing"" of previous Spielberg directed works: Duel (1971), The Sugarland Express (1974), Jaws (1975), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), 1941 (1979), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), and E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982).Spielberg has often said that Frank Capra, Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean, John Ford, Stanley Kubrick, John Frankenheimer, Ingmar Bergman, Jacques Tati and François Truffaut, all inspired how his own films would eventually look. And without question, his films are inspired creations designed specifically to entertain.So when Poltergeist rolled out June 4, 1982, followed by E. T., June 11, 1982, I could not have been more excited to see these two extraordinary films practically back to back.Poltergeist delivers the kind of ethereal entertainment rarely found in today's plethora of CGI heavy undertakings. Special movie effects today (2021) have become so sensational, and graphic, they often upstage the acting. Not so with Poltergeist.This film is made up of (then) relatively unknown performers, and that's perfect, because the special effects, while clever and captivating, don't overshadow the fine performances of the cast. The thrills are all expertly executed and laced with humor. But in less than an hour into the film all hell begins to break loose, and the audience quickly discovers they're ""not in Kansas anymore.""In German, Poltergeist means ""a noisy, physically active ghost.""

When they get their daughter back, they decide to stay in the house rather than leave it no matter what, but somehow someone behind camera figured out that that stupid attitude was needed for the final showdown of special effects. And that's the only reason that gets me to score a maximum of 4/10, the incredible special effects for the year 1982.As another reviewer already pointed out, there is an episode of the original series ""Twilight Zone"" (""Lost Little Girl"") with a very similar story, which raises serious doubts as to the originality of Spielberg's script. If you don't believe me use the net to check it out.",Poltergeist
195,rowanmaillot,7.4 are you alright IMDB/critics?,9,26 June 2019,"Let's just start this off simply by saying one word (That annoys everybody in all my Spielberg reviews, please do not kill me!) CLASSIC! It's the true definition of scary/spooky, not the 'horror' films we have nowadays with blood, guts, intestines and liver torn apart and men with their face torn apart coming back from the dead to haunt other people and make them bleed to death and haunt them till their face falls off and they die a horrific death just like the did and blah. I just felt like I needed to get that out of my system. Phew! What I call spooky is Poltergeist (maybe even Annabelle). If you're a true horror nerd you'd know it's not all about the blood, the guts, it's about the jump scares, possession, maybe the slightest blood on a window or something like that. OK, I'm running out of words, but to keep it PG- FLIP THIS IS THE BEST HORROR FILM!!",Poltergeist
196,VikiLauda,Y'all mind hanging back? You're jamming my frequency!,9,24 February 2021,"This superbly made movie is in my top 5 favorite movies of all time. I was already a fan of Tobe Hopper's work for Chainsaw & Fun House, but Poltergeist is an absolute masterpiece, which is hard to fault. This is certainly my kind of horror/ghost story because it is genuinly creepy, gripping stuff & when I first saw this in 1983 when I was just 15 it actually kept me awake at night! I kept hearing Carol-Anne's distorted, disturbing voice saying ""Ther'es somebody here..."" coming from the TV set, which was a scene that really touched me because of a sleep walking expierence I had when I was six when I woke up sat on the living room floor with my hands on the TV screen, just like in the movie. It still makes me shudder today.Poltergeist tells the story of the Freeling family, who are ordinary middle class, suburban Americans, who are having a swimming pool built in their garden. They have three children, Dana, Robbie & Carol-Anne the youngest. & they begin to expierence some what benign phenomena such as chairs moving about by themselves. However things turn nasty & their youngest daughter vanishes, so in desperation the parents call in a paranormal team to investigate. Two of the team expierence traumatic events & refuse to return to the house, but the third, Dr Lesch returns with a gifted medium called Tangina...Well I am only marking this down a star for the really implausable scene with Robbie & the tree, which just makes me giggle, but the rest of this film is awesome with some terrific acting & nerve jamming tension. There is great chemistry with the cast & ILM's special effects are jaw dropping. Jerry Goldsmiths original score is hauntingly beautiful (pardon the pun!) which has a mystical quality, which continued on his next sound track for ""The Secret of Nimh"" which is similer in places. But all this simply makes Poltergeist a visual as well as an audio feast, to still be enjoyed today. This movie was made at a time before Hollywood was drowning in SJW propaganda of recent years, so it's very refreshing to rewatch this today, with a story centered around a loving, caring family, however this is not a movie for small children as it has elements of horror, shows mild drug use & uses real skeletons for props. The profanity is very mild & there is no nudity or sex scenes. It has aged well & still stands today as a superb movie which can thrill a new generation of fans, its just a great pity that the sequals were not a patch on this great original film.Tangina: ""To us it is the BEAST...Now lets go get your daughter!""",Poltergeist

Without putting too fine a point on it or preaching, ""Poltergeist"" critiques relentless, consequence-free Reagan-era American optimism, in which past sins and omissions can be ignored and replicated because Profit!!, until the overlooked decide they've had enough. The movie only leaves the ticky-tacky, sunny and stormy suburban setting for two brief scenes, which helps it build a blandly claustrophobic atmosphere. ""Cuesta Verde"" is a place where, as one minor character observes, the houses all look alike, where people are so packed in that your neighbor's remote can change your TV channel, and where the phased planning aims to corral past, present and future residents in a manner that extracts maximum value. A lot of factors have helped enshrine ""Poltergeist"" as a modern classic, from the back-and-forth exhortations about going into the light (or not!) to Zelda Rubenstein's memorable turn as a psychic to the sad tale of Heather O'Rourke (who utters the film's most famous line, ""They're here...""), but beyond all that it remains as gripping, entertaining and watchable as it was when it debuted.

202,lucianomarzo92,Poltergeist,6,8 October 2009,"Poltergeist is a very good movie. It is entertaining, interesting, original, and terrifying. However, most of the movie does not feel like your watching a horror movie. Some of it actually seems like a kids movie. Poltergeist is not a kids movie! I'm 16 and it really scared meme! I'd hate to imagine the reaction of a child to this movie. There are mostly two terrifying scenes, and they both involve a clown. There are a few ominous, creepy scenes. There is also one startling scene.Most of the movie, looked like it could have been straight out of a fantasy movie, not intended to cause terror. These scenes were extremely mild for a horror movie. Very very mild. But the clown will terrify children. Clowns are already really creepy, but when a life-sized inanimate clown springs to life, its even scarier. This scene was really good though. It was truly a classic horror scene. Poltergeist is a movie about a young family living in an urban subdivision. The parents have a young daughter, a slightly older son, and a teenage daughter. The two youngest children are still frightened of seemingly irrational things, like life-sized clowns, and funny-shaped trees. The older girl, and parents are not scared of these things though. The young girl finds that there is a voice that talks through her television to her. She talks to this voice occasionally. One day though, she is captured by this TV. She is captured by a Poltergeist. This Poltergeist proceeds to place a haunting on the house. This includes objects moving themselves around, objects coming to life, and earthquakes within the house.These quakes are spawned by ribbons of green light that erupt from the TV. The parents then hire three of four professional Poltergeist busters to get their daughter back. The main problem I had with it was it didn't really have much of an intended audience. I say this because it seems to be a kids movie. A lot of the movie is lighthearted and intended to be touching, like a kids movie. But the clown excludes the audience of children because its so scary. Despite this, I was fairly impressed with Poltergeist. Its worth a watch.",Poltergeist
203,ironcraftleague,A boring horror film.,7,7 March 2019,"I don't see the appeal. A lot of the things with this film are boring and uninteresting to me. Such as the tree or the room where they're trying to get the girl back are very cool but yet it's uninteresting by the way it's executed.

205,eytand94,Poltergeist: Terrifying 80s Ghostly Fun!,10,10 November 2009,"The plot: Enter the nice, suburban town of Cuesta Verde, and the home of the Freeling family: Diane, her husband Steven, their son Robbie, their oldest daughter Dana, and their cute-as-a-button little girl Carol-Anne. The Freelings live a normal everyday life, until strange disturbances occur and Carol-Anne begins to make contact with eerie voices in their TV set. Then things get scary when Diane and Steven discover that Carol-Anne has been whisked into another dimension, one of terror, pain, and fear. The Freelings are being terrorized by ghosts, and extremely ferocious ones at that.""Poltergeist"" is one of the most perfect haunted house movies ever made. It's filled with scares, a witty sense of humor, and enough goo for the fans. It gives you a few chances to breath, but when the horror begins, there's no stopping it. And all of this came out of the mind of Steven Spielberg, director of ""Jaws."" One of the reasons ""Poltergeist"" works so well is the setting. This family is living in a normal home, lending the viewer the idea that this can happen to anybody. Not until ""Paranormal Activity"" have I seen such terrifying supernatural events in a horror film.The movie is plenty creepy. Sometimes, there won't be anything happening during a scene, then Diane will turn around and all the table chairs are stacked up. The movie psychologically plays with you, and only throws in special effects when they're most needed.The acting is stellar. The entire cast comes off as pure and real, especially the Freeling family. JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson have wonderful chemistry as the parents, Beatrice Straight creates a great parapsychologist who is not the only one who is stunned by this ghostly activity, and Heather O' Rourke is to die for as Carol-Anne. And don't miss out on an awesome performance by Zelda Rubinstein as psychic Tangina.Nobody quite knows who directed ""Poltergeist"" the most: Steven Spielberg himself or his partner Tobe Hooper, the dude who brought us the classic ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" Most of the movie comes off as Spielberg's, and I think the scenes of the special effects are probably Hooper's material. Until we hear it from Spielberg and Hooper, we won't know.It's been nearly 30 years, and ""Poltergeist"" still has the ability to scare you, to make you jump, to amaze you, and to make you laugh. This is one 80s haunted house movie that everyone remembers, and we still love Carol-Anne's classic line: ""They're heeeere."" P.S.

Just think about this for a second... If every living thing had to be graved with a headstone, the whole world would be a cemetery many times over.I also love how, in the ending of the movie, they keep the kids inside the house as they move out, which causes them to have another horrifying experience. You just got your kid back from a poltergeist, wouldn't you take both of the kids out of the house and secure with someone as quickly as possible?In the end, I watch this movie simply because I can laugh all through the movie. The Poltergeist is simply another good joke. I have to ask, is there any question that Steven Spielberg was involved in the making of this movie?",Poltergeist
207,JosephPezzuto,Reel Look: 'Poltergeist',7,7 February 2015,"""They're here!"" After his success with the low budget but high grossing 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' in 1974, Tobe Hooper would then later go on to collaborate with Steven Spielberg to create another horror cash-in with the 1982 supernatural thriller 'Poltergeist'. But did this 80's film truly define the horror genre altogether? Let's take a look. Set in a California suburb, the plot focuses on the Freeling family whose home is invaded at first by ghosts who seem harmful at first of which would later on become malevolent and abduct the family's youngest daughter Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke), befriending her first via communicating through TV static. At first the evens within the Freeling home are bizarre yet harmless: silverware bends, chairs stack themselves on the kitchen table and furniture moves on its own accord thanks to the ""TV people"". Dismissing the phenomena as benign, the specters declare their presence known even more so as time goes on, as the son Robbie is nearly swallowed by a gnarly demon tree in a thunderstorm whilst Carol Anne is sucked through a glowing, unearthly portal that emanates from her bedroom closet. As if an evil clown doll, a parapsychologist tearing off his own face and even the petite Zelda Rubinstein herself as a medium who professionally exorcises residences were not enough, Hooper quickly pulls the stops on the treats and the tricks especially at the end that really launches the film into a full-scare frenzy. Why the family doesn't just pack up and leave already is anyone's guess, as the scares intensify and the dread slowly builds set to Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score until the final showdown between the Freelings and ""the Beast"". Followed by two forgettable sequels, the original is regarded to be the best of the trilogy franchise, grossing $76 million plus in 1982, making it the eighth overall highest gross for a horror film for the year. Frightening, tense and loaded with spooky yet visually creative special effects, Hooper has a ball releasing his thrills and chills on us as Spielberg reveals the darker side of suburbia that indeed defined the horror generation. And yes, I already snub the remake.",Poltergeist
208,tallguy62,Jerry Goldsmith's finest music on film!!,9,11 October 2007,"If I had to pick out one reason this movie was successful, a good reason would be Jerry Goldsmith's disturbing yet beautiful soundtrack. He was at his best during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Even though film music buffs know that during the ""ghost scene"" Spielberg cut out a lot of the music that Jerry had written, still, the film stands well even though it is now over 20 years old. The music is stunning and beautiful.This was the era when Spielberg did serious movies that were much more enjoyable than he does now. He remembered that audiences want to be entertained and horrified but not be overwhelmed by special effects and nothing else. True, the special effects in the film were great, but they did not overshadow the storyline like War of the Worlds or Majority Report, Spielberg's modern BOMBS.Everyone can relate to the simple ghost story presented here. At least Spielberg seemed to know how to direct children in this movie. I don't know why he has failed in so many recent movies. Maybe someone else has an opinion about this.I really enjoyed this movie in the theater. It is not nearly as good on television -- it seems rather cheesy when not on the big screen. Highly recommended movie.",Poltergeist
209,victoryismineblast,Still relevant after 32 years,8,16 August 2014,"Very mild spoilers.I am slowly introducing my thirteen year old daughter to the (mostly horror) films of my youth. She scares easily so it took a few weeks to talk her into watching this one. Tonight we shared the experience. It was about my tenth time seeing it. ""A Steven Spielberg Production"" is what the opening and closing credits promise, and this is exactly what we get. In actuality, it's more of a Spielberg/Tobe Hooper hybrid. Anyone familiar with Spielberg's work of the late 70s/early eighties will see the similarities. Kids riding bikes and playing with remote control cars around sprawling residential cul-de-sacs. Period cultural references abound. The kids' room is covered in Star Wars, from the sheets on the bed to the little R2-D2 toys and Chewbacca jacket, as well as the poster on the wall. A Rubix Cube sits on the shelf in the background and by far coolest of all, AN ALIEN POSTER IS PROUDLY DISPLAYED ON THE WALL!!! (see my avatar for significance). Pizza Hut is of course mentioned also (see E.T.). This is not your average Spielberg fare though. There is some weird stuff here. An 8 year old boy is almost eaten by a tree. A woman flounders in a swimming pool full of rotted corpses and skeletons. A man literally rips his own face off. These two latter scenes are where the film becomes more ""Hooperesque."" Where the film really succeeds is in playing off on our childhood fears. Ghosts of course are the main focus here. Who as a child didn't harbour some sort of fear of ghosts or monsters in the closet? And while we didn't all have one, that damn demonic clown doll is enough to scare the hell out of any child. Even for adults, the memories of those fears are enough to put a few scares into you while watching this movie. Add to that the fear of losing a small child and you up the scare factor a few notches. Zelda Rubinstein is usually mentioned as a standout here, and she does a great job as Tangina, but her part is very small and it is O'Rourke as Carol Anne and Williams as Diane who are the real standouts here. It is really very sad that O'Rourke's life and career were cut short at such a young age. Another thing that needs mentioning is Jerry Goldsmith's score. It evokes emotion in all the right places, and dread very effectively. It is very haunting and melodic. I'd also like to add that jump scares are used here. There are only two or three, but they work, and they work well. For those of you who think that they are just some new plot device improperly and over used in recent film, give this one a re-watch. The only regret I have is that I couldn't take my daughter to the theatre to see this, as I did as a thirteen year old boy almost 32 years ago to this day. Those are my thoughts on Poltergeist. Now with all that said, I can't imagine this remake coming out next year capturing any of the above qualities.",Poltergeist
210,jacobnunnally,Didn't get into it,5,10 October 2015,"My favorite movie by Tobe Hooper is ""The Funhouse."" Now that is a sensational movie! So good! I was hooked in the first few minutes of the movie and it just kept getting better and better and then the final scene tops it all off. Wonderful movie.By contrast, I didn't really get into ""Poltergeist."" I actually just watched this for the first time and I thought, ""Eh."" One thing I thought that was odd was that they didn't call the police after their child had been missing for a few days. Can you imagine that!? They kinda ""know"" where the child is, but not really. And also, after the child goes missing, there are lighthearted moments in which people smile, offer comforting, uplifting words of encouragement, and I think someone might have even laughed at some point.Can you imagine that!? Think if your small child was missing - could you smile about anything? I don't think so, I don't think that that's possible. You'd be overwhelmed by anxiety, fear, doubt, and worry.I guess there was just something that didn't add up psychologically. And the son didn't say, ""Hey, the tree broke through the window, grabbed me, and threw me out of the house."" Nope! Doesn't say a word about it!!! And this is AFTER he mentions that he doesn't like the tree to his father earlier! Ahh, come on.I think this is a really overrated movie. I gave it a 5, and that's just because I like Tobe Hooper.

That's Poltergeist. Don't get hung up on it, it's just my opinion. Poltergeist is superbly crafted, well-acted, and beautifully shot. The score is excellent and the special effects hold up. This movie is not as scary as some other horror classics. Most people would complain about this. For me, it's a positive: it makes the movie better for those getting into the genre. If you're big into horror from nowadays, I definitely wouldn't recommend Poltergeist, but for those who are passing fans of horror or who want to into the genre, or if you don't like horror but your friends want to watch something scary so you all watch Poltergeist. Also, I would recommend it over the 2015 remake. 80s films just have such charm, even when it's on-the-nose (Star Wars memorabilia, the dad reads a book called ""Reagan: the President, the Man"").

212,scorfield-51711,Spectral Presence Onset and Off,8,5 September 2016,"'To her it is simply another child. To us it is the Beast.'The legacy of this film can be witnessed by the multitude of derivative productions it has left in its wake, yet its reputation and iconic status has also suffered in the same regard. It also bears the unmistakable influence of its writer and producer, who despite not helming this landmark supernatural tale, ensured it was imbibed with his trademark mix of suspense and humour, and furnished with state-of-the-art visual effects. It is just a reflection of the great strides such technical expertise has undergone that some of these now appear slightly dated. Whatever the truth behind the extent to which Spielberg assumed direction of the project from Tobe Hooper, the reality is that the finished product enjoyed far greater box office success than anything the latter directed since. Contractual obligations in helming 'ET' ensured Spielberg could not direct this feature, but delays in the shooting of his other project, shot just a block away from where this one is set, meant that his presence was nigh constant. What is abundantly clear is the film's success is largely due to focusing the audience's attention on the family undergoing these paranormal events rather than the events themselves. This is pure Spielberg fare, as we share the Freelings' disbelief, fascination, and ultimate terror at the abnormal occurrences which infest their home. The depth of characterisation Spielberg brought to the project provided the vehicle to ignite the acting careers of relative unknowns Craig T Nelson and JoBeth Williams. Indeed, the emotional charge with which the latter portrayed the devotion and protective instincts of a mother to her missing child moves her performance to a calibre far higher than normally adorns this genre of movie-making. In addition, there are superior performances from Beatrice Straight as lead scientist on the team attempting to assist the parents, and Zelda Rubinstein as the diminutive but highly enigmatic medium with greater understanding of the paranormal. Yet, the most noteworthy contribution to the film's ongoing appeal is that from the youngest cast member, Heather O'Rourke, whose short-lived career would become the main talking point behind this franchise. Not all is accounted for by Spielberg's genius , as the focal point of the screenplay - parents' desperate attempts to rescue a child who has slipped through a portal into another dimension - replicates those of a much vaunted episode of the 'Twilight Zone' entitled 'Little Girl Lost'. This is itself adapted from a short story by Richard Matheson, another of whose short stories, 'Duel', marked Spielberg's debut as director. Although criticised by some reviewers for not epitomising true horror, the originality of the screenplay, and ultimately chilling premise for audiences, lay in uprooting a 'haunted house' storyline from the habitual dilapidated ruin on the outskirts, and replanting it right in the heart of modern suburbia. A further inspired touch was the use of 'static' on the TV as the medium through which the abducted child can communicate, thereby transforming this everyday means of entertainment into an object of fear - Spielberg dubbed this production his 'revenge on 'tv'. Moreover, the disembodied, distorted, voice emanating behind the static heightens the tension throughout the rescue attempts. The film's tagline, 'It knows what scares you', serves to reflect the inspiration for many of the film's standout frights, being based largely on the childhood fears of the film's writer and producer. One such scare nearly resulted in real tragedy on set as young Oliver Robbins nearly asphyxiated in his character's life or death struggle with the demonic clown doll, until Spielberg realised the child actor's predicament and stepped in to save him. Another fascinating piece of film trivia concerns the film's barnstorming finale, in that the skeletons used were real, working out cheaper in production costs, and that this fact was deliberately kept from JoBeth Williams. There are obvious holes in the plot, and a glaring piece of atrocious editing. However, the laudable work by the special effects teams would unjustifiably in this reviewer's opinion lose out at the Academy Awards to those working on Spielberg's other project of that year. Likewise, the classy soundtrack provided by Jerry Goldsmith would miss out, but in this case to one of the most emblematic pieces of film score in cinematic history: John William's musical accompaniment to 'ET'. Much wasted attention has been paid to the supposed curse surrounding the production, but suffice to note the tragic irony that the actress portraying the eldest Freeling sibling, spared from sharing the full trauma of the horrors unleashed within the family home, would just three months after the film's release fall victim to domestic abuse, strangled on her doorstep by an estranged former boyfriend.",Poltergeist

Secondly, I don't understand the sub plot about Dana's birth. Steven mentions Dana is sixteen and Diane is 32. This means that Diane was 16 when Dana was born.

Steve Freeling is a successful realestate agent who has a nice house and a loving wife, with a family to die for. There is the spunky, rebellious eldest daughter, as portrayed gloriously by the late Dominique Dunne, may she rest in peace. The sporty young son, and the cute, innocent youngest daughter, Carol Ann, of whom the story is based around. The Freelings' are a happy American family whose lives are turned upside down when they realize their house in 'haunted' and the 'poltergeists' kidnap the youngest member of the family. In the film that pursues, Steve and his wife Diane do everything in their power to get her back, with the aid of Dr. Lesh, played out Oscar worthy by Beatrice Straight, and her assistants. Horrors and traumas ensue.Enough power to knock you out of your dreams for long time, this film, was said to be directed by Tobe Hooper, whom had previous fame with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. But when one watches this film, it is anything but Hooper. Hooper's trademarks include hysteria and screaming by a young female in the finale of his films(remember 'Eaten Alive?') and have no real substance or depth in their plots, what you see is what you get. Whereas this film, said to be produced by Spielberg, was so obviously directed(on the side anyway)by also, as his trade marks include psychological P.O.V. shots(Diane Freeling in the hallway scene) and wide range of character development(all characters except for Dana are developed to fruition, but Dunne does such a great job as Dana that you can't really tell.)There was even controversy over who directed the film, and still stands so today, although Spielberg came forward a little after the film was released, and exposed himself as only producer and assistant to the director, still, rumor is still hovering over the memory of the production.The music to the film is superb, with Goldsmith clearly at one of his best moments, nominated but did not win, although he should have. His theme for the Freelings' is a calm, gentle one that compliments his theme for Carol Ann, which is quite possibly one of the prettiest themes he ever concocted. His score for the ghosts consists of structured, spiritual themes and rough orchestral brass woodwind, accompanied by a grand chorus. All other themes he came up with were just as stand out-ish as the above mentioned.The acting is top notch, by conflicted Steve Freeling, who is so confused he self destructs into a pale maelstrom in his mind, and Diane, the mother and star of the film, Jobeth Williams is at her finest as she deals with the stress of trying to find her daughter, and keeping her family afloat amidst the chaos. The children are all really good under Hooper's(Spielberg's?) direction, particularly Dominique Dunne, who shines through in all scenes she is in, even though her character has got to be the most underdeveloped! Robbie is fun to watch, as all little boys will be boys. And who could forget the cute Carol-Ann...They're Heeeeere! Enough said. But my personal favorite was the late Beatrice Straight, as the sympathetic Dr. Lesh, who with every facial expression, the audience can see what exactly she is thinking, about to say, and still manages to surprise the audience with her spontaneous acting skill. The supporting cast are just as great.Special effects make this even more of a thrill ride of the ages, as Industrial Light and Magic was first starting out, and makes this one of the biggest special effects fest of cinema. Nominations for those also.So in full circle, this family, this film, the most extraordinary horror film of the eighties, still has the power to ring every chill out of it's script, while still managing to keep the audience calm with it's realism, and relief.And about the curse that is said to follow the series' past, all just tragedies and coincidence.May Dominique Dunne, Beatrice Straight, Heather O' Rourke, Jerry Goldsmith, all rest in peace.10/10",Poltergeist
220,sn319,A Classic Horror Film You Can't Go Wrong With,8,8 December 2014,"The week before E.T came out, a little film called Poltergeist was released. Well, the commercials seemed tame enough, the PG rating meant it couldn't be too scary. And especially after seeing E.T on June 11, there was no way that Poltergeist could be anything more than family friendly fun.You see Spielberg was the director of E.T but produced this flick and a lot of people took their kids to see Poltergeist not knowing that it would be...well, what it is.And what is it? It's well-directed, well-shot, and really creepy. It's not a horror movie in the sense of a single entity presiding over the scares. It's not that gory either. It's actually pretty tame considering the time period (the slasher flick genre was picking up steam).That said, the movie is really freaky and maintains the weird from beginning to end. It has a few bumps here and there (the psychics slowed the movie down immensely) but you get a ton of pay off. The effects, for the time, were amazing and many of them are still really good even by today's standards. The story itself is cliché but done so well you won't care.This will scare the crap out of your kids. I wouldn't suggest you show it to them. But it's a truly fantastic piece of cinema and one of my favorite horror films of all time.",Poltergeist
221,DemiRonin,"Come on Spielberg....don't lie. This film is obviously all your crafting, it has your handprints everywhere.",6,5 June 2011,"Poltergeist is about a haunted house in the middle of suburbia. A family of five is living the peaceful life when one night their youngest daughter Carol Anne starts talking to something inside the TV. With the iconic lines ""They're heeeere"" a series of paranormal events occur with the Carol Anne being sucked through the closet and into the spiritual world. Refusing to leave her cursed home Diane, the desperate mother played by Jobeth Williams, contacts scientists and spiritualists, doing everything in her power to get her daughter back. If the question is does Poltergeist scare then the answer seems to be a mixed yes and no. Unfortunately Poltergeist is a film that doesn't age well with time. The reason being is that Poltergeist relies heavily on its special effects and puppet techniques that simply seem ancient nowadays. With computer effects advancing at such a fast pace anything over 20 years will seem antiquated. At the time I'm sure the effects were miraculous but watching scenes from Poltergeist today is like going to a 50 year old ride at Disney land. Yes there's a bit of charm to it but the tricks are only going to work on toddlers. One example is the ""tree"" scene, where this tree made out of wire and molding is clearly not a tree at all and looks ridiculous obtuse in their suburban backyard. The scene I found the scariest actually occurred in the first five minutes and had no special effects. The scene is of a little girl with huge eyes and strobing lights. The vulnerability of the girl alone combined with the music is a powerful effect. Everyone knows this movie is going to be full of scares but not knowing what they're going to be is the terrifying part. Poltergeist is a little long; six minutes short of 2 hours is far too long to sit still being scared every 15 minutes. The story is a little uneven with very important characters introduced into the movie very late. The acting is not too bad. Williams' desperation comes from a true place most of time but many of the side characters aren't all that impressive. The film also starts to grow a little cancerous towards the last third. What I mean is that all of sudden the haunting expands in dramatic fashion but instead of being ""scarier"" Spielberg simply goes for ""bigger"". The special effects are enlarged in scope stretching beyond the house. This choice almost takes it away from horror and turns Poltergeist into scifi, which we know Spielberg is great at. However in this case I don't think a clear cohesion between the two genres was achieved. At its release Poltergeist was probably break through for its time. There are some unique scares which you will notice from other films that copied it but the overall Poltergeist doesn't contain that 'timeless horror' feeling like that the Shinning or The Exorcist. Who this film is not for: -People who don't like horror films -People who constantly obsess over the quality of the special effects.",Poltergeist
222,stephenbishop-22925,Brilliant for its time,8,15 April 2019,"I remember seeing this in the cinema with my best friend. We both came out of the cinema scared stiff and never wanting a TV in our bedrooms.
Who could go wrong with the two brilliant minds of Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper to produce this masterpiece of a horror film. I don't think there has ever been one to rival the brilliance. The story is so simple. The tension and pace just right.
""They're here"". The tag line that brought the horror of the TV People to life. Considering it was made in 1979 when special effects just weren't fully CGI'd, the movie is top of its class.
It's scary, funny in parts and the ending is typical Spielberg/Hooper. You think it's over, and there's more.

Now the second time, expectations were high because on Blu-Ray everything would be HD and the director is Tobe ""Texas chainsaw massacre"" Hooper. Not Steven Spielberg as I remembered. (Spielberg is here the capitalist, the producer.)""Poltergeist"" is however more close to a spielbergian Indiana Jones-saga than to classic horror:-Suspense is always accompanied with noise.-It is stuffed with symphony music with horns and trumpets.-Its backround is a description of american white middle class lifestyle erroneously considered ""normal"" and sympathetic. (Bret Easton Ellis, the writer of ""American psycho"", described american suburbs as places where every house looks similar and where even the kids use downers.)Summa summarum not the worst ghost movie in the history, but it stinks production money and lacks sense of naturalism.

224,thatsweetbird,The least of 4 movies from 1976-82 with the same plot,5,1 May 2019,"I wanted to write about the fairly little noted similarity between 4 popular movies during a 7 year period
In the late 70s to the early 80s.
I decided to put the review on this one-the last and what to me is the least of the 4 movies.
I give it a ""5"" because it is entertaining and has a likable cast.
But make no mistake this is the same plot as the other three movies with sparkly effects added
And all the psychological horror lost.The other films I'm referring to are Burnt Offerings (1976),
The Amityville Horror (1979) and The Shining (1980).
All four movies are about a family (husband wife and child(ren)) who come to reside in an evil house.Burnt Offerings came from a novel by Robert Marasco.
It's fine cast included Oliver Reed, Karen Black And Bette Davis as the aunt.
I'm pretty sure there are evil house movies before this, but this is the first I was acquainted with.
The idea that the house is not only evil but making the family evil is important.
This sets it apart from previous movies where a house is threatening its inhabitants but NOT
making them a threat to each other as well.
This element is continued in ""Amityville"" and heightened
In ""Shining"" ,
with it absent from ""Poltergeist"".
""Burnt"" probably made money but probably less than all the other 3 movies.""Amityville"" was a very popular movie.
It starred James Brolin, Margot Kidder And Rod Steiger as the hapless priest.
It was based around a book written by the Lutzes who had lived at a real home
thar had previously seen a real brutal murder of a family by a son.
Despite that ""Burnt"" is fiction and ""Amityville "" is nonfiction (Well at least according to the Lutzes)
the two movies are strikingly similar.Just a year later ""The Shining"" comes out.
It was a modest box office success and was actually disparaged by a number of critics at the time.
Today it is considered one of the greatest horror movies of all time.
And I definitely consider it the best of these 4 movies.I think it's become a cliche after Anthony Hopkins performance in ""The Silence Of The Lambs""
to think that actors are good at playing crazy evil guys .
Here Jack Nicholson puts in a definitive performance as a regular guy going crazy.
Likewise how many scream queens have we seen over the years ?
Shelly Duvall seems genuinely horrified here.
The boy actor as the son is very credible .
Few child performances in other movies are of this quality .Based on Stephen King's novel but quite changed around by the great director Stanley Kubrick.
It uses virtually the same ending shot as ""Burnt"".Then a mere 2 years later we get the very successful but shallow ""Poltergeist"".
Starring JoBeth Williams and ""Coach"" Craig T Nelson and actually directed by Stephen Spielberg .
It delivers all the ""this house is evil"" ideas of the other movies while leaving out any substance,
Any feeling of real horror.Comparing scenes I note the early scene in ""The Shining "" when a psychologist visits Danny to evaluate him. We see his room which includes Bugs Bunny and or Mickey Mouse on the walls as a real child would have.
In a later scene he's watching a cartoon on TV as a real child would.
In ""Poltergeist"" we have a number of scenes in the son's bedroom.
It's filled with posters and toys of virtually every single thing a boy at that time would be interested in,
Including very just popular movies like ""Aliens"" that are questionable fare for a boy his age.
This is ironic as ""Poltergeist "" itself was no doubt seen by many children for whom it's scares are perhaps not appropriate for due to its PG (or PG13 rating). The other three movies were I believe rated ""R"".
The room is like an ad for what a young consumer should be consuming,
With ""interests"" in all and any and therefore no real direction.To me this typifies the tone of the entire movie which is more like an advertisement for a scary movie than a scary movie. Indeed, to me it is a regurgitation of the scares of the earlier three.
But instead of a grounded feeling of menace as is in all the other three we get the ""we are just a regular middle class American family"" vibe that Spielberg scored with in a bunch of movies in the late 70s
And early 80s including ""Jaws"", ""Close Encounters"" And ""E.T."".
No substance, no psychological component-Not truly scary, or that good.",Poltergeist
225,filmfanperspective,Underrated; one of my all-time favorite films,10,22 May 2015,"As a species, we odd beings known as humans mark the passage of time in a variety of odd ways. Some keep pictures, whereas others may travel to specific locations on an anniversary. Me? I watch certain films each year at particular times, for they either remind me of that time of year, were released at that time originally, or give me a general 'feeling' that can only come from being wrapped up in them. The original Poltergeist belongs in that category. It puts me in the mindset of a fall evening, when the howling, cool wind carries a bite that only a thin-skinned child can feel. It also calls back to a time when the nuances of a house frightened me, when I assumed that things going bump in the night were after me, and when the fear of being lost was tantamount to death itself. Directed by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre veteran Tobe Hooper, but crafted by Steven Spielberg (we can argue about that later), Poltergeist is a film that has affected me deeply in different ways at different points in my life. It remains one of the best films of the genre, darned near a masterpiece of spiritual and familial terror.I was near the tender age of 5 when I first saw the film, as it aired on broadcast TV for the first time. For some unknown reason, my parents felt I was up for the experience. After all, it was rated PG; a rating that was clearly inaccurate for the terrors and occasional gore on-screen. However, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and the furor surrounding its' gore was still two years away, and thus the MPAA had yet to develop the PG-13 rating. I remember feigning my bravest face after it was over, wanting my parents to continue bestowing those special privileges upon me. Inside, my stomach churned. Like any child that dealt with a menacing-looking tree, static on an analog television, or a creepy stuffed animal their family thrust upon them, it was clear that Poltergeist spoke directly to me.As I learned later in life, that may have been close to Spielberg's intention. Like E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, released a week later in 1982, he framed this story through the lens of a child's experience. Children can be easily frightened by stuffed animals, or thunderstorms, dark closets, or even a misshapen tree. Parents generally try to assuage them, and over time they overcome those irrational fears. Poltergeist is intimately aware of those fears, and they're all systematically brought to life in the film. The scary tree will eat you, clowns are evil, and the closet literally will come after you. In this film, the cozy comforts of a friendly neighborhood and a cookie-cutter home cannot save you. From a parent's perspective, all the safeguards we build up around our children, all the rules about talking to strangers, the fears we allay in our kids- this film boots them to the side, praying on our ""parent"" brain as well. The film begins with that innocent, sweet tone, slowly lurking in the shadows to take everything precious and stomp on it.Spielberg and crew made a smart, timely film that tore into the very fabric of baby boomers' suburban dreams. Representing the now aging demographic is Steven Freeling (Nelson). He's the consummate post- hippie salesman father, passively parenting his children, selling carbon copy real estate like an old pro, escaping in aggressive Sunday football parties and beers with the exuberance of a frat boy. His wife Diane (Williams), still riding that wave of hippie bliss, has yet to encounter her primal, maternal self at the beginning of the film. Perhaps it's the pot residue, but the most trying thing she seems to encounter are misplaced clothes and the death of the family bird. They're living the dream, or at least the Reaganomics version of the dream. Even their kids are cute and relatively well- behaved, if not also blissfully unaware. The dynamic can be summed up in a scene where Carol Anne (O'Rourke) is gently chided for staring at static on the screen for it will ""hurt her eyes""; Diane changes the channel, apparently fine with the war film now on the tube instead. Oh, the irony!Then it starts to happen. Carol Anne is caught talking to the 'TV people' in the dead of the night, the house appears to quake, and household objects move themselves. At first, Steven and Diane think it neat, like a trippy magic trick; then comes the menace of the trippy magic trick, the snatching of the 'WASP' dream. Carol Anne is taken somewhere, Robbie (Robins) is nearly devoured, and Dana (Dunne) is hysterical. Steven, against his beliefs, consults a parapsychology team at the local college. This motley crew, led by Dr. Lesh (Straight) and the odd, diminutive Tangina (Rubenstein), quickly learn that the Freeling's predicament far exceeds the excitement of a time-lapse video. In the span of fifteen minutes in the film, we go from seeing this relatively normal family deal with a standard, nighttime thunderstorm to being completely strung out in immeasurable grief, pleading with pseudo-science for assistance. This paranormal spirit that envelops the Freeling house succeeds in luring the family into a false sense of security, then it viscerally ""breaks on through to the other side"". What follows is a series of unexpected, thrilling, deeply moving scenes that play with the notions of life, death, instinct, and fear.Read the full review here: http://filmfanperspective.com/2015/05/20/classic-film-review- poltergeist-1982/",Poltergeist

Consequently, the girl's family enlist the help of a mysterious psychic (Zelda Rubenstein), to rescue her.The movie kicks off in great style by offering its audience something different from most standard '80s horror flicks: thrills not generated by visual effects or over-the-top gore. Early in the film, most of the thrills in 'Poltergeist' are generated by the tension felt by the characters, as a result of Carol Anne's mysterious disappearance. However, it is in the second half where 'Poltergeist' falters. It is at this point where the film begins to dwell upon familiar territory.  The visual effects become the focus of the movie.

Why do the bodies of multiple people show up in the pool after the house has been there for several years, and why does the family even entertain the idea of staying another night in the same room that the supernatural stuff was happening in???

I understand its from the early 80s and therefore dated, but that doesn't mean its scary just because it was a ""horror"" movie when it came out.

My mother instantly regretted having me see the movie, even though we watched it together... She had forgotten how terrifying it is, I forgive her.As an adult, watching this again, I am reminded and terrifyingly surprised just how scary it is.In the beginning, the movie begins as a somewhat satirical overlook of cookie-cutter ""McMansion"" American suburban life. The father of the story's family is depicted as a stereotypical simple-minded middle-aged and middle-upper class American male, pregnant with the trademark ""beer belly.""As the events unfold however, Steven Spielberg's writing, along with the rest of the production, shine through... With horrifying special effects, sound design, and nightmarish imagery make this film unforgettable and captivatingly sublime. The cast performs well and suits their characters near perfectly.The end result is a masterclass surrealist horror that is by far one of the best, if not the best, ghost movies ever made.",Poltergeist

243,Newsgeek13,Spielberg at his best.,8,20 September 2013,"As soon as i'm writing this review, I just finished watching it and I have to say, it was awesome. I have always been a fan of Spielberg's work and seeing Spielberg and Tobe Hopper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre)work together, is kinda cool. I liked the ideas the movie had, i think it might have been inspired by the Twilight Zone episode, Little Girl Lost. Where a little girl gets sucked into a portal and the parents have to get her out. The premise came from that, but with the always awesome 80's effects, good story and entertainment. It makes for a fun time. Two sequels were mad, but sadly most of the cast members died during the making, even Heather O'Rourke died at the age of 12. Many people consider this the Poltergeist curse and also apparently owning all the movies is a bad omen because of it. (I find that kinda ridiculous.)I defiantly recommend seeing this movie, its a must. oh and there is a remake coming in 2014. I might check it out, my only problem already, all the effects are gonna be CGI. I can tell ya that.",Poltergeist
244,vertigofan-3,Frightening Spielberg production,7,17 November 2002,"MY RATING- 6.9It's quite a frightening mov directed by Tobe Hoper and co produced by Spielberg, thing that is visible with atempts to scare all of us. This time Spielberg challenge us with a house that has a lot of paranormal disturbances. The victims are JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson and his kids, specially the little daughter who is capturated by the ghosts.We get really scared with some scenes in the kids' room with the alive tree attacking. We even get a pause when the ghostbusters leaded by Beatrice Straight and a midget woman appear. The final attack is particularly frightening, with all that difficulties of getting out of the house, but it can't get out of my mind the  time the midget said `This house is clean'. Too early to say that, I think-- One thing that also confuded me was JoBeth Williams being so young and having already a 17 year old daughter! Overall, a nice spooky flick, but not the best of the genre.",Poltergeist

But the poltergeist is only seen by the youngest daughter in the TV after close down. Then suddenly the daughter disappears and the family tries to find the daughter. Her voice can be heard but they do not know where she is. This is combined with very boring but also very brutal scenes which is the reason for the Certification of 16 years. If they would have left these brutal scenes the movie's certification would be about 6 years and interesting-for children. Never the less the end of the movie is not bad and quite exciting. So 5/10.",Poltergeist
247,steelcorpfilms,A great ghost movie.,9,3 September 2001,"This movie was awesome.  Practically every aspect of it was great.  It had good atmosphere, it was creepy but still had just the right amount of comic relief in just the right places.  The acting was superb, the story was interesting, and the effects were awesome (even by today's standards).  One thing that amazes me is that this flick is rated only PG.  This is a very intense movie for that low a rating, I'm amazed it got by.  I assume this was before the advent of PG-13, which is the reason why.To tell you the truth, I never thought much of Craig T. Nelson.  I always thought of him as `That Coach-guy.'  But while I was watching this, I realized he's a pretty damn good actor.  The same went for the rest of the cast, except the oldest daughter who just seemed annoying for the most part. They all played their parts well, seeming like a normal, happy, tightly knit family.  Very laid back and everything.  There's an especially funny scene with the parents smoking pot in their room.The storyline and plot was really good.  It gives you a lot of action while keeping you informed of what's going on at the same time.  I'd think it would be very hard to get lost in this movie.  The whole story made it seem real, as if it were based on real events.  Paranormal investigators were brought in and they had all their fancy equipment and everything.  There were a few problems with the pacing, I thought.  It seemed to move very fast and then slow to a crawl and then start up again.The special effects in this flick were very well done.  Jan de Bont could take a lesson from this movie on how to properly make a haunted house movie without using crappy CGI effects.  It's really sad, I think, that they could make a movie look this good and have some very creepy effects, and yet with the passing of time not be able to do it anywhere as good.  A couple particularly creepy scenes involve a tree and a clown doll.  There was one scene where a guy tore off his face and you could obviously tell it was a dummy, but that was the only crappy effect in the whole movie.A great ghost movie, probably one of the best of its kind.  Great acting, story, and effects.  Tobe Hooper really outdid himself.  I highly recommend this flick to everyone.",Poltergeist

It is ridiculously overhyped, however.All in all, the film is a great example of the lesson that you reap what you sow. Spielberg definitely gets this message across in the very end, while keeping us hooked for fun ride from the beginning to the end.That being said, with every twist and turn, with all the action and development on screen, I found myself very unfulfilled once the credits began to roll. With everything I had read about this movie before watching, all the hype, all the facts about on screen happenings, and etc, the movie didn't live up to my expectations. Not only was it not what I was hoping for, it left some things unanswered in a way that wasn't so much ""what if"" for my brain to have fun with afterwards, but rather ""what the hell happens now""?",Poltergeist

There you have it, a film about the battering spirits who refuse to die and who haunt and sow terror in a family. Really, the script is controlled as well as its atmosphere, despite an ending that goes a bit far in the fantastic for my taste, but that's just me. The story is really gripping, quite creepy at times. The atmosphere is great, supported by a somptuous staging and special effects which for the time are impressive. So yes, the Tobe Hooper's direction is really effective.The actors are all convincing and perfect in their roles.A classic that has become a cult despite the curse that weighed on the film. 9/10.",Poltergeist

The scene that scared me the most at the time was the tree coming into the window and that pink form coming out of the closet door.  What is so exceptional is it is scary from every point of view.

252,OneRingToRuleThemAll13,Breathtaking horror film that builds up suspense,10,20 September 2011,"I greatly enjoyed this movie. I saw it today on DVD and I was absolutely thrilled during most of the movie (although the first 20 minutes or so don't quite manage to grab you that well, it makes up for it with the last hour and a half). The movie is about a family: The parents, their son and two daughters (plus one SUPER CUTE adult golden retriever). When the daughter, Carol Anne, starts communicating with some strange entities through the family television set, the house becomes haunted, and the family enlists a group of paranormal investigators (ala ''Insidious'', which copies LOTS of elements from this film.).The film is perfectly cast, each actor delivering its respective roll in a n almost perfect manner, which adds to the suspense and atmosphere of the film. It's so sad that two members of the cast horribly died some months after the film's release, leading to many people foolishly thinking the film was CURSED.The special effects are great for its time. For example, the part when one of the investigators hallucinates himself ripping its face off looks stunning, and due to how real it may look for some people, may have to be fast forwarded for younger audiences. The scare and tension level is pretty high during the last half hour, and scared the crap outta me.The music is awesome, and helps create the haunting atmosphere for the movie. Although, the soundtrack alone wouldn't be much fun, so I wouldn't encourage you to buy the soundtrack. Overall, I loved the film. Go see it, you'll have a lot of fun. And like Steven at the end of the movie at the motel, you might be compelled to kick your TV set out the door/window before you go to sleep ;)",Poltergeist
253,Fred_Mopkopf,"It's great anyway, but watch it if you're a film student!",9,2 May 2021,"I guess from now on I'm gonna start all of my reviews with the following petition: If you're not generally able to watch an older film while appreciating the circumstances it was made under - in this case the period with its world view and possibilities - then for crying out loud don't write a review about it. Complaining about unfashionable clothes, old TV sets and cars, the way people spoke and not-up-to-date looking SFX is not gonna get uns anywhere.I hadn't seen 'Poltergeist' in at least fifteen years, and boy, had I forgotten how good this film is. I don't know how much Spielberg eventually had a hand in it (a lot, as I read), but Tobe Hooper is well undercredited wherever you look. Everybody's talking about 'Spielberg's film', completely ignoring the fact that the movie poster says 'Directed by Tobe Hooper'. And even if the producer is such a heavyweight like Spielberg already was at the time, and for marketing reasons has been billed way bigger than the director, the latter must have had a saying in casting and the way things are put to screen. And these two factors - amongst others - have been done very well, and it shows.There is not a really bad actress or actor to be seen across the board, but of course JoBeth Williams, Craig Nelson, Beatrice Straight, Zelda Rubinstein and Heather O'Rourke do make a powerful nucleus of characters. Watch for little gems like when Steve and Diane go to the neighbour to tell him about their first supernatural experience: It's just brillant acting, combined with great timing. There are many such scenes, from comedic to dramatic. I guess one of the highlights is the whole scene when Steve opens for the first time the kids' room door for the parapsychologists. I also had forgotten what a charismatic guy Nelson is: Watch how he can be so cool and hero-like, funny, and vulnerable at the same time.Oh, and one more wafer thin mint: If I'd teach at film school, I'd use this film as a showcase for staging and framing well done. Many scenes are staged as uncut masters - but not like in earlier times when this was normal and cutting had not yet really developed; here it was done deliberately to help the film's mood. The highlight must be when Tangina's plan to get the daughter back gets executed: From the starting close-up on the tennis balls to the finishing close-up on the door knob it's one continuous master of almost three minutes. Watch how people are staged. It's brillant. And this was in 1982 - it is not just a stunt to show off what's possible, it serves the atmosphere and the storytelling.Apart from some shortcomings that have to do with the time it was made in, this is one great demon picture. If you like the genre or if you want to add to your filmmaker's knowledge, watch it.",Poltergeist
254,Mr-JAFO,Terrific movie with a terrifying story behind.,10,16 May 2005,"I can still remember when I first saw this movie (when it came out on TV, because I was too young to see it in its theatrical release), and I felt really impressed by both the special effects (even effective today to be honest) and the awesome and above average work of the children. I still feel especially fascinated by the unsurmountable work of the late Heather O'Rourke (as the sweetest little Carol Anne, the real hard core of the plot, in my modest opinion). When I read that most special effects were added in post-production, and that actually the actors interacted almost always with the typical blue screens and/or (nearly) empty sets, that made my admiration increase even more.On the other hand, thinking about all the story that lies beneath made me feel very sad; there were too many disgraces: Oliver Robins was about to die actually in the infamous clown doll attack, a member of the crew died during the shooting (I'm not too sure of that), Dominique Dunne was murdered a few months after its release, when she was just beginning (tho I guess that a jealous guy has actually no relationship with a movie, even a horror movie), and finally the beautiful ""human doll"" that was Heather O'Rourke also died during the filming of the 3rd shot. Too many tragedies that shouldn't really affect a movie quality and the position of the audiences about that but, who can really maintain it?Now, because of that, I feel sad every time I see the whole movie or just a scene or trailer. However, I can't really help watching it every time it's programmed on a TV channel. It's very hard to repeat such a unique piece like this, especially because there will NEVER be another Carol Anne like Heather O'Rourke. Rest in peace they all and let's feel really blessed for having been able to share that delightful experience at least once in a lifetime.",Poltergeist

If you saw this as a kid in the late 80s/early 90s you were probably as terrified as I was. Unfortunately this movie just hasn't aged well at all. The special effects look juvenile but that's not even my main problem with this movie. Personally, I couldn't stand the bombast, the hammy acting, the melodrama and the god-awful depiction of ""ghosts"" as lonely spirits. Give me a break.It honestly felt more like a Disney live action cartoon than a horror movie. On top of that the story jumped around with little to no explanation. The little girl disappears, the boy is almost swallowed by a tree and no one sees this? Their neighbours must have been deaf and blind to have missed what was going on next door.But it wasn't all bad. Like I said, this movie terrified me when I was younger and I think most kids would still be scared of this movie (though they would probably laugh at the special effects). The clown doll, the ominous tree, the skin peeling scene are all pretty scary (the last one isn't really for kids at all).Check this out if you haven't already, you might like it.

I suppose I should have known that this type of film rarely withstands the test of time, with key aspects like special effects and soundtrack becoming outdated as fast as they are created. But I thought, hey, it's a classic, it's probably still pretty good. Instead, I was extremely disappointed with it's inability to even offer a slight thrill, and it's very simple storyline.

263,jeffplus3,The best acted movie of all time,10,17 November 2000,"Considering that a good portion of the film ""Poltergeist"" was acted out by children, 5-year old Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) and 8-year old Robbie (Oliver Robins) and still say that it was a great acted movie might sound strange.  But it was.  In my opinion, O'Rourke was the best child actress of the 80s, if not in history.  Robins, although he never became largely-known, did a surprisingly fantastic job in ""Poltergeist.""  Also, 18-year old Dana (Dominique Dunne), the parents (JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson), and the psychics were also just as good. (Considering that none of the actors in this movie ever became large stars with the possible exception of Nelson)Also, the rest of the movie was great.  The special F/X were adequate for 1982, the plot was interesting, and ""Poltergeist,"" unlike ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" ""Friday the Thirteenth,"" et cetera, did not rely on blood and gore. In fact, those stupid slasher movies will never have the same singular effect as did ""Poltergeist.""  And, if anything, it was underrated.  Have you ever seen ""Poltergeist"" on any 'top 100' movies or referred to very often? Poltergeist should get the respect it deserves, like ""The Exorcist.""  It should be rereleased into theatres in 2002, the 20-year anniversary.I shall not give away the storyline for those of you who have not seen the movie, but if you haven't, rent it.

273,DVDKing-2,Landmark sci/fi horror film of the 1980s.,10,5 January 1999,"Poltergeist is one of my all time favorite movies.  I never saw it until about three years ago (I was only 6 when it first came out--I wasn't allowed to watch it).  For a movie that is 17 years old, it still packs a punch in the hearts of movie-goers who believe in the supernatural.Although not horrifyingly scary, the movie will give you the creeps for a few days.  The childhood nightmares of Robbie (Oliver Robins) and Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) come to life as the spirits of the dead that are buried under their house (unknowingly, of course) invade the Freeling home and send the family into the world of the supernatural to find Carol Anne when she's abducted by the poltergeists who want her to lead them to ""the light"".The special effects still hold up fairly well to today's standards, mostly with the help of LucasFilm's Industrial Light and Magic.While the two sequels didn't hold up to this one (the second one was decent, the third one sucked), the movie had many different avenues that would lead to the sci-fi/paranormal genre in the 90's. Perhaps while the current trend of remaking hold classics continues, maybe a remake of this movie (my idea would be to add David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as the para-psychologists who investigate the poltergeist disturbances at the Freeling's home).  But then, the Poltergeist movies were probably put to rest for good after all the cast members started dying off (O'Rourke died in 1988 a few weeks after shooting Poltergeist III from a freak bowel obstruction, there were three other deaths of cast members following the first and second movies).Still, if you're wanting a highly productive and intriguing horror movie, rent or buy Poltergeist.

276,MrGrundle,Flawless Horror....Spielberg & Hooper pose a formidable tandem,9,1 June 2006,"Stephen Spielberg is responsible for the most polished, complete productions of my lifetime. He may be second to only Hitchcock in strength of ""viewer manipulation."" It has been said that Hichcock had such a flair for suspense that viewers would overlook/ fail to notice the plot holes (of which there are many) in his work. If there is a knock against Spielberg, it is not plot holes- his scripts are often airtight- but it his lack of grit, of edge, of the substance that made his first few efforts so great. It is true, upon such mighty laurels as he achieved early in his career, anyone might mellow out, become complacent. At times Mr. Spielberg is like a living Hallmark card...Enter Tobe Hooper of Chainsaw fame. If anything, here is a director with the capacity to shock, but perhaps a little lacking in the production department (this guy really put some awful work to screen, much of it later than POLTERGEIST though). Hooper's flair for visceral imagery is really what cements this film as a horror classic, not just a creepy drama. The most unsettling scene may be watching a guy ripping his face apart after he watches his raw steak crawls across the kitchen counter and subsequently erupt. However, POLTERGEIST does excel in the pervasive creepiness it evinces, similar to the tone of the Gothic horror pictures of decades before. Transposing to a sunny California housing development the type of atmosphere usually reserved drafty old castles and Victorian mansions on craggy hillsides. It is not this ambiance that puts the film over the top though, it is the combination of these solid, structured elements handled by the production team paired with penchant for gore that Hooper brings to the table. When you see his name attached to a title, you needn't worry it a ""vanilla"" picture.The cast is exceptional. Williams and Nelson (both in STIR CRAZY, 1980) are wonderful as the loving, ultra-liberal parents of the family. This reviewer has a special place in his heart for the portrait of liberal family life that Hollywood films of the 70's/80's depict (damn, how do those teenagers get so much free time!!). The late Heather O'Rourke is a scene stealer as young Carol Ann, and the other children are serviceable, thus avoiding the 'obnoxious child' pitfall of many other films. The parapsychologists are likable, and Tangina, of course, is one a kind.All in all, this is a stupendous film. Well deserving of it's hallowed status, and lionized by numerous rip offs and homage through the years (most recently, and quite well, on TV's FAMILY GUY). This film had potential for all kinds of cool intellectual horror, but the screenplay fails to extrapolate upon these opportunities. Perhaps it is for the better, for quaint charm and lack of pretension are virtues that age well.9/10* Exceptional. If you have seen this film five times, watch it again!",Poltergeist
277,Shreya_Gupta,Classic Horror.,9,23 June 2020,"As close to perfect as it gets, tense and engaging, great acting and outstanding special effects that still hold up today. Produced by Steven Spielberg and directed by Tobe Hooper. A classic.",Poltergeist
278,greatbritain1989,Why Poltergeist works as a film of many dimensions,10,12 August 2005,"In the seventies, Horror was the new ""genre"" to make a film. Musicals and family films were good fun but many people wanted danger and chills while watching a film that combines terror with fear. A combination most popular with The Texas chain Saw Massacre. The films could be good fun but the plot was as threadbare as the acting. Poltergiest is a film that can appeal to many more people then simple horror movies. It is centred around a family of different ages. It starts pleasantly yet the youngest child Carol Anne talks unnaturally to a dead television screen. Slowly everything blends the music is Oscar worthy and brilliant for the mood. The setting is not isolated as such but the film is in two different worlds. The real life and the an in-between land of people wanting to move away from the light. The screenplay sizzles with quotes such as ""they're here"" ""stay away from the light"" ""you son of a bitch. you left the bodies but you only moved the headstones."" The ""kidnap"" or ""abduction"" of Carol Anne is a parents nightmare and the secondary characters who deal in the ""supernatural"" understand the parents fear creating a blend of subtly and fear is brilliant and terrifying to watch.The build up of tension starts with the ""tv people"" entering their home and making minor changes to their life's (moving the furniture etc.) Soon trees and clowns all personify to effect the family and try and take Carol Anne into the light. The objects of fear are natural fears (both clowns and skeletons are enough to make you scream at the top of your lungs. Normality never quite remains intact in this film but i would class this as the greatest horror movie. The last 15 minutes literally keep you hanging as you watch the Freeling Family desperate to leave the home that they built. It still holds up and is a pleasure to watch. The two sequels followed and they are dreadful to say the least. Only when you have a film complete with engaging characters, acting of calibre, effects to hold your breath, a score of enchantment and the screenplay and story so gripping you know you're in for a good two hours of chilling and brilliant entertainment. The sequels seem to burn away the cast as it was the ""Carol Anne"" collection. Whereas it is about the lives of a family. A family story that is similar yet different to a movie about a child abduction, this is simply more inventive and enigmatic. I would even suggest(possibly) a accolade such as best horror movie/a top 250 position. Well it's definitely very good!",Poltergeist
279,falcolnpunch,They're Here... and they're still just as scary.,8,24 March 2014,"Poltergeist is one of those scarier cult movies that you might stumble upon late at night and end up watching the whole thing. Do it. Because it's one of the better 80s horror's that you'll find.We open on a television set, as the American national anthem plays and we see out the end of the broadcast day. Already it's a weirdly creepy film, and the national anthem hasn't been as haunting as this since Hendrix. Set in a quaint little American neighbourhood, kids play, guys drink beer and watch football. With a hand from Spielberg, the town looks like a carbon copy of E.T., but instead of a misguided little alien (the two films were released within weeks of one another) there's something much worse coming for our suburban American family as their house is taken over by ghosts.With a good cast, including JoBeth Williams in a Sigourney Weaver/Carrie Fisher-esque mother/wife role and Heather O'Rourke as the horror-trope creepy/cute child it's decent stuff. But it is Craig T. Nelson who heads the family and leads the cast as the spot-on average man. He's not particularly smart, or even attractive (joking about his gut in the mirror at one point), but here he is perfect as the hauntings worsen, staying strong and believable as the loving father and husband throughout. With some fantastic effects, Poltergeist harnesses both practical (One scene involving a reflection in a mirror is a Scanners-rewind-as-many- times-as-possible-type moment) and digital effects (many scenes remind us of the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark, another Spielberg classic) to really get the fear in to us and which, for the most part, still look excellent today.The one noticeable downside is the pacing. I'm not usually a stickler for this, but just after the sixty minute mark that the film seems to sag: While more (arguably interesting) characters are introduced, it slows the pace down to a crawl and leaves the film bland and - worst of all - not that scary. It's not really until the last twenty-five or so that the film starts running again, perhaps even saving the whole picture.Poltergeist is one of those kind of movies that you'll watch, then realise that this is the film that you've been quoting all those times without knowing. Paving the way for (much lesser) scary pics, and referenced time and time again in the likes of the earlier Treehouse of Horrors, Poltergeist is like an art-house Paranormal Activity, a true gem which should be viewed (and enjoyed) as many times as possible before the inevitably terrible remake arrives...Twitter: @JonnyJonJon1",Poltergeist
280,music232,Great and enjoyable horror movie!,10,8 November 2007,"OK, i've never really been into horror movies but I decided to give this one a shot. Turns out, I thought it was great! The theme is great, the acting is great. Absolutely no flaws to the movie. Even though the movie was made a little while ago it still is a good horror movie to enjoy today. Most horror movies you'll find today are too much of gore, gruesome, and just plain out nasty like Saw or something like that. Now this movie wasn't to disturbing but it might be a little scary for anyone under the age of 13. It's scary but not gruesome, bloody scary. Just suspenseful on the edge of your seat scary. If you know what I mean. I definitely recommend this to all horror movie lovers. This movie gave me a shock because I thought it wasn't going to be that good. But like I said, it's great! However if you love blood and gore, you won't find much of it in this movie. I heard Poltergeist 2 wasn't that good but i'm going to go rent it anyway! my overall rating: 10/10!",Poltergeist

I think we all know the story of that movie so I will probably not need to share much of it, but that film, for those who have not yet seen it, is quite remarkable for it's time. The special effects are amazing (for that time again), the musical score is divine (composed by Jerry Goldsmith), and the ensemble of the cast is terrific. This ghost story written and produced by Steven Spielberg is directed by Tobe Hooper, who was the director of the original macabre Texas Chainsaw Massacre.A young couple with their three children live peacefully in their suburb house. Unbeknownst to them, not only do they live on top of a cemetery, but only the gravestones have been removed by the building contractors. And one one given night, the spirits of the dead arise, and decide to bring their little five-year-old Carol-Ann with them on the other side to their ghostly dimension.

283,ITTMovieFanatic,Steven Spielberg's ghost story,10,2 June 2004,"""Poltergeist"" is Steven Spielberg's vision of a ghost story, and a great one at that. This is an outstanding movie in every way possible. It has terrific acting, a good story to tell, a nice sense of humor, and astonishing special effects. Plus when I first saw this film, it was pretty scary.""Poltergeist"" tells the story of a suburban family living in a small town in California who's home is abruptly invaded by supernatural forces who are anything but friendly, and proceed to terrorize the entire clan. This is a movie that plays like a roller-coaster ride, and once it gets going it never stops. Tobe Hooper, who directed the original 1974 cult classic ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", was picked by Spielberg to direct ""Poltergeist"". He does a fine job of creating scares and tension, even though rumors were floating around that writer/producer Spielberg actually stepped in and directed some of the film (Spielberg went on to say that Hooper was the director of ""Poltergeist"" even though Spielberg was very much involved with this film from start to finish). To me, it doesn't matter who directed it. This is still an excellent horror movie. Spielberg did a great job as writer/producer, and even if he had directed the whole movie it would still be as good. JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson are wonderful as the head of the Freeling family, with Dominique Dunne, Oliver Robins, and Heather O'Rourke equally good as their kids. The late Oscar-winning actress Beatrice Straight (""Network"") scores points as a parapsycologist investigating the hauntings, and Zelda Rubinstein steals scenes as the mysterious clairvoyant brought in to ""clean house"". The acting is great, but it's the Oscar-nominated special effects that dominate. Wow! This horror film is a must-see!***** (out of five)",Poltergeist
284,modarkajo,Aged so poorly it's almost unwatchable.,2,28 May 2019,"Bringing myself to finish this film proved to be an almost impossible task. Not Because it's disturbing or scary, but because it's one of those films that go all the way to 'too bad' but don't quite reach the 'too bad it's good' mark. The end result is a boring, cheesy, and all around over the top flick.Poltergeist has been called ""one of the best horror films of the decade""; considering that a film like the Thing was also in June, 1982, I find it ridiculous to even call it the best horror film of the month.",Poltergeist
285,brettmcneill,What Happens When All That Scares Children is Put into a Film,9,10 August 2008,"Poltergeist has almost every child nightmare imaginable. The creepy tree outside, the clown, the closet, something under the bed, loud thunder, you name it it's here. And what's Wonderful about it is that each fear is almost universal to every person who watches this movie, making it a much more scary experience.It starts with a normal family. As always. One night, the youngest child (a girl) gets up from her sleep, goes downstairs and starts talking to the TV. Her family sees this and are a little worried but brush it off as a 'child thing'. Then weird things start to go on all over the house. Chairs start pushing themselves out from the table, before stacking themselves on top of it. Then that night during a thunderstorm, one of the kids (the only boy) is grabbed by a tree from his window and then is almost devoured by the tree. While the rest of the family tries to save him, the little girl is (as most of the object in her room) is sucked into her sucked into her closet. The rest of the movie revolves around the family trying the get the young girl back from the house spirits.What makes the movie work most is that fact that is more about the family more than the scariness of the ghosts. The characters are real and believable so you care for them and are scared for them. Whats wrong with the movie is the disjointment of scares. Most of what is truly terrifying about this movie happens during the last ten minutes, of we do get a couple of scares before then (ex. the tree) but for the most part they're at the end. But this aspect lets us learn about the characters more and making the movie better than it would have been.I think if i had seen 'Poltergeist' when i was a kid I still wouldn't have been able to sleep (I know some people who did and still can't) but that only shows how much of a good scary movie this is and it also makes you sad that there aren't much like it anymore.Star Review: ***1/2/****",Poltergeist
286,doddysd,Just gets better every time!,8,31 July 2020,"Just re-watched poltergeist (1982) for 1st time in years, still one of those movies where I am stunned by how good it is, from the fun, goofy kitchen scenes at the start, through the tense battles (for want of a better phrase), to the exile of the appliance at the end. A must watch!!!",Poltergeist
287,erv-7,Maybe it was worth watching in 1982,4,7 August 2009,"When I decided to watch this movie, I hoped to see something similar to John Carpetner's ""The Thing"" or (if I'm lucky) Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"" - in terms of quality, not gore/sfx. Unfortunately ""Poltergeist"" doesn't offer something that good.My main complaint is that characters are poorly portrayed: For example, you could easily remove ""older daughter""(Dana) character from the story and no one would notice - she had nearly no lines, and you can't really tell anything about her - the only thing you'll know that she might have a boyfriend, and that's all. Even her personality is enigma. Same thing goes with other 3 main characters - it almost looks like as if their main purpose was to scream sometimes. Sure, Diana and Steve has some dialogs where pieces of their background pops up, but even after that they doesn't make any sense. There are many people that literally work as an element of backdrop, adding little to the story. Take Steve's boss for example - this guy is supposed to be business shark or something (after all, he is responsible for all problems), but he doesn't even look like a bad guy, because he doesn't have any character portrayed - he drops few occasional remarks, seems to care about having Steve as employee, but that is all. You don't know if he is obsessed with money or something - the movie doesn't tell you.There are also a lot of problems with the story and directing. The story leaves a lot of things unexplained (which isn't bad in some cases), but doesn't provide any clues to make your own explanation. Instead of adding elements of mystery, a lot of things doesn't make any sense. For example, why ghosts attacked only after the storm if the house was standing on the graveyard all that time? Why people that dug up the pool didn't find any corpses? Who is that ""dark presence""? And why ghosts came back after that ""psychic"" character told as that ""this house is clean""? Why did ghosts attack Steve's family instead of going after his boss (who is responsible)? And why did ghosts destroyed the house? And why they didn't kill the family right away instead of playing with chairs? There are a lot of questions like that, and they don't have reasonable explanation.Directing is very inconsistent. Beginning of the movie looks reasonable enough, and even has some good scenes (for example, when Steve sees moving chair - looks great). Once ""paranormal investigators"" arrive, the movie looks pathetic - because characters act unnatural, especially at the moment when that small ""clairvoyant"" character starts explaining what is going on - at that moment there are five people silently listening (looks extremely unnatural), and director's attempt to add atmosphere by playing music in background only ruins scene further. The problem is that the dialog of ""psychic"" character at that point is extremely weak. For example: ""for her it simply is another child. To us ... it is the beast"", at that point we see horrified face of Diane Freeling with tears. For me her reaction doesn't match the words, and looks like overreacting. Because of this the whole explanation scene looks pathetic and might provoke occasional laugh at best, but won't make you feel horror of situation. Also there are certain annoying clichés in that part of the movie (like ""two people kiss in the beam of light before one of them goes into dangerous situation""), and several pitiful attempts to make me feel compassion (I'm not heartless, you just have to try harder and avoid clichés). Last 30 minutes looks like another movie directed by different person. Suddenly we see main heroine in the bath (no nudity, but it still looks pretty strange compared to previous hour of the movie), there are suddenly a lot of corpses in coffins popping out of ground, action, destruction, although movie could have ended several minutes ago (remember that ""psychic"" said ""this house is clean""?). Although those last minutes look much better than the rest of the movie (at least I wasn't bored to death anymore at that point), they look too different, and doesn't match the mood of other parts of the movie. And there is another problem. Movie was released in 1982, so ghosts and moving furniture alone wouldn't work for modern generation that is used to shooting all kind of unholy abominations in computer games (including moving furniture and Lucifer himself). I had only one cheap scare during the whole movie (the second scene with the clown). Right now ""Poltergeist"" will be probably scary for kids, or people that are not into video games or horror movies. Movies like already mentioned ""The Thing"" and ""Hellraiser"" still ""work"" for people not because they have astonishing special effects or gore, but because they offer unusual story, nice world, good mystery, great characters, they are solid and because of this they are still enjoyable. In ""Poltergeist"", however, I did not find anything like that. Maybe it had good special effects back in 1982, but right now it has nothing else to offer. Not for me, at least. Of course, there are many movies that are much worse than ""Poltergeist"", but I'd still prefer to watch something better.",Poltergeist
288,quatzdoesdamage,They're here (What a film),10,29 February 2008,"Poltergeist is a horror picture with a lot of touching moments. It does what many horror film just simply cannot achieve and that is true emotion. Trust me what i say, its not only scary, its touching, funny and dazzling. I grew up watching this film and to me it hasn't aged a bit. No horror film even comes close. It has a beautiful score by Jerry Goldsmith which gives the film a lot of energy. Its beautifully photographed and the visual effects by Industrial Light and Magic are spectacular, but not overdone.I think that was Spielberg's intention, not to make it over the top and to make it as realistic as possible. Spielberg also used a lot of his own childhood fears and put them into the film. The acting is ace from Craig T.Nelson, Jobeth Williams and the late Heather O'Rourke which whom does not have much screen time but is the centre focus of the movie. She was just an angel.With all of the elements of visual effects, sound, acting, directing (Tobe Hooper) and writers (Steven Spielberg) this is one film that achieves everything you want to see in a motion picture. Don't expect the usual gore and typical shocks you see in all modern horror films these days, Poltergeist is not about that. Its the emotion of losing a loved one, a family coming together to fight to bring that loved one back and the hell they have to go through to succeed.This film, even though considered by many to be a classic does not receive the credibility it truly deserves. Poltergeist is a marvelous piece of work. The film received 3 Oscar nominations for visual effects, sound effects editing and original score. These awards which were all won by Spielberg's E.T. I truly believe Goldsmith should have won the Oscar for this film for the score. Nevertheless its one film that cannot be overlooked and will always be classed as one of my favourite films ever made.",Poltergeist

Since this movie has some obvious sci-fi, just go all out and make the dam corpses dance and try to kill people. I would not recommend this to any horror movie seeker, this is more of a little kid horror film, or if you are scared of clowns u might get scared for a second or two......the tag said ""horror"" but is the horror when the guy is peeling off his face? and those hands seemed soo weird doing that, that bothered me because it did not look like the guy was peeling his own face off, it looked to me like someone else was doing it....I dint like this movie so much that I even started getting bothered by little things like that...",Poltergeist
292,Strobenz,Overrated and unimpressive,3,1 May 2015,"My entire review may have a lot to do with the fact that I watched this today (april 2015), which is probably the reason I didn't like the movie, but I really think it was bad; really, really bad. All of this film is just poorly done. I like Steven Spielberg's work and I am a huge fan of horror movies but Poltergeist lacks a lot of interesting things to be considered a classic, or a good horror movie. I feel like it is overrated mainly because it falls under the ""it's from the 80s so it must be rather good"" conventionalization. Firstly, the plot is nonsense even though it could have been great. So an entire neighborhood was built over a huge cemetery, which is why these random ghosts decide to kidnap, for whatever reason, a young girl during a stormy night. Her parents seek help and so a group of ghost-busters goes into the house and, by doing pretty much nothing, save the girl. After that there is a huge ghost manifestation that forces the family to finally leave the house, and that's it. Almost two hours for not too much going on. The effects are good for the time, the acting is solid, camera work is flawless, but there just had to be more to this film! Its tone felt WAY too comic, the horrible music appears to be composed for a drama flick, and there aren't just enough ""scary"" moments. I am not talking about jump-scares (no one cares about them), but about creepy atmospheres and unsettling events! This movie lacked that precisely, and it's the whole point of horror movies! I understand that 70s-80s was the era of slashers and maybe Poltergeist tried to do something different for the time being, but it just didn't get it right.All in all, this film isn't a classic nor the best horror movie ever made nor anything memorable. If you wish to watch it just for the sake of it being popular and famed, go ahead, but have in mind that this isn't 1980 and therefore it won't be even slightly impressive.",Poltergeist

The story is solid, and the performances from the cast are about as good as they can get from a script that can borderline on the cheesy, at points. But in a world where film has evolved from the use of apparent fake heads, robotic tree arms, and ghostly apparitions that would appear in ghostbusters a couple years later, the scare factor of the major physical events leave a little to be desired. However, to the standard of other scary films that came out in the 80's, the story is vastly original and set apart from the popular 80's blood and gore slasher films, and will likely be one that ends up in my rewatch list going forward. It's considered classic for a reason, because it is. Could it have been better? Sure. Best all time? Nope. Then again, I'm not sure anyone is claiming that it is.",Poltergeist

299,jillmillenniumgirllevin,Feeble characters vs. predictable monsters,4,24 February 2017,"Poltergeist: Tobe Hooper; Steven Spielberg. In the clichéd phrase: This is a movie that those who like this kind of thing will like. A movie I wanted to like, but found dated and disappointing. The performances are adequate, although the family are disconnected and loveless; why, for instance, include an elder daughter who gets less than five minutes of screen time? (And given my arithmetic , would have been born when her mother was sixteen.) As so often in Spielberg, a child is endangered; as so often in Spielberg, the child is rescued, in this case, safe in her mother's arms, and covered in red-orange jello. Unsurprisingly, the visual effects now seems a bit quaint,, which is not the movie's fault. What is its fault is its failure to make us care about its characters. For example, when the medium asks which is the authoritative parent, the couple are at a loss. Also objectionable — one hopes then as now — is JoBeth Williams's costume for the final showdown, a not quite crotch length tee shirt and visible white panties — enough, presumably, to satisfy male voyeurs — and in the bathroom is subjected to a kind of supernatural rape. But hey — a mom's gotta do what a mom's gotta do, and she couldn't be expected to know that ""this house is not clean"" before she luxuriates in the tub, thinking all is well. Unless, that is, she'd ever seen a horror movie, which would have alerted her that as a woman with a daughter, she'd constitute the Final Girl. Given the running time, she should also have known that the house is most definitely not clean, and that she'd have to face a final showdown with fierce and enraged ghosts and spirits. I admit to being puzzled by television's being the conduit to their world. Is the message that TV is dangerous? or that children shouldn't be allowed to watch it? or that they should be taken to the movies instead? Presumably not this film, which in my admittedly conservative view is too gruesome for preteens (although they probably love it). If there's a Lubitsch touch, let's propose a Spielberg touch, and assume that had Spielberg had time to direct it, it would have been a different and better film. But if he had, we might not have ET (with its feisty single mother and convincing children), and that we would miss more acutely than this film with its unconvincing family.",Poltergeist
300,Mike Mc,"One of the Few GREAT ""Horror"" Movies",10,1 August 1999,"This film really works.  Most horror films are laughable, boring, or just plain dumb.  Who would think that a PG rated film could have so many great scares?  There aren't any cheap gimmicks to make you jump out of your seat like 2 friends accidentally bumping into each other. Which must be a prerequisite for most Horror films.  A perfect example of the difference between this scarefest and anything else on the video shelves is the typical...""I can't get my car to start all of a sudden when I really need it too!""  This film is smarter then that.  Instead to build up tension, we see a frantic search for his keys in his pockets, to finding the right key on the key chain to open the door as his hands are shaking from being scared sh*tless with what's happening to finding the ignition key as his family is yelling at him to hurry the hell up.Most have seen or at least heard the basic plot scenario of Poltergeist. But what many people who haven't seen it don't realize is that it's a truly great movie and you need not be a ""horror geek"" to appreciate it.  It's emotional, fun, exciting, heartfelt, and yes, even scary.Steven Spielberg knows how to write scary stuff that we all have experienced at least a few times as children. Such as leaving the closet door open, or being spooked by one of your toys that just always kind of freaked you out for some reason as a kid or looking under your bed expecting to find something...alive?  This film is just as effective today as it was in 1982 when it was released in theaters.  Spielberg took over most of the direction while still directing E.T. (Despite Tobe Hooper's directing credit).With Steven Spielberg's ""direction"" and Jerry Goldsmith's best and creepiest score he's ever done , this film is nothing short of a masterpiece of modern cinema.Grade:  A+",Poltergeist
301,Danlanham,This movie is and will remain a classic,5,12 October 2000,"I loved this movie. First of all, there was actually a story to this movie. It wasn't just hack em up and rip out their innards, the way most horror movies are and will continue to be. It was an easily followed story and a VERY frightening one, at that. Just watching this movie could give someone disturbances, so it's not for the faint of heart. To say that it is no longer scary is blasphemous. Turn out the lights and watch it all alone.

So,it started out pretty well then it just went downhill.I mean,a tiny lady with helium voice and a ugly looking clown doll,come on? The story isn't even trustworthy,and nothing scary happens at all.I cant believe how this is considered as a horror movie. One of the worst movies that i have ever seen. The scariest thing about this film is that it got 2 sequels,that just gives me the creeps considered how crappy this movie was. I give it 1/10,but if i were able to give it 0/10 believe me i would.

305,GABaracus,Close Encounters of the Supernatural Kind,10,26 March 2005,"I first saw this film back in 1990 and have loved it ever since. ""Steven Spielberg's"" story about a family haunted by ghosts in their suburban home is a very thought out and chilling tale of the family's fight to save their daughter ""Carol Anne"" who has been taken to the other side by the paranormal forces at work.""Heather O'Rourke"" was the perfect choice to play ""Carol Anne"" and was an absolute sweetheart (she died sadly in 1988). ""JoBeth Williams"" and ""Craig T. Nelson"" play the lead roles of the parents (reprised in ""II"") and are very convincing, you could really relate to the family and believe what was happening to them. I always thought ""Zelda Rubinstein"" was the perfect choice when I first saw her appear as ""Tangina"" and she always managed to keep you hooked with her spooky theories about what is actually happening to young Carol Anne trapped on the other side. Jerry Goldsmith's music score for this film is also just fantastic and really adds dimension to the surroundings, along with a terrific lullaby theme for Carol Anne. He later scored the 1986 sequel which is also highly remembered amongst film score listeners.This picture definitely has its classic moments, the tree, the clown, the closet and cute little Heather O'Rourke saying the classic tag-line, ""They're here!"". If you are into ghost stories? Then you must see the grand daddy of them all, if you have not already managed to. It's right up there with my other three favorite ghost stories ""Lady in White"", ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Others"". Be sure to catch ""Poltergeist II: The Other Side"" as well.... but you would do very well to steer clear of the shockingly bad ""Poltergeist III"".Poltergeist is to this day still one of the best ghost stories around and is a classic tale worthy of its hugely successful impact during the 1980s.",Poltergeist
306,sivertholm,"Great film, but not that scary",8,7 May 2014,"Poltergeist isn't really scary. It really isn't. That may be because I've recently seen ""The Shining"" for the first time, and that film scared the crap out of me. Thats not to say that Poltergeist doesn't have scary scenes, It does. Not gonna spoil anything, but there are some scenes that truly makes this qualify as a ""horror"" movie, but if those scenes wasn't in it, It would be a spooky thriller no doubt. I actually really enjoyed the characters. I wanted them to survive, but I thought some didn't have enough screen time (like the big sister, she's the only one I didn't care for) But where the movie really shines, is in the last 25 minutes. It gets really intense and action packed, and I loved it. It moved the film up a good notch.In conclusion:Pros:+Some truly scary scenes+Fun concept and enjoyable characters+That freaking clown+The last 20 minutes+Good characters...Cons:-...but some of them deserved more screen time-Slow start-Not that scary8/10",Poltergeist
307,embax11,"""They're here!""",7,2 January 2005,"""Poltergeist"" is one of the few horror movies around that not only freaks you out but is a good, well written movie too. Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper really pull this movie off. I must admit I wasn't expecting much out of a PG rated horror film, but I have to say that this film is wonderful. The acting is great; you can tell that they are really truly scared. The special effects look good, unlike those of the sequel ""Poltergeist 2"", where the effects seemed somewhat cheap. I was sort of grossed out by a few of the scenes, but ""Poltergeist"" is not overly violent or gory. ""Poltergeist"" is one of my personal favorites, and it makes an effective horror movie with some good shocks and surprises. I would recommend it to everyone looking for a good horror flick that isn't filled with pounds of blood and gore. ""Poltergeist"" rocks! A+",Poltergeist

Sort of like the Conjuring, but still scary.The family searches for the girl and would probably leave, but there daughter is still missing.

309,thegreenbiker,Ghosts are real,9,10 July 2005,"When one of my friends first told me about this 1982 ""Scary"" movie i really didn't know what to think. Movies with ghost usually are not very scary because of that fact that nowadays all they do is jump out at you and startle you once and you can never see it again because you know its coming. But with Poltergeist i mean Jesus. That is some scary ish. Even though Spielberg didn't directly direct this movie i feel that his expertize and style of filming did not go un-used. I think the cinematography in this movie is amazing. The minor characters just add to the already great cast. The fact that you never actually ""see"" the ghosts makes it all the better.

It was then we realized that seeing that movie at ages 8 and 5 had really done ""traumatized"" us. I rented it the other day and my daughter (11) watched it with me. She too enjoyed the scare.I still closed my eyes during the bathroom scene and I still jumped at the clown scene. It's not as intense as when I was younger, but it still produced that freaky feeling that you want when you watch a scary movie.If you're into gore, then this movie isn't for you.

313,mbellovin,Great psychodrama,9,8 February 2009,"I am most impressed by Steven Spielberg when he arranges his films to serve his neuroses. Now, I haven't attended to Mr. Spielberg on the psychiatrist's couch, but we know the recurring elements: single moms, preteen boys, orphans, nuclear families under threat, the American dream, California suburbs. I just watched Poltergeist after not seeing it for a bunch of years (I was twelve when it came out) and I really enjoyed the depiction of the parents, their embrace/rejection of their dream home, their hippie pothead moments, the way the mother is wearing white when she goes into the closet to rescue her little girl and get reborn from a sac of amniotic fluid in a bathtub, awoken by her husband... as for the horror elements, it's not very scary, more of a funhouse ride. That's okay with me. I just kept shouting at the movie that the nuclear family is under threat from nasty ghosts, corpses and giant vaginas, and that it must protect itself at all costs. Great fun. Although given the awful things that happened to some of the film's cast and crew, perhaps I shouldn't be saying that.",Poltergeist

This was directed by Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and starred Craig T. Nelson (The Incredibles), JoBeth Williams (The Big Chill), and Heather O'Rourke (Poltergeist 1, 2, & 3). The story is simple but is very well executed in this classic.There is almost nothing that is wrong about this movie. The performances are great, all of them. It's very suspenseful and one particular scene (involving a clown doll) made me jump out of my seat. Steven Spielberg produced this and wrote it.The special effects are great even by todays standards so back then, they must have been amazing.

Thats more than can be said about 95% of horrors they make now-a-days. This movie deserves higher than a 7.6 , but people are stupid. For example , some people actually like remakes more than the originals. i.e Texas chainsaw massacre, amityville horror (bad example because they both suck - and its all based on a hoax) , house of wax etc etc etc. Hollywood has no more ideas these days , its all special effects , terrible dialogue and repetitive scenarios.

Clearly an influential film by Chainsaw director Tobe Hooper, Poltergeist reached for, and achieved, everything that the earlier Amityville Horror failed to be; namely, scary, credible, and well acted.Poltergeist, in a nutshell, is a story of suburban California family that discovers the darker side of the American Dream when their youngest daughter, Carol Ann, makes contact with evil spirits through the family television set. ""They're here"", never fails to send chills down my spine as I recall seeing this film for the first time as a teenager.Perhaps 10 to 15 more years will finally lend the credibility to this film to finally place it among the classics in modern horror cinema.",Poltergeist

319,soundtrackbuff,"an imaginative, creative, smart film.",10,8 May 2006,"Poltergeist is one of my all time favorite horror/thriller movies of all time. The directing is great along with the cast and the acting. Compared to the special effects of this age, poltergeist's are not that great, but they were top of the line back then. This movie didn't make me jump at any scenes, but the whole idea of it was scary. Actually, there was one scene that made me jump, and it was the clown scene. Its classic. For some reason, the horror movies of this age lack the true horror elements like the ones fifty or so years ago. Every horror movie now is so freaking typical and almost boring at times. This is not the case for Poltergeist. Its extremely original and there is never a dull moment in the movie. Its fast paced and scary if you really think about the concept. What i think is scary about the movie is the concept of the unknown. Unlike slasher movies where you actually see the killer, in Poltergeist things are confusing and it has no boundaries in what it does. It can make a tree attack, chairs stack, a clown attack, a man rip off his face, it can even make a closet try to suck up two kids! With a regular slasher movie, the killer cant do those kind of things. They are very limited in how they kill their victims.Overall, I would highly advise you to see Poltergeist. Its original, imaginative and scary. If your a true horror fan, you should definitely see it. I give it 9/10 A great movie. P.S, sorry for any misspelled words.",Poltergeist

Would have been great to see the deleted scenes and a documentary on the film.The film relates to people as the family are the everyday usual family. There are quite a lot of scary moments.

It feels like more of a sci-fi than a scary movie. Pass on this if you like a truly spine-chilling scary movie.The actual plot of the movie makes sense once you get to the end, but the execution just does not. While it was the 80s, the special effects are still a little way over the top and more comical then building to the ""fear factor"".

323,Robskit6,A magic carpet ride for the senses,10,22 August 2013,"Some films really take you on a ghost train ride and this film does it with style. This is obviously the main reason for watching it. The other reason for watching is that it so much more than just a ghost train ride. This film is actually beautiful. From Jerry Goldsmiths wonderful score, I.L.M's SFX still looking good after thirty years and still better than some things out now. Mathew F Leonetti's photography and last but not least, the cast; especially JoBeth Williams, Craig T Nelson and Beatrice Straight. These actors prove themselves as dramatists and make us believe what we see.In my humble opinion they all do a great job of bringing the drama. For me, these are the reasons to watch this film again and again. This film brings to life the horror comic book story's I loved as a kid like Tales from the Grave and The Nightcomers. Unlike a lot of tales of the supernatural on film lately,it is not spending an hour watching a door open slightly due to perhaps an unseen presence or maybe subsidence. This is seeing the door being ripped off its hinges by a force that has dropped the veil and allowed us to glimpse the howling twisted monster that awaits us on the other side and all in Metrocolor. Rather than a remote old mansion in an over gloomy setting, we are placed within the sun-kissed California hills, in a valley under a cobalt blue sky with an ordinary family whose youngest child Carol Anne becomes the conduit for the souls of the dead propelled by a terrible evil enabling them to escape the world of the dead and break through roaring, laughing and screaming into the world of the living with CarolAnne exclaiming Their heeeeeere!!!. Craig T Nelson is just superb as Steven Freeling being the man-in-the-sketch and JoBeth Williams as the enthusiastic mother and brave matriarch is just fantastic. The whole movie has a Steven King quality and style to it with the slow build reaching to a draw dropping finale.All of it laced with humor and some scenes played for laughs which are very funny. I do believe that this is a classic film and a must see. For me,the film delivered everything I ever wanted from a story of the supernatural.If you haven't seen it yet, then get it! Then get the beers in,the chips n dips, turn down the lights and enjoy. Rob H",Poltergeist

All the criticism surrounding the storyline as how ridiculous and unbelievable it is. Well it's a ghost story, although i've always felt it was closer to a modern day fable in which the parents have to prove their love for their daughter going so far as to having to go to another dimension to retrieve her (well, the mother does that). People keep saying that the ghosts are in the TV and that Carol Anne was sucked into the TV, for Christ's sake, have these people actually watched the film? Another thing is that some critics complain that after the film was over they still didn't get what the spirits wanted and why they targeted the little girl. What about the sequence between Steve Freeling and his boss and the monologue delivered by Tangina where she EXPLAINS what is going on?! Sure, the film is not perfect, there's that infamous edit jump, too much cutesy with the burial of the bird and the lack of complaint from the neighbours about the thundering, thumping, screaming sounds that go on in the house, but it is a fable people! The acting is great, we really care about the characters, and because of some great dramatic sequences with Diane Freeling (brilliantly portrayed by JoBeth Williams)we realize that (SURPRISE!) the film isn't so much about the ghosts and (iconic) special effects, as it is about the drama of parents thrown into a supernatural situation they never saw coming and having to bring their daughter, that they hear THROUGH the TV (she's NOT IN the TV), back into our world. The action sequences are greatly imaginative and entertaining, Jerry Goldsmith's score is his best, being horrific, tense, spectral, childlike and such a masterpiece.

I recall thinking then that some of the f/x were cool (a few of them still are, but overall they've aged badly) but that it ultimately wasn't really scary, partly because of what felt like a sadly uncertain tone -- one that had a lot of wimpiness to it.The scuttlebutt at the time was (and still is? no idea) that Tobe Hooper got sat on by Steven Spielberg -- that the movie would've been utterly grisly and terrifying had S. S. not stopped the proceedings and insisted on a more family-friendly production. I've no idea whether there is any truth to this, BUT the final product is exactly what I'd have expected if it WAS true.There is a cloying spine of utter sentimental sap running through this movie. You can hear it in the score when those kids' voices start lullabying la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-laaa laaa laaa ... when the Beatrice Straight parapsychologist character starts opining about the we're-not-going-to-call-it-Judaeo-Christian Light that Carole Ann is either supposed to be running toward or away from ... when Jo Beth Williams' Diane Freeling starts weeping tears of joy because the missing kiddo has just run straight ""through her SOUL.""Awww. Yeah.And this sappiness ensures by its cowardly H-wood-approved presence, that it will all be okay in the end -- that no one will be hurt and we'll all even learn An Important Lesson and the family will become closer, if only because they'll be watching less TV. Not much bad can happen, and stay bad, because we'll all be swallowed by that friendly Light after we die. Fun in a popcorn-munching way? Sure. But really, truly scary? Nope.",Poltergeist

Heck, it wasnt even the best horror flick of 1982, that was 'The Thing'.Even for a scary movie, Poltergeist is rediculous. Some reasons include:*Why did the spirits choose that time and specific house to haunt/possess/etc?*How is it possible the dad doesnt know about the graves already?*No matter how scared the kids get of what's outside the window, nobody thinks to close the drapes?!*Days (maybe WEEKS) after Carol Ann goes missing, the first people they call for help are the local paranormal society, not the police or relatives or friends or neighbors?*How do NONE of the neighbors not notice whats going on?*How could Carol Ann survive that long in the spirit world?*Instead of CPR, they put Mom and Daughter in a bath?*And then the classic: why put the kids back in the SAME ROOM???And the adult characters? Mom and dad are cowardly, childish morons for at least 47 reasons. The Paranormal crew is pointless and a lot of time is wasted as they repeat everything we already know. They just whisper a lot, raid the fridge and film the ghosts. I love when they finally film the ghosts and we have to watch them watch the video of the ghosts they saw literally moments before. Such a waste of time. And the little lady that apparently knows how spirits think, feel and act? Okey Dokey.The special effects were top notch for 1982 and it's a creative spin on the haunted house story.But Poltergeist isnt an all time great Horror movie, It's a scary movie thats safe to watch with the whole family.

It is a bit dated now, however I think everyone can still connect with it in some way. Although TV's no longer turn to ""snow"" we can all still respect storms.

The acting is bad and cheesy, the effects are good, but inconsistent, and I think it was supposed to be a depiction of the American way of life during Reaganism but the story drags for so long that the political commentary gets lost along the way.I struggled to finish the movie and I was extremely let down when I did. It did not make sense how this could've garnered horror classic status. Then I learned this was ""Steven Spielberg's ghost story"" and everything made sense. It is actually rumored that he did in fact direct the movie, but is not credited as such due to contractual obligations because he was directing E.T. and it all fell into place. Poltergeist is a ""horror"" story fabricated by Spielberg for the masses. Poltergeist is closer in tone and genre to E.T. than it is to The Exorcist or The Omen, two great horror pieces that still stand the test of time and hold their place as horror classics.If you're a die-hard horror fan wanting to catch up on your horror classics list, you better skip this one.",Poltergeist

It is a ghost, which announces its presence with loud noises and the creation of disorder. But the poltergeists in this movie go far beyond that. Directed by Tobe Hooper and produced by Steven Speilberg, ""Poltergeist"" is (in my opinion) one of the scariest movies of all time. The plotline is very original (written by Speilberg), on how nasty ghosts invade a family home, kidnap the 5-year-old daughter and bring her to the other side, and her parents must battle the ghosts to get her back. Although filmed in 1982, the special effects in ""Poltergeist"" are very astounding and are done very well (my favorite being the beast esophagus, which manifests grusomely in the children's bedroom closet). Some people who have seen the movie still have nightmares about it two decades later, esspecially the incidents with the malevolent clown doll, and the swimming pool.

From a plastic tree attacking a boy and then objects floating around the room It got so bad.One of the worst films I have ever seen.

I was pretty let down. The plot is barely being held together by anything. The movie suggests causes for the events in the house left and right and quickly discards them. The actual events started off being subtle, but then we are quickly thrown head first into an array of crazy events that feel like they were there to cover up the many plot holes and show off ILM's command of the effects. The acting is mediocre and the effects, while impressive, feel out of place. I personally did not find the movie to be scary at all. So, why is it that everyone loves it so much? Maybe we just feel like we have to because its a ""classic"". I know that initially after the credits started rolling, I thought to myself, ""did I miss something?

Clearly an influential film by Chainsaw director Tobe Hooper, Poltergeist reached for, and achieved, everything that the earlier Amityville Horror failed to be; namely, scary, credible, and well acted.Poltergeist, in a nutshell, is a story of suburban California family that discovers the darker side of the American Dream when their youngest daughter, Carol Ann, makes contact with evil spirits through the family television set. ""They're here"", never fails to send chills down my spine as I recall seeing this film for the first time as a teenager.Perhaps 10 to 15 more years will finally lend the credibility to this film to finally place it among the classics in modern horror cinema.",Poltergeist
347,layouth2015,Poltergeist (1982),8,1 October 2012,"The movie poltergeist is a movie about a family living in a nice house which is built over a cemetery. It's a horror movie with some imagination with the inclusion of the dead and a house with spirits. Unlike most horror movies, this movie has lots of bright colors and family togetherness. It is a horror movie without gory scenes.The definition of ""Poltergeist"" is a ghost or spirit which makes noises and in this movie, the spirits of the dead in the house were making noises. We get straight into action with a TV left on and the little girl talks with it. Although we go through an introduction after that scene, we know that the TV will play a big part throughout. It's further symbolized by the father removing the TV from the motel room. The TV is symbolic as it starts the trouble in the house. The TV keeps getting focused on – firstly the channel with no images then the men watching football. However, the interesting part is that the channel with no images is the origin of the spirits. The author uses that as if it was an area where those spirits could settle. Since the family members left the TV on, it was an invitation for those spirits to come into the house. An anthem is very symbolic but I think that it is used to symbolize danger. Grown-ups pay their respects to the anthem but here it is a call to the little girl that the ""TV people"" are coming.The two young kids notice the danger. Carol-Ann is the lead to the strange actions behind the TV then Robbie declares his fear for the tree which eventually attacks him. The children represent the force behind both the family's fight against the spirits as well as they are the start of the troubles. The little girl however is the innocent hero. Despite her lack of knowledge, everything revolves around her. She talks to the TV, always wants the closet light left on, then she gets sucked into the closet. When she gets rescued, she does not remember anything. This was taking away from the cliché of horror movies where the heroes are the older ones.There aren't powerful, sinister sounds in the movie. There's a mix of soft sinister sounds and peaceful sounds. However, there is a major use of shadows. We were shown the shadow of the door knob when they were finally about to open the door to get the girl. The shadows were a different way to create shadiness. Also, the lightning creates shadows. Normally, the storms signify an attack from someone and you will have the girl running from the danger. Instead, the characters embrace the effect of the storms and Robbie is even told to count the time between the roars of the thunder. The roars seem to hear him count and keep going a second later than the last one. Finally, to create more fear, they used the little girl screaming in the background. This is not the ideal method but it is disturbing when there is a little girl in the back screaming for her mother. This gets the viewers emotionally involved because they feel sorry for the helpless/defenseless girl. As mentioned, the youngest seem to be the main characters and since it is unusual for children to be attacked and to be directly involved with the horror, it gets us emotionally involved in the movie and we feel sorry and worried for the kids.Despite the mother being able to communicate with her daughter at night and the storms only taking place at night, there is a lot of white in the movie. The closet light is white, the ghosts show up in white when they leave the room, they attach themselves to the white walls. The bright color is a sign of innocence. It shows the little girls' innocence in the movie as she has no idea what is happening. I believe that the family is extremely innocent and clueless about the house being built over a cemetery. However, the man who knew about the cemetery being moved is shown only twice and he is not dressed in any bright colors. The ladies who come and try to help out with rescuing Carol-Ann are not dressed in white either.The movie is very systematic and well built. Firstly there is the TV and the strange movements of the furniture in the house. Then the girl disappears. When we are all trying to figure out why these things are happening to the house we find out that it was built over a cemetery. Towards the end when we think that Carol-Ann has been rescued and nothing else could go wrong, the house ends up vanishing. Everything built from one thing to another so there were smooth transitions. The movie started off with normal talking then when the spirits settle in, they started whispering to communicate. When the daughter is about to get saved, the characters are yelling at the top of their voices to communicate between each other. In the end it gets back to normal talking. This is different because with the whispers, anything sudden could happen but when they are yelling to communicate then they are almost ready for the final showdown and ready for battle.Normally, you would expect the mother to be worried over her lost child but instead she is relaxed and it's the father suffering the most from losing his daughter. Bravery is a theme of the movie. They stick together to pull through the tough times. Towards the end, the father is not at home and they suffer one more attack, the mother grabs Robbie who grabs Carol Ann, this chain shows the family strength.",Poltergeist

Special effects cannot take the place of a good script, editing and cinematography.Spielberg has not always knocked it out of the park as he did with ""Jaws"". Even ""Titanic"", which was entertaining, disappointed me with its lack of historical depiction. Spielberg made a love story out of an event that was so worthwhile retelling in a minute by minute recounting of actual events. Meh.As for Poltergeist...it was produced in an era that gave us ""The Exorcist"" which every Hollywood producer and director was attempting to outdo at the time, but this one never accomplished that.

353,djsjetsteve,"They're Here """,8,7 March 2009,"1982's Poltergeist is a true horror classic. I really thought the cinematography in the film was excellent and the casting seemed to fit the movie perfect. The controversy surrounding the film with the real life death's of main characters'( Heather O' Rourke, Dominique Dunn ) has added a mythical appeal to the movie. I did at times feel the movie start to drag but it seemed to always pick back up quickly. You cant help but realize that your watching a classic when you hear O Rourke's famous line ""They're Here"". I believe the movies from the late 70's and early 80's can never be duplicated. You cant get a good horror flick on HD or modern camera practices, it lacks the shadows and the grainy look that is a hallmark of those films. Finally I would say that O'Rourke stole the show in a film that had the likes of future star to be Craig T Nelson. You could imagine the parents being replaced while the show could not have been what it was without the performance of Heather O' Rourke. I give this movie a 4 1/2 out of 5.

354,lucasbohr,Review of Poltergeist (1982),8,6 November 2019,"Steven Spielberg, alongside his team of a hardworking cast and crew were able to display true terror and fear in their masterpiece of a film. It is this team that was able to collaborate to make something truly special, Poltergeist. The movie starts by presenting the Freeling family to the audience by using the family dog as a way to show each of the five family members, this being a great and easy means of transitioning. The dog walks up and down the house, but he ends up waking everyone up in the middle of the night. The house that the family lives in was built on top of ancient Indian burial grounds, but they did not know this at first. After a few traumatizing visits by the ghosts of these grounds, the Freeling's soon realize that the suburban house was not safe at all, only for their five-year-old daughter Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) to become trapped in the spirit world. Producer Steven Spielberg is able to bring his story to life with the help of brilliant transitions and special effects, while unfolding his story with a combination of the dialogue of as well as actions, and is mainly told in the eyes of the Freeling family, with the exception of the ""cleaners."" The horror of not having their daughter (for the time being) that the parents (Steve and Diane Freeling, (Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams) have to suffer along with feeling servile could make anyone go mad, not to mention the sheer amount of pure fear Robbie Freeling (the only son of Steve and Diane, Oliver Robins) and Dana Freeling (Steve and Diane's eldest daughter, Dominique Dunne) have to deal with throughout their stay in the house, and in the movie's entirety, each actor showing true humanity and their character's more than
2 / 3
realistic horror. Dominique Dunne, though being a great actor, her character was not needed. As mentioned earlier, the film's conflicts are heavily displayed by the incredible special effects, even compared to now (being that the movie was made in 1982) with the head of this department being Jeff Jarvis. For example, when Marty (Martin Casella), one of the cleaners go to get something to eat from the house's fridge, you can see the raw steak he takes out bubbling and bleeding out right in front of him. Marty splashed his face with water after running to the bathroom When doing so, the lights in the bathroom get so hot that the special effects make it so all of his skin was melting off, only for Marty to snap out of his hallucination.
Spielberg sets up Poltergeist by setting up the Freeling family in a comfortable house in a nice, suburban neighborhood, which makes the viewer think ""how could this go wrong"" and making it more relatable. But once nighttime approaches, a storm appears, and the music and sound effects start becoming more ominous, the atmosphere becomes darker. The choice of adding dark classical music with a volume that goes along with the actions of the characters is brilliant and adds suspense and surprise.
Poltergeist ends on a high note, having the whole neighborhood become rubble, as the Freeling family (including Carol Anne) drives away to the Holiday Inn, free from the spirits. Once they arrive at the hotel, Spielberg adds some humor by having Steve, after a long pause, put the television that Carol Anne used to speak to, outside their room, just to make sure that nothing bad is going to happen. In conclusion, Poltergeist is a beautiful rendition of your normal ghost tale and deserves plaudits even to this day, because so many other stories have been made because of it.",Poltergeist

If the movie would have ended from the first ending i would of gave this movie a 7 but the just had to put something bad in there again. But its a better movie than some stupid horror movies today.

356,cuatesluken,A Work of Art....MASTERPIECE,10,6 April 2001,"This is one of the greatest movies ive ever seen. Everything about it is perfection. A masterpiece must, first of all, have a masterpiece of a score, and Jerry Goldsmith has done it. The special effects( by George Lucas' ILM) are perfect, but are no way the best part of this epic. The acting is at its best at all times(no big names then, just super talent).The Story(by steven Speilburg) is extremely original, imaginative, and extremely well done. Although everyone says how scary this movie is(which it is, i guess, but its a million times more than a ""ghost story"" or ""horror movie""), but the great part of this movie is how flawlessly made and presented it is. Be prepared to be entertained, scared, and ENTERTAINED AGAIN!!!One of the greatest feats of this movie is the Sound Effects. If u don't believe me, just crank up the volume when the skeletons come out of the water in the pool scene....AWESOME. This film is Fun as hell and will have u glued to your seat the entire time. Plus, when u think the movie is over and ur about to give it a 3 and a half star rating, it takes you on an unforgettable **** journey of perfection the rest of the way. And to add genius to greatness, the final scene (i will not give it away) as the camera pans out and the great theme starts playing leaves u with a ""can a movie really be this perfect"" feeling. If u havent seen it, its probably Steven's best, at least technically. this is a MUST SEE-MUST SEE-MUST SEE-MUST SEE type of film. i have no more words to praise it.

359,Chucky_Smith,Vastly Overrated,5,3 January 2006,"Poltergeist is a tremendously overrated movie. I watched it again the other day for the first time in 20 years and had the exact same reaction as the first time. The plot simply doesn't hold together.There are too many elements introduced in the story, or hinted at, and many of them are never explained properly or ""paid off"" later. It's classic mediocre scriptwriting. Steven Spielberg is a terrific director, but a middling writer. He wrote this story, about some of his childhood fears and recollections, and the movie plays like a disjointed series of set pieces, which are only partially related by a poorly thought-out framing story.First it's about unsettled ghosts. Then it's hinted in one scene that Satan is involved somehow. This, and how it relates to the ghosts, is never explained. Then corpses start breaking through the ground. So why now, some 6-7 years after the house was built over the graves? Where have all these spirits been for 7 years?? Again, this is never explained. And why only in this one house, if the whole subdivision was built over the graves? And what's the deal with the tree that grabs the son and tries to devour him? Can anyone tell me what the hell this has to do with the rest of the story as it plays out, because I sure can't! Just another action set piece.And in classic bad script fashion, the characters suddenly start acting clueless in order to further the action. After all that's just happened, the family decides to spend one more night in the house and the mother lets her children sleep in the same room which was the center of all the evil?? OH, PLEASE! Even Tobe Hooper's direction is slow and plodding, and many of the scenes just don't pack the wallop they should. IMDb states that Spielberg held Hooper back, so this may not have been his fault, but it's still a problem with this movie.I'm sorry if these complaints seem nit-picky, but I don't think they are. Any good movie, including a good horror one, needs to be coherent and have things make sense and be understandable. Poltergeist simply has too many irons in the fire and it comes off as disjointed and unsatisfying.",Poltergeist

A few early scenes are startling, and I was hoping for greatness.Unfortunately, it quickly falls apart. Honestly, it feels like several different movies were shot, and the scenes pieced together to make Poltergeist. It's so...random....both in terms of plot elements and the characters' reactions to them. First it's just spooky presences, then a tree comes to life (what?). Then there's a vortex in the closet leading to where some creature lives. Then someone tears apart his own face for no real reason (an exercise in special effects?), but was it imagined or real? Then there are zombies. There's no driving logic. It's simply ""anything goes.""The ending especially feels tacked on. There's closure, in that the house has been freed of spirits.

I also noticed a lot of cheesy effects and some pretty poor acting to be honest but that all that being said, i think Poltergeist was always meant to be sort of a kid's horror film,and a great one at that.Although personally my favourite film directed by Tobe Hooper is the cult classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Poltergeist is firmly ranked in second.Overall Poltergeist is a movie definitely worth watching. If you can overlook a few cheesy effects with a tad bit of bad acting here and there then Poltergeist is a must see. Much to love, little to hate.7 out of 10Mr. Massacre",Poltergeist
367,dgibson_24740,Poltergeist is the best movie ever!,10,20 December 2004,"I love this movie! ever since i was a young kid i have liked it. when i was young i would watch it over and over. now that i am older and have taken some film classes in college i have come to respect different aspects of the film such as the great special effects, the great acting (carolanne was adorable), and its good plot line which was creepy and at times humorous. i always thought the idea of being trapped in another dimension with ghosts would be horrible. especially if you were that little.one of my favorite scenes is when carolannes mother hears her voice in the TV, then carolanne's ""spirit"" moves through her. i liked all the characters in the movie, but one of my favorites is tangina. she added a flair to the film and she also gave it some humor as well.",Poltergeist
368,jmars409-121-290297,Similar to Twilight Zone Episode,10,6 January 2012,"This is a classic movie. One thing I want to point out is that the disappearance of the little girl into another dimension was the premise of a classic Twilight Zone episode aired in 1962 entitled ""Little Girl Lost"". If you come across it in reruns, check it out. Many of JoBeth Williams' reactions are seemingly taken from this Twilight Zone episode about a little girl who disappears into another dimension during the night. Poltergeist has many more elements to it( the poltergeist, of course, the monster, the tree outside, and the appearance of the Indian burial ground), but the initial disappearance of the little girl is straight from this Twilight Zone episode.",Poltergeist
369,diogof1978,A great entertaining movie,10,16 December 2011,"I obsessed with this film when I was a kid. I didn't own a VCR and all I knew was the video box cover which fascinated me with its eerie photo and strange word that I didn't know what meant back then but felt it was creepy. So I finally watched it as a teenager and absolutely loved it! I've seen it many times and although it has some flaws, it is still a film filled with very creative and imaginative sequences that will entertain you like nothing else. The acting is phenomenal, the story is unique, the special effects are still amazing and the soundtrack is heaven! I don't see it as much of a horror film, but a very intense fairy tale where the parents have to do go to incredible lengths to get their daughter back. Brilliant film!",Poltergeist
370,louisereimer,It's a roller-coaster...,9,26 September 2014,"I can't think of a movie for which the metaphor could more aptly be a giant ""scary"" roller-coaster.It's never THAT scary. It's not disturbing. It won't ""haunt"" you (sorry!) for hours after you watch it like some -truly terrifying- films will, and some of it is, frankly, way over the top (even perhaps inordinately ridiculous) -but you won't care. You'll be enjoying the ride too much! It's nearly two hours of wonderful, jolting, exciting, 'frightening' fun... and at the end, you're pretty much left with a smile on your face -albeit a 'wind-blown', awkward and slightly relieved one.This film's a blast.If you've not yet seen it, do so.",Poltergeist
371,alstew2000-569-177535,Absolutely chilling,10,18 July 2019,"Poltergeist drags you into this family's horror, chills you to the bone and spits you out covered in pink goo",Poltergeist
372,dbodine01,The ultimate in scary realism,9,1 April 2015,"You could say that I have an unhealthy fascination with Poltergeist. I saw it when I was very young and it has stuck with me throughout the years. It was my first introduction to Steven Spielberg, along with E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial that same year. This movie reminds me of all the things I loved about my childhood...the location being Southern California were I grew up, the suburban neighborhoods...the house could very easily have been the one I grew up in. So it does have a special place in my memory. But nostalgia aside, how does this movie stack up to more modern horror films? Some would say that it has lost it's horror appeal due to it being dated, but I think that it has not lost any of its appeal. In fact, for those of my generation, it may be more pertinent then we know. This movie hits home, literally, in that a husband and wife are doing everything they can to keep their family and home intact despite being overwhelmed by outside forces they can't control. When we were children, this movie would have been a good scary movie, but as adults with children of our own now, it reminds us that our family bonds can be fragile and strong at the same time. It shows us that love for your family can be your greatest strength and that we shouldn't let anything, natural or supernatural, get in the way of that. This story is very much film-making at it's best. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it, or to those who may have seen it long ago and need to be reminded what a good horror story really is.",Poltergeist

374,johnnydjc,I feel sorry for the younger generation...,10,17 March 2018,"Aaah the quirks and backlash from much younger people bashing good entertainment without any real perception of what real horror is. I love seeing how so many people are quick to rate a movie with the line, ""Go see The Ring instead""..LMAO. You've gotta be kidding me. That's how you know they're young and call that horror. You see, true horror hits close to home and that's exactly what this film does. Brilliant and plausible story (It could happen to anyone owning a home) and to this very day...people are still rattled about the untimely deaths that occurred during the making of this film. Yes. Real people died. Coincidence? Nobody knows. Were there real poltergeists that actually contributed to their deaths? Why don't we let our one sided minds be the judge of that. This film was terrifying back then and it's certainly held up over the years to be a one of a kind, pulse pounding, dark and original ghost story. Keep in mind folks, that movies like these were the inspiration for THE NEXT generation to RIP OFF! The newer generation has run out of gas, so naturally in good old Hollywood fashion...they steal material from older, classic movies such as Poltergeist. I have respect for the people that love what Spielberg has done here. For the others who think The Ring, Blair Witch Project, Annabelle, The Boy, The Grudge, and Insidious are true horror...I weep for your generation. This movie is original to the core, visually stunning, realistically acted (hard to find nowadays) and a masterpiece of horror to cherish for generations to come. Notice how I didn't put any spoilers in here like the other ones did either. Kids. As for the PG rating goes, yeah this in a R rated film nowadays. Too many parents complaining that it's too scary for kids, so they decided to come down hard on horror films. Even though we all know pre-teens and younger children have access to every R rated film and lord knows what else these days since every kid in America has a cellphone. Duh. You won't be disappointed with this film. Hands down terrifying, especially if you live in California.",Poltergeist
375,sharadbbhat,overrated,4,23 September 2018,Don't know why it's considered as a classic .nothing scarier also very very boring.,Poltergeist
376,writetoappleseed,Vastly overrated,3,9 December 2005,"This film is not without merits - but it certainly is no classic. It's aged badly, the characterisation is poor, and there are at least a dozen things about it that really grate, e.g.; the fact that the whole film is an excuse to use special effects; the fact that everyone blindly accepts the existence of ghosts and attributes any strange happenings to them without considering any other explanation; the cheesy horror clichés; the annoyingly sickly suburban family; the odd moral of the tale (treat those corpses with respect or else!); the American-dream-gone-wrong theme which doesn't quite work (given the fact that this is a 10 on the daft scale); and, last but not least, the fact that one of the paranormal investigators is scared half to death by the crawling meat scene; and yet ten minutes ago, he was happily documenting dozens of levitating objects flying around a bedroom.That said, the special effects are quite good for the time, and the acting does it's best with such a daft story. At this point, you may be thinking; ""this guy just doesn't like the genre"". Not true; but in my opinion, effective, truly scary horror is created by the maxim ""less is more"" - not the more is more approach that Spielberg has employed successfully in other films, and less well here. A disappointment; go watch Ring instead for truly creepy television antics.One last thing; it's appalling this got a PG in the US. One particularly disgusting scene involving peeling flesh is clearly unsuitable for kids, and I can imagine this giving young children nightmares, as hokey as it is. I suggest your kids should be at least twelve before you watch this with them.",Poltergeist
377,flashpenguin86,Made me afraid to enter a kitchen after dark,9,21 February 2007,"I remember seeing this movie premiered on HBO in June 1983, I was almost 14, and it scared the living beJesus out of me. A pivotal scene in the movie left a lasting impression so that 24 years later, if I hear a noise in the kitchen, I turn the light on first. The special effects were the talk of the town in 83. Now they were so cheesy. Could you imagine the film if it was made with today's technology? Still, it has managed to with stand the test of time, not many horror films can claim that one.The one thing that gets on my nerve is the talk of a ""curse"". I did some research on another movie classic, GWTW, and this is what I found:Poltergeist I (1982) Dominique Dunn (homicide)1982 Beatrice Straight (pnuemonia) 2001Poltergeist II (1986) Julian Beck (stomach cancer)1985 Will Sampson (heart/lung surgery complications)1987 Geraldine Fitzgerald (alzheimers)2005 Susan Peretz (breast cancer)1995Poltergeist III (1988) Heather O'Rourke (cardiopulmonary arrest) 1988GWTW (1939) Clark Gable (cardiac arrest)1960 Vivien Leigh (TB)1967 Leslie Howard (Murdered by Nazis)1943 Thomas Mitchell (cancer)1962 Barbara O'Neill (cancer)1952 Hattie McDaniel (breast cancer)1952 Butterfly McQueen (3rd degree burns)1995 George Reeves (gunshot to head)1959 Oscar Polk (undetermined)1949TWO main actors died and FIVE supporting actors died in relation to Poltergeist. GWTW had SEVEN main actors and TWO supporting die. Plus many of GWTW stars were divorced numerous times. Is there a curse? I don't know. Heck, we all die. Are we all ""CURSED""? I watch movies for entertainment, not to keep a scorecard. Also, Heather O'Rourke and Julian Beck were the only two to die DURING filming. And Heather was 12, not 10.",Poltergeist
378,ppradin,is there any cue missing ?,9,24 January 2006,"I first saw 'Poltergeist' 23 years ago in its poor quality french-dubbed version... Years later, I was able to see it again & again thanks to laser-disc and then to DVD... I do not remember acutely my first screening, but when I got the U.S. 'Poltergeist' Laserdisc I was somewhat surprised by some cues / shots ? seemingly missing... Did anyone ever notice the time when the Freelings come to speak to their neighbors at night, just after Carol Ann has experienced some supernatural sliding in the kitchen... Well it seems to me that the scene has actually been shortened for some unknown reason, because the shot of Carol Ann's parents talking to the neighbors (they are comically annoyed by mosquitoes while talking) is cut just in the middle of a sentence... I then watched the U.S. DVD release and could not but notice the same cut... Could anyone tell me I'm not crazy and provide me with any information about this continuity problem ?",Poltergeist
