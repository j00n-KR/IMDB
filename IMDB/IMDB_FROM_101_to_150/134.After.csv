0,SnoopyStyle,flat soap,3,9 July 2019,"Tessa Young (Josephine Langford) is a good girl. She is starting college and her simpleton boyfriend is still in high school. Her mother (Selma Blair) hates her new roommates. She is pulled into their party world and the mysterious bad boy Hardin Scott (Hero Fiennes Tiffin).Langford is a beautiful girl but I would give her glasses to fit the role. Hardin is such a smirking British douche that it's impossible to root for this relationship. It's cringe-worthy how much I dread this movie going forward. The only meet-cute moment comes from the Great Gatsby difference. He needs to dial down the hipster vibe and dial up the bad boy personality. Her high school boyfriend isn't much better either and bookish Landon has no juice. Dread is the defining word for this movie. I'm guessing that this is 50 Shades for teen girls. It's just as bad. The plot is slower than molasses and obvious as F. The dialogue is clunkier than a Ford Pinto but this movie has no possibility of exploding. The breakdown of Jane Austen is simplistic and too broad while trying to be deeply literary. That's part of the clunky dialogue conundrum. It needs to be smart and it tries to absorb the smarts by commandeering literary classics. It fails the comparison. It would be smarter to debate the romantic possibilities of Fuller House. At least, it would be at its own level. With Langford and Tiffin, the movie has two models right out of a catalog. They are unable to deliver more dimensions to these characters. There are way too many montages although the aquarium looks great. This is indeed 50 Shades for teen girls.",After
1,CinemaSerf,"Oh, just get on with it!!!",5,15 September 2020,"Ok, so I'm not the demographic so why am I surprised that this made me squirm? ""Tessa"" (Josephine Langford) is the straight-A student who falls for dark, enigmatic bad boy ""Hardin"" (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) and they spend much of the next 100 minutes trying to get it together. Snag - well he has a rather harrowing secret that can render him unreliable and unpredictable. Some of the dialogue is so cheesy - ""I really don't deserve you"" type stuff (well, actually Jenny Gage, neither do we) - as to really make you cringe which leaves us with a slush-fest that doesn't allow either of the two principals - whom, I think, have some potential: she has something of the highly personable Reese Witherspoon about her and HFT is tall, handsome (not pretty) and charismatic - to make their mark on this rather plodding romance. It also uses some terribly uninspiring filming techniques to substitute for decent writing and creativity in a fashion that all too frequently resorts to the soundtrack when things start to go a bit wonky (egged on my some pretty nasty ""friends"") just when the script should be at it's most poignant! I gather a sequel is in the pipes - give the guys a chance and give their characters some depth!",After

5,Thanos_Alfie,Waste of time...,3,9 November 2020,"""After"" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch a young woman falling in love with a young man who is very complicated because of his dark past and some choices he has done. They both have to find out how they can work things out in order to be together.I did not have high expectations from this movie and that is the main reason I was not disappointed. This movie has a poor and boring plot, without any plot twists or surprises to make it even a little bit interesting and it's mainly consists of major clichés. The interpretations of the cast followed the same pattern of the plot and direction, and they were below average. Finally, I have to say that I have not read any of the books and I only take into my consideration the movie which I found dreadful and I believe that I wasted my time watching it, I do not recommend it to anyone.",After
6,cruise01,A stiff romantic story that should have been straight to tv kind of movie.,5,11 July 2019,"After (2.5 out of 5 stars).After is a romantic drama film that follows a young teenager entering college. She was raised with tight rules by her mother and has a boyfriend from high school that is caring and respects her. Tessa (Josephine Langford) is innocent. She does not party, drink, or hang out with a bunch of guys. When her roommate introduces her to a bad boy attitude kind of guy Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin). He is tattooed, does not stay in one relationship, and is rebellious against his father. She falls for him. He takes her virginity and falls for her. He does have one dark secret that she does not know about him.The romantic drama does not offer anything new to the genre. It has its clichés. Tessa is awkward and innocent. Hardin is the opposite. They bump heads with their views and despise each other. Until they both go out together and fall for each other. Tessa's mother cuts her off cause of her behavior. She loses her high school boyfriend cause of the new guy. There is something that Hardin has yet to share with her.The script is cheesy with its dialogue. The direction is slow and has an uneven pace with the film. The plot is thin. The story is about an innocent girl meeting a guy that may make her different. There was barely any story. The acting was kind of stiff with Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin.Being based on a teen novel, maybe the film will find its audience from the fans of the book. Others may just see the film has another typical cliché romantic drama story that should have been on a lifetime channel. Overall, After is a pretty bad film with its bad acting, boring direction, stiff script, and a plot that is lacking in a story.",After

It's starts out with the typical formala that all the girls would love about a good girl who falls for the bad boy.
This movie does have some enhanced archetypes: the protagonist is a goodie two shows on eleven, her college roommate is met to be the very polar opposite. I mean everything about her scrams unchristian, and the bad boy seems to be just a pretty face with a British accent.
But the movie starts to get better. Like the fantasy of the young teen novel seems to wear off and the story becomes very grounded and down to earth as it progresses.

17,fernandoschiavi,"After seeks to please only fans of books. But, you run the risk of not being able to please even this audience. It is uninspired, and driven in automatic mode",6,13 February 2021,"For centuries, the search for great love has guided authors of all kinds, from Shakespeare and his Romeo and Juliet to Emily Brontë with Wuthering Heights. In the face of so much abundance, the writer Anna Todd doesn't even try to dare in After: the proposal here is to reinvent the wheel, adapting a beaten story for the present day while splashing references here and there, to support it. And this is not a demerit, such is the honesty transmitted to the viewer, even though comparisons and similarities are inevitable. The first one, wide open, is in relation to Fifty Shades of Gray. Not so much because of the spicy climate of the sexual saga created by E.L.James, but because of the conception of the female protagonist: Tessa Young - pay attention to the surname, not by chance! - it is the exact copy of Anastasia Steele, be it for behavioral naivety, angelic costume or even purified virginity. Her counterpoint is Hardin Scott, whose booklet also follows the basic stereotypes to the letter: rebellious, elusive air, an exotic beauty a la James Dean, with a hint of devourer that echoes in relation to sex.Overall, Jenny Gage's film strictly follows the formula for winning over teen audiences; however, for those who are already used to the subtext of the genre, there is not much to add by not leaving the common place and presenting uninteresting characters. Tessa is sweet, modest and responsible, the product of the firm education of an authoritarian mother. At university, she meets her roommate, Steph (played by rookie Khadijha Red Thunder), a funky party girl who turns out to be the opposite of Tessa. It is Steph who presents to the protagonist his objective for the film: the sensitive, closed, tattooed, literary lover, handsome and bad boy, Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince""). The problem is that Tessa's story is so simple and sweet that any expectation of accompanying the feature with richness or depth needs to be reduced to zero if she wants to consume it with any possibility of fun. The universe of ""After"" is created from the perspective of an immature girl, who had a repressed adolescence, only that the new phase of the student remains a simplified version of a dream world, which includes the personification of an ideal boy in the role of Hardin. Everything is very shallow and reduced to stereotypes in this story and, considering its conception as ""work done by fans"", it is difficult to expect more than that.However, this success comes side by side with a controversy: the abusive relationship. Hardin and Tessa's romance is filled with controversial moments where the young man abuses the girl's psychological condition by verbally assaulting her, taking various extremely toxic actions and being quite explosive. In the film, and here is the positive point of this adaptation, it was all softened. Here, their relationship is modified so as not to have a negative impact in the same way that the books did and still do today. Hardin continues to have an explosive personality, but does not directly affect Tessa. He is very controlled, and his explosive moments happen while the girl is not around.Novels aimed at the female audience have as their elements escapism and the representation of a perfect world, without any commitment to the reality of different human types. Tessa represents that ideal point of view. Her romantic partner likes books as much as she does, she is sexy and attractive, she suffers from problems like hers, treats her gently, respecting her wishes, represents the independence she seeks and, at the same time, cares and protects her. The development of this relationship serves Tessa's pure interest, without any surprises or difficulties. Even the sacred book for fans of this genre of stories, Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"", appears as a recurring reference in ""After"" as winks for her audience saying ""this film is for us"".As a cinematographic work, the absence of risks that history takes also impacts its look. There is nothing that at least tries to get you out of mediocrity. The clichés of this format are all there: the drama in the rain, the lust of the ""wet"" characters in a lake, the narrated voice that begins and ends the film. Furthermore, even considering the target audience, it is also impossible to ignore the average performances. For such a proposal to work, the ability of the chosen couple is crucial - and at this point, there is a certain dichotomy. If Josephine Langford, in addition to exuberant beauty, shows resourcefulness when composing a Tessa that alternates between such different moments, from almost emotional closure to absolute surrender, Hero Fiennes-Tiffin has an impressive interpretive nullity. If the couple has a good time, a lot is thanks to the direction of Jenny Gage in the more ""spicy"" sequences.The weak dialogues and some unusual paths in the script. The dialogues, incidentally, instead of moving the audience, cause only involuntary laughter. It is difficult to take their romance seriously when everything seems to have been taken from the first ideas that came from the director and screenwriter. They don't try to give the story a visual pop, just like, for example, Fifty Shades did. The material is precarious, and something was needed to make the experience with the film not as tiring as possible. As much as the feature is not intended to be a reflective and profound novel, it presents some details of the narrative that are already more than saturated in the genre - such as the rejected girl who sets up a plan to separate the protagonist couple (with the right to faces and mouths when you see them passing together) and the old speech resource ""things were like this before I met you, but then everything changed"" (which I leave in the air to avoid spoilers).It is also necessary to highlight some scenes that try to create a climax without much sense - as in the sequence in which Hardi leaves Tessa alone to meet friends at Bob's after a fight, or when the protagonist stops in front of the mirror (to the sound of a version more melodic of Avril Lavigne's Complicated) and begins to put on makeup and separate clothes that are different from his style so that, in the end, it gives absolutely nothing; or in the ridiculous scene that Tessa cuts her finger on the glass. More than ten songs were used over the course of an hour and forty minutes of film. The impression that remains is that this scene only exists because they wanted a moment to highlight the music and that's it, like a video clip in the middle of the film. In order not to be cruel in the extreme, the scene involving the couple in a lake is even interesting for the direction it takes, but it does not go beyond that. The same can be said of the expected spicy scenes. Present in books, but on screen they are few and simple, missing the opportunity to create something sensual. It seems that the director was afraid of the film gaining a higher age rating, which would prevent most fans from being able to watch in theaters. It is a pity.Contrary to what marketing proclaims, After is far from the sexual fantasies and fetishes of the Fifty Shades of Gray trilogy. It is clear that the film explores the latent sensuality of two young men with the hormones on the skin, increasingly in love, but also with a good dose of puritanism. Interestingly, the same puritanism that After brings about the protagonist couple is not reflected in the subplots. If the college environment is highlighted by the sinful potential, at least from the perspective of Tessa's mother, it is also in it that the film delivers its most liberal side in addressing bisexuality without judgment. It is in this respect that the screenwriter Susan McMartin tries to capture the current young audience, setting a beaten plot in an easily recognizable reality, while fighting ingrained conservatism. The love story between Tessa and Hardin, ""daring"" in itself, has its echoes also in those around them.The proposal here is to retell the classic story of the different who fall in love, to the point of teaching each other the art of loving, facing traumas from the past and barriers of the present. This, of course, punctuating penetrating glances and the chemistry of the couple, as the subgenre booklet says. In the end, After seeks to please only fans of books. But, you run the risk of not being able to please even this audience. It is uninspired, and driven in automatic mode. A certain affection was necessary to bring the project to the cinema, but it is non-existent. Absolutely predictable, After faces the serious problem of the absence of conflict by presenting many scenes of making out between its two main actors, as if the lust portrayed compensated for the lack of history to be developed and, after all, this is exactly what After proposes: to the present day an old story about an exacerbated love, if possible making room for continuations. Demanding from him more than that is frivolous, especially for a film that, so honestly, opens up what it intends to be.",After

21,johannes2000-1,Just for teenage girls.,5,10 April 2020,"The text on the cover of this dvd made me expect something of a romantic thriller about an ambitious but inexperienced girl who falls for a bad boy with dark secrets. Unfortunately it turned out as a rather one-dimensional tear-jerking teenage romcom. Supposed bad boy Hardin can hardly be called ""bad"" or it should be for his abundant tattoos - he doesn't do alcohol or drugs, can recite whole sections of romantic 19th century literature, is as chivalrous to main character Tessa as any girl could want and looks more like a cute puppy than anything remotely dangerous or bad (actually, Tessa's weird pierced and painted room-mate looked ten times more frightening!). The secrets of his youth that Hardin eventually reveals are just sad, not dangerous, and the twist that (almost) breaks up this blooming romance is SO cliché that I could hardly believe that a nowadays movie dared to come up with it. As a matter of fact the devastating effect of the twist lasts hardly 5 minutes and then at the flick of a wrist everything is all peachy again. Josephine Langford as Tessa does her utmost with the shallow material, but apart from his looks I was not very impressed by Hero Fiennes Tiffin, who's British accent is of course genuine but here sounds almost over the top and exaggerated for the sake of it's intended romantic effect.",After

26,Magow-Intermean,After Review,6,4 May 2019,"'After' is based on Anna Todd's best-selling novel with the same name. It's the story of Tessa Young (Josephine Langford), who meets her fellow classmate - the brooding and mysterious Hardin Scott (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) and sparks begin to fly. They are the perfect opposites, but do they have what it takes to be one, against all odds?REVIEW: For Hardin Scott, ""Nice is just another word for boring."" He has an enigmatic charm and there's an air of uncertainty in his cryptic behavior. That is perhaps an irresistible combination in a young lad, who is also conventionally good looking. Throw in a girl-next-door with textbook good behaviour and an ambition to make her mother proud. When these two meet in a film, the audience knows what to expect. Ideally, that would take away the surprise element, but it's the writing of these characters that keep you invested.Tiffin is in the best form portraying the unpredictability of Hardin in measured tones. It's easy to root for him even when he's not doing the right thing. He also gets some really cool lines that add to the curiosity around his character. Josephine Langford successfully brings the vulnerability of Tessa to fore. Her performance is honest and understated that portrays her hunger for new experiences. Selma Blair as Tessa's mother performs well in her limited screen time. But the rest of the cast has too many clichés. College teens sporting tattoos and nose piercings, a spiteful and vamp-ish fellow student with pigtails and a constant smirk, girl's supportive friend in college, who is dark skinned. Wonder why? There are also American stereotypes like the dysfunctional families, daddy issues and single parents.But none of that hampers the film's strong emotional texture. Writers Susan McMartin and Tamara Chestna weave in the intense romance between Tessa and Hardin in a conventional yet mystical way that builds interest.There are not many twists and the narrative is simple. However, it hoodwinks you into feeling that something really unusual will happen - whether or not it does, is for you to find out. Sex scenes are aplenty but none of them over-the-top. They are aesthetically executed and remain complimentary to the storytelling. Director Jenny Gage handles those scenes with finesse, never letting her young, good looking actors lose their next-door image. This helps the audience stay connected with the characters and feel for them. The pace is slow, but consistent with moments that will stay with you. Soundtrack packs quite a punch into this intense college romance.'After' is as formulaic as it is ambitious for young lovers who seek exciting first experiences. It has love, lust and heartbreak in equal measure.",After

28,movieman6-413-929510,Fanfiction is difficult to film well.,2,19 April 2019,"After is a new romantic drama directed by Jenny Gage, the director of All This Panic.The film is about eighteen-year-old Tesse Young (Josephine Langford), who will start her first semester at the university as a student. Here she ends up in a whole new world with a way of life that she is not used to.
When she meets the mysterious Hardin Scott (Hero Fiennes Tiffin), she soon feels attracted to him. In this way they start a stormy relationship together, in which Tesse gets to see life in a different way. In this way she starts to doubt what she really wants to do and achieve with her life. In addition to her personal doubts about life, she also wonders who Hardin really is and what his life looks like.This film is based on the book by writer Anna Todd. She came up with this book and wrote it on a website called Wattpad. Her book is actually a fanfiction about Harry Styles, a member of the band One Direction. That this film is based on a fan fiction can also be seen in the characters in the film. The characters come across as stereotype teenagers with an imaginative version of teenage life. The film is full of clichés that you have seen in other teenage films before.
In addition to the fanfiction of Anna Todd, the film also comes across as a teenage version of Fifty Shades of Gray. This film and book series is also based on a fanfiction, but from the story from the Twlight films and books. If you put these films next to each other, you can see that fanfiction is not something that can really be filmed and can therefore be better kept with the book.Because the film is directed and also written by novice people and is furthermore based on fan fiction, the novice cast doesn't have much to work anymore. This can also be seen in the film, because the cast comes across as a fantasy version or very exaggerated teenagers. This way they don't appear credible in the film.

32,zac-04879,Another Unlikeable Romance Story,4,31 May 2021,"Characters meet - get to know each other - immediately get sexual... That's what makes After a predictable and average romance/drama. Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin star in this college drama as well-acted but incredibly unlikeable characters. And like most of these disappointing teen romance films today, they go through dramatic issues throughout their relationship and deal with peer pressure.Not only are the characters super average, but the story is completely predictable. There are plenty of fully expected and obvious turns. However, the music is actually pretty decent and the film is well-produced. Audiences getting started on romance movies may find this movie ""hitting-the-spot"", but most will find the film boring and should spend their money on something else... almost anything else...Therefore, it's easy to say or just believe that the books were much better. After would be a decent recommendation to teen fans of romantic college dramas, but to others this film is a terrible waste of time (which it is).If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",After
33,Jerique,Somehow a worse film than Twilight,1,22 September 2019,"I never thought I'd see the day where a film I am watching is more cringeworthy than Twilight. But alas, here we are. Starting out with some bad dialogue we always here about Pride and Prejudice from a literary standpoint, Tessa Young and Hardin Scott discuss the viewpoints of the characters and argue over Tessa's love life. It doesn't take long to see Hardin Scott is a simple down-scale version of Edward Cullen without any supernatural powers. Hardin is creepy from the get-go.While the story description sounds interesting on paper, and maybe the novel was good the film itself plays out like a badly written fanfiction. It is not well executed and each line of dialogue screams rookie. It looks like Jenny Gage is a first time director and writer and although she had some help this screenplay and film fails to inspire. It has no spark or substance in the material and the acting is stiff as a wooden board. Josephine Langford bares a striking resemblance to her sister Katherine (13 Reasons Why) but that's all she got from her. Katherine has talent but Josephine gives off zero emotion. Her acting has no range and all her scenes in the film aren't worthwhile.During the scene where Tessa learns the truth of the nature of her relationship, the film is supposed to be reaching its peak of plot. However, the film is forgettable and leaves no lasting impression. In scenes for Twilight, there are moments that you cannot forget. Even with the horrible acting of Robert, scenes are given substance and although the film is terrible there are memorable moments. Tessa is a poorly written character in the sense that you cannot relate to her. It is unbelievable that she has lived this dull life and the friends she has are even more unbelievable. This literature is offensive in the way that these characters are meant to be so linear and one-dimensional so you cann easily find a way to relate to them. But there's nothing to relate to when it comes to Hardin since he's a basic stalker. But he's a bad one.I found myself wondering what I was really watching nearly every minute passing. The inclusion of Selma Blair and Peter Gallagher to try to show some actual credible talent goes off without a moment's notice. Screen time for both is so little it's almost a cameo appearance for each. It's a shame that the source material is executed so badly. A good idea is salted by the bad acting.",After

The female lead they made out to look and sound like Reese in Cruel Intentions, as is overall theme of movie. Make no mistake this is not close to that movie but tries to be real hard. Selma Blair as the mom was just a gross miscast to throw into the mix.The girl's high school senior boyfriend looks like junior student instead. Clearly that was done for story purpose.

A romantic story, with solid music. The problem with these films is fantasising about the ""happy end"" moments like in the ending of this movie.Such things simply do not happen and there are no such conclusions that after the end of the relationship you will go somewhere and at that exact moment someone will come. Not in real life.Anyway, the girls (up to 24) will recognise themselves in the movie and boys will not, because all together is one ""bubble"" of foam.Cheesy movie, but still leaves nice impression. There's something about these fantasies we all had and sometimes we can afford to fantasise a bit, right?Tip for young people: It's nice to experience moments of ""endless love"", but know that you change the criteria later.

40,untilnow99,"The Eyes Have It. And the Eyebrows, too, I guess",6,16 April 2019,"Okay. I didn't read the book. I went by the IMDb rating and saw all the ""Fantastic!"" ""Loved It!"" reviews and thought, ""Oh, heck. Why not?"" Now I realize I should have paid more attention to the ""Where's the dialogue?"" and ""Waste of time"" reviews.First off, and I know this is super nitpicky: I had a really hard time not focusing on Hardin's neck/head. The actor has one of those heads where the back of his head is a straight line from the top of his head down to his shoulders. This ""deformity"" fascinated me, but not in a good way. Otherwise, he is one fine looking dude. Oh, those eyes. Oh, those eyebrows. Ooh, that Brit accent.Same with the girl. Oh, those doe-like eyes. Oh, those amazing eyebrows. But her silly June Lockhart wardrobe. Gah. That was a bit much.The fact that this was filmed in what seemed to me to be 80% close-up framing was kind of a drag after a while. I got sick of looking at the two of them gazing intently into each others' eyes, lips two inches apart. Then, when the first kiss FINALLY came, it was an absolute letdown. Where was the passion?Not sure what we're supposed to make of this couple, both of whom grew up damaged and wounded beyond all repair by their heartless fathers. Talk about baggage. Are we really supposed to believe that these two will rescue each other and all for love? Sorry. So unrealistic.There were two parts of the movie I really liked. The first was the scene at the pond. That brought back fond memories of me and a handsome guy swimming (naked) at just such a pond, many years ago.The second scene I liked was where she finds out Hardin made a bet he could seduce her. But then it was spoiled utterly and completely by the fact that he just let her take off into the rain without chasing after her to explain things. Really? In real life the guy would just let the love of his life wander off into the pouring rain, alone on a dark night, knowing she was upset like that? Doubtful in the extreme.All-in-all a kiddie romance movie with a highly implausible message and tons of gooey close-ups. If you're into such things, you'll love this movie.",After

The play is fair, but there is nothing that tears the legs away under one.The rebel Hardin is not at all as rebellious as the film would like him to be.It is almost a pure woman-produced film. The critics have killed it for being overly generic and I am very inclined to agree with them.The film is based on the first book in the After book series, which it describes as a phenomenon. However, it is not a phenomenon I have ever heard of. One can therefore imagine that there will be additional films and the 2nd will soon be in cinemas, only a year after this film was released. Of course, it's easy if the movie is already template cut.Before the book series, After was a One Direction fan fiction. Therefore, many of the characters also have names inspired by the members of the OD. Other than that, there are no other traces from the OD fan fiction era.Finally, I think Josephine Langford makes a fine figure in the role of Tessa Young. She only had about a week to prepare for the role, and that week she spent reading the books and the script.What makes this film a little better than a completely generic film is that one can learn a little lesson from this film. It is to take small steps in a new relationship so that you are not suddenly too deep inside an unstable relationship",After
43,darkwizard404,Very close to reality,8,11 October 2021,"I like this movie mainly because it's very close to reality. Tessa fell for Hardin because he was masculine unlike Noah who was more like a brother. Hardin gave her butterflies in her stomach and the excitement that every woman craves in a marriage/relationship. In the beginning of the film, I immediately figured that Noah is a nice guy and a simp looking at how he was carrying their baggages and taking Tessa to college and the fact that Tessa hadn't slept with Noah was proof that Noah wasn't someone Tessa wanted to be with in the long run.Looking at Noah's body language, I got such feminine vibes from him that I as a man couldn't feel bad for him at all after Tessa dumped him. Even Tessa's roommate assumes Noah to be Tessa's brother until she tells her that he's her boyfriend. When he shows up at her college with flowers, I thought to myself, what kind of a girl would wanna be with such a feminine guy? Seriously that was so cringe. If I saw a girl with a guy like Noah on the streets, I would have assumed him to be her gay best friend.Being nice gets a man nowhere. Like Hardin said, nice is another word for boring. This is a romantic movie which is highly realistic. Women do fall for bad boys in reality. Not necessarily because they're bad boys but because they have a masculine edge to their personality. That's something average nice guys don't have.",After

47,PerryAtTheMovies,Middle of the road romance movie....,5,8 February 2021,"Initial Thoughts:
This review is based solely on the film and not book vs film as I've never read the book. First to set the precedence this film is a more mature version of ""The Kissing Booth"" in the sense that the romance doesn't feeling goofy or childish. It also doesn't feel as predictable. On the other side it's a more toned down version of ""50 Shades of Grey"" in regards to the fact that neither character is looking for a strict sexual relationship. Although ""After"" falls in the middle of these two film, emotionally, it never hits home. There's never a true connection between the leads. The entire time it does feel like they're acting. The romance that does blossom between Tessa and Hardin takes too long to reach its pinnacle and by the time this happens the film is all but over. This to say. The storyline with the emotional drama is a flop for me.A positive to the film and the thing that seems to make it fail less is the soundtrack along with cinematography. These two combined were obviously thought out to some extent. Each time a song played or just the music was going it brought what little emotion I was feeling to life. In addition to the soundtrack the cinematography played a key part. Whether it was night time, in a room, or out in nature, what was being captured with the camera was perfect for this film.Although I'm not dying to see the remaining films. I do look forward to see how the rest of the ""After"" series plays out as whole, but for now, oh for one so far.Overall:
An ok movie for young adults. While not emotionally driven it does offer a few glimpse moments of enjoyability. This is a relatively safe romantic drama that could possibly enjoyed on a quiet night.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'If you're not paying for it, sure. Otherwise you're not missing much.'Enjoy the show!",After

I haven't read the book so can't comment from that perspective, but I feel a little underwhelmed in the wake of this movie.The ""black moment"" of the story wasn't black enough to be a convincing reason for the heroine to flee town, and everything in general seemed to happen too quickly without much development behind it.Perhaps they tried to put too much into the movie (that was in the books) and so weakened the whole thing (jack of all trades, master of none?).

Never read the novel, so no idea if it's true to the novel.For me, it was definitely a sexy and dark romantic drama. Remembering when I was a teenager and feeling those feelings of falling for bad boys.After, did this well. The main female character is somewhat shy, inexperienced and starts college whilst in a longterm relationship with a sweet 17 year old who's more like her friend than her boyfriend.She then meets the sexy, intriguing but damaged Hardin, who doesn't date, he just wants one thing. She tries to keep away, but finds herself drawn to Hardin like forbidden fruit.What unfolds is passion, lust and something wicked.I enjoyed it and am looking forward to the 2nd installment next year. Not really sure why the movie has been met with such criticism and low ratings. Langford does an excellent job, but I don't think that the lead actor brought much chemistry to the story. Yes he is sexy and dark, but acting and chemistry wise, that was the only let down for me.Turn on Netflix and enjoy this sexy coming of age romance.",After

After the movie I found out what the book was about and how they changed the original ""shocking"" ending to this watered down soft 9- year old version. I mean, the original story ending isn't that original either. It has been done by so many romantic movies (How to lose a guy in 10 days for example), but at least we would have a shock moment and it could have saved this garbage from being such garbage. How did the main characters fall in love in the book? That was actually quite hot and not so badly written. What do we see here? No dialogue, they look each other in the eyes and a loud song plays in the background. Then they go for a walk or lie in the bed together and a loud song plays in the background again. Then they eat something and a loud song... and so on. That is the laziest writing I've ever seen. You can maybe make 1 or 2 such scenes in the movie, but you can't swap real dialogue and a story line for some music video montages and call it a movie!

well I went to see it because I was bored, but Once I started I loved it.... yes I literally did not know or was not familiar with the two leads ""Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin"".... the only thing that literally that I was able to google was the fact that he was the Nephew of the Fiennes brother ""joseph and Ralph"".

The problem is that once you're out of your teens, you realize that that scenario isn't actually a romantic ideal, and thus the male ""hero"" of this story will just generate a lot of eye rolls. Overall it's trying to be an intense romantic drama but it's a bit cheesy... though admittedly still kind of cute.",After

It's good and light escapist literature. This was on Amazon Prime, so I thought I would give it a try.I was quite disappointed. It is poorly directed, poorly produced, not very well acted and the pacing is atrocious. Seriously, they have sex at about the same pacing as they study in the library, to even the same tempo of music? It lasts about 15 seconds, (which is about right for boys that age, from what I remember.😎), but I thought this was an important point in the story, when she finally commits completely to Hardin - in the movie, more of the same.The movie seems short, but I think that's because the movie never switches gears.

After is by far in my opinion better than some other teen romances as they are usually just so cringe and uncomfortable to watch.The characters in After aren't done as well as they are in the books as they aren't really explained and done as well as other movies. Tessa Young is made out to be a smart young girl who is very into her school work and her career, but Hardin Scott is a bad boy who has house parties every week, drinks sometimes and has anger issues. In the book these two characters are explained way better and have more opportunities to speak to each other, but in the movie they only see each other a couple of times before it goes somewhere more a lot sooner than expected considering their characters haven't been shown as much as they should off.I would recommend watching this movie but don't be expecting an absolute amazing teen romance movie as their are better romance movies out their, but for being a teen romance movie it is the best out of a lot i've seen.The new trailer for After We Collided has just came out and it looks a lot better than the first movie so i'm hoping it will be better than the first one.",After

The acting was good, chemistry between the two leads was definitely there. Typical cliche complicated guy/good girl plot. Had a little bit of a Cruel Intentions vibe to it. I wish there was more character development, especially for the side characters, because it felt disjointed in some scenes. I wanted to see more of Landon. And Molly intervening and being rude could have been done slightly better. The scene when Tessa finds out about the dare could have been played out better, too. It was awkward when she went to the bar and they were all hanging there and stalling to tell her. Would have made more sense for her to overhear them talking about it or to read a text that said something about it directly.
I assume Hardin in the books is more of a jerk, because in this he wasn't terrible. A little broody and wishy washy, but typical teenage boy otherwise, so it didn't make sense for Tessa's mom to warn her about him so early on. Kind of like Noah in Kissing Booth. He wasn't that bad either, aside from getting into random fights, and yet he was dubbed ""the bad boy"". Bad boys in YA would be more like Damon from Vampire Diaries or Spike from Buffy.It was definitely the fall in love in two seconds type of story, but it wasn't super cringy either.

*the movie is beautifully shot
* Hero Fiennes-Tiffin is so, SO attractive, I giggled like a school girl every time he was on screen. he really nails the smoldering stare.
* the actors do well with the source material
* i did appreciate that sex scene showed him asking for consent numerous times.cons:
* the pacing is way off, the beginning scenes should have been extended to show the build up of their relationship.
* i didn't feel like they explained Hardin's troubled past enough and i found it strange that he just casually brings up his mother's rape(? or attack?) at his dads wedding.
*timelines are confusing. does she go from meeting him to moving in with him in like a month? bc that what it seemed like.
* no character development for the secondary ppl. they are just there and they are all miserable assholes...including her roommate.
* it felt like a discombobulated collection of scenes that loosely followed a plot.
* what was that ending? it just abruptly ends with them meeting at his spot after being apart for idk how long. he just sits down next to her. the end. i legit laughed out loud in the theater.i didn't finish the 1st book bc Tessa & Hardin's relationship was trash and it was poorly written, but i'm glad they toned down the abusive stuff. they could have shown him to be a little more of an jerk at the beginning and eased up over the course of their relationship. He just seemed madly
in love with her from day 1 in the movie.i'm interested in seeing a European cut of the film bc there was a lot of weird and choppy edits that i think we're made to maintain the PG rating. like where was the book up the dress scene? (that was what made me want to see this in the 1st place)all in all it was a cute but average flick that suffered from character development and pacing issues. if you go into it expecting eye candy and great make out scenes...you'll love it. i really liked Hero and Josephine's chemistry and i hope to see them in more projects....specifically Hero (did i say that he was a cutie?)",After

What else could you expect from a movie that originated as Harry Styles fanfic?I'm not gonna go into too much detail about this dreadful snoozefest, since it's probably all been said already, and honestly I've spent too much time thinking about this movie already. That being said, the acting is subpar, the romance is terrible, the plot is plain stupid almost the whole way through, the dialogue is utterly cringeworthy, and despite the fact that it was marketed as being steamy and sexy, there ends up being exactly one (1) sex scene-and it was quite possibly the most vanilla sex scene ever put to film. The list of grievances goes on and on.The only things that save this movie from a one-star rating are the aesthetics and the ending. Yeah, not much effort was put into this movie, but at least there was some clear effort in the visuals department, as it's actually a decently shot movie with some nice visual moments. And the (slight) twist ending may be stupid, but at least it's kind of emotionally engaging. Plus, the movie at least ends on a somewhat melancholy note, instead of forcing in a cheesy happy ending, which would have just been adding insult to injury.Ultimately though, if you're looking for a terrible movie to watch with friends and make fun of, ""After"" is not it. You'd be better off watching literally any B-grade sci-fi flick; at least then you'd have fun while watching it.Really, the only good thing that came from this movie is that it won several Teen Choice awards, confirming what we already knew: the Teen Choice awards are meaningless.",After

God do not waste your time watching this if you've read the books you will literally lose your mind trust me I read all five of them. And trust me when I say I know what I'm talking about
Where do I begin ... firstly the cast what a great cast Josephine not a great actress at all I detected no emotion emigrating from her at all she literally had no connection with the Tessa form the books at all Tessa form the books has a completely different personality she is extremely sensitive, very dedicated, responsable (to a certain level and strictly academically speaking) trait of which is not shown clearly in the movie.
Harding god just why everything about the way he was portrayed is completely wrong they got literally nothing right about his personality they completely cut off his offensive vocabulary, his disrespect towards Tessa the lack of pearcings, his mysterious vibe and rudeness and most of all the dangerous and negative issues and all the things he actually does to Tessa and has done with many girls in his past, in the film they completely cut off the fact that he makes Tessa cry literally every chapter of the book they have massive fights (which are cut out as well)
The movie's storytelling mode will literally make no sense to you if you've not read the books because nothing's adds up , nothing gets clarified or detailed enough to create an actual emotional response form the audience.
Now the sex.. if you've read the books you'll know this happens quite often and not the way it was shown in the movie at all you will literally be shouting to the screen wtf that did not make any sense at all! And regret watching it in the first place.
Weak plot potential completely wasted non of the acting was astounding
Half of the scenes that happened never occurred once in the book and they made no sense to tie the events that followed *sigh*
Mistake #1 make the movie B because that wkeaked the plot dramatically.
#2 not focusing on the actors ability to act (Hero's was fairly decent he made some decent attempts to create an emotional response and not bad acting at all, but his potential was wasted with the weak portray of a powerful character that is Hardin) Josephine she Has potential but she did not know how to make the characters emotions known she did not cry nearly enough as the Tessa in the book did she did not dress like Tessa in the book did she is not a perfectionist like she is in the books, and hardins friends my god firstly not going deep enough about Zed's affection towards Tessa wasting mollys character as a villain god I could go on forever

135,vshukri-83740,Terrible for those who haven't read the books.,1,14 April 2019,"Worst movie I've seen in a long time. I didn't read the books, (I tried but the writing was terrible and needed an editor...badly.) I figured the movie would be better and would be a good way to support it. But my god. TERRIBLE. The ""couple"" were in love in 2 seconds. The viewer didn't have enough time to even process what was happening or WHY. Because there was NO connection and NO plot.
Now, I KNOW I'm the ""odd person out"" because a billion people who read the books will disagree, but I'm sorry, I can't lie. For the 65% of the population who live on earth who have NOT read the books. This crap made no sense.
NO PLOT. (I'm going to keep saying this, because I've never watched a movie without one before.) However, It was like the director and author (who was highly involved based on all the press interviews with the cast members) decided to take the most popular scenes and just make a movie montage.
There was barely any tension or a challenge...just bad. The person I saw it with didn't read the books either and he wanted to walk out like 5 times because he was so bored and confused. We also laughed because some of the scenes were just so terrible. There was one scene where I guess (I have no idea because the way it was cut was so strange) but Hardin was supposed to be doing something sexual to her, but like...they just looked at one another for a few seconds (she didn't even so much as moan so it was super confusing just watching her face stare up blankly at the ceiling) before the scene cut and they were laying in bed cuddling with her pants off. Me and my partner looked at each other in confusion and both whispered: ""Wtf just happened?""
The whole thing was just dumb. There were scenes that could have been cut. Like when she went to the car with that gut and asked where Hardin was. WHY? Why waste 2.5 minutes of film of that when the scene before the viewer (and the actress) were SHOWN the text messages explaining where Hardin would be. Those 2.5 min could have helped the beginning of the film and developed the relationship a bit more before the lake scene (like three scenes into the movie) where they're in love. I just don't understand how the heck they have all these deep feelings toward one another? They knew each other for 2 days max before they were in a lake and he was all, ""I don't think we can ever be just friends?"" Such a confusing and strange film. Surely people 16 and older are smarter than this?Also: As a side note I don't understand the BS this movie got before opening day. This relationship wasn't ""abusive"" in the least. Hardin was actually really sweet and the bet wasn't that big of a deal. She fell in love, he fell in love. He cried like a baby in the rain for her. I am NOT going to sit through part 2 of a movie where this chick is going to berate him and for there to be no plot again. NO.",After
136,majaz9,made for 14-year-old girls,3,21 April 2019,"I had a lot of expectations going to the cinema to see the premiere of this film and left utterly disappointed. I don't understand how people are comparing it to the 50 shades franchise. I'm not saying that 50 shades triology was amazing, but this film was not even close to being sensual and sexy. The passion between the two main characters was non-existent and all the lines were extremely cheesy and unbelievably hilarious. Instead of falling in love with the characters and their relationship, I was laughing at them. This film was a let-down, the only good scenes were the beautiful nature shots. If I saw this film at home I would stop watching it after 20 minutes.
After saying all that, I can image a 14-year-old me enjoying this film. So maybe if you're a young teenager, discovering love and romance, give it a try because you might like it. But if you're an adult, don't be bothered to spend money and see this film, you'll be dissatisfied.",After

They both suck.This movie is basically like that one line in The Fault in Our Stars. ""Gorgeous pixie-haired girl dislikes authority yet can't help but fall for a boy she knows is trouble."" The chemistry between the two lovers felt forced, and tried to make a reasonable break-up at the end, you know, like every romance movie?This movie misses the mark badly, and makes me question the future of romance films, which I wish people would stop making.

They got half of the lake scene, the diner scene and the classroom scene. Maybe 2 more short shot of others. Very unsatisfying. Hardin is not the same person. In the book he's rude, destructive, overbearing ECT. This book he's just like every other male lead that ""has problems"". He wasn't portrayed as the god awful boyfriend you should never fall for but are pulled to because of the unbelievable-god-given sex appeal that turns into love. He WAS.... H.O.T, S.E.X.Y, D.A.N.G.E.R.O.U.S. The forbidden fruit if you will. In this movie he's just. hot. I wasn't drawn to him. I didn't want to want him even if he's not a good person. So disappointing! Every scene that builds the tension and connections (you know what I'm talking about!) Was gone!! And come on. ""He BeT hE cOuLd MaKe Me FaLl FoR hIM"" No! Where was that bloody sheet?!?! 🤦🤦.

Although some of the characters that I wanted needs a push as I like them from the books. Though the only critic that I had was the movie needs to clean up a bit in editing so it does not look too choppy when it was watched as a whole movie.Overall, the movie is pleasantly confused in a good way as it is refreshing and not too tiring to watch all over again.

She had sex with another guy while he was back at her place waiting for her and you think he would just forgive her?

Never has a movie been so deep and so well written and directed. The Dialogue is beautiful and can only be understood by true intellectuals like myself. The Chemistry between the Two Leads is the GREATEST THING EVER PUT TO SCREEN. The Two have so much chemistry you Just want them to go at it every 2 seconds to a beautiful pop song. Did I tell you this movie has songs. The GREATEST Songs ever put to cinema. You got Halsey, Selena, Alessia, Freya (do I need to say their second names). Who cares you would know if you were a DEEP INTELLECTUAL. Can I go back to the actors. Beautiful 10/10 from the Guy one. His English accent is so beautiful and him being English is never forced in or feel stereotypical. It's beautiful. I just realised I haven't talked about the plot. The plot is so deep that only true intellectuals will understand. A Good Girl needs Bad Boy and they bang. Also a University. And Pop Songs. Did I tell you this is based on Harry Styles fan fiction, The greatest media of all time, which was made into a book series which is not as good as this movie. This has Hannah Baker's sister in it and she's even better than her sister. (Katherine Langford who?, Josephine Langford is where it's at. #joesphinelangfordfor13RWseason4). I mean Joesphine needs an Oscar for this movie, she is just as pretty as the cinematography which is the greatest of all time.

I know I'm probably too old to be watching modern teen films but I'm a romantic soul and can't help myself).There is a lot of chemistry between the two lead characters and I think they cast them well....I must say that Hero, who plays Hardin, is extremely pleasant on the eye (which enabled me to forgive some of his monotone delivery) ....but I found the rest of the cast a bit lack lustre but that said, overall I enjoyed the film and have watched it a few times since reading the books. It's definitely got the essence of the books but its almost like a tame York Notes version.....Seriously though the books are on a completely different level to this film with such a depth to the characters and detailed back stories and the inner dialogues are amazing, plus it's also very well written so you can't help but be completely drawn in to their lives ....(I literally cram read the whole series in about 5 days and it would've been less had I not had to go to work!) it's very addictive, with serious emotional highs and lows ... i loved, hated, cried and laughed along with the characters as if I was actually there.....but how do they get all that into a movie on a budget?After reading the books I agree with the masses that its a shame that they changed so much of the main storyline, especially the twist, but I realise this was due to the film being designed as a teen romance so it needed to appeal to a certain age group so they had to soften it up.I'm looking forward to the next film to see what they do with it, but had this film been an 18, kept more in line with the books story line and had more depth, I would have loved it so much more.If you havent read the books I'm sure you'll enjoy it as the teen romance that it is .... if you have already read the books, then I think you'll likely be disappointed.",After

Like I didn't understand why Hardin was meant to be a bad boy we were supposed to sympathize with? Okay so his dad wasn't so nice too him... so this is why he can be a bully? Can someone explain?

Although I have to say I was disappointed and angry that the director along with the writer missed this great opportunity to make an astounding movie from such great content from the book.Sadly, the storyline written in the book is involved in the slightest, which I think was a huge mistake. Everything that makes ""After"" After was cut out and replaced with scenes that might look like they've been cut out from some Instagram filter - fantasy world, but doesn't move the plot further or doesn't do anything to help develop the characters as well. I feel like there have been so many scenes that weren't finished or just simply weren't important. I think that this movie could have been so much better if they just stuck to the book more strictly.Also, the characters development wasn't as great as I thought it would be, I mean the actors' features did resemble the ones, you would imagine from the book, but the acting and playing had its flaws. It was maybe because both of the actors have so little experience or just simply weren't able to perform the characters correctly. For example Tessa in the book is more overthinking things, not just jumping into things 2 seconds after Hardin says it, and on the other hand, Hardin is much ruder and mocking, seductive.. than in the movie.Also I simply just don't understand why they decided to label this movie with PG-13 when half of the book is contained from sex scenes or intimacy. This was another thing that disappointed me the most.Also, I feel like the whole movie would have been much more realistic if they showed us more dramatic scenes like the intense arguments between Tessa and Hardin, the flaws of their toxic relationship and also the complicated past of Hardin's which led him to be the way he is.From my point of view, this movie wasn't the worst I've ever seen, but if I recall it today, I can't even remember the plot, I mean nothing really happened in there.

Yes, it is ""bad boy falls for good girl and vice versa"" but was done so beautifully and, I think, realistically.
It's much more sweet than expected or marketed and it's a pity.
It is really very watchable, very easy. I actually was impressed.
Bravo.As far as the acting is concerned, well, it's a movie about young love in college and a drama, so, pretty average, but it's ok. Personally, it didnt take anything from my viewing.It's cute, try it if you want a romance and you are fan of these movies. Or read the book, (I haven't, didn't know it was based on a book anyway), it's enjoyable.",After

I know there's a lot of people attacking this film and the author but don't listen to any of them I read the after story when It was on wattpad and I couldn't wait for the books to be published. My favorite scene in the entire film is the lake scene. the ending is so beautiful I can't even word. They did change the bet it is a bit different from the book but I'm okay with that.

If I hadn't read the books before watching it, I would probably give this a 4 or maybe even a 3.I'm givning this a 6 because I loved the books so much & the scenes I got that was from the books, I was somewhat happy with. But overall, it was a bad movie.It was extremely rushed & they barely talked to eachother. It was like ""hey"", ""let's fall in love"", ""let's move in together & ""oh, and then let's break up"" - in like 3 seconds. For people who haven't read the books, they will feel so confused.They totally destroyed Hardins character.
He is way to nice in the movie - and he barely cusses at all, which in my opinion is important for his character. They showed a lot less sex or ""intimate"" scenes, if you wanna call it that, which also has HUGE part in the story. And they way they did the bet scene(??!!!), I was so upset! ""Make her fall in love with me""??? The bet scene was about Hardin taking Tessa's virginity before Zed & that was very important through out the 4 books & they just destroyed that as well.This makes me so upset because I think they casted everyone so well & they had everything to make an amazing movie but just threw it away.

204,gothicsunshinebooks,Bothered me enough...,6,6 May 2020,"First, I'd like to start off on how much I regret watching this movie. It's a frustrating regret for me.I feel like it's not good, but not bad either...
I will admit, overall, this would be one of those movies I would watch if I'm having a crappy day. Which is odd since it's not a cheer me up kind or feel good movie.First off, when writing this review, I have not read the book or the watt pad version. This movie had bothered me enough to actually read the damn book... Or you could thank Hero for that (guilty).By the time the movie ended, I was confused. The story line is clear and brief, cute, got many intense scenes where they're staring at each other, but the cast are well paired, however the story is lacking. I had to Google the movie info, hoping for some clarity, and found out it was based off of a book. There was is some back and forth between Hardy and Tessa in the movie, however, not enough to show their relationship is toxic. Not too long ago before watching this movie, I was wondering about what makes a relationship toxic. I've asked myself, what are the signs that makes a relationship toxic. It's not something that could be easily spotted in a behavior if you've already become so used to it, that it has become normal. Tessa is surrounded by toxicity. It's with her mom, it's in her friends, it in Noah, as well as Hardin.I could be wrong. For someone who has never been a relationship, when I see constant anger, to the point of things being thrown around, and yelling, as well as controlling almost every single move, to me, that's a toxic relationship. In the movie, it lacks any type of argument that I should consider as toxic. The only time when it became so obvious that it's a full blown argument, was when Hardin was put in a position to reveal a 'bet' he made with his friends over Tessa's virginity.Many occurrence happened with Hardin's behavior considered rude, but not something that shows a toxic relationship.* Bedroom, not excusing himself so Tessa could get dressed
*Coffee shop, they acknowledge each other, but do not talk (normal)
*Party, game of truth or dare - personal question of 'Are you a virgin' then 'shes a virgin i are you to kiss Hardin'
(Tessa stood up for herself, she has absolutely no interest in being the butt of people's joke. I applaud for in a strong female character. Hardin could have stepped up, especially her roommate.)
*Still at the party, Tessa ends up in Hardin's room, Hardin has no right to be angry considering he didn't keep the door locked.
*In class, topic of Pride and Prejudice, they have a blow up, about comparison of Darcy's & Hardin's behavior to Elizabeth's and Tessa's character... this definitely has gotten to a personal level, but it also felt like it came too soonSo far with this section, nothing warrants a blow up or shows toxicity in a relationship. Of course Tessa has every right to be mad, at this point they are drawn to each other, and just don't like each other but have absolutely zero ground in showing toxicity in a relationship.When they call for a truce:
*Coffee shop- hardin polite, settles for friends
hangs out with tessa at lake - shares intimate moment, changes his mind, ' i don't think we can just be friends'
*Restaurant: Both Tessa and Hardin enjoy each other's company until his friends show up, that when he starts being a bit cold
*Tessa's plan to break it off with Noah, Hardin changes his mind again, to 'Don't break up with him on my account, I don't date'- Tessa has a right to be upset. They did share a moment not too long ago, and she also did feel like he does not want to be seen with her when his friends show up. That is sure, hell a lot of mixed message.
*Noah at campus, Hardin gets jealous when he shows up with Tessa at the bonfire, on top of that gets in a fight with his friend over a game of 'kiss and blow'... the jealousy makes sense, but as to the fight, it does not make any sense at all. There has to be something more than Tessa losing at 'kiss and blow' to cause that fight. Also what the hell did Jace do to deserve getting punched?
*When Landon call Tessa and she shows up to comfort Hardin rather than sticking around with Noah, Hardin pushes her away, at the same time apologizes for his rudeness, she stays, only to end up broken up with Noah and in another argument with Hardin...the next morning. This results in silent treatment. Tessa putting her focus on school work, ignoring her mom and Hardin. (This also feels like it came a bit too soon)At this point, I expect to a blow up and some signs of toxicity. The blow up between Tessa and Noah as well as Tessa and Hardin are quite anti- climatic. I expected to see more effort on Hardin's part, after all, Hardin was the cause of the break up between two childhood friends. All Tessa did was walk away from Hardin when he was trying to talk to her, which is understandable, I expected more between them, not a single text from Hardin asking 'Why won't you talk to me' to Hardin waiting on the roof for Tessa to come around. The waiting I expected, but only AFTER he puts in an effort to talk to Tessa.When their relationship changes:
After Hardin's drunk incident, over his dad's second marriage, and the break up with Noah, that is when Tessa's and Hardin's relationship changes (no surprise).
Hardin and Tessa would spend time together during their free time together and away from Hardin's friends, Tessa ditching class, Hardin getting Tessa to enjoy life a bit more. The two pairing is perfect in helping Tessa climb out of her shell, to Hardin stepping up once he find out Tessa's mom cutting her off, because of him.
As to how Hardin steps up, Both Tessa and Hardin are living together in his dad's friends apartment. This makes absolute no sense, I could understand if Hardin and Tessa moves into his dad's place or illegally sharing a room, or Tessa getting a job right after she gets cut off from her mom, or Tessa moving into Landon's place sharing the rent, that way she's not always with Hardin.Tessa is able to get Hardin to open up. She know there's bad blood between Hardin and his dad, but he doesn't know the full story, only that his dad left and his mom living in a dump, finding out more about it at his dad's wedding reception. Of course Tessa would feel protective for him. This is when she fall in love with him, and lets him have her.The betrayal:
Return to school, Molly spends time playing with Tessa's mind.
This in a way I could see as a toxicity in a relationship, but it wasn't constant in the movie as in asking 'What is Molly talking about', 'whats going on between you and her Hardin?', 'What are you keeping from me Hardin?', etc. I did not like this part of the movie, It made Tessa seem needy. It seem to be continuously making Tessa look needy and only one scene of her sticking up for herself. This section of the movie is something i would consider in a toxic relationship. When Tessa asks Hardin about what Molly was referring to, he closes up. Any type relationship is a two way street, one that needs to be based on honesty, not matter how sensitive the topic is. Hardin being Hardin, went to his friends when it got tough, he cares for Tessa, but at the same time he was pushing her away. In the process of pushing her away, Tessa ends up having hear the truth from his friends.The argument after the truth has been revealed:
I was quite disappointed. This part of the scene was very much downplayed. I expected a blow up, a big blow up. Tessa wanting to throw something at Hardin in front of his friends blow up. At the same time I was also happy with the fact Tessa was in shock. I would be in shock. Honestly in reality I do not know how I would be react in terms of how shock I would be or how I would respond. The way Tessa responded made her see a more mature and grown, but it could have been better. In any toxic relationship I believe there is also constant past mistakes or occurrences mentioned and brought up repeatedly to show constant reminder. That did not happen. The only part that was repeated that had to with the past, was when Hardin mentioned, 'You said nothing could change the way that you felt about me'. Tessa never mentioned anything about the faults of Hardin's. All she did was walk away after stating that they're both liars.What bothered me:
It was mostly Hardin and Tessa during the movie, there was no back story involving Landon, or any of Hardin's friend. I would say Hardin's friends showed up for maybe bout 10 minutes, and Landon for 5 minutes. Then the wedding reception, it makes absolutely no sense in her meeting the dad or Landon's mom that night of the reception. There was a lot of holes that could be filled in a more constructive way. The apartment, also makes no sense. More of Tessa's & Hardin's college life could have been shared, without either of them together..In terms of ratings of contents within the movie:
Sexual 4/5
Drugs 4/5
College Party 2/5
Language 2/5I'm not sure how to rate theses topic. Honestly, the portrayal of college party is pretty poor.For a teen movie, this would be okay to watch.",After

I did miss some of the love hate relationship they have, as it keeps us from seeing that passion they so clearly have. But the movie doesn't lack for chemistry between the characters. I love the extra scenes they added, like the library and the letter at the end. I liked seeing more of the love, and less of the fighting that drive me nuts in the book.

realizing that they will probably never finish making a movie series, i started reading the series. i read book 1 (After) and it is COMPLETELY different from the movie - it's ridiculous. it's like they picked random scenes and meshed them together.
the following is a list of some differences.
in this movie, stephs girlfriend, Tristan, is actually a boy in the series. the movie shows them staying in an apartment, as hardin claims a professor is out of town, when really they leased their own apartment. scene with her mom doesn't happen as it does in the book. ¿Jace? i don't even remember seeing him. the truth or dare scene video towards the end is different in the books , where it is the last scene and she basically goes off with Zed in his car so he explains , leading to book 2. ZED isn't even a supporting character like he is in the books. the internship office isn't seen. half the book is intimacy and the other half is fighting, so it's basically a PG version since we see little to no scenes of intimacy/love.

215,gabcekiskyte,No storyline whatsoever...,3,12 April 2019,"Movie started great and I was expecting a lot from the beginning, but come on, there is no storyline at all!So we see this girl in the beginning of movie who is ready to go to college. She seems dedicated and good girl, in general. Her mom is concerned about room she is going to live in. She is afraid Tessa's (protagonist) roommates could have bad influence on her... annnnddd from here everything starts to happen really fast. Mom is quickly convinced that room is good to live although she smelled weed when she was in there. Then Tessa's partying roommates invite her to party, then people there play 'truth or dare', then Tessa gets asked if she's a virgin, then she is dared to kiss Hardin, she rejects him, later they almost kiss in the room... Long story short, she falls for Hardin while he seduces her, she breaks up with her boyfriend and later we find out that the dark secret about Hardin was that, in fact, Hardin did this all because he wanted to prove to friends that he could seduce the girl who rejected him. I just got one question - what is the point of all this story? Is there even a story, really? Through all movie, I watch them kissing hundreds of times without reasonable explanation why this good, smart girl makes out with a guy who she barely knows. There is no storyline - just kissing! Also, characters were really unrealistic. In the beginning, they seemed convincing, but later it seemed like I watch something projected in a thirteen-year old's head. Hardin is smart, attractive, good but also a bad guy - in short, perfect. He was convincing when he told Tessa that he doesn't want to be in a relationship. But everything's after that, - just plain nonsense...
Overall, movie does its job if you watch it for kissing scenes. Actors are pretty and they kinda have chemistry between them. But don't expect this movie to have any point - because it doesn't.

She's not a good writer, and makes Hardin seem like a bipolar brat and Tessa seem whiny. But I've watched the movie multiple times. It flows better than the book, the conversations are more genuine and real. And the chemistry between the two lead actors is palpable. Josephine Langford has this gorgeous natural beauty, and she plays the part of an innocent yet headstrong lead perfectly. And Hero has that smoldering stare down perfectly. And they fit together. You truly believe their chemistry, it's one that gives you butterflies in your stomach when they're together. Sure, there are some unbelievable and childish parts to the movie that would never actually happen between college aged people, like playing truth or dare. But that's the book's fault, not the movie.

I don't think it's amazing, and it certainly won't win any prizes for originality (bad boy meets innocent girl, they fall in love, drama unfolds etc) but I don't think the one star reviews are justified. I think the majority of the bad reviews are from people (women mostly) who have read the One Direction fan fic saga which this is based on- and yes if you go into this having read a series of books this probably will disappoint, as screen adaptations usually do. It does have it's bad points; there is very little character development in the movie and the romance between the two teens seems rushed and escalates extremely quickly for instance. The saving grace is the palpable on-screen chemistry between the two leads who work well with each other. This movie wasn't terrible, but it could have been done better if it had been spread over 2 or 3 films. N.B if you are looking for the x-rated content of the book, you'll be further disappointed! But a quick look at the age rating should tell you that's not where this movie goes. So, not bad as a teen love story in it's own right, but avoid if you've read the books I guess.",After

Boy was I wrong.First off, the main character seems to have no control over her own actions and lets herself be manipulated and peer pressured by others around her. I still tried to think positive thinking there would be a character ark or something. But no. If you're familiar with Wattpad, the protagonist is like every teenager there is in this world of fantasy. This whole movie is marketed towards young teenagers which makes sense with the music choice and the movie's plotline. It's good that the characters are almost always consenting to their actions but they act like complete idiots and something the story doesn't even make sense. And the bad acting doesn't help. The directing was nothing special but something it was even distracting and questionable. Wish there was a 0/10 option",After

It wasn't all there. Hero Fiennes Tiffin and Josephine Langford did a great job portraying Hardin and Tessa from the scripts they had. They had the key important scenes from the movie like the Lake, Wedding, Professor Sotos Class, Dorm Room Meet, and the Party scenes. It was all there for great attention but it was PG13. They had the IMPORTANT scenes but not the cute, small, adorable, building up their relationship scenes. The book is R, very R. The director they had didn't want to pursue the routes the book had. This movie was a great beginning for starting a teen romance, please do not shame the actors Hero and Josephine. It breaks your heart at the end of the movie for both, Tessa and Hardin. Even though, they didn't end the film like the book I think they ended it better. I was upset at some of the characters they didn't pursue, plots they didn't do and the scenes they cut. In the books, Hardin is a bad British boy, in the movies they want you to think that but he isn't. The sequel just came out today and was much better. Much closer to the book and it is just amazing. The real Tessa and Hardin come alive! Although, they had some lines and scenes from the first book. Fans were not satisfied with the factor of the whole film, but you can't have movies like the books. In my opinion, I thought the movie was good, it had some book parts in the movie.

First of all, why do so many people kiss with their eyes open in this? Second, what is the timeline of this story? Has Tessa been at school for 2 weeks, 2 months, a full school year....what? The relationship between Hardin and Tessa escalates so quickly yet so awkwardly and there are so many holes in the plot of their story. Their love for historical fiction novels written by famous authors becomes an afterthought 20 minutes in - what was the point of that? Noah and Tessa break up after a love story that started when they were 5 and she's quickly moved on from that, and then suddenly these two are moved in together after 20 seconds of knowing one another....""that seems quick, even for lesbians"" (Oscar Martinez, The Office S6E22).There are a ton of things I could say about this movie, but simply put, this movie is confusing, silly, and has too many stereotypical teenage movie plots smashed together that it just doesn't make sense.

I loved almost every scene but the best one to me is Tessa's escape from the party straight into Hardin's room. It captures emotions from the book like no other scene and if they had left the seductive book sliding, it'd have achieved cult status.

It's an easy movie to watch if you're not trying to be a critic and not comparing it to the books.The casting of the main characters is perfect. Some of the secondary actors need a few acting classes though. The script isn't the best but not terrible either. I am glad I read the books after (hehe) because I probably would have hated the movie because it deviates so much. In the books Hardin is a violent asshat, I don't think they depicted his darkness as well as they could have. Tessa is more of a spitfire in the books. They didn't capture the extent of the passion and the push and pull of their relationship. The movie was so PG that I had NO IDEA that the books were romance novels with descriptive sex scenes until I started reading.

A normal person would be too embarrassed to even let the guy come close, but ..ok. Also,
This guy is cute and smart and has a nice car. Seriously, someone introduce this girl to Shania Twain's ""That don't impress me much"" song. 2 Days after meeting eachother, the guy is already saying he doesnt think he can ever be just friends....the whole scene when they go to the lake the first time ...ugh so farfetched. This boy is crawling with ref flags: punching a guy out of nowhere, drinking by the pool, the ""i dont date"" line. Not that Tessa is doing any better for herself either: running after a boy when she has a boyfriend, and then spending the night with said boy while her boyfriend is in town to visit, and then telling the poor kid ""im confused"", argues with a mom over said boy, risks her own studies and still thinks its all very normal.

A teen romance with a little angst. I had read the first book on wattpad years ago and remember being able to get through it and liking the characters pretty well. One of the better things that the movie accomplished was dialing back Hardin's over the top behavior. While he is broody and tortured, he is also realistic. People don't just lash out all the time in violent and abusive ways. He would have been under psychiatric care if he acted that way in the real world. In the books, quite a lot of his actions definitely come across as abusive and cruel. The sex was also handled well. Slow build up with excellent chemistry between the leads. Tessa was also much more realized than in the original book. She was kinda Mary Sue originally. This made her seem like a more real person. I thought both Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin worked well in their roles. They played off of each other well and the emotion came through. The reveal scene at the diner broke my heart. You could feel the anguish coming off both of the main characters. Tessa's sinking horror and Hardin's desperation to stop what was coming. This is a teen romance and played perfectly. I am actually looking forward to the next movie to see how it comes together. My only real complaint was that the ending seemed a little rushed.

So this movie encourages cheating on your boyfriend - not once but twice! And while poor Noah was literally sleeping in Tessa's bed, she goes out and makes out with Hardin and then SLEEPS IN HIS BED. WHAT?! Talk about evil on her part. And then my next problem is her mom. Who just busts into someone's dorm room? Why didn't she call or knock? That's just an insanely rude invasion of privacy. And then she cuts her daughter off for liking a boy she doesn't know? Does this mother even talk to her child? I thought they were supposed to be close since the dad left? So dumb. And then my final issue is her friend Steph. Who the F just stands by and let's that entire situation unfold? She was there when the bet started, there when the relationship developed, and then just sits there when the truth comes out? She could've said something at the beginning if she cared about Tessa at all. This movie encourages cheating (but using condoms!), destroying your relationship with your family/friends over a guy you hardly know, and being friends with people who literally could care less about you. Tessa's character has no strength, love for herself or respect for her family.

A group of twelve years olds next to us who bursted into laughter everytime a kiss was a little more intense and when they saw a condom didn't really help to create a romantic atmosphere. But at the end of the day it is a movie for them. For a teen girls who weren't in love yet, who still live in their dream world, who still have their whole love life ahead of them.

Even in the movie trailer Hardin looks like the guy next door. Without the black clothes, the leather jacket and nice car he could have been casted for Noah. Although He does have a few tattoos in the movie and what bothers me strongly is the fact that from the little tattoos he's got, he's got a big one on his back. In the books his front size is full of tattoos but his back is plain. In one of the next books this is important. Not only Hardins appearance changed in the movie. I feel like his whole personaIity changed. I get that the movie is pg 13 but they made everything so soft it looses a big part of its story and with it its appeal. Don't get me wrong it's a likeable movie. Tessa is played wonderful. I think if you watch the movie without reading the book you are watching a nice love story. But nothing more.

This movie fixed everything that I didn't like about the books. For example, it brought a diversity of personalities which you don't see in the books and there were way less ""Tessa crying"" moments, which were so repetitive in the books. HERO played Hardin AMAZINGLY WELL. I never thought they could find an actor who would so closely resemble Hardin--but they did. I remember Hero playing the young Tom Riddle in Harry Potter and I knew instantly that his career would take off when he got older. His ability to play dark, brooding characters is truly phenomenal.Josephine was absolutely beautiful, confident and strong. She is the Tessa I prefer to the Tessa in the books. Her smile, her eyes, her voice, everything she did was perfect. She LOOKED exactly as I pictured in my head.For those diehard fans of After that didn't like it, I truly feel bad. However, movies are never like the books.....take Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings just as a few examples.This movie is so romantic and beautifully filmed. It is not a waste of your money so please go see it!!!!!!!!!!!",After

I've seen a lot of reviews whining about how it's not like the book, newsflash not every movie is gonna be like the books. Like hello twilight had changes & Harry Potter had ALOT of changes. If you've read the books you have to go into the movie theater with an open mind. Yes there are gonna be changes & a lot of new scenes that weren't in the book. But for those of you that have known this series since it was released should just be thankful we got a movie, & hopefully the rest of the series as well. This movie had to be re made enough so that even people who haven't read the books will go see it. It's still amazing even with the changes. They couldn't have chosen better people for the parts honestly. Josephine & hero for one work great as Tessa & Hardin. Yes he's softer in the movie but come on people be honest, there was no way they could go back & fourth back & fourth with the arguing & harshness between Hardin & Tessa & still be able to make the story into a movie. I'm 21 years old & have loved this series since the beginning, even I knew there was gonna be changes because the first book is long. & they needed to cut or do whatever to make it a real movie. Again if you have read the series & are nervous about seeing the movie because of everything you've been hearing, don't be. It's still just as great! I loved the movie & I hope they will be able to make the rest! Enjoy it guys & fall in love with Hardin & Tessa (our hessa) all over again on the big screen!",After

The changes that they made were necessary in my opinion and I prefer the ""softer"" Hardin from the movie.

Sometimes, I don't really have problems with flawed stories, but this just bothered me.Hardin is supposed to be Tessa's love interest, but the problem for me is that there was no chemistry. In the beginning I felt like he was disrespectful and a jerk towards her. She first wants to stay loyal to her boyfriend and denies him. Then he decides to take her to his favourite place and they kiss. There was no romantic build up. It just felt rushed and sudden.I feel like there was not one character that I really liked. There decisions were sometimes so irrational that it just didn't seem realistic. I know it's a fictional story, but I didn't feel really fleshed out.The end wasn't great either, but I've read that their will be a second movie, that the story isn't over yet, so perhaps it will become better.My conclusion is that I didn't like the movie and characters. I feel like there are too many romantic tropes forced in this movie. I hope the book is better than the movie tbh.",After

The acting was average at best, but it wasn't like the characters were exactly the most complex to portray, so I suppose the actors did their job. In addition, the characters either fit complete stereotypes or simply did not have any personalities at all. Side note: I refuse to applaud Anna Todd for making the movie ""diverse"". She made Tristan a girl, which would have been interesting had Pia Mia been on the screen for more than 4 minutes. Anyone else getting the same queerbaiting vibes as Riverdale? And representing the African American community with Landon wouldn't have been a problem had he had more duties than being the typical 'black best friend's stereotype.The biggest thieves of the screens were the two main characters, Tessa and Hardin. The movie focused much more on the romance between them rather than them as individual people with separate stories and personalities. For a movie that bragged about encouraging empowerment, they sure made Tessa seem dependent on Hardin and hinted at her being irrelevant without Hardin. I mean, a lot of romance movies are guilty of this, but still, it makes for some pretty unrelatable and boring characters, especially the female lead. Another side note: Josephine Langford is an okay actress, however the producers should have told her that her Australian accent came through way too much and asked her to do the scene again. The editing was a bit odd, including a lot of shots of characters just staring at each other and extreme close ups of body parts and objects. Jenny Gage was way too dependent on montages to save this film. In terms of plot, some of the character motives were lost in the fast-paced nature of the film. Believe me, it was incredibly too fast. This is something that happens a lot in book to film adaptations, since it is very difficult to cram what would be a 10 hour reading session in a 2 hour movie, but still, they could have tried a bit harder. Instead of trying to stuff a film with new scenes that have zero relevance, this movie should have at least tried to include scenes from the book that may have been a waste of time as well but at least they weren't brought out of thin air.

There is still so much see and witness from the book and these actors. There is SO much more of the story we love to be told. The books as Tessa & Hardin were written in 2014.. to make it adapt to 2019 there were changes. GOOD changes. And adaptation of the book isn't making it exactly like the book itself, it's taking bits and pieces (important) pieces and making it into its own!

I was really excited for the movie and I couldn't wait to watch it, but then I did; I was completely disappointed. I get that that you can't put everything into the movie but I felt like they weren't even trying hard enough to make that happen for fans. First all the scenes were all over the place and were too short. For example Tessa and Hardin are in a library and he reads a sentence for like two seconds and they get up and run from the security guard. That scene was really irrelevant. All the scenes were like that, this movie didn't capture Hardin and Tessa's true relationship. Important parts were missing from the movie, it felt like I was watching two strangers trying to be like them but in a chessy way. Hardin looked emotional the whole time, it didn't feel like him. I get that they wanted to tone him down a bit, but honestly they shouldn't have. I brought a couple of friends and they even said they shouldn't have made him too soft. I'm more upset that they changed the bet scene. I can't believe they did that. It was the worst movie I've ever seen. It didn't have that effect on me like the books. They ruined this movie. I feel like if he's already soft and whatever what's the point of the other movies if they make more. I thought the point of Hardin being an asshole was important because he changes later throughout the books and then Tessa wasn't Tessa. Tessa was so different, her personality, stuff that she wouldn't say. Zed was hardly in the movie, he wasn't apart of anything. I don't know why jace had more scenes than him, He was irrelevant in the books. They should've made it like the books or at least try to. I honestly hope they don't make more movies, I felt like if people who didn't read the books would find this like a stupid chessy movie.",After

I will agree that the movie wasn't exactly like the book, but considering the fact that the book was 400 pages, I think the movie was pretty good at cutting it down. The movie did a great job softening Hardin's character, and Tessa was slightly more sassy and less sensitive, which, in my opinion, was better. My recommendation: Watch the movie with a fresh mind, not with expectations from the book. If you have already seen the movie, watch it again. Watching it the second time helps you focus on the movie itself, instead of ""how it was compared to the book.""

It's about forgiveness and unconditional love, and it shows how much a person can change, really change, if they try hard enough and if they really want to. It's the type of story that shows that anything and everything is possible when it comes to self-recovery. After shows that if you have someone to lean on, someone who loves you and doesn't give up on you, you can find your way out of the darkness. It shows that no matter what type of parents you had, or type of addictions you faced, you can overcome anything that stands in your way and truly become a better person. Tessa took Hardin's hand and led him out of the darkness, whilst discovering herself and what she truly wants in the process. I swear the book and movie changed my life.

I didn't read the book before watching so I didn't know the exact storyline but now even tho I read the book, I find it even better. ( after the movie I rushed to read the book because I wanted mooree! and the movie is to short xoxo)Hero and Jo are very well matched to play these roles and I'm so glad that specifficaly they got the leading roles. Their chemistry is soo goood I watched the movie again and again like about 6-7 times in a row, in just few days!!!
They did such a great job and their facial expressions and movements are incredible. If I wasn't aware I was watching a movie, I would have thought they are really feeling everything and really falling for each other. Just magnificent.
I know the inspiration for the leading male character was Harry Styles, but I'm really glad they picked out Hero because I couldn't imagine Harry or any onther guy looking similar to Harry in the movie. Hero looks so good in that bad boy attitude. Also, Jo playing Molly, ugh noo! So glad it turned out this way.My favorite part is that look on Hardin's face while Tessa is leaning with her head in the water, to hear one more time the silence which Hardin showed her a few minutes ago..that look is everything! that's when he changed and didn't even knew so that was awesome. Second best scene was when he wote on her back ""i love you"" in the bathtub. I loved that so much, and the way he looked at her when she asked ""what was it?"" adorable.
third best one is when Tessa runs out of MyBob's and they both cry and he tells her that it was all before and she didn't let him finish, otherwise he probably would have said ""i love you"".. that's a very good one beacuse it's like that in real life so this love story also has little life messages throughout the movie which if you pay attention to the details are very nice.I hope they make AFTER 2!! and leave the whole crew in the movie as it is in After.

I love Hardin. He's the most emotional character I've ever read about in YA romance. Tessa, she's okay. She just annoys me, other than that she's pretty cool. But Hardin, I can relate with him in ways I don't want to. Anyways...
The movie is good.... Except everything is different.
1. ZED does not play a very impacting role
2. Hardin doesn't portray his aggressive, jealous, protective self. Which I utterly enjoy him like that in the book. One fight scene (WHICH HE LOST) doesn't count. now I can't even see the actor they've chosen to be aggressive or...the fighting type?
3. The bet was changed. Completely. Unless there gonna add ""some"" large twist in the sequel
4. The ending was nowhere near the same. Tess was supposed to leave with Zed. Not run in the rain to a gas station.
5.The parties. Not the first one. I'm talking all the other times Tessa went there and was met by Hardins rude, mocking, yet hilarious self. My favorite part in the book is when he scares Neil after he was trying to touch Tessa. Like cmon? That was just a scene that should have been included. Hell, it was there first kiss.
6. Landon wasn't as big of a character as he is in the books.
7. Dakota? Where is she...?
8. Tessas attitude! Where was it? It's like the only thing I like towards that girl
9. They never tell eachother that they love eachother...Hardin legit writes it on her back..with soap. And she didn't get it. ANOTHER FAVORITE PART OF MINE IN THE BOOK is when Hardin tells Tess he loves her and Tessas says ""I love you too"" and he says ""Don't say too."" And then Ya know several times in the series he always gets Tessa to repeat saying I love you to him because he just loves to know she loves him.
10. Sex scene and make out scene were a no-go. They legit could have left them out because they were not the best. They could have had a whole like twenty minutes back and use those minutes to recreate scenes from the book. I don't know
11. Where was Hardin worrying about her? Showing up at her room? Barging In for her? Those parts are amazing in the book.
12. Sorry one more thing. Hardin doesn't have any tattoos on his back (well...for now) why the hell were like all of his tattoos on his back?Well I could go on and on so I guess we should go over to the positivesThe good part of the movie1. The lake scene was very well played out, although I was missing the humor and laughing. The lake scene in the movie seemed, really, serious.
2. Tessas necklace. It's such a small detail. But it's the best thing I've ever seen. Instead of the infinity symbol being tattooed on Hardins wrist, it's a necklace on Tessas neck.
3. Molly. I LOVE MOLLY. Molly is probably one of my favorite characters. She played her character SO WELL in this movie. The actor is stunning!
4. The ending letter. Even though this part isn't in the book, I Greatly appreciated the Bronte reference.
5. Hardin. Okay as much as I hated the fact they didn't show the dark, emotional, ""tough"" Hardin. I did like the actor and in his scenes he did pretty great.
6. Landon is just a sweetheart
7. I think one of my favorite parts in the movie is when Hardin tells Tessa ""If you wanna dump Mr. Highschool go ahead. But don't do it on my account."" And then tessas storm off or whatever. The way Hardin reacted after it as she walked off where he mouthed the word ""Fu#k"" was just...I don't know...impactful.",After

I get that every book that gets turned into a movie needs certain changes to make it work in movie land, but to change huge factors of the storyline to the point that it doesn't make any sense doesn't just confuse me but makes me ask why? There was so much content in that one book what I didn't see a reason to differ the storylines.My main issues
*Why was Zed hardly in there when he had a huge role?
*Why was Meadow a professor it was supposed to be a male and her acting was sub bar at most..
*Why was Jace in the movie more than Zed?
*Why change the huge plotline?
*Why make it that they fell in love so quickly to the point you don't even feel anything from it..
*Why was there so many damn montages and hardly any actual dialogue?

As someone who has read the books, I can understand the appeal behind the story: ordinary girl who falls in love with troubled and mysterious boy, finally feeling free to engage in an unhealthy romance with someone she barely knows (we all have seen that before).
Regardless of my opinion of the story, the film's execution was simply painful. The plot is non-existent, everything happens so fast that you don't have time to understand what these people are doing with their lives, you don't even understand why these people like each other, the main couple has no chemistry at all and even the end that should be shocking does not bring you the least empathy for the characters.
It is a story that begins and goes nowhere, since you are left without understanding the attitudes and choices of the characters.
Unfortunately, just another book that had a horrible adaptation.
Any resemblance to Twilight may not be so much of a coincidence.",After
330,mikeysmom,Where to begin!!! Major Spoilers,4,19 April 2019,"I am actually really surprised by the positive reviews by the book readers of this series. This movie was such a disappointment. If I hadn't read the books it wouldn't have been that bad. But they chopped it up so bad it was almost unrecognizable and frankly I'm surprised Anna Todd would let them butcher her books.They left out so much, I can't even begin because there was soooooo much left out and out of order. It also seemed to me like they were trying to fill some politically correct quota. Steph is not gay, Tristan is a dude?!! How does her being gay even fit with why she ends up doing to Tessa what she does later on in the book. Also Landon is not black! Like wtf, are we so PC now that every movie has to have at least one black and one gay character? It's lame! I honestly don't see how they could even have a sequel as the stuff Hardin writes is given to Tessa by the teacher, and that's pretty much the end of the book!!! (Which doesn't happen like that in the book, and also Soto is a dude not a woman!)It's like they met and moved in together in the first 10 min! The bet was such a climax of the book and they skimmed over it like it was nothing and didn't even mention her virginity once in the movie. Zed was barely a character in the movie and in the book he's the 3rd main character. The mom was all wrong,
They left out the 100 times they broke up and got back together. All Hardin's rudeness and crassness and meanness was no where to be found. Ken and Karen and Vance and Kim were huge players in the book and we never even saw them in the movie?? There was no London, no talk of Hardin's past, and why the hell was Noah at the bon fire?? She went with zed and Landon and Dakota. And suck and blow didn't come until way later.Ugh, I am so upset and even more disappointed that Anna Todd let them take her work and totally murder it for a pay check. At least Fifty shades and Twilight stuck to the book. Just leaving out the raunchiest of sex parts. Sex was a huge part of this book. And why was she wearing an infinity necklace??? The infinity symbol is suppose to be Hardin's Tattoo. The only thing they got right was who they chose as Tess and Hardin.",After

One of the only things I hated about the movie was the script. It seemed like Harden was just asking questions all the time to Tessa and not having real conversations with her.

354,biancabbswart,I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't satisfied either,5,12 April 2019,"There were parts of this movie that were romantic and left everyone in the cinema feeling smitten. However, having read the books, I have a few bones to pick.The beginning was quite rushed so their relationship was not developed well. One second they meet each other and the next they are already at the lake ... and anyone who has seen the movie or read the book knows what happens at the lake; it was all too fast for me to truly feel happy and excited that they are finally getting together.The movie was oddly PG. Anyone who has read the books will know that the books are a lot more passionate. It is confusing as to why a story about college students is kept so PG when college students in general aren't PG. They adapted a very intimate and non-PG book into a PG movie, which many who read the book might be disappointed by, as I was.This is an oddly specific bone to pick, but: I felt the placement of the scene where they argue in class over Elizabeth Bennet came too soon. They are in essence arguing about Tessa being interested in Hardin, but by then that didn't seem like an issue. Perhaps this scene would have made more sense being after the lake and restaurant scene where she does confront him about whether he is embarrassed to be seen with her. But, what is done is done.Lastly, the movie did not portray the essence of the love-hate relationship in the book. Where was Hardin's jealousy and possessiveness? Where was Tessa's attitude towards Hardin? They tried to capture the complicated nature of Hardin's character when he tells the story of his drunken father and his mother whilst at his dad's wedding, but there was no development on this - I didn't see emphasis on the relationship issues he seemed to have in the book. Also, in the book I myself had a love-hate relationship with Hardin's character, but in the movie I simply just enjoyed looking at Hero Fiennes-Tiffin considering how good looking he is.All in all, it was still an enjoyable movie and I could tell a lot of hard work went into it. The movie was beautiful to watch, especially the lake scene and the bathtub scene (which was an especially cute scene). I also have appreciation for the attention to consent and safe sex practices. Casting was done well; Josephine Langford (Tessa) and Hero Fiennes-Tiffin (Hardin) we're extremely well suited to their characters, but I feel they could have done more with their characters if they were given the opportunity.The romantic scenes were cute and made me smile, but the movie lacked the deeper layer that the book has about how complicated people can be, and the message of learning to love someone despite their flaws as well as trying to be a better person for the one you love. Considering Ana Todd (the author of After) was on set all the time, I am confused as to why she allowed the movie to stray so far from the core messages of the book.Small details of the book were included and did leave a smile on my face when they came up as they reminded me of the effect the book initially had on me, but the bigger-picture messages and themes of the book seemed missing.Viewers who have not read the book may be confused by the fast pace, as I used a lot of my knowledge from the book to fill in gaps.Reading the book does cloud my judgement, so I would like to emphasize that it was still a good movie which I plan to rewatch many times.Should you watch this movie? Yes.Do I want a sequel? Yes; I am hoping much of what was left out in this movie was because they plan to make a sequel, one which is more passionate and explores the complicated nature of Hardin and Tessa. The movie did not have the same effect on me as the book did, but I would still watch it again and tell others to watch it.",After

Well, I got really disappointed. If you have read the books, you're going to be really disappointed as well.

It is boring because 90% of the film nothing much different happens, most of the times is just music playing and Tessa and Hardin kissing and making out. The dialogues are weak, they barely even talk, and if they do, is just hi and how are you. Basically, the characters met and 5 seconds later are already declaring eternal love. No sense at all. The storyline is poor and doesn't respect the film at all. For me, the film killed the book.

I have not yet read the books, but I still loved the movie. No movie will ever be as good as the book! And that's the understanding anyone has to have before watching a film based on a book series.
The lead roles were acted well and I understood and felt the story of the main characters, no matter how rushed they felt. The film is filled with romance and Hero and Josephine, as Hardin and Tessa, respectfully, had great chemistry and are beautiful together.
I'm just saying, regardless that the movie couldn't cover every facet of the book, it's still fun and beautiful and not a waste of time at all for anyone who loves watching movies about love and all it's dark, dramatic, silly and sometimes dumb sides. I'm looking forward to the sequel.

3. Information that was given from the book that changed the whole story, wasn't shown in the movie.

Well, first of all, im going to say something that maybe some of you will hate me for. I do not personally think that Hero should be Hardin. Hero just looks so innocent to be Hardin in my opinion. I think maybe Samuel Llarson could've been Hardin.
I think everything was just happening too fast, one minute they were in the coffee shop and next minute they were at the lake. I mean, show us some passion or some emotions.
The other thing that bothered me was that the story of Hardin's bet was completely different. Zed wasn't involved whatsoever and Tessa and Zed had no relationship or no communication in the movie. Hardin wasn't jelous at all and i really wanted to see Zed and Hardin trying to win Tessa. Zed was not involved in any way.
They also jumped to the wedding scene too quickly. They didn't show Tessa meeting Karen or Ken, they just met at the wedding for the first time. And they told Hardin's mothers tragic story that kept him from sleeping very briefly. We didn't see Hardin struggle after Tessa left him and suddenly they just met at the lake again? I know that movie adaptations are very different from the movie but they changed and skipped a lot of important stuff. Not to mention the movie was oddly PG. I know, i know. It was released as PG-13 in US but not worldwide. No profanity, no swearing, no passion, no sexuality. I mean, Hardin is literally a man who swears a lot, fights a lot and who has sex a lot. This movie shouldn't have been like this. I just did not imagine it to be like this. I hope we get a second and a third movie to fill the void. Im keeping my expectations still high for the upcoming movies and hope that they will portray the characters better.",After

The fighting back and forth left me wanting more. I read the books within 3 weeks because I couldn't stop.... I was addicted.The movie was so rushed and all the good bits where left out or changed. This movie gave no justice to the books at all. They changed the bet from taking her virginity to falling in love and switching it off... Why why why? This bet has such a vital role to play in thier relationship.They missed the fights at the frat house, they changed the timeline of where and when he took her virginity. They ruined the lake scene that was such a massive part of the beginning of their insane relationship.The portal of her mom was so off the mark. Her mom was a perfectionist. In the movie she looked and acted like a normal mom. As was with Noah. Noah is a clean cut boy and in the movie he looks more like a beach bum.So much detail missed, so many big scenes left out.If you are going to make a movie based on the book, then do it based on the book.

408,kihyuklim,Absolutely Terrible,1,23 April 2019,"This movie is the most cliché movie I've ever seen. A cliché movie can be good. But, this movie definitely is one of the worst. It succeeded in nothing. I wonder if this will even make enough money to cover its budget. It's obvious that this was made as a money grabber, but I think that it's stupidity will stop it from even being a money grabber. First off, sometimes the screenwriting and directing can be bad, but the acting can somewhat save the movie. This movie definitely doesn't do that. All the actors and actresses in this movie show how bad a person can act. This made me feel like I was watching a B-rated movie(obviously it was one). The guy who plays the role of Hardin shows how someone with only looks can be in a movie. His acting makes me feel like I someone is spitting acid into my eyes. Whenever he says something, I could feel the awkwardness. Was that in the script? No. It's clear that this character is supposed to be some ""cool"" and ""interesting"" character. All this actor shows me is how awkward acting can be. In fact, the there is no chemistry between any of the characters. Hardin and Tessa? No. Tessa and her mom? No. Tessa and every other character? No. Hardin and every other character? No. Every time there was an interaction between any characters, I felt as if they were reading off a script. Obviously they were, but an actors job is to make that seem impossible. Their job is to make the audience believe what they're watching. Nothing in this movie felt realistic. Nothing in this movie made me interested in it.Second, the plot was just a disaster. For example, it was no surprise that they would do a truth or dare game and it'll be revealed that the main girl is a virgin. It was no surprise when her mom came into her dorm when the two were making out. It was no surprise that the the guy started to date the girl as a bet. It was the plot of some 10 year old's fan fiction. Even a 90 year old grandpa could write a better teen romance than this. The screenwriting was written in a mess. Why? The screenwriter's job is to show the audience what the characters feel. Their job is to make these characters not one dimensional. Every character should have a motive. Yes. Even the sub characters. If you want to make a great film, every character should be filled with emotion and motives. The first character that makes absolute no sense is Tessa. She is written to be a goody two shoes girl that turns into a ""I-Lost-My Virginity"" girl. Now if they really wanted to make the main character a cliché character, they should've gave her depth. No, they do the exact opposite. She is seen to become a bad girl just because she meets the boy. That's exactly it. There's nothing special about him. He just falls in love with him and feels like she should become rebellious. It's actually pretty idiotic. She's the most one dimensional character I've ever seen on screen. Now Harden is just a guy. A guy that has an English accent and is mysterious. That's it. He's just there to show how what love is to the main girl. I could go on like this to every character in this movie because that's how problematic the screenwriting is.In conclusion, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I regret spending 8 dollars on this. It's worth nothing. I can't believe some people would watch this movie and think that it's actually watchable. If anyone would want to watch a movie with no plot, no depth in the characters, no sense in anything, I would recommend this movie. Absolute disaster of a movie it truly is.",After

I've been more than ecstatic, fangirling over the movie with my friend and making plans to see it with her for months. I decided to see it beforehand with my mom, and I can just say thank God.After (movie) is nothing like I expected. It's also barely like the book. Some of the scenes are recognizable, yes, but they are out of order or not even complete. I understand that a book as big as After can't be fit in an hour and forty-six minutes (though you could definitely make it longer), but I expected more out of it. The main plot of the book, the bet, was barely even there. No loss of virginity was mentioned, only shown, and the whole ordeal seemed to be based around Hardin making her fall in love with him and then breaking her heart. A little cliche if you ask me.A few of the main aspects of Tessa's character wasn't present, there was barely any Noah which I think is a HUGE contributing factor to the plot and her relationship with Hardin, barely any of their friends, and not much concerning Landon and the relationship between Hardin and his dad. I do like how they planned the apartment in the movie. It makes so much more sense than the two of them buying an apartment together after only a few months of dating, if you can even call it that.Overall, the movie wasn't much like the book and the main points were most certainly absent in the film.The acting was okay. I wasn't expecting too much considering there aren't really any big name actors in this movie which is understandable. I think it was pretty good considering.If there is a second movie, I will watch it, but I'm ready for disappointment. Perhaps I had gone into this movie with too many expectations and that's what ruined it.(Let's not even mention the teeny boppers behind me talking and squealing every two seconds)",After

Hardin is a bit softer than in the book, but I don't mind that at all because it's perfect for the movie.

The movie was really interesting to me and I didn't feel board thoughout the whole thing. The movie and the book are very different to each other but still similar to each other in another way which was a nice new take on the story. The new scenes that were added in the movie were really cute and fun to watch too. I think both Hero and Josephine did a great job in portraying Hardin and Tessa. Josephine is really what I pictured Tessa to look and be like and her acting was enjoyable. Hero was amazing!! I loved his portrayal of Hardin Scoot I thought he did a fantastic job even though Hardin was a lot more softer in the movie than in the book which didn't really please me and a fan of the book but I felt it worked well with the story line of the movie. However even though I enjoyed the film sooooo much as a fan of the book I feel like some characters weren't played to their full potential in the movie my main concern was the absence of Zed's infatuation with Tessa which was very much present in the books but not in the film. The other characters also didn't get much screen time in the movie which was a shame as you couldn't see their true personalities but none the less I still enjoyed the film very much and I hope that there will be a sequel to the movie as there is a lot more to the story of Hardin and Tessa,After

Yes there were changes from the book, but there is a huge difference in how much you can include in a book vs. a movie. I think the changes were great and those who have read the book need to go into the movie with an open mind. I had a friend accompany me who has never read the book and she absolutely loved the movie and how relatable it was, especially to her college experience freshman year. Sure, there were some things I wish were included and I wish there could've been more time to explain certain things, but like I said there is only so much you can include in a movie adaptation. I think the changes benefited the movie for an overall audience to make it appeal to everyone, and not just book readers.

I went in with an open mind because I know that book-to-film adaptations are not and are never going to be the exact same. It's just not possible. With this being said, filmmaking is just another medium of storytelling. And that's exactly what After did. It retold the story in a more modern and different way, and it was absolutely refreshing and beautiful. All the little things that we loved in the books from the characters' mannerisms to the lines/jokes to the entire vibe of the story, it was all there. The essence was there just like Anna said.

There were some things that the characters did that I was like ""hardin would never"" or ""im not really sure if that would happen"" but Hero did such an amazing job of showing the brokenness and complexity of the character. Josephine was also The most amazing and perfect Tessa we could have gotten, and their CHEMISTRY! It's really something you have to go and see for yourself. The main problem I had was the editing. I really hope we get some kind of extended cut or something on dvd because there were parts where it would skip to the next scene and it was confusing at times. For someone who hasn't read the books they would have no idea what was going on. So hopefully for the sequel *fingers crossed* the editing is better. Overall I would recommend going and seeing this in my opinion the Story is still there, but we need to have the other movies in order to fully develop it.",After

For people who have read them all as well, I just want to say that it is best to walk into the theater with an open mind due to the fact that it is nearly impossible to fit an entire 600 pages into a film. Some things are changed from the novel and in my opinion I think it is for the best because I will admit...the book can be a little harsh for the big screen BUT 'After' is NOT romanticizing an abusive relationship. It is about two non-perfect people who find each other in the dark and bring light at the end. It's not a fairy tale story but it is a real one. A real life story that needs to be told considering the fact that there are people around the world who, more or less, have the same storyline as Tessa and Hardin. Personally speaking, I believe that everyone (read the books or not) will love this film! It's different from other romance movies and it is something new to people. It will leave the audience lost for words and wanting more for a sequel!!!",After
426,kramirez-47050,"A different adaptation of the book, but a beautiful film!",10,12 April 2019,"The book and the movie were very different from one another so when I watched the film it was hard to not want more. I feel like they did a great job with the casting, and I loved the actors chemistry! It was such a beautiful film, but I feel like a lot of people might be disappointed if they compared it to the books. If you separate them, you will enjoy the movie on its own. It definitely had a lot of potential, and I feel like they could have made the movie longer so that people who haven't read the book would understand what was going on because their love story felt rushed at the beginning. However, I really want them to make a second film and focus on keeping the relationship complicated. This film didn't really have any fights scenes, and I feel like it was a big part of what made their relationship so complicated. They definitely needed to expand the Hardin's character more so the viewers could see why Hardin was the way he was. Either ways, I loved the ending and overall the film left me feeling happy.",After
427,delacuevagwen,A MASTERPIECE,10,12 April 2019,"Have i words to explain how much this film is amazing?No. Yes,i'm speechless,there aren't words or adjectives worthy of this film,it's more than amazing.
Why?
it isn't just a teen love story, it teaches a lot, especially for the age in which we live, it has been adapted for an audience in 2019. we all need to get a message from this film, everyone has their own. And i think it isn't comparable to other films. And obviously the acting exceeds the perfection, the actors identified themselves in their character and made the film truly believable and spectacular.
What are you waiting for?Go to the cinema,now!",After
428,sheenaanthony,Blown Away,10,12 April 2019,"This movie was GREAT! I am typically scared when my fave books turn into movies because the actors they choose may not fit your imagination or scenes you fell in love with may not make it into the film. With After??? I was pleasantly surprised!!! The cast was perfect, I felt I was experiencing their experiences as the movie went on. I was completely engulfed in the romantic relationship but more importantly by how Hero and Josephine were BOTH able to portray those strong emotions so effortlessly. They both are great actors and take their craft SERIOUSLY. I certainly hope we see more. Also, the soundtrack for this movie was PERFECT, sometimes you get a good soundtrack and you watch the film and it seems the songs dont ""match"" the scene you're looking at, but that was not the case at all!! Honestly, it's very evident the hardwork that went into this movie by everyone! Congrats to Anna, Hero, Josephine, Khadijah, Shane and just the whole gang!!! #proudafternator",After

They left out a lot of scenes that would've explained the relationship of Hardin and Tessa better so you feel like the relationship is rushed.

I remember waiting patiently every week for a new chapter to be released so I could keep up with it, as I was absolutely hooked. Fast forward a few years and the stories become published books (of which I own them all and have read them a thousand times over), and I didn't think it could get any better than that. Fast forward ANOTHER few years, and the story gets a movie deal! I had never been more excited for a movie before in my life. I'll admit, I was very nervous. It's typical for movies to not do books justice. However, the After movie went above and beyond my expectations. I loved every minute of it and every aspect that they added to the story to make it work for the big screen. Sensual scenes and incredible chemistry between its leading actors, I will keep seeing it in cinemas over and over again so that I will definitely get more movies to complete the story of Hardin and Tessa.",After

435,zukaleksandra,DISAPPOINTED,1,12 April 2019,"If you read the books pleas don't watch the movie
1: In de books Hardin and tessa they fight every single chapter. That's missing in the movie
2: Hardin never made her cry
3: Hardin in the books is like a bad ass and in de movie he is like a cry baby
4 : I miss the part where Zed is ""obsessed"" about Tessa
5: I hate it the way they changed the first kiss
In the books I loved it so much the way that tessa was scared that a boy wanted to have sex with her and she ran immediately to Hardin. That was the moment that tessa knew she had a chemistry with him.
6: the lake scene in the movie miss some parts
Tessa in the movie came directly in the water but in the book the only read she did that is because she could ask Hardin one question.
And I thought it was strange because the question was in the movie but I think a lot of poeple did not understand when Hardin said ""do I even have a choice""
And the way the cutted thare first fingering scene that made me very mad
7. Tessa first time was in her loft(book) and in the movie it was after the wedding
8. Tessa was good with Karen en Ken and she wanted to go to their wedding and that was the only reason Hardin came to the wedding
9.The bet scene was also changend the book version was way dramatic and more heart breaking than the movie version
In the books it was Zed & Hardin with made a bet who is gonna take her virginity first.In the movie it was only about making Tessa falling in love with Hardin
10. Also their apartment in the books Hardin rented the apartment (with the bet money)
And in the books it was only his friends apartment
11: in the movie Tessa after the break up did her stage in Vance and in the books is it when she is with Hardin and Hardin drive her to Vance ....
...
Thare was a lot of missing what made the movie really bad for me
I fell in love with the books because it was so dramatic and so passionate and i really miss it in the movie",After

438,vivihernandez-22321,Beautifully shot movie!,9,12 April 2019,"I read the books on Wattpad and I have all of the published versions. I am a bit biased towards the film because I love the books. I have been waiting for the movie to come out for a very long time now and I followed the entire process since the beginning. Overall I did love the film. The cast did a great job at portraying their characters and they all have such great chemistry. I admit it is different than the book. If you didn't read the book it may leave you a bit confused, but I still recommend watching it. If you did read the book, some parts might leave you disappointed. Overall I still really loved the film and I hope we get a sequel so we can hopefully see Tessa and Hardin's story develop more.SPOILERS!!
So the beginning of the film felt rushed. I loved the first meeting of Tessa and Hardin even though it was different than the book and Hardin is a lot softer towards Tessa in the movie. Their relationship happened fairly quickly without much of portrayal of their relationship actually developing. It made sense because I knew what is supposed to happened, but someone who has no clue may be confused. We still got many of the things that happened in the book in the movie, they just happened differently. It's hard to capture every detail into an hour and forty minute movie and Anna did her best as a producer to keep its essence. Some things were out of her control and needed to be changed in order to appeal to the general public. Also remember that this was written in 2013 and it's 2019, a lot of things have changed. Even with the changes I still really enjoyed the film.",After

Girl and boy meet, fall in love, get in one fight, make up, and live happily ever after. That's not how the real world is and I am so in love with the fact that this story touches on the hard parts of relationships. So many people experience an unhealthy relationship like Hardin and Tessa's, and now they finally have a story to connect with. This book and movie contains real life scenarios that happen in college. (I'm about to finish my first year at college and have experienced a lot of similar things). I am so proud of Anna Todd and the cast and crew of this movie for creating such a captivating and real life story.",After

Some people are saying if you haven't read the book you'd be confused but that isn't true because I took 6 people who haven't read the book to go see it and they loved it and understood every minute of it.The directing was amazing but the editing was a little sketchy...but besides that it was amazingly perfect and I cried and cried.

446,kyleee_jo,Disappointed.,1,12 April 2019,"For someone that has read the books and loved them so much to re-read them several times, you could say I was really excited to see it come to life. I knew from the start that there was no way the whole book could be acted out into the movie. I went into the theater with an open mind and really hoping for movie that could bring the book characters to life. I knew beforehand that the characters names had to be changed from the Watt-pad version to the book and movie versions. As for the movie... I was disappointed in the fact that the story line was not followed correctly. Certain events in the book happens before others, but in the movie some events were missing. Just a lot of plot holes. Another thing was with Hardin's character. In the book his rude, cold, and demeaning behavior was a key part in the plot line and how Tess and Hardin reacted with each other. Minor details in the book were Hardin having a bunch of tattoos, in the movie there was a lot but not as many as the book portrayed. Another thing about Hardin's appearance was that in the book he had facial piercings which has a key moment in one of the books because he takes them out because they remind him of his past, however in the movie, Hardin's character does not have any facial piercings. It's just some of the minor details that have big meaning in the end that weren't in the movie that really had me disappointed. As for Tessa's character, she acted out pretty good to me, however, in the book she was an English major, in the movie she is an economics major. There are other events in the movie that are around this general idea that wasn't how the book was written, one being Hardin getting the job for Tessa at Vance, but in the movie Ken makes the first move and Tessa ends up emailing Kimberly herself with no help. Tessa, early on in the book, started looking for cars and eventually got one within the first book, in the movie she did not and she rode a bike everywhere. Fights between Tessa and Hardin weren't as violent I guess is the right choice of words as they were in the books. Personally, did not enjoy the movie. It was disappointing in the fact that minor details weren't kept, character development was poor, and the movie itself was rather short and to me felt like it was rushed. If there happens to be another movie, at the moment I don't know if I would go watch it after seeing this one. After isn't after with Zed vs. Hardin, Hardin being rude, cold, and his unruly behavior, Tessa being soft, the BET scene being how it was in the book. After waiting for 5 years now for this to come out, the only words to explain how I felt about it, is thoroughly disappointed.",After

But I went today and totally loved it. Of course it was not as good as the books because there were lots of scenes that were cut. But it didn't bother me at all. The casting was very good, I loved Hero as Hardin and loved Josephine as Tessa. They were exactly like I thought they were gonna be. But I do think that in the books you can more see that Tessa and Hardin really love each other, I know that it is because you can read the thoughts of them and kinda now how they are feeling. The chemistry of Hero and Jo was THE BEST. Totally loved seeing them act together. I think it is a great movie and don't form your opinions by reading other people's opinions.

There are missing trailer scenes in the movie and that's because of the backlash the movie received. They took a lot of scenes out, and that's very evident, so people need to keep that in mind. Also, it's clear to me that some fans are very upset about the movie changes, but remember this: books are not movies and movies are not books. Some things just don't work in movies and Anna Todd was very young when she released After, and we're in a different era right now. After was modernized for the better, Anna made those changes based upon what she thought was right, and she was right for all the changes. Don't come here acting like you thought the movie was gonna be an exact representation of the book because we all knew it was not gonna be that. No movie will ever be an exact copy of the book. All in all, this movie was great and I'll DEFINITELY be watching again. Watch as much as you can if you don't want After to end the way it did, we need a sequel!!",After

454,herrerarubi,LOVE AND NOTHING MORE,10,12 April 2019,"First I want to clarify that I do not judge why I am better than others but because I hear positive and negative opinions of those things that interest me and after is one of those things. Yes, it is true that I do not take this story like the rest of the fans who have been loving it since its inception in wattpad, because ten months ago I started to know that it was after and as I started reading the book I realized that the story had potential and I still believe that he has it, I love the work of anna todd I love his novel but the production of the film not so much I think he lacked a little more to stick to the book there are many things that do not match.
With respect to the duration of the film I thought it would be a bit more extensive, and the actors' performance was well love molly, tessa, tristan, steph but I did not have that super connection with hardin as when I read the book I expected more toxicity part of the bad boy that Anna made us fall in love with but I did not have it, but in general I loved everything because I know that cinema is an industry that has mostly been used by men and to see that now women are daring to enter the creation of new movies that have a very positive message for youth I lovewritten by: J.T RUBÍ

455,macykennedy-57532,Incredibly beautiful,10,12 April 2019,"I absolutely loved this film. College romances have really never been represented and I think this movie was an incredible portrayal. This is because of both Hero Fiennes-Tiffin and Josephine Langford's stunning performance. From the nostalgic feelings of independence to losing yourself in the midst of finding yourself. The events of this film are played out in a way I don't think I have ever seen before in a romance movie. Hardin and Tessa's love completely transforms the idea of a cliche love story. This is not just your typical bad boy good girl romance. Finally a romance movie portrays the complexity of two people pulled together by how different yet achingly similar they are. I recommend this film to anyone that wants to experience 2 hours of their life filled with the emotion, imperfection and passion of this thing we call love",After

I was shaking my head, gasping, blocking my eyes and crying. And I did all of those things because these actors pulled you in from the opening to the end. The entire cast just made me think back so much on past experiences but not in the typical cliche way. Smh. I will admit if you haven't read the books you might wonder why Hero just seems so angry, lol. But my gosh, did he embody his character Hardin. We NEED a sequel. Neeeeeeed!",After

Almost always the adaptation to the big screen isn't 100% the same as the book and it's a good thing because as someone that's read all books, I would like to still be surprised and not know what to expect versus knowing exactly everything that's going to happen... I mean where's the fun in that? For those who are stuck in their old ways then I guess you can keep re reading the books, those will never change.

I thought when she wrote the books she gifted me but no, now that she's given me the PERFECT movie to her books? She's REALLY gifted me. The chemistry between all of the cast is out of this world. You watch this movie and you literally forget these are actors and not actual friends. Khadijah portrayal of Steph is spunky, sneaky and especially funny. Hero and Josephine remind you of a love lost and also a love you want. Everyone dreams of finding your soulmate. But this movie is no cliche. Uh uh. Don't even insult it by thinking that way. This movie shows the flaws, the rawness of relationship, of hurt, and how not dealing with your past might cost you your future( this is why Hardin is always angry on the film). I watched him portray the guilt Hardin carried, the fear he dealt with everyday wondering when will he lose Tessa. Especially the wedding scene when James Bay song ""US"" comes on? Oh my days!!! THAT'S when it's hits BOTH Hardin and Tessa. This movie had me on the edge of my seat although I've read the books countless times.

Im sure most may judge it as the typical boy meets girl romance, but they would be SOOOO wrong! The only obvious and cliche thing about this movie is that Hardin and Tessa will end up together. Watching this movie, you are left wondering whats going to happen next. There's innocence, danger, humor, and love. Hero and Josephine BOTH take charge in this movie. You're watching a movie with two characters who look so different on the outside that you could forget "" never judge a book by its cover"". These two are similar, where one falters the other picks up. They are a couple facing real life issues! There's quotes from the books in there, my favorite was Hardin telling Tessa, ""don't flatter yourself"" at the beginning of the film. Their argument in the class over Pride and Prejudice, and let's not forget Selma Blair( she is the BEST!). I loved how the readers of the books can pay attention to the movie and get those little inside quotes from the book that might go over other viewers heads. I loved the way the cast interacted, Khadijah played her role exceptionally well. I don't think the film was rushed, i was on the edge of my seat hoping it doesn't end. But the ending?! Oh my goodness, nothing could have prepared me. Tessa saying, "" well i guess we're both liars""????? Like wow! Is she now realizing that she's similar to Hardin? Was she being sarcastic?

Everything about it was cliche; the characters, the plot, everything. The plot felt like your average teen/young adult drama but worse. The ""tension"", if it could be called that at the end of the movie with the two main characters breaking up was pointless when the got back together. I mean, even the characters themselves were just cookie cutter characters that you'd see in every teen drama. Tessa, the stereotypical ""I'm-not-like-the-other-girls"" girl, who's doing her best in school until she meets the bad boy with a dark past, Hardin, who's edgy but likes literature and has a soft spot deep in him. Landon and Tessa's roommate being the stereotypical token charatacters to appeal to anyone and always give Tessa ""good advice.""

471,spicymariah,Loved!,10,13 April 2019,"I've been a fan of After since Anna Todd started it on the app Wattpad in 2013. Yes, there were lots of things missing. Yes, the film was rushed but they can't fit every single little detail into an hour and a half. Yes, the book and film is a cliche but it is what we LOVE!!! Whether any of you want to admit it or not, deep down we all have that ""hot, bad boy fantasy"". The movie was perfect to me and I'm hoping in the future there will be a sequel. It's everything I'd hoped for.This is a movie and book for teens/young adults, let us enjoy something for once. I feel as though most of you are trying to shape our generation into something you want it to be. I had an entire row of Qtips (old people with white hair) in front of me tonight, just commenting on every little thing they didn't like or agree with. The disrespect. Anna has worked so hard on the novels and putting together this film. I loved it and I know plenty others did also.",After

It still had a lot of the book parts in the movie but you can only put so much into a film and I thought it was worth watching and I REALLY REALLY REALLY!!!!!! Hope we get a sequel! LOVES IT !!! I love Hero as Hardin he was PERFECT and Josephine is a PERFECT Tessa as well. just as the rest of the characters! Please give it a chance if you haven't watched it it is worth it!!!

475,elizabethcardona-10629,It was okay,6,13 April 2019,"For some reason the trailer made it seem like there was so much to this movie. There was a lot of missing parts that some scenes fail to acknowledge. For example in the trailer it seems to focus a lot in the problematic side of Harden but when you actually watch the movie its sort of lacks in explaining and developing that side of the character in the film. Towards the ending it almost feels like film was rushed to end. It just completely leaves you hanging and the screen goes black, which pissed me off because I was expecting a bit more warmth and closeness from the build up of the relationship and how things got complicated for the couple.",After

Often returning to read in whenever I'm down, the book series really moulded me into what I am today. Tessa being the perfect role model for all teens. The movie was not what I was expecting but did not leave me disappointed. The cast and crew have worked extremely hard and it shows. This had me feeling all types of emotions, Hardin and Tessas love takes centre stage as the attention grabber and I look forwards to adaptations of all the other books.Thank you Anna",After

I've read the entire series and over the last year, the author mentioned some changes that would be necessary in the movie. So I knew when I went to see this, I needed to be open minded. It is quite different than the book as a whole, but they kept the essence of the book and the actors played the characters very well! If I hadn't read the book and went to see this, I would have still loved it. The chemistry between the main characters, Hardin and Tessa, is amazing. Josephine and Hero played their parts beautifully. Go see it before you watch spoilers and ruin it for yourself!!",After
479,mmans-44723,It was good but not AMAZING,10,13 April 2019,"I felt that the scenes were very rushed and it didn't portray the love story in an effective way. People who haven't read the book might be confused how sudden the main characters fell in love with each other. The casting was phenomenal, Josephine Langford as Tessa and Hero Fiennes Tiffin as Hardin were the perfect match for their characters. I understood what they were trying to do during each scene, but some where too long and some weren't long enough. There were useless scenes that they could've cut from the movie to make other scenes longer and more understandable to the audience. The movie overall was really good, but the way the movie was rushed and edited is why I'd give it a 7/10 and not higher.",After
480,cindyhangch,Enjoyed it but left disappointed & empty.,7,13 April 2019,"As a reader, I told myself to not have too much expectations when going into the theaters, but I left feeling so empty. There was no significant climax, and the beginning was extremely choppy and rushed. Some scenes were absolutely unnecessary, especially that one scene where Steph & Tristan made out while Tessa was sleeping. Absolutely no build up from that scene! I'm still so confused why it even made the cut because it was a waste of time! Had they followed the book and introduced Hardin earlier, they probably could have avoided so many filler scenes and progressed with the two's relationship so much better. In the one sex scene where he goes down on her, there's no context that he doesn't want to go all the way with her yet because of the bet or whatever. There was awkward dialogue and a lack of good dialogue. I know that most of the actors are rookies, but some dialogue just felt so cringe and awkward especially when Tessa asked Hardin why he stopped at the lake. I laughed out loud when she said that lol. The character development was horrible & they did a mediocre job at portraying Hardin. You get montages of them together & there's never anything to explain their relationship. They're about to kiss one day and all of a sudden, Hardin says he can't stay away from her & asks her to go to the lake. Had I watched this movie without reading the book, I would have been super lost. I want to love it, but it's hard with how they executed the final cut. Everything felt so choppy and out of place. Ugh.",After

""are you ready?"" and open the condom with the teeth and how can you put a freaking condom with one hand???Before you even start with the excuse ""you didn't read the books"" YES I read the books and there was essential parts that it should be in the movie, like Hardin forcing Tessa telling Noah that she was with him during the night, or the REAL MOTIVE of the bet, or Landon's and Tessa's friendship AND the most important thing Tessa's thing with Zed!!!! But no, instead you only focus on Tessa and Hardin kissing all movie, constantly looks for each other, her sighs...The movie itself wasn't worth it to watch because it all happened so fast most of the scenes didn't happened in the books... gosh I'm going to try to forget that this movie ever happened.",After

And Don't Rush It,2,14 April 2019,"THE BOOK WAS BETTER .... but we all know that right?I made sure to read the book before I went to see the movie and the movie was so insanely rushed and none of the scenes blended well at all. It was just from scene, to scene, to scene.Book Hardin and Movie Hardin were completely different from looks to personality. Book Hardin was just so much more intense and vulgar, movie Hardin showed absolutely none of that. Too much was changed and I didn't like that at all.We barely witnessed Vance publishing or Karen and Tessa, it was all just far too rushed and I'm bummed.Let me tell you about the terrible sex scenes as well ... they were non existent and boring there was no ""fireworks"" or goosebumps for me. The ONLY good part in this movie was their dance at the wedding and their time in the bathtub. The rest of the movie was garbage. It sucks it truly does and that's a bummer. I will cherish the book series forever but seriously work a little harder on the next movies, blend them well and make sure to add the important parts, the tattoo scene was pointless that could have been utilized with actual scenes from the book IMO. I enjoyed the movie a little only to see the personalities of Tessa and Hardin but other than that a complete disappointment",After

The day I finally got to watch our movie, after waiting years since reading After on wattpad. I'm going to be honest here and say the movie wasn't what I expected but it was still so rememberable. For being such a short movie (about 1 hour and 40 minutes) there was a lot included and felt a bit rushed at times but I loved it. The movie was left open ready for plot and character development and hopefully we will be able to see our movie improve and development. The hessa scenes were cliche in some ways but were so adorable and their chemistry was amazing. Most of the acting was amazing and most of the characters fitted so well with the actor/actress. I really recommend that you watch it with an open mind and don't expect it to be much like the book. I have faith in Anna and her team that they will develop the second movie and possibly add more details and scenes from the book. I think Anna and her team did an amazing job on the first movie and they can only improve from here on out. It's disappointing that the UK haven't got the movie but I'll be sure to watch it on Netflix when it officially comes out in my country. Thank you Anna Todd. Can't wait for the other movies and hope they're more like the books.",After

I too have read the book, but I believe that it is okay to change it a little to be able to make a movie out of it. Obviously if you are going to make a movie out of a book they are going to have to change some events and it may feel rushed because they are trying to fit an entire long book into a movie. If they would have made the movie a little longer to drag out some events more then I think more people would appreciate it, but they still did a very good job with what they did do. Also, the author of the book was one of the producers and if she believed that changing something would be better for the movie then we have to trust her. The ending was incredibly smart and I hope to see sequels in the future.",After

497,sinclairrunyon,It was good but disappointed,7,14 April 2019,"I read all of the books and was so excited to see this movie. I loved the casting choices and thought they fit perfectly with what was described in the books (other than Tristan, but I liked it in the movie) I was so looking forward to the romantic scenes but it honestly felt like a movie for 12 year olds. They made it out like it was going to be this passionate romance movie but it was just only kissing scenes, nothing like the book. There was a lot of things missing from the book and stuff that they put in the trailer. Honestly, I believe that they tried to not make Hardin's personality like the books because they were worried about the backlash of him being and making it a toxic relationship. It felt like they just jumbled the scenes up and the relationship progressed so fast. I was disappointed becuase I felt like I was watching a sappy teen romance but in the book it's like a erotic steamy novel. I wanted to see more scenes with Zed and Landon. If it wasn't apart of the book I would of liked the movie. It is becuase I liked the books so much and was really counting on it to be more like the book. I was so excited to see this but all they did the whole time was make out and hardly talk. I want there to be a second movie, but done in the right way. A Rated R version",After
498,inessantos-74903,Just read the book,1,14 April 2019,"Since I read the book, i was disappointed at the movie for various reasons:
First of all, the timeline was not correct at all, for example, Tessa met Hardin's dad and Landon's mom before the wedding and the internship at Vance happened way before they ""broke up"";
The movie missed a lot of episodes, which is understandable because it was an adaption of a book, but it was all very speed up, they met each other and legit 3 minutes later they are declaring their love for each other and moving in together...
Another thing was that Tessa and Hardin looked nothing like the author described, physically.
I was very excited to see this movie because I loved the book, but it didn't make it justice at all. I don't recommend this movie, just read the book instead.",After

I've read all the books, and the feeling I've got during this film was awesome, because even for me gave something new, that I haven't read already. The ending was so emotional, I literally cried. It's unfinished, and I can't wait for the second movie to come out. If I have to say a bad thing, is that Zed, Landon, and a few more characters had just a few scenes, but I'm sure it will change later. Hardin is not as bad as in the books, but I loved this sweet guy with a lot of ""scars"", and to be honest, there was scenes when he showed the heartless guy, so I think Hero made a very good job playing Hardin.

Incredibly difficult to follow the plot if you havent read the book. An insult to harry styles as a human being. The entire movie looked like it was filmed within a few days. Tessa was made out to be this basic girl who talked like she was stupid, when in the book she was very smart. Her character in the book was extremely empathetic and understanding of harden, in the movie she basically addressed his childhood abuse as ""okay, but my dad.."" At the beginning she claimed to love pride and prejudice for being a feminist novel when that is the opposite of her character.
Supposed to be a ""sexual awakening"" movie when my friend literally fell asleep while watching because the characters were so dry. Landon was not given justice. He was incredibly helpful to tessa and there was little revealed about his character.
In general all the characters had barely any substance to them and seemed awkward in their roles. I would not reccomend this movie to anyone as it is an insult to the books and an insult to females everywhere.",After

However the movie turned this book into every other boring typical love story. The movie was super rushed and lacked all the things I loved from the book. I wish they would have just made this movie R, not even just for the sex just to be able to show the character personalities better. Hardin had such an attitude and edge to him in the book while the movie Hardin was so soft and honestly you weren't given enough information about him to really understand why he is the way he is. The same with Tessa. In the book you understood a bit more about why she fell for Hardin and yet in the movie it's like one second she loves Noah and the next she's in love with Hardin. The Tessa in the book shows more apprehension about her relationship with Hardin. Also I get that they wanted to reach their younger audience, but sex was an integral part of this book and to leave it out is ridiculous, instead they just ellude to them doing a bunch of stuff and even that was so rushed they might as well have left it out. (Also side note if these underage kids are reading the book what's the point in editing this out for the movie?) I hate how they changed the bet too, since the bet was the main reason after you fall in love with Tessa and Hardin that you, like Tessa are so shocked and disappointed with Hardin and when you realize how messed up he is. Changing the bet to making her fall in love with him is so juvinielle and over done. I mean if you want the ""fall in love"" plot watch cruel intentions which is a much better movie by 100%. I could go on and on about the bad acting and the lack of important characters that you don't see at all in the movie, but in short save your money and either rent from a library or redbox because this movie was not even worth it.",After

I'm a book girl, so I decided to purchase all of the books and read ALL of them in a week. So, needless to say, the information is all very fresh in my mind. They have turned one of the best, edgy, and sexy books into a HORRIBLE, RUSHED, cliche movie that NO ONE would fully understand unless they have read the books. I'm so disappointed and wish I would have never watched this because it does not display the characters in the way it should. The acting is HORRIBLE, and this disappointed me because I am an actress in Atlanta and I know plenty of people that could have portrayed those roles 100% better.
Now, the leading lead roles, like Hero and Josephine, did a great job and physically met the descriptions, but everyone else, JUST SOOOO BAD! I was laughing and covered my eyes in such disbelief on how trash this movie is.Why rush so many pivotal moments and why try to make the movie PG-13? Anna Todd, girl, if you ever read this. DO NOT EVER LET HOLLYWOOD MANIPULATE YOU. There is a reason why you are successful, and everyone loves the traditional Hardin and Tess. I want the potty mouth bad boy that won my heart over because he had trust issues. The bad boy that was mean and showed it. I did not once see that in this movie. So disappointed.

There are differences between the books and the movie, of course. But in my opinion you have to see the them as two different things, not as one.
They had to make changes, but the author said, everything important is in it and even there are scenes, that are not in the book, it can be a great movie. AND IT IS!
If you like romance, drama and a perfect cast, watch this movie, but don't try to compare it with the books all the time. You just disappoint yourself.

The whole movie felt like it was just chopped scenes all mashed up into one movie, if I had not of read these magnificent books I would've had no clue what was going on with the main character and the story line. Nothing was shown about Hardin being depressed and violently angry while trying to form a relationship with Tessa, all that was show was Hardin being so monotone and nice to Tessa that it made no sense with how they got an apartment together when NOTHING was shown about them fighting or trying to work things out let alone meeting Hardins parents or learning about his drinking issues and everything in between. Everything was just so wrong. The movie was so rushed that its a disgrace. Anna wrote these magical books that had teens being so eager just to read the next chapter when she uploaded it to have this disaster of a movie really humiliating the hard work and talent she put into this series. Honestly do not even want to picture what the potential other movies to the series will be like as this should never be watched or aired!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.",After

Personally, I couldn't wait for the movie... and yes it was made to be more of a teeny bopper movie but that is the market for most movies out there like the fault in our stars or paper towns that are also based off books. Also the choppy montages were a bit rushed but its an adaption from a book! I totally recommend reading the book it's more of a young adult genre instead of a PG13 film.",After

Josephine Langford is the perfect Tessa Young while Hero Fiennes-Tiffin plays Hardin Scott to the core.The chemistry between Hero and Jo is something rare to find in movies, but extremely authentic. Though the movie had various changes from the books, all changes were within reason and best for the movie. Everything worked in the favor of the movie viewers and the time crunch they had.The story is still the same concept, with a few necessary changes here and there.

But only kinda. Movies based on books never do the books justice, this is a prime example. The whole movie feels rushed, I feel like the writers were so focused on getting a ""major moments"" into the movie that they forgot about the minor moments that were still monumental. Like Tessa and ""Hardin"" 's dislike for each other, they weren't close for awhile in the book; but in the movie it seemed like Monday they met, Tuesday the whole class scene happened, then Wednesday they were making out in the lake. Overall, it was a very good film... just rushed.",After

The depth in the love between Hardin and Tessa and the friendship between Landon and Tessa is completely non existent. The ending is completely different to the book and makes the situation seem a lot less awful than it initially was.
Many important features from the book were completely brushed over in the movie.
Other than that, sure the actors were fine and casted well, but that's the only positive thing I have to say about it.
Having waited several years for this movie it breaks my heart a little to write this review.

The stars Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin have impeccable chemistry.I really hope they make a sequel because it would then help them make it an hour longer to get enough depth and the more complex experience of after.
This movie made me cry. After we collided is all about the drama and Hardin trying to get Tessa back, I really hope that if we get a sequel it will be a longer film and the scenes will also be longer that way it gives them enough time to talk and explain each scene and hopefully they include more scenes from the book because we didn't get enough of that in after.",After

A lot of things were changed too and some things were randomly added. The order things happened in were out of order too.

Fast paced, bad acting (minus Josephine who was an absolute star), too much music and unnecessary montages, ZERO character development and plot... and the worst part? Hardin. The character Hardin was not at all the Hardin Scott I know and love from the books. Like I said, nothing ever is like the books but this movie really failed to capture the essence that is After. The editor, director and script writer for this movie really need to take a lot of the negative feedback After has received into consideration because this movie majorly disappointed me.",After
541,teena_ferat,"Incredibly honest and truthful, Don't waste your money",1,23 April 2019,"I have read the book series and was completely excited for the movie when it was advertised, however, my high hopes were horribly shattered. I adore the actors as well as the screen writer and publisher of the books but this film was horrendously portrayed. Let us pretend I hadn't read the book series, if that was case, i would rate the movie less than one star if it was possible. It didn't have to include events that happened in the book but they should have kept the storyline. There was no storyline in the movie whatsoever. If we are to focus on the main characters, (Hardin and Tessa), there was no build up. It was completely rushed . They meet and then the next scene literally jumps to her being heart broken over one date they had and an almost sexual encounter. Even the friendships formed had no base, had no importance, had nothing. I understand many say it romanticises a toxic relationship but it really doesn't. It is supposed to highlight the finding of themselves in each other, the horrible mistakes they make, the forgivingness of their traumatic pasts and their overcoming of the toxic relationship due to their strong love for one another. It also highlights many other topics such as embracing and exploring her sexuality, etc. In the movie there is no storyline just scenes thrown together and labelled as a film so there is basically no message, no positive or negative message. I can honestly say if you haven't read the books you will be ending the film with confusion and regret on spending your money, if you have read the books, you will be incredibly furious, disappointed as well as regretful on spending the money. I feel as if though many people give high ratings for this shocking film because they desperately wish to see a second film as well as majority are females who are enormous fans of the actor Hero Fiennes-Tiffin who plays the role of Hardin. I enjoyed the acting of the cast members. The film itself was a huge fail. The lack of story, the horrible editing, the rushing, the clipping it was just all round not pleasant to watch and a time-waster. I understand this may sound harsh but it is my honest review, i wished so wholeheartedly that the film would turn out amazing but it hadn't. I genuinely enjoy and get a better storyline from the trailer rather than the movie. But if you are like me and your curiosity gets the better of you, i suggest waiting until it comes out on television or DVD that way you spend less money on this not worthy movie.",After

The movie however has nothing to do with the book. I felt like because the original book had to do with one direction they made it PG-13 so that younger people would be able to watch it. The movie should've been rated R because it didn't even portray the characters in the book.,After
546,joycejexx,A movie can't be the same as the book,9,24 April 2019,"I am a big fan of the ""After"" books, so I was really hyped for this movie.
Of course, the movie couldn't be the same as the book, so I had to get used to the differences, but I TOTALLY LOVED it!!
The story is a bit changed, but I don't think that's a bad thing. I think the story is beautiful this way. Of course, the books are amazing, but that couldn't possibly be the same story as the movie.
A book of over 700 pages (including parts of book 2) can not completely fit in a movie of less than 2 hours!
So it's logic to me that a lot of parts of the story were left out.
If you look at the movie without looking at the books, the movie is amazing! Because the rating was 12+ (at least that's what it's called in The Netherlands) a lot of ""dirty"" parts were left out. But the story on it's own is still amazing!
Also, the end has changed from the book, but it's still the same effect.
I heard a lot of people hate the ending (the last few minutes). But I disagree. I think the ending is amazing this way! I am not giving any spoilers, but I absolutely loved it! (Keeping in mind they had to keep an opening for a part 2).So if you've read the books, the movie can be a bit disappointing. But you have to see the books and the movie separately. Yes, there are a lot of parts from the books missing in the movie. Yes, there are some parts in the movie who aren't in the books. Yes, Hardin doesn't look the same as written in the books. But it is still a beautiful lovestory. The big lines from the books are in the movie. A bit changed, but they are still there.Take a look for yourself. I think it is the best movie we could ever get! I am really proud of everyone who worked so hard for this movie!

Also in the book they had to beg each other so much and that intensified the relationship, example Tessa had to beg Hardin to go to the wedding like the whole book but in the movie they just go like it wasn't difficult for him.
Also in the bonfire scene, why was Noah even there like wth. Also Carol (Selma Blair) was supposed to be more cold. Me and my friends felt like Josephine was laughing through out all the movie, and Hardin was supposed to be more rude to Tessa and be meaner but I felt like he was more emotional, I know it's not the actors fault also Anna should have been more part of the decisions.",After

557,jaimemorris-27269,Not like the books at all,3,18 June 2019,"There were a lot of little things about the movie that strayed from the book and killed it for me. The placement of Hardin's tattoos for one. He has no tattoos on his back because he saved it for Tessa. And he had swallows on his neck. And the tree took up most of his torso. Also where's the infinity Heart that became the symbol for the books and is supposed to be on his wrist? He's supposed to have rakish curly hair. This guy had a buzz cut. He wears plain black shirts. Not Ramones shirts.Tessa did not meet Karen for the first time at the wedding reception. Hardin's dad doesn't have an English accent.Hardin wasn't there when Tessa's mom dropped her off. And Hardin is the one who asks Noah about his sweater, not Tristan.Oh yeah. And they made Tristan a girl. And steph was supposed to have flame red hair. Not red highlights. And Molly was supposed to have short bright pink hair so you can pick her out of a crowd. Not maroon on the ends. They made Landon black. But his moms still white? That dude is too dark to be half.Teachers would never be able to just hand another student someone else's work. And that wasn't in the book anyway.The bet was to take her virginity and to show them proof. Not a dare to make her fall in love with him.Zed was basically cut out of the book.They had sex way before the wedding ceremony. And the apartment was rented by Hardin in both of their names, not an apartment they were just watching for someone.There's probably a dozen more. But what upset me the most was the lack of character development. It was just scene after scene with no feeling or explanation of what was going on. I was able to piece it because I'd read the books.

563,brunetemaciel,After Movie Review: Where is the essence?,9,8 June 2019,"After was originally a fanfiction written by Anna Todd that later became a world wide phenomenon book series. And in 2019 - after a four years wait - is being released the movie of the first book. The story is about Tessa Young (Josephine Langford) an 18-years-old lady with perfect grades and a simple life that arrives to college in Washington DC. There she meets her roommate that has a group of punk friends. Between them is the mysterious Hardin Scott (Hero Fiennes-Tiffin) who intrigues her with his rude attitude and a lot of secrets. Then they get involved in a troubled relationship that changes both of them completely.
But, despite all the efforts of the book author and the screenwriter Susan McMartin, the movie didn't reach the fans' expectations, which wanted to see the imperfect couple with real life issues, that tries to be better for each other and for themselves, after making a lot of mistakes that we know from the book because the movie only shows us a couple that shares the same opinion for romance novels and has issues with their parents.
In the book their relationship is very messy and considered even abusive because of the strong personality and stubbornness of them, and the director Jenny Gage tried to soften the story the most for the screens and with that a great part of the characters' essence was lost.
So, the fans expect that in the second movie they rescue all that - and change the director - so the story will be able to pass on its message properly. But even not pleasing everyone, the fans still fight for the story and for the sequence. The movie is going really well reaching almost US$ 50 million in box office only 2 weeks after debut. Anyway people should watch it and get their own vision about the story.",After

I wish this movie was a bit more provocative because the passion between the couple seems intense, but it was kept very PG. Although this was a familiar plot, I love these kind of movies so I wasn't too let down. I honestly thought the secret was going to be something darker.

At this point is where Molly was getting jealous and she was trying to destroy any type of relationship Tessa and Hardin had by showing Tessa the video from that night. It destroyed Tessa but it also hurt Hardin because he knew he was about to lose her.

However, what made them fall in Love was their background, their story, their family, their friends... and all of this is necesary to understand why Tessa and Hardin are who they are and why they behave as they do! In the movie you do not really get to know any of this so it seems like Hardin and Tessa have a strong sexual attraction and that's it, when there's so much more between them. The lack of background is so big that you do not get to know them which is a shame... Oh and I almost forgot! Most of the scenes do not look natural I mean, they are ""POSTUREO"" in a way that dehumanizes the scene...So, for the next movie (If it ever happens ) I hope they have this into account!Saludos,",After

It showed that idealistic relationships aren't always real and easy to find. I fell in love with the characters and their individual personalities and how they each brought their own part to the overall story. In the movie the characters have a few lines and don't bring anything drastic to the storyline apart from being a filler. I feel like if you haven't read the books than this is mearly 10% of what took place throughout the story. It annoys me that even though I was a young reader and at that time it may have been inappropriate to read something so graphic, being older now I wanted to be able to feel the same emotions and experiences that I felt when I was younger. ( Which I didn't because they decided to make everything PG ?) They twisted the whole plot ,they missed out the whole love triangle with zed and Hardin and Tessa. She came across overreacting over nothing majority of the time, instead of her feelings being valid from everything that's happened. HE TAKES HER VIRGINITY AS A BET AND SHOWS EVERYONE THE SHEETS THAT SHE BLEEDS ON TO PROVE HES WON.
It glorifies an abusive relationship and doesn't significantly highlight the damage that he does by the end of this movie.

It left me wanting more and I even ended up watching it again the next day. It really related to my age group however I can understand why some people would not appreciate it. I personally highly recommended this movie.,After

Good girl falls for the bad boy, people try to get in the way, finally they end up together and he's no longer broken cause she's gone picked up all the pieces of broken glass and put them back together. One of the main reasons I loved this movie so much is that it is so generic and predictable. And I'm quite glad I've found this movie. It made me feel things that I normally don't when I'm watching the movie, I could really connect to the characters and was quite invested in them.

While some moments, despite how cliche, were nice and pleasing to the eye, giving your inner self a little fairytale to daydream about, the whole plot and the movie as a whole does not deserve more than a 5, unfortunately.The cast was nice and the main actors were well matched, but conversations seemed stiff, almost empty and odd, the beginning of the movie felt like the makers just sped through it and wham bham there's this huge love in absolutely no time.",After

REALLY dry dialogues, i genuinely feel like no one really talked in this movie, and if they did they talked really slow for no reason and it was mad annoying , 4 lined dialogues took them 3 minutes to finish.

The lake scene was changed, almost 100% of the movie doesn't even come from the book. The book is not PG in any form yet the movie was extremely PG. The movie consistently hit 1 note for me. The book was deep and meaningful showing how different people can be and that brings them together. But the movie just shows two college kids falling in love too fast.

592,maisyforster,If only there was a 0/10 button...,1,31 July 2019,I literally just finished the first book and was beyond excited to see this new interpretation but the true failure of this film is the characterisation. Hardin's character was supposed to be short tempered yet loving- the film portrays him as rather simple and with no reservations towards love (apart from at the very beginning) and furthermore no progress in his character which is the worst part- he basically doesn't change at all. The timeline also wrecks the love story built- there was 0 conflict within the actual relationship which i suppose is only to do with compressing the book into an 1:44 minute film. Overall a fat let down after reading the book...noice one.,After

It even got better ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. I think that's because The Room was a bad movie that accepted it was bad but After was a bad movie that didn't accept how bad it was and is punishing us with a sequel. Also, - just a quick note- the fact that this movie won three Teen Choice Awards beating The Hate U Give and Bohemian Rhapsody, seriously makes me doubt the ability of the voters to differentiate a good movie and its production value. It's obvious that the 14 million dollars used for making this film went to hiring two good looking actors to distract us from the horrible plot or just to buy the hopelessly romantic 10 year-olds voters.

602,Ella_basi,Waste of an opportunity,3,8 October 2019,"I was one of those teens reading the original Wattpad series those few years ago. Anna would post chapter by chapter at that time, her readers couldn't get enough. It wasn't long until After became a 4 part series on Wattpad, read by millions of fans. The series then became published officially, acknowledged by more than just one direction fans.When I heard this was becoming a movie, I was excited. Although it felt like a guilty pleasure to be invested in some romance novel, that is not so critically acclaimed, yet I was excited to to see Anna's imagination become a reality and see this brought to life. SThere were times i'd roll my eyes at the novel, cringe at the irrationality or stupidity of the characters, but that's exactly why the books were so addictive. Each chapter would grip you in, as much as you'd tell yourself how unrealistic it would be you just kept reading. Just like you'd watch an episode of your favourite drama, - picking up from where you left off in the After series offered the same escape. You could delve into the life of Tessa and Hardin and everything that surrounded them. Their intentions are all Justified in their perspective. The P.O.V style chapters aren't exactly accepted by literary critics - a style brought over from Wattpad's best fan fiction always offered for perspective sake ... for entertainment.I always wished at times I could just watch it instead of reading, But always knew that a 1-2hr long movie would never do this intricate series justice. Sadly I wasn't proven wrong. The movie was such a let down, and waste of potential. Aside from casting and some cinematographic effort this movie was bad. What could have been a captivating and intriguing story brought to life was rendered into a horrible rendition of the books. Failure to to detail the majority of the plot line and characterisation accurately made this film so poor. It is such a shame to see such a disappointing film for such a well received (for the most part) series. The cast was wasted potential. Some hit and miss. I feel the leads were cast almost perfectly, Ken Scott however is American in the film, when he is supposed to be British? Yet I believe Hero and Josephine had good chemistry but the lines they were given were bland and cringe worthy.This entire series would have worked so much better as a series. Chapters could be 1-2 episodes, that's how much happens within them. If I had never read the books I would not have cared for this film in the slightest.I hope someone can turn this into the TV series it deserves. I can see it being as big as,the Vampire Diaries, True Blood, Gossip Girl or Skins, the raunchy parts can't be skimmed over either, another PG13 remake won't cut it.",After

615,sweetiennc,Not bad but disappointing.,5,9 November 2019,"I watched this movie before I read the first book and I thought the movie was cliche and not very good. When I found out it was based on a book I read it and then re-watched the movie. Sadly to say I was disappointed with the movie but liked it better than the first time I watched it because I got to see the characters come to life. I think they picked good actors to play Hardin and Tessa, they fit the roles and seemed to have decent chemistry given the scenes they had to be in. But with that being said they changed the story to much for this to be a good movie. They did not need to portray Hardin as such a pushover. He was a hard in the books and his flirty character and blunt attitude were some of the reasons Tessa was so drawn to him and we didn't get to see that in this film.The passion and fighting was very poorly portrayed, those parts of the books drew you in and showed you the bond between Hardin and Tessa. He sadly just came off as moody and whiny in the movie. Tessa seemed so young and innocent in the movie and we didn't get to see her sassy side or her boldness when she stood up against Hardin or her trying to party with them and kissing Hardin first or any of the scenes with Zed. I didn't mind that they didn't make the film as sexual or explicit as the books but they didn't need to make it so pg13, it almost seemed like a middle school romance instead of college. The relationship with Tessa and her mother was way off in the film. They never really had a good relationship to begin with in the books and almost seemed like good friends in the movie. I wasn't a fan of the actors chosen to play Noah or Hardin's father, and they should have left Tristan as the sweet guy he was in the book and not changed him to a girl. This movie was also poorly edited, several scenes felt rushed and the actors delivered the lines either too soon or with no feeling. And they didn't have very much depth to the conversations. And the one scene with Tessa and Landon mouthing the lines with no sounds?? Why? If they would have added just a few more scenes and chosen to stick closer to the story line it would have had the chance to be a good movie. Or better yet why not make the books into a mini series with these same actors so that they could have had more time to bring the characters to life from the books and not been so rushed to cram so much content into a 160min movie. And the ending, bad just bad. That's my two cents, not trying to be harsh, I liked the books and I hope the second movie is better than the first.",After

The movie completely looked over all of the details that made the original story compelling and beautiful. I understand for the sake of time they couldn't add as many details as possible, but honestly they were probably better off not making it into a movie at all.
Honestly, in order to capture the story the way the novels did, they were probably better off creating a series for the books. That way the story can gradually evolve, and we can see the FIRE within the relationship.

The book gave me anxiety as someone who spent the end of my high school years and almost my entire 20's in the type of relationship portrayed in the book... Now, for the movie review. The characters they got for all of the cast were pretty much spot on with what I had imagined them to be. Hero is the most adorable kid ever, and him and Josephine had an amazing chemistry that definitely shines on screen. I wish it had a little more details from the book but other than that I still give it a solid review for a cute romance movie that lets you escape from the monotonous day to day real life for an hour and forty five minutes.

I bought and downloaded the books and read the first ebook in that same night until the early hours of the next morning. Obviously by reading the first book, I could tell that things aren't the same as the movie and scenes are all jumbled up and interpreted differently. Also, hardin's character is a lot more like able in the movie than the book. But I was so obsessed still. More with the books than the movie yet I'm still looking forward to sequels. You have to imagine that making a movie based off a book that is over 100 chapters long would hard so of course, it will be different.

631,samanthajoliene,Atrocious,1,15 February 2020,"While the movie is said to be based on Anna Todd's best seller it was anything but. If you have read the book you will hate the movie. That may be a bold statment, but im gonna say its 95% accurate. Instead of filling in any of the raw powerful emotions or some of the key points behind the book the producers opted for 50+ minutes of make-out scenes. Nun of the other key relationships were played out properly. (Hardins and Tessas we also not played out properly but at least you saw them)No body on the production team has pick up the book is all I can figure out, I hear their making the sequel when they should simply just start from scratch and hope Anna Todd is still willing to allow them to create garbage from her books.Hardin is spose to be a troubled young adult and Tessa a feisty young woman. Both actors who took on this roll looked like they were in pain the entire movie. Hero Fiennes-Tiffin is an English actor, his accent was spose to be sexy and mysterious, the whole movie I just wanted to hug him and tell him things will get better. He looked and sounded like the whole time he was filming someone from the camera crew was kicking puppies to make him sadder. Josephine Langford is apparently the new Kristen Stewart on the block as she had one face the entire time. There was no chemistry between the two. When they had sex and he said do you want me to stop I yelled at my TV yes please your hurting her. I made it to the end of the movie wondering what actor Zed was.They never even say they love eachother outloud.Dont waist your time. Spent 8 hours curled up with the book and couldn't take my eyes off it, it was hard to sit through the first 60 minutes of the movie and I only kept watching to see how bad it would turn out.The soundtrack was good, that's about all this movie had going for it.",After

I agree with some comments that the movie goes a little bit too fast - 'suddenly' Tessa cheats on her boyfriend of 2 years and is ready to go all the way. Would've loved to see more of the book details in the movie, but it's just extremely hard to capture the whole book in just 100 minutes.

Hardin and Tessa's love story just wasn't there at all. The movie was too fast paced. So much had already happened before their first kiss, and it skipped everything. I loved the book, but hated the movie. This doesn't even deserve 1 star.",After
638,linam-42353,Bad,2,23 July 2020,"This was extremely bad. Well, if you haven't read the book, you will probably like it because as any other teen romance movie, it is entertaining (at a certain extent) even if in my humble opinion, this was absolutely cringe and empty. Well anyways, this movie is an insult to the book and its author because it is absolutely different from it. It isn't even the same story at all. For example, some random useless scenes were added in the movie, some key passages/elements were altered or totally modified such as Hardin and his friends's bet which wasn't the same at all in the movie etc... It could've been way better with a little more effort. Please show some respect to the storyline next time. So fucking bad.",After

Like wtf, that girl deserved her heart broken in 5 different places. And oh, her ex boyfriend just forgives her and is like we all change, like wtf you saying man.

However, I do think that the movie is a much better approach. In the BOOK the main character Hardin is incredibly manipulative and emotionally abusive towards Tessa who seems to accept the fact because he had a 'difficult' past. And in the end it almost makes me hate him. But I will admit it had a gripping quality to it and made me want to read the rest. But if this was a real life scenario It would be a whole other kettle of fish. In the MOVIE it's portrayed in a much safer and realistic scenario which in the end is a much healthier for young teens to be watching and overall I preferred it over the book.",After

But I will talk about the negative aspects first since most reviews have that. From my perspective, it was a bit cheesy with the storyline and everything said in the movie. It did catch me off guard a couple times and made me laugh cause of how ridiculous it was. Another negative thing was the pacing, everything seemed a bit rushed and I wanted a bit more from different scenes. Now the positive aspects.
The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, the lake scene and basically any scene with Hardin and Tessa was just so mesmerizing to watch. You can see they have chemistry and they worked so well together. Love also had a bigger meaning here, as the main characters love was real, and even painful. I wish they would've put more into this considering how much content there is within the actual story but that's all we really get.

Now if you have read the books you would know that it contains some mature scenes, being that the movie was rated PG-13 I am not surprised that the physical romance was not up to par. And with that I am okay. Being now that we are in the AWC and soon to be AWF & HEA era I would just like to say that the movies have matured way more to be just like the books.

Awful plot, script, acting and relationship.That need of normalising toxic relation ships is just awful. Things do not work like that ever. Disgusting.The actor who plays Hardin Scott is simply the worst. Happy, sad, angry... his face is the same and it changes nothing. -1Plot and script go together. I understand that it is based on a book from WATTPAD, but we have to consider that the writer was 22 years old when she wrote this. 22! She wasn't a teen of 15. She was 22!

Everything from the plot, the little details like costume, even the scenes that were chosen to be put in and what was played out in the scenes. It's common for the movie adaptation of a book to be missing details and scenes but for this to be way off from the book is ridiculous. What makes it worse is that this movie sets the tone for the rest of the movies. There are things you can't put into the second of third movie if you didn't include it in the first, so now we're set up for a series of disappointment. I was surprised to see that Anna was apart of the production team seeing as this was her book.

Without going into blatant detail as you can see that from the plentiful critism already, but this is endorsing so many red flags & what's to be wrong with the modern generation/society. Netflix has become fixated on creating romanticism that's a vague comparison to a random teen's insight into fanfic. Tessa spent her entire life with her boyfriend ""Noah"" & she reflects by saying to Hardin ""you are so much more"". Is this what we should be encouraging to modern youth, to think this is okay and a realistic approach to take? I'm 25 and if I was 17, 18 or 19 etc I'd know how much this can influence a teen. Getting carried away with infatuation to override a stable relationship is a poor plot, it's unrealistic & it's so childlike to watch this. In the real world where experience is a virtue, we know that this backfires in a hot second as time progresses. Didn't we all? It's always good to see abit of romance, but the general consensus appears to agree that this is yet another predictably storyline amongst academic students. I'm interested to see what the other half will unfold, didn't think I'd need to feel out of context for this film. I'm only 25 & somehow I feel this film is designed for 15 year olds.",After

Sometimes the message is not for you to take a moral message from it, it's to acknowledge the dark things that our society is so happy to hide. Or no message at all.

I felt that personal experience while watching this - wanting to root for the relationship but also knowing it's not a good idea to root for it. While it may seem the story romanticizes toxic relationships for the film, I see it more as a story telling what a toxic relationship can do to a young woman and a young man in college before they truly begin their real adult lives.

The love story is passionate without the obscene. I like a movie that makes me feel not just see. This movie made me feel. I cannot wait for the next installment.

However, having read the books, I have a few bones to pick.The beginning was quite rushed so their relationship was not developed well. One second they meet each other and the next they are already at the lake ... and anyone who has seen the movie or read the book knows what happens at the lake; it was all too fast for me to truly feel happy and excited that they are finally getting together.The movie was oddly PG. Anyone who has read the books will know that the books are a lot more passionate. It is confusing as to why a story about college students is kept so PG when college students in general aren't PG. They adapted a very intimate and non-PG book into a PG movie, which many who read the book might be disappointed by, as I was.This is an oddly specific bone to pick, but: I felt the placement of the scene where they argue in class over Elizabeth Bennet came too soon. They are in essence arguing about Tessa being interested in Hardin, but by then that didn't seem like an issue. Perhaps this scene would have made more sense being after the lake and restaurant scene where she does confront him about whether he is embarrassed to be seen with her. But, what is done is done.Lastly, the movie did not portray the essence of the love-hate relationship in the book. Where was Hardin's jealousy and possessiveness? Where was Tessa's attitude towards Hardin? They tried to capture the complicated nature of Hardin's character when he tells the story of his drunken father and his mother whilst at his dad's wedding, but there was no development on this - I didn't see emphasis on the relationship issues he seemed to have in the book. Also, in the book I myself had a love-hate relationship with Hardin's character, but in the movie I simply just enjoyed looking at Hero Fiennes-Tiffin considering how good looking he is.All in all, it was still an enjoyable movie and I could tell a lot of hard work went into it. The movie was beautiful to watch, especially the lake scene and the bathtub scene (which was an especially cute scene). Casting was done well; Josephine Langford (Tessa) and Hero Fiennes-Tiffin (Hardin) we're extremely well suited to their characters, but I feel they could have done more with their characters if they were given the opportunity.The romantic scenes were cute and made me smile, but the movie lacked the deeper layer that the book has about how complicated people can be, and the message of learning to love someone despite their flaws as well as trying to be a better person for the one you love. Considering Ana Todd (the author of After) was on set all the time, I am confused as to why she allowed the movie to stray so far from the core messages of the book.Small details of the book were included and did leave a smile on my face when they came up as they reminded me of the effect the book initially had on me, but the bigger-picture messages and themes of the book seemed missing.Viewers who have not read the book may be confused by the fast pace, as I used a lot of my knowledge from the book to fill in gaps.Reading the book does cloud my judgement, so I would like to emphasize that it was still a good movie which I plan to rewatch many times.Should you watch this movie? Yes.Do I want a sequel? Yes; I am hoping much of what was left out in this movie was because they plan to make a sequel, one which is more passionate and explores the complicated nature of Hardin and Tessa. The movie did not have the same effect on me as the book did, but I would still watch it again and tell others to watch it.I copied and pasted this review from another user because it is exactly how I feel and think it would benedit others to read.",After

The thing is that I don't care if the movie didn't gave the vibe that the book did (not many movies do that anyway, books are unique because the describe in detail everything), but they left some gaps that don't make the viewers understand the kind of relationship that those two had...I won't go on about how the boo is rated 18+ and the movie isn't even using the f word but yeah. In general I think that some more analysis in what kind of person Tessa and Hardin were was needed, and how much pain they caused in general to each other... And even though I know that this wattpad novel was never the BEST BOOK EVER (I mean yeah you read it cause it's fun, not because its quality is the best), and I also knew that the movie would be like that, I expected at least to feel some kind of emotional resemblence, a tear to leave my eye, as it had actually happened back then...

This movie focused more on the love between the two characters and the positives in their relationship. There were points when they tried to sneak in some struggles however that wasn't the focus of the movie.

723,pachee-m,So Much Potential,4,23 April 2019,"Despite the push back the film received from just being a ""teen romance"" alone, the film had a strong enough fan base to back up its possible success had it just gone a little deeper. My understanding is the film steered a little away from the novel, in the best way possible. The female protagonist has a backbone and the male protagonist was not a toxic jerk as he is in the book. I LOVE that Anna Todd (and team) made that call. However, the character's development, relationship with one another, and plot flat lined the entire film. I think the production team tried really hard not to fall within the lines of a typical teen romance but failed because of that. There was very little to no explanation how come some things were the way they were such as how come Tessa was still a virgin but asked Hardin why he ""stopped"" during the scene at the lake; or at what point did Hardin realize he no longer wanted to follow through with the bet (they seemed to have wanted each other since the beginning); or even something as tangible as why Tessa and her Mom's relationship was so fragile when they've only had each other?

724,tessajm,Underwhelming,4,22 April 2019,"I have read the books and was looking forward to the movie. But I ended up being pretty disappointed. First of all, I thought the actors looked a lot like their characters and did a pretty good job with what they had to work with. But the whole film was very rushed. I found it bizarre that after knowing each other for only about a week they ended up at the lake and are talking about how they can't be ""just friends."" The scenes were very choppy and if I hadn't read the books I would've had no idea what was going on. Hardin was probably my favourite character in the books and I was not a fan of how he was softened and overly romanticised, as opposed to the book version who is passionate and impulsive. The last thing that was a let down was the bet scene. The whole reason Hardin began to pursue Tessa was because he and his friends bet who could take her virginity. But in the movie he bets that he can make her fall in love with him which takes away the shock value. Overall I thought it was a cliché ""good girl meets bad boy"" teen romance film. It wasn't a terrible movie, but after reading the books I expected so much more.",After

I have read the books, and although they cannot compare to similar young adult series such as the mortal instruments, divergent or the hunger games, there are some obvious real world characters and problems, which I at least thought the movie would address. I was extremely disappointed with the movie, not just because the actual essence of the story was lost, but there was no depth to the characters or the story whatsoever. The plot jumped all over the place, which made it extremely hard to follow, the cinematography was strange in parts, and the scenes did not flow from one to the other. I think this is another unfortunate book adaptation which will most likely be forgotten due to its poor execution much like vampire academy or Percy Jackson.

The books were never intended for an audience below 17/18 years of age so I just don't understand why they made the movie to cater to the youth. Oh well, what's done is done. Can't go back now, unfortunately. I loved the actors as well but I feel that the movie didn't really let them build their characters. Tessa was too easy, Harden wasn't as brooding and mean. The important moments were squished down and everything just went way to fast. No climax, no excitement, nada.

There are the typical cringe-worthy sappy moments like any other romance out there and then Hardin and Tessa were somewhat different from the book. I found I actually prefer how their characters were portrayed with a less yelling and weeping in this version and how they condensed a lot more of the storyline. But really I didn't mind the changes of including more dating scenes as long as the basic plot line stayed the same, which it did. The story itself was all about a bet even if the book and the movie differed slightly. In the book it was about taking Tessa's virginity and the movie it changed to making Tessa fall in love with him and him turning his love for her off once she did.

I knew it was going to be incredible because I had the utmost faith in Anna when she said that despite the changes we were going to love it. It's not exactly like the book and that it okay! It is simply beautiful and took my breath away. Anna and Jenny did such an amazing job taking such an extensive book and characters and breaking them down to their very core. They captured the core of the story and presented it to us in such a lovely manor. Jenny is such a great director, she understood this story so well and did an amazing job capturing the essence of the book and characters on film. Hero and Jo completely embody everything that is Hardin, Tessa, and Hessa. They were incredible and MADE this movie. Jo is so adorable and is a wonderful actress. In every scene, she just SHINED and I am so happy she is our Tessa. To put it simply, she is perfect. She is so strong and sweet and wonderful! Hero is just AMAZING as Hardin, he took such an amazing and complicated character and dominated it and made it so much better. He IS Hardin like Jo IS Tessa. Jenny and Anna were not joking when they knew right away that he was the one. He is a sublime actor. You can see the pain from his past in his eyes so well and the love he feels for Tessa, the relief and calm that he feels around Tessa. And this movie has only touched the surface of the character that is Hardin Scott and I have the greatest faith that Hero will tackle the most difficult parts of Hardin really well. Jo and Hero are just so completely compatible in this movie from the most cute, romantic scenes, to the sexiest, the tender, and even to the most heartbreaking. I just love and appreciate them so much. When they are on the screen, they just create MAGIC. The entire cast of this movie is really great. Ken and Karen were hardly in the movie but you could feel the connection between them and the tensions that Hardin and Ken had. Every cast member just had great chemistry. A change that I really like is how Tessa resolved things with her mom. Hardin was not the only character who was rightly made softer, Carol was too and it was great. I cried and loved this movie so hard, that I could literally feel it in my heart. I am so grateful for this movie and everyone involved, thank you so much to everyone for being so incredible.

Tessa meets Karen for the first time at the wedding! This movie skips their relationship entirely. Hardin doesn't even speak about his father until the wedding. Absolutely ZERO arguments or Hardin's up and down of emotions and I'm 3/4 of the way in to the movie. I feel like they've exchanged 50 words back and forth between Tess and Hardin the entire movie.

A troubled childhood, a tragic experience, a controlling parent can all contribute to how we act and react. Even when we want to be better, the learning process to make changes can be near impossible. This storyline clearly shows this.The actors interact well for the most part. You can see the natural friendship between Jo and Hero. There are some scenes that could use a little more dialogue to fill in the awkward silence, obviously waiting for the next line.Some of the music is ok and seems appropriate for the scenes but there are some songs that come to mind that would be more perfect for certain scenes.Over all, it's a good movie.

However, those who have read the book as I have, Would understand the movie, but will be extremely disappointed, I understand you can't fit a whole book into 1 hour and 40 mins in a movie but they cut all the important parts.

765,clarita-maria,As bland as it gets,1,12 April 2019,"I read the books and ended up hating them as I couldn't shake the feeling they were glorifying abuse. 'Then why did you go see the movies?', you might wonder. Well, I decided to give it a try. Maybe I had misunderstood the story - I had to give it a second chance.No such luck. The movie is simply put as bland as it gets, chemistry took the day off and character development was a no-show. Protagonists go from who are you, to hi, to you are the most important thing in my life and I would give up everything for you. There is no way to believe them. I cannot even say 'Yeah, it also glorified abuse, just like the books', because the plot is so flat that there are no emotions anywhere. There was a group of teenage girls sitting behind me, during the first 20 minutes they kept swooning and whispering 'OMG, I love him!', and I wondered how the ameba on screen had elicited that feeling. I happened to come across them in the ladies room after the screening and they seemed pretty upset the movie was 'that bad'. So yeah, I'm not the intended audience, but clearly the intended audience did not buy into the story either.I will avoid spoilers, but basically, if you read the books you will find they decided not to include the event/object that drove the whole plot of the first book. I can understand why that is absent -I mean, again, abuse-, but that also means the main driver is AWOL. That leaves you wondering what the whole fuss was about - nothing happens.",After

Although, I was very excited to see this movie and it didn't let me down.If you have not experienced the ""I have read a book and now the movie's out""-phenomena before, I get the fact that people could be let down by this movie. However, the terrible reviews aren't rightfully made.Hero and Josephine both do a terrific job of making the characters as they are, who have fully fulfilled my image of Hardin and Tessa. The producers and Anna Todd herself have done an amazing job at matching details with the book (Harry's (Hardin's) tattoos, quotes, rings, behaviour, even the hair colour of Steph and Molly were on point).The story is a little rushed, especially the relationship between Hardin and Tessa. But 600 pages are hard to fit into a movie that lasts for 108 minutes. There were scenes deleted, added which made the movie somewhat more ""happy"" and ""loving"" than the actual book, but let's not forget it was a PG movie (I guess? In my country it was 12 years and up). I actually loved this version without the endless fights and hard to get games.I loved Noah. They did a great job with him. He waarschijnlijk JUST like in the books.TINY SPOILER!!! Hardin's love for Tessa was so cute. There were countless times you could see he loved her, and she never noticed, but we all did. Can we talk about the bath scene? That was the best of the whole movie.The only downside for me was the rushing and the PG thing. After is known for its passionate writing style and explicitly written scenes of intimacy and fights. I missed that bit.

She wasn't a stuck up girl like she sounds like from the book. Everyone did such a terrific job!! I honestly can't find the right words for this movie. I truly hope that there is another movie!!

All the scene goes way to fast, arent well developped, some are even switch compared to the storyline, whick make no sense. You cant understand the complexity, the toxicity, the passion of their relationship in this movie. Hardin is way too soft. Tessa dont seem like the perfect little girl who control anything in her life. All the second characters seems to be there just to fill the screen, without any explanation of their role in the story. Honestly, I wonder how they could even think of making the next movies to be more representative as there is soo much important things missing in the first one.I dont expect a movie to be as great as the book (it never happened in my opinion), but they really missed the point with that one trying to make it a PG movie.

However, with a book like ""after"" and a writing like Anna's, I expected more details about the main characteres and how they developed feelings for each other, I really felt that it was rushed and fast. I mean, the book was a great material for a more detailed script that can, also, fit into a 2 hours movie. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie and I loved all of the cast especially Hero and Jo and I really loved their chemistry, I just hoped somethings were different especially the next:
1- I needed to see more dialogues, because I put myself in the shoes of any other viewer who hasn't read the book. If anybody hadn't already read the books, not so many would understand how deep their relationship is, and they wouldn't understand the development of each character.
2- Although the soundtrack of the movie is one of the most amazing soundtracks I've ever heard, I just felt that there was too many songs during the movie, even more than I heard the characters actually talk.
3- the change in Hardin's character made him look like a sad teenage boy not the aggressive and Manipulative guy we knew in the books. Aggressive and Manipulative is wrong but this was him and the change in the movie mafe him a completely different person but with the same name.Don't think I hate the movie, though, beacuse I definitely DON'T.

I found them very good despite being ""teenage romance"", because of the complexity of the characters (especially Hardin), the roller-coaster storyline and how you get so sucked into it and feel everything the characters feel. You can actually truly feel how Tessa and Hardin are soulmates.The movie though...
I totally get that they had to cram everything together and leave stuff out which most of the time when I have read a book and then watched the movie annoys me but still leaved me satisfied. But with this I was too dissapointed. They left out so much that the whole development of the story and their love just felt extremely unrealistic and strange so that it made all of the romantic scenes laughable and weird. I mostly rolled my eyes and cringed as well as most of the theatre did. As soon as Hardin started speaking, everyone in the room burst out laughing because of how monotone he sounded and how weird his lines were.They left out so much of the character Hardin, his darkness and pain, the anger and the mood swings. On screen, all that tried to portray it was just him being a bit passive aggressive and cry sometimes. Be a bit moody but it was nowhere near what it could have been. This also made everything lose that deep passion that I think is the reason many people are captured by the books. Not many romantic books capture passion in that way and that´s what made it unique to me. When they left all of that out though, this just became a bland and boring cliché film.Usually when I watch rom-coms or whatever, I am at least a tiny bit captivated by them or can at least feel some compassion with the characters but this movie didn´t move me or make me feel anything at all even for a second. Which is sad because when I read the books I cried several times.The other thing that I think draws people in by the books is the sexual content. I heard this movie was gonna be the new ""fifty shades of grey"" but the attempt at this being sexual was the lamest I´ve ever seen. The sexual scenes were so not sexual it was weird that they were even there. And it´s a shame becasue I feel like the seuxality and the passion and darkness of Hardin was the whole core of this story and they left it all out and made it into just any other love story.And don´t get me started on the soundtrack.... it was pathetic.The one thing I liked was the visuals, they found great fitting characters, I loved the settings and I loved the modern but still retro feeling to it. It was pretty much perfect.
But perhaps such a complex story as After can´t be made into a 1,5 hour film without failure. It´s too bad though, it could´ve been great.",After

In one of the Scene I got really confused and it was the wedding scene because in the book Tessa had to talk to Hardin to make him come to the wedding but in the movie they just straight up went to the wedding which i really hate.
Some of the scene from the trailer wasn't even in the movie like the part where Hardin smash the book shelf with the guitar, when the book went between Tessa legs, the part where he said"" you are stunning"" and much more.

Well, it had all the ingredients - good girl, bad girls, brooding mysterious college hottie, wannabe college teens sporting nose piercings & tattoos, dysfunctional families & broken marriages..the list will go on. But what trumps all of this the heavyduty emotional texture of the film. The intense romance that develops between Tessa and Hardin in a conventional yet very mystical way. There are not many twists and the narrative is simple. However, it hoodwinks you into feeling that something really uncanny will happen - whether or not it does, is for you to find out. Makeout scenes are aplenty but none OTT. They are aesthetic and complimentary to the storytelling. Director Jenny Gage handles that well with his young, good looking actors keeping their next-door image intact. Audience will relate with their characters and root for both of them.

And it's important because this mind setting, these expectations affect their REAL life, their REAL relationships.
It romanticised things that shouldn't be romanticised; the characters were on a constant battle of who was the real victim; the ""bad people"" were those who smoked etc.
And what about the mother that gets into her room without knocking, calling or anything? Very realistic, let me say.

Half the movie was make out scenes and it was implied that there was character development, but it wasn't believable because by the end of the movie the guy still looked at the girl as if she was a piece of meat instead of someone to be loved. I didn't see any ""chemistry"", just sexual desire. Maybe if some of the sex scenes were replaced with the characters spending time to interact with words then there would be more space for character development to show. Also the girl fell for the guy wayyy to easily, like how are you gonna fall for him without even knowing him first. I only gave it 5 stars because I liked the overall storyline, but I don't think the directors imagination and what they were trying to convey on screen matched up. I can see where they were trying to go with it, but as the audience I didn't feel connected to the main character because of the little time spent on showing what her character was like before dating Hardin, but I guess the movie IS called ""After"" so it makes sense lol.",After

834,catarinaferreiramagalhaes,Stripped from the books essence and lacking depth,4,13 April 2019,"Every time there is a movie adaptation of a book, there always seems to be the same kind of comments, talking about the little insignificant differences. Entering the cinema, I had in mind there would be several differences and adaptations, so I obviously didn't feel bothered by the dress that changed color, the teacher that was no longer a man, the same sentences said in similar words. I had previously read the book, and am aware that there was a severe backlash due to the portrait of a toxic relationship and its romanticisation towards a very young audience, therefore the need to take away the violence, the heavy vocabulary and the sexual scenes was found when remaking the story. The problem seems to be that without Hardin's dark side, childhood traumas, abusive behavior, without Tessa's emotions on her skin, stubbornness, and without the fights driven from their personalities clashing, both the characters and movies are left shallow. There is nothing to them. The secondary characters were also not handled properly. In the book series, there is a very dynamic interference of this characters on the main story line, leaving loose ends on the beginning to be found i the end, providing new levels of depth to the story. The movie however failed of both subjects, lacking total content, becoming just one more ""teenage"" movie with a cliche romance that will be forgotten in months.
When a story is taken by another artist and put in a new medium i expect to see a new take on it, to see how this new artist felt so captivated by the book that they had to bring it to life. Nevertheless, Susan McMartin, responsible for the script, failed. The whole movie felt rushed, leaving the viewer confused on the story line. There was a lot to be explained in this movie, and it certainly wasn't said nor shown. The scenes lack correlation, making the viewer believe the whole story happened between five conversations made of small talk, showing itself to be very unrealistic.
The acting left a lot to wish for, the best performance was delivered by Josephine Langford (playing Tessa Young), however, none of the actors were able to give a truth sense of their characters, lacking versatility and depth.
And the characters themselves, when stolen most of its traits, became very flat and stereotypical. Molly is simply ""the bitchy/slutty girl"", a if there is nothing left to her but who she wishes to sleep with, and some mean comments (this is something I find disturbing in the book as well.) Even the main characters became a rude boy and a studious girl.
In conclusion, I must admit i wasn't expecting this movie to be good, due to the circumstances in which it came to be, and the budget i imagined was on the table, and I was correct. The movie stripped away all the essence of the books, portraying only the most superficial layer of the relationship, and still doing it in an awkward choice of scenes and dialogue.",After

It completely misses out the fact that Tessa got an internship which is what gives her the independence and builds up respect for her . As well as learning about major characters for future films.It Misses out Hardins backstory so you don't know or learn about his dad or step mum and why he is the way he is .And the way they go about getting the apartment to straight into telling Tessa about it all being a dare is so rushed and poorly written I couldn't watch past that point .

She subtly conveys with her facial expressions that her character lusts for Hardin. She delivers lines well too. It's hard to believe young kids these days are reading Bronte so it's convincing.

One needs to feel the urge to continue watching, not the other way around. To my unpopular opinion, I actually quite liked the characters, and did feel the chemistry between Hardin and Tessa.

The movie lacked minor details that could've been easily arranged such as behaviors and appearances. Hardin didn't have his piercings which were essential in the turning of events and for god knows what reason he didn't even have anger issues nor a temper, which were pretty much what led on the whole story. Tessa's mom what actually understanding at some point and wasn't even the obsessive perfectionist she was meant to be. All of what led that movie to be total trash. And these are merely what I remembered to write here. That movie ruined the vision I had for the books and for that reason i will be reading them over and over until I can erase what I just watched from my memories; which was absolutely a mere attempt at linking scenes together where even the timing and turn of events weren't correct.

875,claudiataylorxo,Brilliant books - avoid the film (for now),2,1 May 2019,"After waiting so long for this film, my hopes were high. As all the fans of the 'After' book series by Anna Todd know, the book is filled with sex, love, lust and much more. It's a shame the movie lacked this completely.
The fans were left hanging after being fed behind the scenes photos and videos that left us reeling for the movie to be released.
First of all, the movie storyline didn't make sense. They took out so much of the work that Todd had written herself it didn't have the structure that's vital for any film involving love, especially Tessa and Hardin's. One part that particularly stuck out to me was the argument they had in their English lecture. If it followed the original storyline, where they had kissed at the frat party, it would have made more sense. Or even if they placed this scene after the all important 'lake scene'. The scene was poorly placed, however it was executed generally well, which made the story hard to follow. As well as this, the movie moved way too fast. If you hadn't read the books before viewing, you would struggle to make sense of much of the film.
Another thing is the lack of sex, of course it is PG rated but when the original premise of the book was based on 'the sexual awakening of Tessa Young', it should never have been PG rated in the first place. The lack of sex stood out to me because the first book followed the story of how Hardin had taught Tessa all these things about sex after finding out she was a virgin and taking her virginity, for her to find out at the end of the book that it was a bet. They changed the bet completely in fact, so it was about making Tessa falling in love with him. I loved this book because it was daring, dangerous, different and it made me blush reading the detail that Todd put into her writing, the movie made me cringe. All these changes turned it into your typical teen love story, which we've all seen before.
A final thing was the difference between the 'book Hardin' and 'movie Hardin'. They are not even the same character. Hardin was dangerous, seductive and sexy in the books, in the movie he was a teenager with mood swings. The way Todd had written Hardin made us want him even though we knew we shouldn't, we had a love/hate relationship with him. He is a main character and he arrives to turn Theresa's world upside down, but he was sweet to Tessa from the beginning. There was no point where I was saying 'get away from him girl!' to the screen like I did with the book. He was a complex character that should've been easy to portray for a talented man like Hero Fiennes Tiffin, however I fear that the struggle to translate Hardin Scott from paper to screen had to do with the director Jenny Gage. She said that she wanted the film to be safe for her teenage children to watch. Well guess what Jenny? You did it; but in the process you destroyed the artistry that Anna Todd created and after fans will never forgive you for that.
Brilliant books - I recommend them 100%. However hold off on the film for now, from what I hear Jenny Gage is off the case and Anna is working on After We Collided (Book 2) with a new team.",After
876,skittles-30800,A good movie.. with gaps to fill,8,14 April 2019,"I have read the books so my opinion may be biased but I really enjoyed this movie and it was so worth going to watch. Although when most books turn into movies we know that they tend to leave a lot of things out, this is exactly what happened to this movie.
In the books we meet a very mysterious and rude Hardin but in the movie he has lost his mean streak that made Hardin, Hardin. Maybe they cut it for obvious toxic-relationship reasons but I feel like it maybe his character lack personality. Hero portrayed him amazingly and I quite enjoyed him as Hardin
Tessa's character was portrayed nearly perfectly to the books. Although to wish it wasn't PG-13, if you've read the books you would know that it's borderline 50 Shades of Grey. I get that they wanted to reach a larger audience for hopes of a sequel but now it's just another teen romance movie that lacks the sex driven madness of teenagers in college. I think both Hero and Jo played the characters perfectly and although it's PG-13 you can definitely see the passion that Hardin and Tessa have in the books.
I was very surprised by how good the movies directed and how beautiful the movie was in general like the lake scene and in between shots while they're driving. I loved the 5 second cameo of Anna around the end. Very cute. I love how although the bet scene happened they put more things to build onto in another movie and if there isn't a sequel, it still shows how although going through a heartbreak sucks there is still light at the end of the tunnel.I give this movie a 8.5/10, it lacked the depth that the books have and the beginning of the movie went by very fast, I only realized what all was going on by using background knowledge I knew from the books.Would I see this movie again? Yes! A million time yes! It was so so worth watching and I will recommend it to everyone I know.I really hope that there will be a sequel do to obvious reasons.. like stuff they left out and the ending. You can tell how much hard work they put into this movie and it was definitely worth itAlso if you haven't read the books you definitely should they're totally worth reading and can help fill in the gaps they left out in the movie.",After

879,amelaissa,Very disappointed,1,28 July 2019,"I really had high hopes for this movie since i read the book which I liked a lot , But this is the worst movie I've ever seen . not only did they skip most of the events in the book but the editing was also very bad.",After
880,guderjahn,Bad,2,11 October 2019,"The movie did not follow the book at all. The book was set in Washington not Georgia, Tristan was a male not a female, Jace did not come in till the second or third book, Noah was not at all what I imagined, the whole part of the bet was not to make her fall in love it was to take her virginity. The books weren't all that great because of the back and forth but this movie made the book 10x better. Tessa wasn't going to school for Econ she was going for publishing. Overall this movie was horrible. If they do decide to continue the series hopefully they do a better job following the book. Just like 50 shades, you have to make it rated R to get the full effect of the books.",After

882,markoucharalambia,Beautiful movie,9,25 May 2019,"I have to admit that I expected a lot from this movie, but I guess it's okay. I'm not complaining about the fact that the movie wasn't similar to the book, because Anna and Hero told us that the movie wouldn't be the same but, there were some memorable parts from the book that should be in the movie. Hero and Jo did an amazing job by representing their characters, Hardin and Tessa, to the fullest. Their chemistry is unbelievable.",After
