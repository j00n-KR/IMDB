0,TheLittleSongbird,Best sequel since the original,9,15 July 2011,"By all means it is not as good as the classic original, but it is better than the two sequels before it, the second was worthy, the third while not bad as such was a disappointment. On its own and as a sequel, Scream 4 is terrific. I loved the opening, it was bloody and funny and thankfully the rest of the film lived up of the opening. The production values are of high quality still, and the music and sound effects are as haunting and as unsettling as ever. The script has a number of funny lines too, the scares are genuinely intense, the story is well paced and entertaining, Wes Craven's direction is excellent and the characters are still credible with GhostFace still iconic and effective. The acting is great, Haydn Pannettiere is very good, and those from the previous movies who return turn in good performances as well. All in all, terrific and the best sequel since the original film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Scream 4
1,Leofwine_draca,"Redundant entry in the franchise, marginally better than the last couple",5,2 July 2013,"Yet another entry in the SCREAM franchise, just when you thought it had died for good. You know the score by now – new decade, new rules, there are plenty of in-jokes at the expense of post-modern horror films, while remakes in particular are singled out for criticism. The problem with the SCREAM sequels is that the whole story was told and done right in the first movie, which is rightly a classic; everything that's come since is just fluff, and SCREAM 4 is no different in that respect.It gets off on a bad foot, with an exceptionally grating self-referential opening featuring cameoing stars and film-within-a-film-within-a-film style spoofery. Then the real murder scene occurs, and it's just as ridiculous as those which have just been sent up – not a clever idea. Then, for the next hour, we're treated to a dull, all-too-similar rerun of the first movie's plot, except that the characters are poorly written and there's a sense of déjà vu hanging over the whole thing.I think the blame for much of the familiarity can be laid at the door of Kevin Williamson, whose inability to write anything not involving teenagers is becoming tiresome; he still seems to think he's cleverer than he is, and his script is boring and by rote for the most part. I won't blame Wes Craven too much, because he seems to direct anything these days, but you'd think that two such self-aware creators would avoid all the clichés that are played out here.The 'scare' scenes invariably involve loud noises designed to make you jump, and it's all very passé and yawn-inducing. Thankfully, things do pick up for the climax, where the action shifts to a house and becomes smaller-scale. There are some interesting twists regarding the identity of the killer, plenty of tension and some decent conflict; the second half of this movie is a definite improvement over the first.Unfortunately, the cast does irritate and it's faintly embarrassing to see some of these actors return to the fold. I mean, David Arquette was never anything to begin with, but seeing an ageing Neve Campbell reminds you of her virtual disappearance from our screens when once she seemed to have potential, while Courtney Cox is almost unrecognisable behind a ton of surgery. Meanwhile, the new, younger cast members, such as Emma Roberts and Rory Culkin, are poor shadows of the feisty figures from yesteryear. SCREAM 4 isn't a particularly bad movie, just an incredibly redundant one even if it does improve on the last two slightly.",Scream 4
2,SnoopyStyle,More Reunion than Reboot,6,25 September 2013,"Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson bring back the Scream franchise. It's been 10 years since the last movie. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) returns to town on her book tour. She reconnects with married couple Sheriff Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale (Courteney Cox). There are a whole cast of young actors to kill, Sidney's cousin Jill (Emma Roberts), and her friends (Hayden Panettiere, Marielle Jaffe, Rory Culkin, Erik Knudsen). Also, Ghostface is back happy to do the killing.After a 10 year hiatus, the franchise really needs a reboot. Instead we get more of a reunion. The tension between David Arquette and Courteney Cox didn't help. The self-referencing horror do feel old school. As a stand alone movie, it's functional. But it's not really going to restart the franchise.",Scream 4
3,claudio_carvalho,The Soul Survivor,5,14 September 2011,"The writer Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) returns to Woodsboro to release her new book ten years after the horror provoked in town by the Ghostface killer. When she arrives, the teenagers Jenny Randall (Aimee Teegarden) and Marnie Cooper (Brittany Robertson) are brutally stabbed by the Ghostface.Sheriff Dewey Riley (David Arquette) investigates the murder with his assistant Deputy Judy Hicks (Marley Shelton) and they find the murder weapon in the truck of Sidney's car. The writer is forced to stay in the house of her cousin Jill Roberts (Emma Roberts) while her old friend and Riley's wife Gale Weathers-Riley (Courteney Cox) snoops the case using her skill of investigative reporter. When Jill's friend Olivia Morris (Marielle Jaffe) and Sidney's press release assessor Rebecca Walters (Alison Brie) are murdered by the psychopath, Gale follows her instinct and teams-up with the members of the local Cinema Club since she believes that the killer is featuring remakes of the previous murders.""Scream 4"" is another flick of the good franchise that should have finished with the trilogy. Maybe it is time for the former Master of Horror Wes Craven to respectfully retire since his last works are not in the level of his fame. One of the best American directors of the horror genre, John Carpenter, is still refreshing in his last works. But Wes Craven's last films are deceptive.""Scream 4"" is an average horror film that uses the usual clichés of the genre and Sheriff Dewey Riley is probably the most ineffective police officer of the American cinema industry, missing his shots and arriving late whenever he is summoned. The conclusion, with the revelation of the real killer and her motives is quite absurd and ridiculous. The shape and beauty of forty-seven year-old Courteney Cox is impressive. Now even the killer also remakes murders reflecting the status-of-art of the American cinema industry of remakes. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Pânico 4"" (""Panic 4"")",Scream 4
4,nogodnomasters,EAT MY LEMON CAKES,8,31 May 2019,"The movie starts out cleverly as a movie within a movie, one that pokes fun at slasher movies. They ask, ""What is your favorite Scary Movie?"" I couldn't help but think about ""Scary Movie"" which admittedly I enjoy more than these Scream movies. After a decade has gone by we are reunited with the surviving cast to give us another slasher film, one where Courtney Cox is the only woman alive who can fight off a man in a mask with a knife. The whodunit element appears weak as the film only gives us two real suspects. But as it turns out, it is not the obvious. Instead we get an ending with a somewhat unexpected twist. Bravo on the script and to the actors.
No sex. No nudity.",Scream 4
5,kosmasp,Where do I start?,6,16 October 2011,"That wasn't really I question for my review. But if you have seen the movie you might know where I am going with my summary line. The joke up front does not really work out that well. Even though a character in the movie points out one of the flaws, it is still not that appealing. And while there quite a few holes in the internal logic of the movie (the recording thing being one of them, especially as we arrive at the final act), I didn't find them too distracting.Unfortunately though there wasn't a really big surprise in here as was in the second one. You can see things coming and you kinda guess where this is going. Even the old ""how did he/she know that"" cliché get warmed up, but you might not mind. There is quite a lot of humour in here and most of it actually works (which might be attributed to the fact K. Williamson is back on script writing duties, who was absent for the third Scream movie). Apart from that, if you have seen the other ones, you will watch this one. And I don't think you will be too disappointed (thanks part 3 for being so bad then I guess)",Scream 4
6,Sleepin_Dragon,It's a pretty good movie.,7,8 August 2021,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that Scream 5 was in the pipeline, it instantly prompted me to revisit the films. This film could have easily been a disaster, but in all reality, it's a pretty fun watch.I'm not sure there's much here for the casual viewer, it is one to please fans of the originals, and of course there is a new set of rules. I can't say I warmed hugely to any of the new cast, the joy comes from the original lineup.The start was very imaginative, and good fun, the ending definitely came out of left field, but it grabs your attention. Lots of scares and thrills.Here's to Scream 5.7/10.",Scream 4
7,gavin6942,The Franchise Is Back and in Good Form,7,25 September 2011,"Ten years have passed, and Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who has put herself back together thanks in part to her writing, is visited by the Ghostface Killer.Not only do we have the original writer and director, and the original cast (for the fourth film in a row), we have such great new talent as Alison Brie, Kristen Bell and Anna Paquin. Wow.Anyone who saw the first three films knows the original was great, the second was alright and the third was a weird mess. Expectations for a fourth had to be low, right? Well, even if you set them high, they were possibly met. I think this is the best film since the original, and I would be just fine pretending the second and third films never existed.",Scream 4
8,lee_eisenberg,full circle,8,19 October 2021,"There's a fifth ""Scream"" coming out soon, and I realized that I had never gotten around to seeing part four, so I went ahead and did so. As with the previous movies, Wes Craven's final film has a number of self-references, although in this case they imply that it's a reboot.Basically, ""Scream 4"" retains the fun of the previous movies, while updating it for the social media era. I was especially surprised to see some of the bit parts at the beginning.Enjoyable.",Scream 4
9,jboothmillard,Scre4m,3,21 April 2011,"From returning director Wes Craven (The Hills Have Eyes, A Nightmare on Elm Street) and returning writer Kevin Williamson (Dawson's Creek, The Vampire Diaries), it had been just over ten to twelve years since the previous sequel, but they brought us another one. Basically the film opens with two film within film clips from two Stab films, the first with characters Sherrie (Lucy Hale) and Trudie (Shenae Grimes), the second with Rachel (Anna Paquin) and Chloe (Kristen Bell), and then the real killing by the new ""Ghostface"" killer (voiced by Roger Jackson) is students Jenny Randall (Aimee Teegarden) and Marnie Cooper (Brittany Robertson). Then we see Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) returning to Woodsboro ten years since the murders, having got over the horrible incidents and coming out of seclusion, and promoting her new self-help book for her tour. Still living in the town are old friends, now married Sheriff Dwight 'Dewey' Riley (David Arquette) and Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), and she also reconnects with her aunt Kate (Mary McDonnell), and her cousin Jill Roberts (Aquamarine's Emma Roberts) who recently had her boyfriend Trevor Sheldon (Nico Tortorella) betray her. The killer of course shows up looking for Sidney, and in the meantime kills numerous victims with no real connections around town, including Jill's friend Olivia Morris (Marielle Jaffe), Sidney's publicist Rebecca Walters (Alison Brie), and police deputies Anthony Perkins (Scary Movie 3's Anthony Anderson) and Ross Hoss (The O.C.'s Adam Brody), and he badly injures Gale. In the end after the few appearances of the killer, some amusing geeky moments with horror loving nerds Robbie Mercer (Erik Knudsen) and Charlie Walker (Signs' Rory Culkin), other victims like Kirby Reed (Heroes' Hayden Panettiere) being pursued, and more talk of the Stab franchise, the killer's identity is revealed. It turns out to be Charlie in on it, but the real brains is Jill, extremely jealous of the fame Sidney has achieved becoming the innocent victim, and doing nothing else, and she wants a piece of that, being the last victim, and hurting herself to make it all convincing. In the end in hospital, where Gale is also recovering, Jill tries to kill Sidney in the final conflict, but of course she gets her comeuppance, but she does become a synonymous name with all the reporters talking about the killings and stuff. Also starring Marley Shelton as Deputy Judy Hicks and Heather Graham as Casey in Stab. Campbell is older and boring, Arquette and Cox aren't the most convincing as they may have been before, and the supporting cast try their best but the scripting is a slight let down, the only gripping moments for me, besides the deaths, was a phone call where Panettiere answered horror trivia questions and named loads of horror remakes, impressive. The film does in ways express the modern trend of endless sequels and remakes to classic horrors, with maybe one giggle or two, but just like Scream 3, it is not as witty or original like the first, and it is just a rehash of what's happened before, so a disappointing comeback horror sequel. Adequate!",Scream 4
10,Tweekums,A real return to form,8,8 November 2019,"Fifteen years have passed since the original Woodsboro massacre and a new generation of teens are about to get slaughtered. Coinciding with the anniversary of the events Sidney Prescott has returned to town to publicise a book she has written. After the two initial murders Sidney must remain in town so stays with her cousin Jill and her aunt. It soon becomes apparent that the new Ghostface plans to target people close to her family. Dewey Riley, who is now the sheriff leads the investigation while his wife, reporter Gale Riley, leads her own parallel investigation. Talking to members of the school film club the theory emerges that like the original Ghostface this killer is following a set of rules... but this time updated for a new decade as things have to be more extreme.I'll admit that I didn't expect too much of this... after all surely the fourth film in a franchise released ten years after the third instalment is sure to be a poor shadow of the original. Not in this case though. I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this. It provides plenty of scares, some nice misdirects, laughs and perhaps most importantly modifies the formula for a new decade without insulting the original. There is also a sense of danger as the viewer can't be sure that the original central characters will survive as the creators might want to clear the way for a new cast. The identity of the new Ghostface isn't too obvious nor is it too much of a surprise during the final reveal. Horror fans should enjoy the number of genre classics name-dropped during the film, mentally ticking off the ones they've seen and noting ones they need to watch. The cast does a solid job, nobody is going to win any Oscars but the performances fit the genre expectations. Overall I'd say that this is a must see for fans of the franchise and while it probably isn't necessary to have seen all the Scream films first it is necessary to have seen the original to get full enjoyment from this.",Scream 4
11,BA_Harrison,Scream and scream and scream and scream again.,3,27 March 2014,"Over a decade after the pitiful third movie drove a large knife between the shoulder blades of the popular Scream series, writer Kevin Willliamson and director Wes Craven desperately attempt to resurrect their highly profitable horror franchise with a fourth chapter that sees a masked killer (in the familiar guise of Ghostface) once again terrorising the citizens of Woodsboro, this time working by the rules of the remake/reboot. How ironic. And how completely and utterly disappointing the result.It's hard to believe, perhaps, but with Scre4m, Williamson and Wes have created a movie even more dire than part 3—an uninspired, not-in-the-least-bit-scary fail that appears to use its supposedly clever post-modern/meta status as a poor excuse to recycle all that has gone before. The result is stale and utterly predictable—so bad that, by the end of the film, I was longing for the series' long-suffering survivor Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) to die a very bloody and very final death, thereby ensuring a permanent end to the series. Sadly, it looks like part 5 might be just around the corner",Scream 4
12,paul_haakonsen,When will it end?...,4,25 August 2012,"I grew up with slasher icons such as Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger and Michael Meyers, so these 'new age' slasher movies never really appealed to me, though I have still seen them and given them the benefit of the doubt. But alas, they have failed to win me over.The storyline in ""Scream 4"" is just laughable. They should have stopped after the first two movies, after that it was steadily downhill. The story for the reason of the killer in part 4 was just so lame and laughable. I was shocked when it was revealed, and it really made the movie drop down in entertainment value.The good things about ""Scream 4"" is the brutality of it. There is more aggression and more brutal killings in this one compared to the prior three. But again, for me, it is hard to buy into the ghostface character as a slasher icon.I am sure that fans of the franchise will find ""Scream 4"" to be a great movie, as it takes stuff from the older three movies and mix it up with a new generation and new ""rules"" (as they put it themselves, in the movie). And it also takes itself by the neck and makes fun of itself and the genre in general - and that was an aspect that I actually enjoyed of the movie.However, I will say you have to be a fan of the franchise to fully appreciate this movie. I watched it out of sheer boredom and with nothing better at hand to watch. And having seen it now, I can say that I am still not won over by the ""Scream"" franchise.",Scream 4
13,BandSAboutMovies,Any promise lost,3,1 September 2020,"Despite there being no Scream movies for a decade - and no Ghostface murders in the universe of the films - there had been tons of Stab films, to the point that they'd become a joke. Sidney (Neve Campbell) had moved on to write books.While the film skewers studios, the studio behind it - oh hello, Weinsteins - played with this movie so much that the original ending, which started with Sidney being stabbed and the ending, which set up a sequel where she would have amnesia and be stalked by the killer of this film, were both thrown out. Kevin Williamson was upset, but after so many go arounds with Dimension Films, what do you expect?Sidney returns to on the fifteen anniversary of the murders, just in time for them to start all over again. Meanwhile, there's a Stabathon showing other installments in the film within a film (look for Anna Paquin, Kristen Bell and others in cameos in bits directed by Robert Rodriguez) and a publicist (Allison Brie) who lured our heroine home just for publicity.Emma Roberts from American Horror Story and Scream Queens plays Jill, Sidney's cousin and there's a whole new group of movie-quoting teens, including Hayden Panettiere and Rory Culkin.Craven and Williamson had both hoped for a fifth and sixth film, but the movie didn't do well and, sadly, Craven would pass on in 2015 (this was his last film). There was an MTV series without Williamson's involvement, but supposedly a new film is on its way.Life moved along as these films were made. In the first Scream, Cox and Arquette flirted. In the second, they were dating. The third was filmed just as they came back from their honeymoon. And they were separated by the time this one was finished.For a film that's critical of remakes and torture porn, it's ironic that Craven produced recreated versions of Carnival of Souls, The Hills Have Eyes and Last House on the Left, with that last film pretty much creating the torture porn blueprint.",Scream 4
14,Coventry,"Act your age, Mr. Craven!",6,11 May 2012,"Writer/director Wes Craven was born in 1939 and hence more than 70 years of age when ""Scream 4"" got released. Just to make a comparison, my own father was born in 1954 – so not even 60 yet - but he doesn't know a single thing about social media (like Facebook, Twitter and such), multimedia equipment or let alone the average type of conversations going on at a high-school playground. This belated fourth entry in the series is literally stuffed with new media references and teenage slang. Ever since the original ""Scream"" film already, Wes Craven appears to suffer from some kind of strange variant of a midlife-crisis where he desperately insists to proof that he still is a youth-orientated and ""cool"" director who's knows what's on the minds of nowadays adolescents. The midlife-crisis also reflects through his other films apart from the ""Scream"" cycle, like ""Cursed"" and ""My Soul to Take"". You could easily state that his efforts to keep up with the times are praiseworthy, but –personally at least – I feel that it's becoming a bit exaggerated and on the verge of pathetic even. This man wrote and directed some of the most innovative and groundbreaking movies in the genre when he was younger, like ""Last House on the Left"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", and therefore already earned his place in the horror hall of fame without having anything else to prove. The new ""Scream"" flick is everything you would expect from a revival of a franchise that was immensely popular ten years ago. It's hugely predictable and pretentious, full of fresh new faces and familiar old ones and literally stuffed like a Thanksgiving turkey with brutality, sadistic gore and graphic make-up effects. Part four truly qualifies as a prototypic slasher that any over-enthusiast horror crowd will absolutely love, but also instantly forget. But I certainly don't intend to write too many harsh and negative elements, as I wholeheartedly admit that this brand new effort actually lives up to the 1996 original and that's a rare event in the horror industry. It even seems that Craven and C° realize this as well, because the characters always refer to things that occurred in the first movie but never to anything that happened in the mediocre part two or the dreadful part three.Many, many years have passed since the infamous Woodsboro murders, but the students at the local high-school are all still very much obsessed with the murders that made their school world famous. The annual Memorial Day is coming forth soon, and the geeky local horror fanatics are hugely anticipating the traditional ""Stab"" movie marathon and the complementary party where everyone puts on their Ghostface mask and ask each other what their favorite scary movie is. And since times and technology have evolved so much, they now even have Ghostface voice-apps and other sorts of foolishness on their cell phones! This year's remembrance is supposed to become even more legendary, as the one and only Sidney Prescott – three time survivor of Ghostface's malicious intents in the past – returns home to introduce her own self-published novel. But  surprise, surprise  with Sidney's homecoming and the subsequent reunion with Deputy Riley and former news reporter Gale Weathers, there's another familiar Woodsboro regular popping up again, only this one carries around a sharp knife and loves to barbarically slaughter everyone close to Sidney's cute little cousin Jill. In other words: same stuff, different decade But ""Scream 4"" is nonetheless fast-paced and entertaining, with plentiful of vile and sickening gore. Straight from the satirical opening sequences, generating an absurd film-within-film structure, the cruelty and grossness is unmistakable and sets the tone for a very bloody movie. The witty remarks and inside jokes are alternately hit and miss (though more misses than hits) and naturally you'll need a whole lot ""suspension of disbelief"" with this one. Particularly when approaching the finale and the identity of the killer more and more begins to unfold, there are a large number of details that don't make the least bit of sense. Also, and this is a thought I encounter more frequently with nowadays horror movies, no serial killer can possibly be as sadistic as illustrated here. Most of the youthful fresh-faced stars and starlets deliver adequate performances. I especially liked Hayden Panettiere and Alison Brie, perhaps also because they're ravishing looking girls, but the best actresses appear only in small insignificant roles, like Anna Paquin, Kirsten Bell and Aimee Teegarden (as random victims numbers 3,4 and 5), Mary Shelton as a deputy and the always reliable Mary McDonnell as one of the teenagers' mother.",Scream 4
15,hitchcockthelegend,Out of darkness comes another cash cow to chow down on well trodden grass.,4,9 September 2011,"Scream 4 is directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. It's the fourth film in the Scream franchise and stars David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Emma Roberts and Hayden Panettiere. Music is by Marco Beltrami and photography by Peter Deming. 10 years after the events in Scream 3, plot finds Sidney Prescott (Campbell) returning to Woodsboro to promote her new best selling book Out of Darkness. Wouldn't you know it, there's more Ghostface killings, and being targeted is Sidney's young cousin and her high school pals. Who wanted another Scream movie really? Part 3, whilst hardly going out in a blaze of glory, did at least wrap things up nicely and still had the last whiff of freshness about it. Here Craven and Williamson do their respective best to update the franchise with nods to web cams, twitter and social networks et al, but the returning cast members look bored (Campbell took a whole lot of convincing to return) and the murder mystery/slasher formula just comes off as tired and weary. Were it not for some spunky performances by the younger cast members (Roberts, Panettiere, Rory Culkin and Erik Knudsen), who clearly want to be in a Scream movie, then this would be forgotten in a hurry by all except newcomers to the franchise. The final outcome does nothing to save the films failings, it's predictable and lacking any sense of originality, while the killings are standard fare and not even able to give the lamentable Final Destination 4 a run for its money. Maybe that's part of the problem? Since Scream 3 just how many slashers have we had sequel and remake wise? Hostel, Final Destination, Saw, Hills Have Eyes, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House On The Left, not all great, but all considerably more bloody than Scream 4. The only thing bloody about Scream 4 is the bloody irony that Wes Craven was once the man who reinvigorated a stagnated sub-genre of horror by embracing its rules and regulations, now he is in danger of being the man to drag its rotting carcass across embarrassing pastures. Never thought I would have the chance to say this, but Scream 3 is no longer the worst film in the series. 4/10",Scream 4
16,Hey_Sweden,It will deliver the goods for die-hard series fans.,6,5 October 2021,"11 years into the new millennium, and Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has written a book about her status as a ""survivor""; she's arrived back in Woodsboro as the last stop in the book tour. She's also in town to meet a niece (Emma Roberts) who's virtually a stranger. But wouldn't you know it: once again an extremely sadistic cretin is determined to paint the whole town red. And this is a cretin violently hungering for fame and fortune. Acknowledging the changing times, they go out of their way to film their murders so they can eventually be posted online.This viewer was never a particularly big fan of this series, and by this point the whole self-awareness / meta approach / quoting of genre classics formula was really getting old. Things get off to a deliberately ridiculous, supposedly clever start that seems to be commenting on the repetitive nature of horror film formulas. Overall, this is yet another in the now long line of horror films that exploit some fans' obsessions over reboots, remakes, revivals, you name it.If you're a series fan, of course, you'll probably have few complaints: the kills are exceedingly violent, the cast is attractive and gives the proceedings 100% (although I'm really getting tired of the Sidney, Gale, and Dewey characters by this point). Standouts for me were Roberts, Marley Shelton as a deputy, and the sassy Hayden Panettiere as one of Jills' friends. Thankfully, Dewey is not AS goofy as he's been in past entries, and is easier to take seriously. The film is reasonably well made and the story reasonably well told, and there are some amusing touches that helped this viewer enjoy this one just a bit more: the throwaway gag 12 minutes in with Dewey's wakeup call, and the extended sequence where the killer, once revealed, goes to GREAT lengths to inflict wounds upon themselves. The dialogue regarding cliches of cops in movies was worthy of a few chuckles.The HILARIOUS, utterly absurd ending is the best part, where you have characters who remain in real fighting shape DESPITE sustaining serious wounds.Sadly, the last film for the celebrated director Wes Craven, who passed away four years later.Six out of 10.",Scream 4
17,preppy-3,"Funny, bloody and violent--a GREAT sequel!",8,23 April 2011,"It's been 10 years since Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) fought the last Ghostface killer. She returns to her home town (Woodsboro) to promote a book she wrote about surviving and dealing with the attacks. Her old friends Sheriff Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and Gail Weathers-Riley (Courtney Cox) are married and still in town. Sidney stays at her neices Jill Roberts (Emma Roberts) place---and Ghostface attacks and threatens Sidney, Jill and her two friends Olivia (Marielle Jaffe) and Kirby (Hayden Panettiere). Also Jills ex Trevor Sheldon (Nico Tortorella) won't leave Jill alone.This opens with a VERY bloody and (purposely) very funny parody of ""Scream"" and other horror movies and then goes full force into its story. It moves quickly and is easily the bloodiest of the ""Scream"" movies with a huge body count. The dialogue is sharp and witty, the violence bloody and frightening and, for the most part, the acting is good. The script goes careening out of control at the end--but all Wes Craven movies are like that. As for the acting--Campbell, Cox and Arquette are great. Newcomers Panettiere, Roberts and Jaffe are also good. Tortorella is terrible--but he has nothing to work with. He's just there to stand around and look handsome which he pulls off. This is as good as ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2"". Thank God it isn't the disaster that ""Scream 3"" was! I give this an 8. I got a good laugh out of the directorial credits for ""Stab""!",Scream 4
18,zardoz-13,"More Ream Than ""Scream"" in the Fourth Installment",7,18 April 2011,"The ""Scream"" film franchise carved a memorable niche out of the slasher movie genre between the years 1996 to 2000. Not only was the original ""Scream"" trilogy a hoot because it ridiculed genre classics such as ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" but it was also a holler since it delivered its sadism with smarts that the grisly classics shunned. ""Scream"" director Wes Craven and scenarist Kevin Williamson have waited just over a decade to reboot the franchise with ""Scream 4."" Judging from its dearth of creativity, the latest installment doesn't deliver enough of anything to whet our appetite for a fifth entry. Mind you, the production values are solid and the gore is more than adequate, it's primarily the story that leaves something to be desired. Craven and Williamson have bled the franchise of its cutting edge spontaneity while other more potent franchises, such as the hilarious ""Scary Movie"" comedies and the sadistic ""Saw"" sagas, have emerged to make the ""Scream"" movies appear prudish by comparison. Although original survivor Neve Campbell, small-town Barney Fife sheriff David Arquette, and savvy news reporter Courteney Cox reprise their roles, their presence adds only minimal novelty to this thawed out run-of-thrill chiller. Nevertheless, the insightful cinematic criticism that permeated the original trilogy is just as razor-sharp in ""Scream 4."" The new technology, such as web streaming, Twitter, and smart phone applications that enable callers to garble their voices like Ghostface, is clever, but none substantially strengthen the threadbare plot. Chiefly, the motive that the new killers espouse to resume their homicide for the hell of it is incredibly lackluster. Indeed, sitting through the repetitive ""Scream 4"" is like attending a high school reunion where your old classmates have invited their offspring to enliven the occasion.Craven and Williamson jump start the action with five wicked murders with twists that follow one another in rapid succession. Indeed, they rely on those creepy as well as surefire phone calls from an anonymous caller (voiced by Roger L. Jackson)to the girls about their favorite scary movies. Actresses Anna Paquin of ""X-Men"" fame, Kristen Bell of TV's ""Veronica Mars,"" and Heather Graham of ""Scream 2"" pop up in cameos during these opening gambits. Basically, they have modified a skillful tactic that director John Landis deployed with considerable effect in his legendary 1981 chiller ""An American Werewolf in London."" After the opening credits subside, we find ourselves back in the small town of Woodsboro as Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell of ""The Craft"") returns as a part of her publicity tour for her new self-help tome ""Out of the Darkness."" Sidney was the survivor girl in the original trilogy. We learn that Deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") has been promoted to sheriff, while investigative journalist Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox of TV's ""Cougar Town"") has given up her old job to settle down with Dewey as his wife while she writes exploitation novels about the Woodsboro murders. No sooner has Sidney shown up for her book promotion tour than Dewey and his deputy Judy Hicks (Marley Shelton of ""Never Been Kissed""), careen up to find the cell phone of a recently slain Woodsboro teenager in the trunk of our heroine's rental car.Although Sheriff Riley and Deputy Hicks struggle to keep a lid on the double homicide of high school teens Jenny Randall (Aimee Teegarden of TV's ""Hannah Montana"") and Marnie Cooper (Brittany Robertson of ""Dan in Real Life""), everybody at Woodsboro High School knows about the murders before lunch. As tragic as the news is, the scene in a classroom where virtually the entire student body responds to their chiming cell phones is rather amusing. Since Sidney is a material witness in the case, Dewey demands that she stick around until he can clear up the mystery. She winds up staying with her aunt Kate Roberts (Mary McDonnell of ""Dances With Wolves"") and cousin Jill (Emma Roberts of ""Nancy Drew"") while a psychotic murderer decked out in a black cape with Edvard Munch mask stabs its way through hapless teens. The most likely suspect is Jill's ex-boyfriend Trevor Sheldon (Nico Tortorella of ""Twelve"") who cheated on her. Jill's two friends, Olivia Morris (Marielle Jaffe of ""Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief"") and Kirby Reed (Hayden Panettiere of TV's ""Heroes""), run interference for her against the ubiquitous Trevor who appears to be stalking her.Like previous ""Scream"" installments, ""Scream 4"" boasts two nerdy characters, Charlie Walker (Rory Culkin of ""Signs"") and Robbie Mercer (Erik Knudsen of ""Beastly""), who serve as trivial pursuit connoisseurs on horror movies. The charm of the original ""Scream"" trilogy was that everybody suspected who was going to die next based on the conventions of the slasher genre. The running joke here is that gay characters enjoy a greater chance of survival than heterosexual characters. Ultimately, this isn't the case. Everybody who congregates around the new Sidney--Jill--and her ex-boyfriend Trevor stands an excellent chance of dying. The problem with all this shrewdly staged nonsense is that none of the old rules apply. None of the teens is involved in illicit relationships that make them vulnerable to a serial killer. Primarily, they become victims when they are isolated in a house, and the sheriff deputies sent to protect them fare no better as our killer doesn't discriminate against them when it comes time to stab. The biggest problem is that none of the new teens make very interesting characters and the thespians that portray them lack charisma. Finally, the last quarter-hour is worse than a classic slasher as things grow repetitively far-fetched, and ""Scream 4"" draws this finale out to absurd lengths. Although it isn't a total waste of time, ""Scream 4"" suffers from over-familiarity and needless self-referentialism.",Scream 4
19,Calicodreamin,How to be a final girl,7,26 October 2021,Ghostface is back and no one is safe! This fourth installment in Scream is how a proper sequel works. Pays homage to the original but adds some new elements and fresh cannon fodder. The storyline was well developed and the ending was actually kind of unexpected.,Scream 4
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Lives up to the series,7,17 April 2011,"It's been ten years since a psycho in a Ghostface mask made calls to, and killed, young people when they were alone in Woodsboro. Sidney has stopped considering herself a victim, with a novel by her out about it. Gale is no longer a reporter, she is now writing fiction. Well, trying to. And she's married to Dewey(now a sheriff, so he commands respect... well, he'd like to, anyway). However, the decade anniversary has someone starting up the murders again, in a horror movie reboot(the only kind the studios greenlight nowadays). This focuses mainly on the original, and if you love that one(watch it before this one), you're likely to enjoy this, as well(it wouldn't hurt to know a little bit about the recent remakes... you don't need to have seen the other two parts of the trilogy, though), and everything that was positive about these three is present here. We have a memorable opening and excellent climax, tons of surprises, red herrings all over the place, jump-scares, tension, suspense, great dialog and characters(that are also consistent), good acting(I don't know most of these new faces, but they do well... Panettiere seems to mistake the Y in her role's name for a chromosome, and her hair isn't exactly flattering), hot chicks, bloody(occasionally gory), sometimes creative deaths aplenty and a solid serving of meta. No, a sequel wasn't necessary(it never was, it could have just been the '96 one), and this doesn't change that. Still, it's a fun ride, the script holds up, and it doesn't devolve into torture porn. We even get The Voice back, and he's used more than in the last two combined. I recommend this to any fan of Craven and Williamson and this franchise. 7/10",Scream 4

Relatively bloody good with original scribe Kevin Williamson (and an uncredited Ehren Kruger) back to keep things at a lively clip and horror meister Wes Craven still throwing out the usual scares (pounce music, hand on shoulder close ups etc.) but the young cast is outweighed by its old school original trio in the acting department (i.e. you could care less who gets offed except these three!) and the twists and turns echo the original. A tad too meta and self-referential even for a film that started the whole horror irony genre.",Scream 4

And, guess what, they start again.The pleasing mix of knowing movie reference, slasher killings, and who-is-it? works as well as ever, thanks to a new crop of suspects who, one by one, become victims. The slaughter is more graphic than before, in keeping with the direction slasher films have move in during the last 10 years. The script is deft, and the guessing is good and constantly misleading! Part 4 happily takes its place alongside the other 3 - it is just as good.",Scream 4
23,morrison-dylan-fan,Stabbing out of the past.,8,18 April 2011,"During my last few years at school,one of the things that I would constantly hear was people doing bad impressions of the killer (s) voice from the film Scream,with the line ""Hello Sidney!"" repeated again and again. (with the only other saying that kept being repeated in my school,being the now extremely uncool and embarrassing ""Wotssssuuuuuup!"")This led me to completely dismissing the Scream trilogy as something that was not worth seeing at all.About two years after leaving school,I was one night looking through the movie channels,and I noticed that they were showing an excellent alien high-school invasion film called The Faculity.After the film ended I decided to look on IMDb to try and find out more about the film.One of the first things I discovered was that the writer of Faculity had written the great TV series Dawsons Creek (!),and the first two Scream films.With reading this,I felt that I should at last give the Scream Trilogy a chance,and watch them all over one weekend.To my complete surprise,I was shocked to find out that instead of relaying on cheap catchphrases,the first Scream film was actually an excellently written and directed horror thriller,that along with being filled with some very witty writing,the film also had a very good amount of genuine scares.As I jumped right into 2 and 3,I was left a bit disappointed that the scares and the wittiness of the dialogue seemed to lose their edge as the films went on.Thankfully after having watched this film,it seems that Craven and Williamson have found their edge again with a vengeance.The plot: With having left the sleepy town of Woodsboro ten years ago,after having survived ""The Woodsboro Massacre""Sindney Prescott decides to return to the town (which is ""celebrating"" the 15th anniversary of the massacre)to try and reconnect with her family (and to try and get people to buy her new self-help book about surviving the murders.)When Sidney starts to try and rekindle her friendships with her family and friends,she is a bit taken aback with how much things have changed,with her best-friend and her former arch-enemy (Dewey Riley and Gale Weathers) now being a married couple! (and Dewey now having also been promoted to being the sheriff of the town) This starts to make Prescott feel that it is going to take her some time to get used to the huge changes.Along with her friends,Sidney has a huge amount of trouble restarting things with her family,things are not helped that much when her cousin Jill (who Sidney desperately wants to get on with,due to seeing some of her own young self in Jill) starts calling Sidney ""The Angel Of Death"".Luckaly with a book signing coming up Prescott feels that she has a chance to try and move on from the past.Sadly during the signing Dewey arrives at the signing telling everyone that they need to stop the signing for a moment,due to the police thinking that an important mobile phone is somewhere in the location.Eventally the cops realise that the mobile phone is in the boot of Sidney Prescotts car.When Sidney and Dewey open the boot,they are horrified to discover that a bloody knife has been left in the boot,with splatters of blood also being smeared on to pictures of Prescott.Finding this starts to make everyone feel that along with Sidney coming back to Woodsboro,something much nastier then ever before has also come back with her...View on the film: For the opening,directer Wes Craven gives the film a real knock out punch,with the first 15 minutes of the movie being filled with some very funny cameos and some shocks that are guaranteed to grab your attention by the throat!.With the fantastic murders in the film,Craven completely changes the lay out of the series,by having all of the victims putting up a very good fight against their attacker (the fights are also helped by looking surprisingly very rough and real by the excellent stunt work from stunt Coordinator Troy Brown.)During the middle of the film,I have to admit that I was sadly a bit disappointed with what Kevin Williamson had written,with the scenes of Sidney trying to sort out things with her family (which should have helped to give a bit more depth to the characters)feeling very drawn out and unengaged,with Williamson trying (and falling) to bring back memories of his very entertaining writing of teenage characters.Luckaly for the second half of the film Williamsons screenplay completely gels with Cravens turbo-charged directing,with the film being filled with strong set-pices (""the horror festival"" and ""the car park police statement"" scenes being two excellent examples)Along with the thrills,Williamson gives the characters some fantastic pop-culture riffing dialogue (such as someone having to name every remake of an American horror film from the last ten years!) that easily equals the great dialogue from the first film.For the ending,Craven decides to go in the opposite direction of the very disappointing endings to part 2 and 3,and to instead make the ending a lot more raw and nerve-wreaking intense.Final view on the film: An extremely strong return for the series,packed with some excellent shocks from Craven,and a very well-paced screenplay from returning writer Kevin Williamson.",Scream 4
24,anaconda-40658,Four Times as Stupid.,3,3 June 2015,"Scream 4 (2011): Dir: Wes Craven / Cast: Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Emma Roberts, Rory Culkin: Another embarrassing sequel that cannot even create innovation in the violence, which is what these films usually resort too. Neve Campbell once again portrays Sydney who returns to the town for which the murders of the previous films took place. She wrote a book about surviving tragedy but unfortunately bodies began to surface. It is clear very early that this franchise has run its course. Wes Craven seems to be returning to the well too often but who can blame him since his last film, My Soul to Take was a piece of junk. Now he seems to be sending the Scream franchise to the same junk yard. This is a major reduction for the director who made A Nightmare on Elm Street. Campbell still looks fetching as Sydney but the role is more or less a showdown in what is basically a mirror of the first film. Courtney Cox as Gale Weathers is the one role of interest. She is attempting a career in writing but finds a desire to return to journalism. She attempts to plant cameras at a party but her plan is sabotaged. David Arquette returns as the town sheriff and he is every bit as useless as expected. Emma Roberts appears as Sydney's cousin who also becomes a target in this spree. This film is filled with meatheads who are never interesting and whose prime function is to get stabbed to death. It's purpose is to convey film reboots, as if it is needed here. It is made purely to ignite further interest in a franchise that died after the original film. A great idea would be to take this shat box film and use it as a target for the sharpest butcher knife available. Score: 3 ½ / 10",Scream 4
25,bombersflyup,"The more I think about it, the less I like it.",7,29 June 2019,"Scream 4 is a decent film, though much flawed.It's lacking a lead or a star and there aren't any particularly likable characters to root for. Also it's a little too self aware, which loses some of the epic kill moments that would otherwise be in such a film, in order for the characters to discuss it. I like the Stab precursors, but one of these actresses should of been in the main cast. As the two lead girls playing Jill and Kirby don't evoke any feeling.",Scream 4
26,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Enjoyable if not as important as the others,7,20 August 2015,"After returning to her hometown to continue her book tour, the survivor of several serial killer attacks finds her and her friends under attack by another killer looking to finish what the others started, putting them in the path of the madman.This was easily the weakest of the series and didn't have a lot going for it. The biggest problem with this was the fact that there's just so much talk about the rules and regulations of horror versus real-life that it just gets old after a while. It wasn't all that interesting to constantly hear from these supposed experts on the genres to blurt out something that can save their lives, then do the same thing to get them into trouble with the killer, seemingly at odds with the usual motifs featured here and built more as an excuse to showcase them than comment on their very nature. Even going so far as to continually go after the rules of the genre that are updated since the last entry and given more modern technology to accomplish this just makes this one more pretentious than smart, and the times where they delve deeper as in the constantly switched-over beginnings or the different conversations regarding the different film franchises and their rules are exactly like what happened with the original. As well, the finale was an unmitigated disaster as the killer's revelation isn't much of a surprise while the motive which was just plain embarrassing to see used in a major film that made no sense on top of that at all as the preparation scenes and the ending in the hospital tends to go on for far too long, with the preparation ones coming off as comical and the hospital almost seemingly to bump it's running time. Still, there's enough here to make this one watchable as a few stalking scenes were good here, mainly in the first half here where the group is tormented over the phone only to appear and brutally attack from another direction entirely, the parking garage ambush is insanely chilling and the stalking around the film festival as well as at the house later on are both highly thrilling with lots of action and the few novel attempts at incorporating the attempted commentary on the modern horror audience that it was aiming for throughout here. That marks up the film's biggest positive as this one does a fairly impressive job at updating and upgrading the rules of the genre for more modern fans and actually getting them right, however badly it fails on executing them in the film proper. The last plus here is that the kills were gory enough to matter and quite shocking at times though a little variety would've been nice as it's all simple knifings. Otherwise this one was enjoyable but not all that great as the others.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",Scream 4

After a really poor opener,the film is back to basics, and all the original characters are here, albeit looking a little more haggard and in one case, a little bloated around the face.We have the usual film trivia banter, laden across the (not so clever) script, and it really does feel like it's 1996 again, that's how far the film has advanced.For a film that has a hell of a lot of living up to do, it fails miserably. the two main things it has, advances in technology, and the 'Gorenography' passion many had in the mid-noughties, are not used enough, so it's just a case of Ghostface phoning some one up, and then jumping out of a closet.The trailer suggests that none of the main cast are safe, but don't worry, you know Craven and Williamson and the Weinsteins are more worried about the fifth, rather than surprising audiences.The cast do a god job in their roles, and make the film watchable, other than Stone, who is just the pits.It's better than the third,at least, but if you're expecting something a little fresh and smarter than recent horrors, don't bother.it' a dud.",Scream 4

The story is quite good for this kind of movie could be irritating but it isn't. If it is a finale for the series it's quite good. Don't really need another one after this.Lots of young A list female TV stars of CW and ABC family TV populate this movie. Courtney Cox looks great but Neve Campbell is a bit puffy now.

29,Wuchakk,Improves upon the original,6,8 October 2017,"RELEASED IN 2011, Wes Craven's ""Scream 4"" chronicles events 10 years after the previous film (from 2000) when author Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) returns home to Woodsboro wherein she reacquaints with Sheriff Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale (Courteney Cox), who are now married, as well as her cousin Jill (Emma Roberts) and her Aunt Kate (Mary McDonnell). Unfortunately, Sidney's presence also marks the return of the Ghostface killer, who has a healthy assortment of new young victims from which to choose (e.g. Hayden Panettiere & Marielle Jaffe). Marley Shelton plays the new deputy who stirs Gale's jealousy while Erik Knudsen & Rory Culkin play two slasher film geeks. Nico Tortorella is on hand as a likely suspect.While ""Scream"" (1996) tends to be deemed a standout slasher flick, I was never a big fan, despite some positives, like Rose McGowan, the numerous references to horror flick lore and the whodunit factor. Why not a fan? Because it tried to walk the balance beam between serious slasher and amusing parody, which created an odd vibe. It prevented me from buying what was going on as reality. The camp and contrivances kept screaming ""This is all a joke,"" like Henry Winkler's weird principal. As such, I never found the movie scary despite some shocking elements and buckets of gore.Another negative for me was the host of unlikable, obnoxious or annoying characters: When most of the main characters are repugnant, it's impossible to care about them. Let 'em all get slashed to death for all I cared, lol. Then there's the ridiculously over-the-top last act, which was so contrived, cartoony and drenched in fake blood I just rolled my eyes in disbelief. All this was compounded by the clumsy and weak killer, which I suppose made sense once you eventually discovered the identity of Ghostface.As soon as I started viewing ""Scream 4"" I had more positive feelings toward the original because now the main characters and the fictional town of Woodsboro seemed so familiar and I was swiftly able to enter into their world, amusingly surreal though it may be. While this third sequel shares some of the original's problematic parts, like the overdone bloody climax, it fixed some of the negatives and is just all-around more palatable and entertaining, particularly the witty first act and the inventive climax, inventive as far as who the killer(s) is and their motivations.Unfortunately, cutie Panettiere looks almost anorexic (Note to women: Please quit starving yourself, most men DON'T like the too-thin-no-curves look). But I suppose this is made up for by Anna Paquin, Kristen Bell and Aimee Teegarden, brief though their appearances may be (Paquin is stunning).The film runs 111 minutes and was shot mostly in Michigan (too many places to note), but also Healdsburg, California.

30,trashgang,ghostface did it again,8,7 September 2011,"Was I afraid to see this feature not for the scary parts but making another part in the franchise after 11 years and after 15 years of part 1. The horror genre revived after Scream part 1 but the scene also changed a lot with some ultra gory flicks (Hostel, Saw,...). And be honest, Scream was always a mix between comedy and jump moments. By seeing My Soul To Take, the teaser for Scream 4 I saw that Wes still could make a decent flick. The positive part of Scream 4 is that the old crew is back on track, of course aged a lot, especially Courtney Cox with I guess a botoxed mouth. It could be a new start for Neve Campbell too who still looks the same, a bit fatter but what the hell, it's about the movie we should talk. The fun part starts immediately in the beginning, we are going back to Stab, the movie about the life of Sidney Prescott. It's funny to see Anna Paquin having a small role in Scream 4. The story luckily stays the same as in all the other Screams but sadly it doesn't add anything special to the genre. I mean, the surprise that it had in 1996 has gone. It's never scary or whatsoever and I never jumped in my seat, you really see things coming. The red stuff do flows copious and you even will see some guts but it's still one for the major crowd. If you have liked the Scream franchise or the I Know What You Did franchise then it's surely something for you. If you are a Saw buff, leave it as they make clear in the first minutes, no, not a torture porn. But Wes did know how to keep you attracted to it. And for the geeks, do the quiz somewhere in the flick when Ghostface is asking a victim some questions. Scream 4, one for the madding crowd and I'm sure a new generation will pick up the old stuff too.

32,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Scream 4,8,14 April 2011,"Rarely does a fourth film live up to its franchise, but Scream 4 has Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson, who wrote the first two installments, to thank for in bringing a lot more to the table through this film than if it were to end in a trilogy, since Ehren Kruger's story in that one is the weakest of the lot. So instead of ending the franchise with a whimper, this takes it back to a roar, and doing so also by reuniting members of the original cast in Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox.It is some 15 years since the first Woodsbro massacre, and the town is geared up for the return of Sidney Prescott (Campbell) who is doing a homecoming of sorts in a new career as a writer, sharing her experience through an inspirational book. But to welcome her back is a series of murders purported by yet another Ghostface, though this time round this serial killer seems a little more savvy, edgy, and clearly a lot more psychopathic in wanting to get rid of Sidney's loved ones, and then some. Joining the fray and as fodder for Ghostface include the return of Dewey Riley (Arquette), now Sheriff, his wife Gale Weathers-Riley (Courtney Cox) who is now at a loss of a crossroads in her life without much meaning since Sidney and Ghostface have been dormant, Sidney's cousin Jill Roberts (Emma Roberts), her ex boyfriend Trevor (Nico Tortorella) and her best friend Kriby Reed (Hayden Panettiere) a horror movie junkie, as well as nerds Charlie Walker (Rory Culkin) and Robbie Mercer (Erik Knudsen) who started Stabathon and into its third season.You may remember the Stab films, which is the film within the film in Scream that adapts the murders, and the opening sequence of Scream 4 is rather fun as it pokes fun and almost self- parodies itself. And this is where it provided opportunities as a launchpad for the filmmakers to lampoon the recent Hollywood trend of torture porn films (will surely get some Saw film fans up in arms), and to criticize the numerous reboots and remakes especially in the horror genre. Trivia pursuit in the horror genre also becomes the order of the day since there are a number of nerdy characters here who preach about the merits and patterns formed in modern day horror stories, and every moment where it can reference other films, or the genre, Williamson's story exploits and takes full advantage of that, as well as digging deep and going back to the first film as a loopback of sorts since the new killer seemed to have followed the pattern as seen in the original.To say anything more would mean to spoil the story and its surprises along the way, but do bear in mind that while Scream 4 tries hard to reinvent itself yet stay relevantly formulaic to its established rules, there are some consistencies that cannot fail to go away, such as how gung ho Sidney Prescott can really be in fending off Ghostface as compared to other smaller, more unfortunate characters, and how the cops always seem to caught flat footed and not arrive until the show's over. Rules get revisited thanks to the a pause in the narrative to run through how things have got updated in today's world, and what would seem like a stinging commentary on youths of today, having the mindset of instant gratification and adopting shortcuts to success in wanting to emulate their heroes rather than to go through the school of hard knocks.While Wes Craven doesn't direct anything too fanciful in the film to allow the story to shine, after all he did exclaim he'll only be back if the story's up to mark, I have to confess that he still possesses the knack for crating moments to make you jump at your seat or to make your heart skip a beat even though you know something's peering and expected around the corner. With the right material such as this one on hand, he again shows why he's quite up there as masters of the genre, and what made this a lot more meaningful is the return of the original principal cast members to guide the newcomers through, even though they look visibly aged, in line with the characters they play in real time, being idols that are looked up to, from Dewey the Sheriff and his female deputy Judy Hicks (Marley Shelton) to provide for some tension with his wife Gale, Gale herself being idolized by Sidney's publicist (Alison Brie), and needless to say Sidney Prescott being the celebrity that she is to have stood up against multiple versions of Ghostface.Scream 4 will be a definite treat especially for those who have followed the series right from the start. There are plenty of references and easter eggs here pertaining to the earlier installments, so the challenge here is to try and spot them all in one sitting, which contributes to the fun. Those who have not acquainted yourself to the Scream trilogy will fare better if you spend some time dipping into the older films so that you can get to enjoy this one at a much deeper level. As I mentioned, rarely does a fourth film live up to the expectations set by the first, and continuing with that level of confidence that it will not be the worst film of the lot, and Scream 4 satisfies on both accounts. A surefire recommendation for Scream fans to wipe that bad aftertaste of Scream 3, and a worthy finale (if it ends here) to the franchise.",Scream 4
33,namashi_1,Fairly Entertaining...,6,16 September 2011,"The fourth installment in the Scream film series, 'Scream 4' is a fairly entertaining film, that offers some chilling moments in the goings-on and manages to sail safe. However, the culmination isn't very effective.'Scream 4' Synopsis: Ten years have passed, and Sidney Prescott, who has put herself back together thanks in part to her writing, is visited by the Ghostface Killer.Wes Craven's Body Of Work is truly impressive. Right from his Debut Film 'The Last House on the Left', to his blockbuster cult-classic 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' to the 'Scream' series, all have been great entertainers to watch. 'Scream 4' is amongst Craven's better works, but not amongst his finest. Reason? The Weak Culmination. Also, when the actual culprit is reveled, it's motive & actions, don't look as convincing as it ought to have been. But, in all fairness, 'Scream 4' does offer some chilling moments, especially in the first-hour, that truly hold your interest. Craven's Direction is perfect, as always, while the Writing Material is so-so. And yes, I would like to add, that, 'Scream 4' is NOT meant for the faint-hearted at all. It's not only the tense moments that leave you scared, but also the gruesome violence. The film is a bloodbath and each killing is disturbing. Performance-Wise: Neve Campbell plays Sidney Prescott once again, and she has done well. David Arquette & Courteney Cox also reprise their characters from the previous installments, and they also have performed well. Emma Roberts is fair. Hayden Panettiere is impressive. Rory Culkin is passable. Anthony Anderson & Adam Brody appear in brief roles. Alison Brie & others lend support.On the whole, 'Scream 4' works in parts, but it's definitely NOT meant for the faint-hearted.",Scream 4
34,StevePulaski,A reason to add one more part to the trilogy,8,17 April 2011,"In a way, I believe Wes Craven was obligated to make Scream 4 because of the bitter taste Scream 3 left in most fan's mouths. Scream 3 was the weakest of the former trilogy, but at least it's followed (and hopefully concluded) by a solid fourth installment. Scream's tagline should really be ""self aware for over a decade.""Scream has been an overall worthy series of films, but this installment as one thing working against it; it's too modern. For whatever reason it seems Scream was always meant to be in the nineties. It's intriguing how they waited so long to bring Scream back, but it's not as fun as it was in the nineties. With all the cell phones, computers, and high definition television sets it makes for opportunities so much more broad than the original three, but it still out moderns itself by being set so distant from the third movie.Not to say it isn't good. Lots of dialog against hatred of remakes in this film that each film deserves in it's own way. I find it funny that in one scene Sidney utters a phrase that goes something like ""Little word about remakes, don't f*** with the original."" Kind of a blatant statement from a director that decided to remake The Hills Have Eyes, The Last House on the Left, and A Nightmare on Elm Street don't you think?Now in Woodsboro, after three Stab movies they're now up to Stab 7 (I believe they are trying to spoof the number of Saw films made in recent years). The current Stab films are unrelated to the story of Sidney after she threatened to sue after Stab 3. Now it's fifteen years after the killings in Scream and two people are now new victims of Ghostface.We get new castmates like Hayden Panettiere, the lovely Emma Roberts, and, a childhood favorite of mine, Anthony Anderson sporting a thinner look than before. All the new characters are warmly welcomed and will likely be appreciated by new fans of the generation.People I know went crazy for Scream 4 without even having the slightest clue what happens in the original three. Luckily enough I knew to watch the original three before even going to the theaters to see this one. Why blindly walk into a sequel when you have no knowledge of the original(s)?Here's a typical Facebook status post from one of my friends;Him: ""finally scream 4 comes out."" Me: ""Did you even see the first three?"" Him: nope. Me: Why are you so giddy that the fourth one is out when you have no knowledge of what happened in the originals? No response.It's not like if you enter this film without seeing the first three you will be completely lost, but it helps to see the originals because some of the character dialog refers to the original film. Plus people who believe Scream is a strict horror franchise will most likely be letdown to realize a certain level of humor is mixed into it.Scream 4 does it's job of reuniting it's three leads that made the original films oh so famous. I hope Craven decides to leave the series where it stands. 5cream doesn't need to be made. Neither does Scre6m, Sc7eam Scre8m, Scre9m, or Scr10m.Starring: David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Emma Roberts, and Hayden Panettiere. Directed by: Wes Craven.",Scream 4
35,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Not what we were screaming for, but I got a good shriek",6,27 May 2011,"It's been 15 years since a classic new slasher film came out. Back in the day Wes Craven had brought us Freddy Krueger, he wasn't interested in the rest of the series except for when he brought the last in the series with New Nightmare intending for Freddy to be dead once and for all. However he couldn't stay away from the slasher series for too long because we were brought into a new nightmare with Scream, where Jaws made you afraid of the water, Scream made you get caller ID. Scream was a major hit and I remember seeing it for the first time at 11 and being scared out of my wits. Then the sequels came, not as scary, but the second one was entertaining, while the third one was just plain yuck. They intended to keep it as a trilogy, but the fans were ""screaming"" for a new movie, Wes and Kevin Williamson decided to give us what we wanted with a new Scream movie with familiar faces and some fresh new ones as well.On the fifteenth anniversary of the Woodsboro massacre, high school students Jenny and Marnie are attacked and brutally killed by a new Ghostface. The following day, Sidney Prescott returns to Woodsboro to promote her new book and becomes a suspect in the murders, with evidence in her rental car, forced by Dewey Riley to stay in Woodsboro until the crime is solved. While in town, she reconnects with her aunt Kate and cousin Jill. At night the attacks continue, taking the life of Jill's friend Olivia and Sidney's publicist. Ghostface is after Sydney and everyone she loves once again calling those who can either outwit him or try to outrun him, but as we've seen 4 times before it's not as easy as the I Know What You Did Last Summer days.I had a great laugh at the end because my friends and I made a ten dollar bet who would guess the killer or killers first and I won, they said that I should have been disqualified since I've seen too many horror films. Honestly, if you've seen the Scream films, it's not that hard to figure out, but you'll have to see for yourself. As for the movie, it's honestly alright, I was expecting a bit more. I don't know if the cast dried out a little bit or maybe because so many people copied off of Scream after it's release that we're now just too used to this plot. But I still think it was worth the watch, the beginning got a little annoying but over all the film picked up. But I gotta tell you, I am starting to feel really bad for Sydney Prescott, the poor girl could never keep a friend with the luck that she, Dewey and Gale have. Who would have thought that a killer could come after them 4 times now? But I do recommend definitely for the fans, it's worth the watch, however I think we should just quit while we're ahead.6/10",Scream 4
36,disdressed12,a bloody good time.,8,15 September 2016,"it's been a long time since I have seen the first three movies in the Scream franchise,so I can't compare this one to any of them. all I know is I thought the dialogue was well written,the acting was good and course there's the self referential aspect of the film.it was at least as bloody as its predecessors if I recall.not a bad thing,in this case.i also found it unpredictable.i wasn't sure who the killer was,even though I was sure I had it figured out.The scream series has always been a cut above most(but not all)horror films.there are a few exceptions of course.anyway I see there will be a fifth Scream movie in 2017.I,for one,am really looking forward to it.any way,for me,Scream 4 is a well deserved 8/10",Scream 4
37,OllieSuave-007,A third sequel for some more screams and scares.,7,1 November 2015,"This is the reunion of the original characters and a new generation of screams relating to the murder mystery surrounding Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who is now a local author detailing her past experiences of the Woodboro murders. She returns to her hometown only to find out that the mysterious man behind the phone is back and is stalking Sidney's cousin, Trudie.Like the previous three films, the actors went all out in pulling another dramatic and suspenseful horror movie with some eerie calm moments and jumpy sequences. It has its corny moments, especially the overly-executed teenage vernacular moments, the nerd-acting producers of the Cinema Club and the somewhat clueless acting Dewey (David Arquette). But, the film is watchable and will give you several good scares from its creepy and jumpy scenes.Even as the third sequel featuring yet again the Ghostface character, the plot still looks fresh and is well-paced from start to finish. Like his horror films, Director Wes Craven has kept the unknown and whodunit culprits a big mystery, leaving this film unpredictable and full of surprises and twists. Overall, it's not a bad film to conclude, as of now, the Scream franchise.Grade B-",Scream 4
38,Hellmant,This sequel definitely upped the ante; the violence is out of control!,9,15 April 2011,"'SCREAM 4': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Eleven years after the third installment of the popular 'SCREAM' series, and fifteen years after the franchise began, director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson reunite for a fourth chapter in the horror saga. They've performed directing and writing duties on every chapter except 'SCREAM 3' in which writer Ehren Kruger filled in for Williamson, which resulted in the weakest film of the series. They've both signed on for two more films as well, which they say will result in a second complete trilogy. Back again, for the fourth time as well, are stars Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette (the sole survivors of the first three films). They're joined by a fresh cast of some of today's hottest young stars (like they were fifteen years ago) including Emma Roberts, Hayden Panettiere, Rory Culkin, Erik Knudsen, Nico Tortorella, Marielle Jaffe and Alison Brie as well as Kristen Bell, Anna Paquin and others in cameo performances. The movie spoofs remakes, re-imaginings and nonstop sequels and centers around the return of Sidney Prescott (Campbell) to her hometown Woodsboro followed by the re-appearance of another Ghostface killer looking to copy the events of the first film. It's a fun fast paced thriller packed with hilarious jokes and gut wrenching horror (everything the franchise is known for).The film picks up ten years after the events of the last chapter in the series with Sidney now a successful writer. She's written a popular book about how she's coped with her traumatic experiences and has returned to Woodsboro to promote it. Her buddies Dewey (Arquette) and Gale (Cox) are now married (unlike real life) and Dewey is now the sheriff of Woodsboro, with a female deputy (Marley Shelton) who adores him. Gale is suffering from depression and missing the old days of being a star reporter and writer. There haven't been anymore 'Ghostface' killings in the last ten years but Hollywood has continued to make successful 'Stab' movies based on them. That all changes when Sidney returns to town and a new Ghostface killer strikes again, looking to imitate the events of the first 'Stab' film in a real life remake. Sidney must now also protect her young cousin Jill (Roberts) and her friends who it looks like the killer is now targeting.The new cast of young stars is refreshing and one of the highlights of the film (especially Panettiere who looks absolutely stunning in the film). It's too bad most of them get killed off, although their death scenes are spectacular. The gore is far more bloody and brutal than the others films as well and contains some of the best and most original death scenes yet in a horror film. The movie definitely followed the rules of a sequel / re-imagining it describes in the film by upping the ante (the violence in this film is out of control). The humor is even more sarcastic and witty than ever before as well and it definitely works. That's the most amazing thing about the film; how flawlessly it blends the comedy and horror genres, taking both to their extreme without depreciating the value of the other. Williamson's script is as clever and entertaining as ever and Craven is back to his horror master ways behind the camera. The original cast is a little tired and uninspired (especially Campbell) but they don't ruin the film. It's about as good as you could possibly hope for in a third sequel and I think the best one yet. It's not as good as the classic original but it doesn't try to be. If you're a fan of the series you definitely won't want to miss this one.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxjYiwLUko",Scream 4
39,bensonmum2,"""You hang up on me and I'll cut through your neck until I feel bone!""",7,24 September 2018,"I missed Scream 4 when it was originally released about 7 years ago. Over the weekend, I finally caught up with the latest on Ghostface, Deputy Dewey, Gail Weathers , and everyone's favorite victim, Sidney Prescott. So how was it? Much better than I could have imagined - and a huge improvement over Scream 3. If you just go with it, it can be a lot of fun. I'll start at the beginning - I've read a number of negative things regarding Scream 4's cold opening, but it worked for me. It takes the whole concept of ""meta"" and ramps it up a few notches. Stab 7 opening with scenes from Stab 6 (or is that the other way around) was about as clever as I could have hoped. An added bonus was watching Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell in small (but bloody) parts. After the opening, the main parts of the film flow nicely with heaping helpings of action, mystery, and thrills. Being a Scream film, there's also plenty of comedy and, fortunately, most worked. Sure, there are a number of annoying monologues from pretentious characters I just wanted to see die, but overall, the tone and feel is very similar to the first Scream. There aren't any death scenes in Scream 4 that I found particularly innovative (in fact a couple harken back to the original), but they are all appropriately violent and bloody. The new characters, especially those played by Emma Roberts and Hayden Panettiere, fit in nicely. I even got a kick out of Marley Shelton's Deputy Judy. The final reveal worked on me in that I was surprised. I'm not sure the reasonsing is very sound, but the ""Who done it?"" aspect was enjoyable enough.I do, however, have a couple of problems with Scream 4 - chief among them is that finale in the hospital. I know that I said if you just go with Scream 4, it's fun. However, the last bit in the hospital takes things way too far and gets a tad ridiculous. Still, overall it's a fun film is you don't take it too serious (like I seem to have done with the ending).An easy 7/10 from me.",Scream 4
40,FeastMode,"i loved it, for the most part",6,20 March 2021,"Things i loved: the comedy, the kills were the best of the entire series, the continued yet still fresh meta theme, the story, the new cast additions, especially emma roberts and allison briethings i hated: some really dumb moments, things that don't make sense, and idiotic character decisions. like how dumb can you be? it made me consider giving it a 6 but i had a great time with it so i kept it at a 7 (about 2 viewing, 3/19/2021)
SPOILERS
this movie faked me out a few times and i loved them all. the opening credits had two of them, and the second one made me clap from how much i loved it. and the other great fake-out was after olivia the neighbor was killed and it seemed like the scary part was over and you felt safe, but there was another attack in the same scene that shot the intensity back up to max.ummmmm, i loved the final killer reveal, a lot, to the point where i was straight up rooting for the killer to succeed. after she finished setting up the crime scene and laid next to sidney, mirroring her perfectly.... she's so awesome lmao. i legitimately would have ADORED this movie if this was the real ending (plus the camera flashes as she's taken to the ambulance). if they had the balls to let her win, man.dumb things i can remember: why couldn't sidney get the cops outside to help save olivia? after the cops finally do come in, the killer gets up and leaves without making a sound in literally 2 seconds while everyone is 5 feet away from him. he's not a damn ninja. gale sees someone block all her cameras but doesn't think that's enough evidence to assume the killer is there. the super smart mastermind killer makes a silly mistake by mentioning the matching scars, and someone with this plan wouldn't tell the investigator that she's thinking about writing a book about this already. super smart mastermind killer repeatedly asks lady cop to give her the gun even though she's gonna shoot her. sidney uses a super complex and risky method of turning on a noisy defibrillator, waiting for it to charge while hopefully the killer doesn't hear it and doesn't shoot everyone in the meantime. also, there was broken glass everywhere that sidney could have used. ugh. that's a lot. i gotta drop it to a 6. i'd definitely still watch it again",Scream 4
41,Robert_duder,Scream 4 revitalizes the series!! A worthy and terrific slasher flick!,9,24 April 2011,"This will be a review of pros and cons...like all of my reviews but this film bounced around for me because sometimes I felt like it was turning in a solid 7 out of ten and then it was eight and then maybe back to seven and then suddenly at the amazing climax (the best ending of any of the Scream films) it turned out an amazing thrilling entertaining flick that lives up to the franchise and the slasher genre in general. It isn't an easy feat for a franchise to come back after a decade with the original cast and create a new film for a new generation although many films try to do it and some succeed. Scream manages to keep so much of what made the original trilogy amazing in tact. However, the con comes from the fact that I felt like Scream 4 didn't quite capture the intelligent nature of at least the first two films. I mean horror films will inevitably have silly moments, and plot holes but the better the film and director the less of these you notice and Scream 4 had some pretty gaping plot holes and the new cast is kind of empty compared to previous instalments BUT the story wins out and the ending is truly the best out of the entire franchise hands down paying homage to the original while still making its own niche.The original three cast members return again, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David Arquette and they do sort of take a backseat to the new cast members but they are still back in full form. Neve Campbell's Sydney isn't quite as strong as she used to be as the scream queen but she is older and more mature and perhaps that is just the evolution of her character. Courtney Cox is back in full swing as Lois Lane-esque Gail Weathers. Her strong personality is a little more subtle this time around but she definitely still is great fun. David Arquette's goofy, lovable Dewey has also matured a great deal and is making a name for himself as the local Sheriff. Mostly the three of them are there to usher in the new cast and give us an update on their characters that we all know and love. In true Scream style the new cast is a veritable whose who of young hot upcoming stars. Some might suggest it isn't quite the calibre of previous films but they are still great supporting characters. Lucy Hale, Shenae Grimes, Kristen Bell, Aimee Teegarden and Brittany Robertson are early fodder for Ghostface and have recognizable faces from various CW/Teen shows of recent. Adam Brody, and Anthony Anderson are small time cops and more fodder. Hayden Panettiere, Emma Roberts, Erik Knudsen, and Rory Culkin are your main 'new cast' and all do a good job. Panettiere's Kirby seems to be one of the more popular with reviewers but I found her character kind of hard and unlikable at times. The scene stealer in this cast is Emma Roberts who gives a mind blowing performance that is certain to gain her MTV Movie Awards and Teen Choice Awards galore and in a world where movies were meant to entertain she would get noticed for this role by real critics too.You can't do much better for your horror film franchise than have Horror legend Wes Craven at the helm. Really Scream is his brainchild and always has been. He simply knows the right ingredients to make a good slasher flick, and he creates the best monsters in the slasher genre. No one does teen angst like Kevin Williamson and he always managed to capture that 'Dawson's Creek' feel even in the Scream series. I understand he wasn't pleased with the final draft of Scream 4 and I think its likely because the characters didn't have as much depth as he would normally like. Regardless of its cons Scream 4 brings this series full circle and proves you can get better with age. This is phenomenal instalment and I hope that someday we get another entry. The last 15-20 minutes of this film is slasher movie genius and the reason I love horror films!! 9/10",Scream 4
42,Pjtaylor-96-138044,An enjoyable epilogue.,7,3 March 2021,"Though 'Scream 4 (2011)' occasionally overreaches with its meta commentary on meta commentary, the flick eventually finds its footing as a suitably subversive and enjoyable extension to its franchise. It's actually somewhat ahead of its time in a few key ways, with its core satire still feeling relevant today (perhaps even more so than when the flick was first released). Wes Craven's as-good-as-ever direction provides plenty of solid scares and prevents the thing from ever feeling like a rehash, which it easily could have under the helm of someone less accomplished. By balancing its call-backs with its new ideas, the film manages to serve as an apt finale to its series (until the upcoming sequel, that is) that also stands on its own as a sort of epilogue. It's an entertaining time once it's underway, even if its lead characters don't quite have as much to do as they ought to. 7/10.",Scream 4
43,bowmanblue,Great to see a franchise return so strong,8,28 February 2015,"I will admit to loving Scream 4, although, apparently opinion was certainly divided upon its release. Some even went as far as to say that it 'flopped' due to it not making as much as Scream 3. But, it did make its money back and a respectful profit, which isn't bad for a franchise which existed in the nineties and who's original audience has probably grown up and doesn't attend the cinema as much as they used to.It's unlikely that many people will watch this without knowing about its predecessors, but, if you have no idea what the 'Scream' saga entails, it's about a killer (wearing a ghostly 'scream' mask) who runs around murdering people, until he/she/they are finally unmasked in the final act.Scream 4 is more of the same. Some people say that's its major flaw - that it doesn't offer anything new enough to warrant a whole new film. And they may be right. It is basically the same beast as the previous three, just with new 'expendable' characters who you won't know if they're the killers until they find themselves the wrong end of a blood-stained knife.However, Scream wasn't successful for a reason. It was actually very good. Therefore, all the following films stuck to its winning formula, so, although it is more of the same, is that necessarily a bad thing? My vote is: no, it's not. With all the rubbish horror/slasher films out there, it's nice to see one with decent characters and that's well written.All the principal/surviving characters return for number 4, which gives it a familiar feel, plus they're all decent actors, meaning you don't have to put up with a gaggle of teenage nobodies for an hour and a half.Basically, if you liked the previous three Scream movies and you don't mind that this is simply more of the same, then give it a go. I think it's an oasis of horror in a barren genre.",Scream 4
44,MLDinTN,"a ""funny"" slasher movie",5,22 April 2012,"Scream 4 clearly tries to have its funny moments, which is mainly why I liked it. I also liked how it started. You are watching the first scenes of several of the ""Stab"" movies in a row. I thought that was a neat idea to open it that way.Anyways, celebrity Sidney Prescott returns to her hometown and with her return, Ghostface appears and begins killing again. The same sheriff and reporter, now married, are back. The movie centers around Sid's cousin, Jill, and her friends. And I just love how the killer just magically disappears all the time. Only in the movies. Eventually the true killer reveals theirselves, and gets a good shock.FINAL VERDICT: These movies are good for a laugh and cheap scare.",Scream 4
45,Cineanalyst,"""How Meta Can You Get?""",7,5 August 2021,"Well, you could talk about how meta the making of the film-within-the-film is--that'd be pretty meta, I suppose, or rather ""Scream 4"" supposes. You could also have two of the prior three installments' survivors competing with each other as the writer of the movie, as well as competing with the killer, ""Ghostface,"" as the filmmaker, as well as with one of the new generation of teenage horror-genre buffs who's live streaming his life, as kids do these days, y'know, and the competition for the starring role in all of that. And, this is in addition to repeating the ""Scream 2"" (1997) trick of murders occurring during the screening of the film-series-within-the-film-series, the ""Stab"" movies (as really directed by Robert Rodriguez), which itself is a narcissistic variation on the first ""Scream"" (1996), where other slasher flicks were used, such as ""Halloween"" (1978). Not that this one doesn't name drop a bunch of other, real slasher titles, too, and it gets some good digs in at so-called ""torture porn"" horror cinema.Thankfully, screenwriter Kevin Williamson was back to pen this one after that abomination that is ""Scream 3"" (2000). I especially like what they do here with the expectations of introducing another generation--even calling it a ""remake"" of the first film. It's but one reason why this is so much better than something such as the 2018 ""Halloween."" Come to think of it, I don't recall hardly any reboot being successful in that way--by carrying over the stars of the predecessors to introduce a new generation. ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014) was after the fact, and the reboot proceeded to the dumpster right after it. ""The Terminator"" franchise has been repeatedly failing at it. We'll see how the Marvel Cinematic Universe handles introducing new variations on its retired superheroes. The problem may be the remake and sequel aspects of such a reboot pulling in opposing directions: one needs to be its own thing and the other also a continuation of what came before it. Wisely, that seems to be the exact dynamic that ""Scream 4"" engages. The meta isn't mere surface level.None of which is to say that ""Scream 4"" is quite as good as the first two entries, where ""the whole self-aware, postmodern, meta,"" er, thing was even deeper in some ways. The opening, for one, is amusing in an exhausting sort of way, but it's not quite as clever as the simplicity of those in the first two films. It may be rather forgettable, too, as I'm not entirely sure whether I'd seen ""Scream 4"" before. Some of it seemed familiar, but I don't know whether that's because I saw clips or trailers here or there or if I once saw the whole thing and forgot about much of it. I also doubt a ""Scream 5,"" and of course there is going to be one, as well as a ""6"" and likely more, could get away with joking about gay characters not dying in slashers without actually featuring any gay characters. Yet, for the most part, the cleverness of the reflexivity, the comedic timing and the thrills of making fun of slasher movies while itself being one are all back on the mark after fifteen years of the franchise.Also, although ""Stab 5"" is allegedly the worst of the series due to its time-travel plot, is anyone else curious what that would look like or if such nonsense were implemented in ""Scream 5?"" Or, is it just me?",Scream 4

49,Rodrigo_Amaro,Awesome!,10,4 May 2011,"When the telephone rings you gotta pick it and see who's on the other side. When the ""Scream"" franchise movies are on the screen you gotta watch it. There's some strange magnetism in this film series that makes you want more, and even the fact the last one wasn't so great and it was meant to be the last, many of the ""Scream"" fans would want more. Wes Craven took a time, made some other films and said that he would only direct another film from the Woodsboro crimes if the screenplay would be near the grandiosity of the first film, released in 1996. And they got it right this time!""Scream IV"" is scary, hysterically funny, has incredible and funny quotes and scenes, and still has the ability to surprise its viewers. I guess we're so fed up with bad remakes, bad reboots, awful sequels to great movies, so many garbage thrown at us, that Hollywood had to resurrect one of their biggest triumphs that was the ""Scream"" series, that had a full and great life in the 90's but got stuck in the 2000's. I was surprised by the quality (in terms of entertainment and fake blood gallons, I must say) of this film, wasn't expecting all that much, and I had a lot of fun while watching more of the same but made by the only master in doing creepy things, the great Mr. Craven.After ten years of absence, Sidney (Neve Campbell) returns to Woodsboro where she's going to release a book about all the horrible wave of crimes that happened in front of her in the other films. But her problems begins after another killer starts to imitate the famous psychotic that killed all her friends, and now new victims are going to be added to a horrific and dangerous game where Sidney, Gale (Courteney Cox), the sheriff (David Arquette) and several other characters will have to discover who's the killer before they enter to the list of victims. Once again, stabs and lots of blood, cult horror film references delivered by the characters, and hilarious lines are part of this exciting thriller. And don't get me wrong when I say the film is funny because it is, I'm not saying that is unintentionally humor or something similar (except one moment when the cops are killed, I couldn't stop laughing at that), it's just a humor to break the tension and it is perfectly made. ""Scream IV"" only committed one small flaw but it might be unnoticed by careless viewers and perhaps the writer wanted to create a suspense towards the ending that wasn't much convincible (the conclusion in the hospital where Gale asks Dewey about the shoulder wound, I won't say more about that but there's a way of how the villain knew about it). But it's nothing so dreadful, it's excusable.Lots of fun, great performances both from the original actors of the series and also the newcomers on ""Scream"" franchise like Rory Culkin, Hayden Panettiere, Emma Roberts and others, and many twists and turns (some very predictable as usual, others not so much). All of this can be found in this great entertaining film! 10/10",Scream 4

51,zkonedog,Absolutely Nothing Original,2,11 March 2017,"The strange thing about Scream 4 is that, viewed completely out of context, the movie isn't an abomination. However, this film brings absolutely nothing to the table in terms of originality.For a basic plot summary...oh, why even bother for this movie. If you've seen any of the first three Scream efforts, this one is no different. Hot chicks die, police are inept, dialogue is cripplingly bad, and Ghostface runs amok.Here's the trouble with Scream 4: The original Scream (in 1996) succeeded for two reasons. First, it resurrected the slasher genre that had died in the 1980s, and did so with a very respectable, legitimately spooky effort. Second, the original used the tongue-in-cheek style of humor to parody horror movies while making one. That combination produced a riveting cinema experience, which of course was ruined by two pathetic sequels that seemed to milk the franchise dry.So, director Wes Craven tries to resurrect the franchise by going back to the approach of the '96 original. The trouble, of course, is that a parody of a parody is, well, nothing at all. What worked at first doesn't translate into today, no matter how many supposed ""surprises"" or plot ""twists"" are thrown in.On a side note, the film even screws up the casting. If Hayden Panattiere is cast as a female lead, she better be ""featured"", if you know what I mean. I'm not even talking about nudity here, but rather just a little eye candy. Instead, there's none of it; just another area where the overall experience fails.What it comes down to, then, is that Scream 4 is not compelling in any area of its film making, whether it be plot, characters, or ""scare tactics"".

In the midst of all this, Sidney decides to launch a book and get back to the city. And it's on that day that the masked psychopath strikes again, this time bent on turning Sidney suffer, seeing the death of her loved ones. Directed by Wes Craven (one of the last films he directed before his death, in 2015), this movie remains in the lead roles the same actors of previous films.It was not until the new millennium for the last Scream reach us and, surprise, surprise!, it actually has characteristics of a true horror movie. Long ago that Sidney has conquered our hearts and our sympathy, as Dewey (now sheriff of Woodsboro) and his wife Gale. But now, we will meet a few Sidney's relatives which will support her when whole town watches her with suspicion and fear. Also very interesting is the ""almost"" love triangle between Dewey, Gale and the new deputy, Judy (who is played by actress Marley Shelton). Not that someday Dewey has had some interest in his blonde assistant, but the ways in which Gale talk to her clearly indicate jealousy. The film has truly tense scenes, and tension is the key driver of scares. After all, Craven hasn't lost his touch: after the parodies he left the best for last... perhaps the audience has also been the target of a very refined practical joke? The ending is brilliant and is reason enough to worth a homemade session with the last of Screams. Enjoy!... Oh, I almost forgot! What's your favorite horror movie?! Ah ah ah!",Scream 4
53,TheMovieDiorama,Scream 4 revitalises its slashing origins with one last frightened shriek.,6,5 June 2019,"A vicious storm is approaching. It can only mean one thing. Gale Weathers is back! Oh yes! Craven has returned, baby! All it took was a decade-long pause for him to deliver the best sequel in this franchise. Whilst not necessarily surpassing or equalling the fresh meta horror tropes that Craven had produced in the original, it's easily the most enjoyably bombastic instalment yet. Having now written a book on self-care, Sidney's last stop on her book tour is naturally going to be Woodsboro, where ""Ghostface"" reappears and is slaying the town's inhabitants once again.No matter how successful your new book is, my initial thoughts would be to not visit a town where continuous murders have taken place and directly involved me. But, Sidney has a point to prove. The real killer is, fingers crossed, deceased and Woodsboro has nothing to fear. Eh! Wrong. A wild copycat killer approaches. ""New decade, new rules"". Craven cleverly disguises, or in the film's case makes abundantly clear, this sequel is primarily a remake. The relentless meta references consistently targeting the do's and don't's of structuring a remake, with the major point being ""don't *beep* with the original"". With that, the narrative structure is identical to the original but twisted by the smart dialogue to alter its design. By the third act reveal, Craven embellishes the original's slashed architecture and optimises it for both fans and general audiences.Whilst this does bring some enjoyment to the blood-soaked table, with references such as a ""movie within a movie"" (to which I totally leapt up from my chair and shouted ""mind blown!""), there are some detriments to this. When the killer is inevitably revealed, although annoyingly I guessed incorrectly (again...), their motives were weak. I didn't buy it. Not to mention various death scenes being questionable for the sake of comedy. I mean, I've never been stabbed directly in the brain, but I'd imagine you couldn't get out of a car, walk a few steps and exclaim a quippy one liner regarding Bruce Willis. A shame that the introductory sequence wasn't as memorable as previous instalments, which were certainly highlights of this franchise.However, the best aspect that dominated every single scene, was the legendary Gale Weathers. Ten years later, and she has evolved into the sassiest slayer in all the lands. Do not, I repeat, do not mess with her. She'll shut you down with no hesitation. The other returning cast members, Campbell and Arquette, seemed somewhat tired. The latter unfortunately not pulling in a good performance at all compared to the early films. The fresher faced cast, consisting of Roberts and Panettiere, definitely elevated the buoyancy of the dialogue although the latter unquestionably looked older than a student (sorry!).A few hit and miss moments to its climactic showdown, but for the most part I enjoyed the heck out of this ""shriekquel""/""screamake"". If it toned down the colossal wave of self-referential quips, the foreshadowing would not have been as obvious. Tighten up some of the plot holes and stretch out various performances, this may have even surpassed the original. But considering where the third chapter left us, this was a definite improvement that slashed me up good.",Scream 4
54,insomniac_rod,A blast from the past!,7,23 May 2011,"Oh, I think I've lived the same situation! In 1996 Wes Craven made a horror movie that borrowed 80's slashers clichés and glued them together with a slight touch of 90's and it spawned many clones, sequels, and started a new era in horror.With ""Scream 4"" Craven takes the most popular elements of Horror in the new millennium and intends to reboot the franchise. First, the movie talks about remakes, ""torture porn"" (hate that term!), sequels, and more. ""Scream 4"" is an almost remake of ""Scream"" but with more black humor and gore. Sure, there are plenty of moments that remind us that Craven does no longer cares about suspense and mystery, but still this is a solid Horror effort. The ""whodunnit?"" aspect is not that interesting and doesn't work perfectly as a twist but still delivers expectations. The gore is great I must add. Ghostface is very angry. The acting was okay and I thank Craven for having such beautiful woman like Paquin, Bell, Campbell, Roberts, Pannettiere, etc. P.S. I liked the Kirby character because she was a horror freak. Where can I meet a chick like her?!",Scream 4

56,elshikh4,Surprisingly Surpassing !,7,23 October 2013,"I liked Scream 1. Forget about 2 and 3, 1 was the one. Now we have a remake of a sequel, which has a lot, and I mean A LOT of the same, but it managed to be very enjoyable too.(Wes Craven) knows that we know the formula. Originally, he made the previous 3 movies based on that basis. And so, he plays it again, yet with changing the victims and killer (s). Hence, it's frank cheese in its core. But - and that's the best part - (Craven) mocks at that all along, and makes zillion remarks concerning every detail in the process, which achieves being catchy for the slasher genre geeks, and intellectual for the ordinary viewers, not to mention a kind of new way to find a special personality among the deadly similar franchises, which - by the way - have a long honorary mention in this very movie.Watch (Craven) declares Scream 4's identity in its first sequence as another gory slasher, yet so sarcastically genre-referential (like a parody). It's impressive when you compare that funny sequence to its like in Scary Movie 3 (2003), which's a pure parody, to discover that (Craven)'s one is funnier. He even winks at us when casts (Anthony Anderson) as one of the cops, while (Anderson) is a familiar face in several Scary Movie sequels. So (Craven) applies the formula yet in a different way; which's mocking at it, to win the benefits of ""horror"" and ""parody"" together.Actually, the movie contains many enjoyable factors: The return of the original's stars. Top notch thrill; I mean (Craven) with (Kevin Williamson), the writer of Scream 1, mastered the game of ""Is that the killer?!"" perfectly, to be played unbrokenly, with mostly the wrong answers from your side. A pace like a flawless diamond, which's able of bewildering you for every minute (thank God that the geeky discussions didn't last forever!). The references to the other horror movies; with hints at the next events. Some wickedly comic moments. Beautifully tense direction. Great third act. And yes, the possible substance this round about the net generation, the on line life, winning fame by killing.. etc. It isn't that new, but it is in the Scream realm, being a good motif (something was / is missed in horror movies), and smart way to re-present the 1990s Scream franchise to the 2010s audience; putting in mind that the last Scream was produced in 2000, and what a huge technological advancement had happened between 2000 and 2011 in terms of media and communication.(Neve Campbell) was effective, and charismatic. (Courteney Cox) was less powerful and harmful to watch (God bless her face. She turned into the REAL Ghostface!). (Rory Culkin) left a prominent signature, I hope him better luck than his older brother!Some points didn't feel right. How a girl is killed in front of her 2 friends in one night, and those friends go to a party in the next?!! How Sydney's aunt knew about the disappearance of the 2 cops in front of the door, and not them being killed?! How (Anthony Anderson)'s character could walk and speak after his brain was shattered into 2 halves?! And while there is a loose slasher around, how oh how no one in Sydney's house has A GUN?! (very provocative indeed!). Dear (Craven), don't allege that by these points you were paying a homage to other bad points in other horror movies, you won't get away with it this way, because bad is bad anytime and anywhere!However, the only fatal mistake remains in casting (Emma Roberts) as the mastermind psycho killer. She has no presence, little talent, and too squeaky to shout voice!A note that forces itself: The men in here are whether too weak hence easy to get killed, or just too weak (like the most goofy policeman ever been in a horror: Dewey Riley!). And the victories good guys, along with the toughest evil guy, were all women (Campbell, Cox, and Roberts, respectively). It's official: This is a very feminine movie, maybe the most feminine movie (Craven) ever made!Although Scream 4 lost the dream, which's already mentioned in its dialogue, of being better than its original. But it is a cleverly written, directed, and acted Scream movie. Save part 1, and the first parody Scary Movie 1, it surprisingly surpasses the rest. So rare when we run into enjoyable rehashed material like this!",Scream 4
57,jadavix,This series needs Jamie Kennedy,6,18 July 2018,"The ""Scream"" movies basically exist to show a-list stars getting cut up in trashy horror movie fare. Roger Ebert said that horror is the one genre of film that does not require big stars to fill seats. People will go to see them anyway because they want blood and guts.Thus, most horror movies - even the ones that receive wide release - don't have recognizable stars.The ""Scream"" series is different, and indeed, all the fourth movie in the franchise really has to offer is its stars: Emma Roberts, Hayden Panettiere, Rory Culkin, and cameos from Anna Paquin, Adam Brody and Kristen Bell.These, of course, in addition to the three main stars who are in every movie.Unfortunately, other than these starring roles and walk-ons, the rest of the movie is pretty light on the ground. At almost two hours it's also fairly padded.I confess I was unable to guess correctly the identity of the killers. I couldn't say I was that surprised though - not because it wasn't a well kept secret, but because I wasn't really paying attention by the end. The movie's just too long and boring.It's also in dire need of some comic relief that Jamie Kennedy would have brought to it. What's the bet that the producers regret ever having killed off his character?",Scream 4
58,dee.reid,"""Scream 4"" - Don't mess with the original!",10,11 October 2011,"I think it's safe to say that 15 years after ""Scream"" (1996) single-handedly breathed new life into the slasher movie genre (thus igniting a new wave of slasher movie imitators) and to a greater extent the horror genre as a whole, the sarcasm, wit, and cynicism that characterized that popular 1996 horror hit has finally faded.The latest ""Scream"" entry, this year's ""Scream 4,"" is proof of that. Wes Craven has directed all four films so far, with screenwriter Kevin Williamson penning each and every script. While said wit, cynicism and sarcasm were a welcome change in ""Scream"" and its sequels, it did not pass onto its like-minded followers. It suddenly seemed hip and cool if characters seemed to KNOW they were in a horror movie and were being stalked & slaughtered by a masked killer, as ""Scream"" had popularized, but it didn't extend to other like-minded films that followed suit and tried to cash in on its popularity.""Scream 4"" is probably the last time this type of knowing self-awareness and hipness will ever work in a horror movie in the post-""Scream"" era. I've been following the ""Scream"" movies for years and the films that they subsequently inspired; the ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" films are evidence of that (though I will acknowledge a glowing fondness/weakness for ""Saw"") and they even get humorously deconstructed here by actresses Lucy Hale, Shenae Grimes, Anna Paquin, and Kristen Bell in hilarious pre-credit cameos.The plot to ""Scream 4"" is well, basically, a rehash of the first ""Scream"" movie, but here that's not necessarily a ""bad"" thing: somebody, as usual, has taken their love of scary movies one step too far, and as the 15th anniversary of the original Woodsboro Murders rapidly approaches, a new pair of ""Ghostface Killers"" are on the loose. These new anniversary murders also coincide with original survivor Sidney Prescott's (Neve Campbell) return to town on her book tour promoting her new book ""Out of Darkness."" Also along for the ride are series regulars Sheriff Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and his wife Gale Weathers-Riley (Courteney Cox), plus newcomers Sydney's teenage cousin Jill (Emma Roberts), her friend Kirby (Hayden Panettiere), Jill's ex Trevor (Nico Tortorella), Deputies Hoss and Perkins (Adam Brody and Anthony Anderson, respectively), and a pair of high school film geeks Robbie (Erik Knudsen) and Charlie (Rory Culkin).""Scream 4"" had this viewer on the edge of his seat from the word ""go."" The hilarious pre-credits sequences are a clear indication of where the movie is going, and that is reboot and sequel territory. The joke here is obvious: ""Scream 4"" is meant to be a parody of Hollywood's current fascination of remaking or rebooting classic horror and sci-fi movies, and how Hollywood almost always ends up getting it wrong (I may have just spoiled here, but I'm honestly not really sure). The lesson here, is also clear: ""Don't f**k with the original!"" There's also a scathing indictment of our culture's fascination with ""instant celebrities"" - you know, like the Kardashians, the ""Jersey Shore"" kids and Paris Hilton, for example - those who become rich & famous for doing absolutely nothing and if they do do something, it's usually something most of us would not want our names associated with.With that said, Craven hasn't lost his touch in keeping the scares and laughs coming at us from left and right, with the film's keen self-awareness and hipness. And neither element is done on the cheap; they're genuine and not on the rehash tip, even as this movie clearly demonstrates everything that's wrong with reboots and remakes nowadays.In that case, Hollywood, heed this movie's advice!10/10",Scream 4

It was great have old cast back and the new cast were really good as well, When i first saw this movie, I had no idea who the killer was, I was thinking it someone else!, It did shock me at first but in the end in kind a of made sense for that person to be the killer!

60,MaxBorg89,"Same franchise, new decade",8,18 April 2011,"Back in 1996, the first Scream was a breath of fresh air in the American horror film landscape: a smart, self-aware slasher movie that poked fun at the genre's various rules while still managing to be genuinely scary. In the fifteen years that have passed since the film made its debut, US horror has taken a turn for the worse, with an endless stream of remakes, torture porn and whatnot. Scream itself suffered from the law of diminished returns, with the third installment in particular being perceived by most as a tired repetition of the same old formula. It is therefore safe to say that it took a lot of guts (pun intended) to decide that Ghostface and his victims were ripe for a reinvention, with original director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson still on board. Well, that gutsy decision paid off, because Scream 4 is easily a match for the original in terms of quality.This time around, the people of Woodsboro seem to be enjoying some well-deserved peace and quiet, since the only murders taking place now are in the latest episodes of the Stab franchise. That is, until a couple of teens are savagely butchered and some of their friends start receiving creepy phone calls (Scream veteran Roger Jackson is, as always, supplying the voice). One of these young potential victims is Jill Roberts (Emma Roberts), the cousin of Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) - who, coincidentally, is returning to her home town to promote a new book. Naturally, it doesn't take long before she and her old friends, Sheriff Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and former reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), end up on the killer's radar, and with the new trends in horror cinema, there are some new rules to pay attention to...The big risk with Scream 4 was that it could all too easily turn into a bad joke, given the genre's lackluster form of late (a phenomenon Craven is well aware of, having even produced two remakes of his own films, although it must be said those were slightly better than most of their peers) and the fact that the first movie was itself made fun of in the inaugural Scary Movie (funnily enough, one of the new characters is played by funny-man Anthony Anderson, who had a prominent role in Scary Movie 3). The solution? Acknowledge the ridiculous nature of it all. The first ten minutes alone are a masterpiece of meta-cinema and self-mockery, with the very concept of movies-within-movies (alongside pointless sequels and torture porn) being the target of one of Williamson's jokes.In fact, the events of Scream 4 are deliberately structured so as to mirror those of the original franchise-starter, which allows for some neat reflections on the concept of remakes and reboots. And yet, despite all the laughs and reinventions, this is still very much a Scream movie, and not just because Campbell, Cox and Arquette are back. Ghostface remains an iconic villain, and the scary scenes really go for the jugular. Sure, the last 20 minutes get a little close to self-parody, and, with the exception of Roberts (and Rory Culkin), the younger cast isn't that impressive. Then again, since they are typical horror movie victims, maybe that's part of the joke.According to this film, the first rule of remakes is ""Don't f*ck with the original"". On those terms, Scream 4 is quite a success, as it sticks to what made the first episode work while providing a 21st century twist. Maybe it isn't enough to launch a new trilogy, but on its own terms it's an efficient mixture of gore and fun.",Scream 4
61,mattkratz,not bad,8,20 November 2013,"This wasn't too bad an entry in the Scream series, as it follows the formula of a killer who uses the ""movie rules"" to ""off"" his victims.

It then features Courtney Cox and Neve Campbell once again being terrorized by ""Ghostface."" Emma Roberts and a bunch of her teenaged friends are in for the ride this time, as they try to avoid being the next victims, and there is a memorable sequence at a movie festival.

Emma Roberts played a fantastic role as the new girl, and of course Neve Campbell was great as she reprised her role, as she did in all the films. This film throwback to the original, and made so many connections, I loved it, very cool. Mary McDonnel was also very good here, even though it wasn't a big role. Courtney Cox still the same Gail, which is a good thing, I've always like her character. Nico was the PERFECT choice for the role of Trevor, Emma Roberts's ex boyfriend. He's good looking, and turned out to be innocent in the end. Rory Culkin portrayed her character wonderfully. The newcomers tried to remake the original 1996 Scream, and it's happenings, and they did it wonderfully!! The die hard scream fans will or should adore this latest and final installment! I loved seeing this movie try to reinvent the original movie! I loved it so much, that I think it surpassed the other scream films as far as quality and entertainment goes!

64,aidanratesmovies,Better than the last two at least...,5,5 December 2020,"An entertaining but again messy little horror flick, Scream 4 surprisingly improves on the last two entries in the franchise, but its increase in suspense and quality is still no match for a poorly written script and overwrought acting. I was surprised by this entry because I honestly enjoyed it a lot more than I have any other entry in this franchise. I didn't expect much, and even though there wasn't too much to see in the whole scheme of things, I feel Craven deserves some credit for still trying to breathe life into his franchise. That being said, this film has many problems. It can be entertaining, although at times predictable, and it even has some good scares here and there, as well as some intense moments towards the end. Unfortunately though, these pros are weighed down by the films overly ambitious nature, cliche moments, thin characters, and simply bland acting. I feel like either everyone in the film is trying too hard or not trying at all, there is no middle ground with these actors, nor the script writers, and its this ridiculous all or nothing vibe that prohibits the film from reaching the potential it could have had. There is some horrible dialogue, cheesey lines, situations, etc. It can be a bit unoriginal at times, relying on tropes of the original, but in the end, it makes it just enjoyable enough to be at least watchable. All in all, I didn't love the film, or even really liked it, but it was okay. Not the worst I have seen, and better than the second and third flick.

67,jadepietro,Bloody Disappointing Sequel,4,19 April 2011,"I always like a good scary movie, not so much for the gore or ""slice and dice"" aspects, but more for the element of suspense and that frightening ""boo"" factor. The Scream trilogy was a successful series with its tweaking of a familiar plot of teenagers sent to the slaughter under the knife of a madman, Back in the 90's, the series started off strong with its witty ironic homages to the horror genre, its wicked sense of humor, and scary well-edited moments. Over the years, as most series do, the films got progressively weaker by the third installment.Now, ten years have passed and the memory of this profitable and satisfying franchise lives on in film history. So the need to resurrect this dated exercise in terror seems destined for a newer and trendier generation of moviegoers that may be unfamiliar with its set-up, but still crave the fear factor in heavy dosage. Yes, most of the same characters that have survived the bloody massacre and the same production team that brought audiences the original Ghostface have joined forces again to deliver similar chills and thrills in Scream 4. Dear Sidney Prescott ( Neve Campbell ), now a successful writer, is back too as she visits her hometown ( Why return and why stay? ) on a book tour and, along with Sheriff Dewey ( David Arquette )and Gale ( Courtney Cox ), tries to track down the latest serial killer and save the younger sacrificial lambs in that small town known as Woodsboro. ( The film boasts a low wattage cast of today's celebrity stars like Kristen Bell, Allison Brie, Hayden Paniettiere, Emma Roberts, Nico Tortorella, Erik Knuden, Marielle Jaffe, Adam Brody, and Rory Culkin, some who are dispatched in minutes, some of which linger to the bloody end. )Kevin Williamson's screenplay reverts back to his original source and this film follows that same formula. The comedy elements are still at work as the updated horror clichés are explained and re-examined. The film's structure starts off with a deadly phone call that leads to a killing which leads to more murders along the way. Director Wes Craven still knows the proper rhythms and techniques to build suspense in mostly every terrifying sequence. He uses the silences so well to lull the moviegoer into a calmer state only to then heighten the tension with high caliber sound effects or reverberating music chords with maximum results. ( Particularly impressive are the deserted parking garage scene and the after Stab-a-thon party gathering episode.)But this latest brew has a bitter aftertaste and relies too much on the blood n' guts effect rather than the tongue-in-cheek witticisms that made the original such a guilty pleasure. The film may deal with cutting edge technology ( the Internet, texting, twittering, and cellular phone service ) as it panders to new advances in the cutting edge goriest of killings. ( This has to be the bloodiest and most violent of all of the previous films in this series, with an ever-rising body count to sate the modern day appetite of the desensitized torture porn crowd. ) However, once the killer ( or killers ) is finally revealed, and the motives for the murders are properly analyzed, in retrospect, the film makes no logical sense at all.Scream 4 gorges excessively on the gore instead of savoring the true suspense it manufactures so well. Yet the film does register enough of the ""boo"" factor to satisfy most of its teenage target audience. I guess it was not quite the ""boo"" factor I had in mind when I decided to see the disappointing reboot called Scream 4, but ""boo"" did cross my mind and my lips as well.

68,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Scream 4 (2011),5,13 December 2011,"I love the first two scream movies. They pretty much played on repeat throughout my teenage years. It was a simpler time back then. Without as much internet usage, I managed to keep everything a surprise back then, even until they came out on VHS. That's why I'm so surprised that I managed to keep all the twists and turns in this one a surprise as well. Unfortunately, I just didn't care that much. Sure, we get the fearsome threesome back, but where's the spark? The film has to spend too long building up new knife fodder. And too much knife fodder at that. The originals kills were actually few and far between. It just seems like there were more because each one had an impact. I've already forgotten most of these kills, probably because I saw them coming a mile away. This is a more fitting end than Scream 3 ever was, but it tries too hard to be a Scream film. Perhaps it will resonate more with a younger audience, like the originals did with me. I just found there to be too many shots of iPhones and Apple related products, too much filming of what was going on, and an endless parade of TV stars that had me going ""It's Teddy from Hangtime, it's President Roslin."" etc. Not as scary, nor as funny as 1 or 2.",Scream 4
69,rgkarim,"A Slasher that is going back to the style of the 1st, yet it's still predictable",7,15 April 2011,"It's been a while since I have seen a slasher, and Scream for that matter, yet here it is years later and finally we are getting back to the roots of the classic slasher. The movie starts out with a couple of funny scenes that lash out at the recent slashers that have been produced and how predictable and cheesy slasher films are, but then dives into the cliché of slashers starting with two helpless victims. After that, we start to get back into the classic killing spree that was seen in the first movie with the addition of a lot more gore. Yes, I'm sure we all know that slasher movies are becoming more famous for the increased amounts of blood that are constantly finding their way into the movies these days, as well as the increasing use of the F word.So what is good about this movie? In my opinion the best part of this movie is the constant slams on horror movies and how lame they can be. The movie does a good job at mocking the genre and pointing out the goods and bads the genre has to offer, which is very satisfying to hear that even directors in this day and age can insult the genre. The second thing I liked about it, was the cast did a good job reviving the series. Yes you had the airheads and geek victims that are famous in the genre, but the main cast does a good job of playing the concerned victims who fear for their lives. The classic characters of Arquette, Cox, and Campbell are still strong and play their roles well as the returning survivors. The new cast also does a good job diving into the series, playing the roles of popular cheerleaders, AV geeks, and bad girls who want to have fun. Although a little overacted, the new generation has potential for making horror genres return to a classic style instead of turning into the crap we have seen it evolve into. A third positive would be the twist that this movie had to it. As I watched the movie, I tried to figure out the identity of the killer, or killers of the movie. I started to narrow down the victims and figured out the identity of one of them rather easily. However the other killer was quite a surprise, and was a nice twist to the movie instead of just a cheap identity that we had seen in the last two screams. Okay so what about the bad stuff of this movie. Well the first thing I have to say is, the excessive amounts of blood seen in this movie. It seems that as technology improves, more directors think we need to see lots of blood and intestines. That's not my cup of tea to tell the truth and so I could have done without the excessive spill of red liquid. The second weakness in my opinion is the use of the F word. Again I think that this word is the only vocabulary word the movie world knows and I am getting quite annoyed with hearing it used as much as it is. However, if you are not offended or annoyed by the word you won't be too turned off by this movie. A third thing that I felt was weak, was the predictability of this movie. Yes it's easy to tell who is going to die and who isn't, that's what this movie makes fun of, but I found it really easy to predict when things were going to try and scare you. The camera angles, the music, and so much more gave it away and I was not surprised or scared by any of the tricks they tried to pull, though one lady screamed at just about every thing in the movie. Finally the fourth big weakness is the explanation for why the main killer is on the loose. It was lame and kind of cheaply written, and could have been much better had they taken more time to write it. Her accomplice had a better motive for killing a few of the victims, but still it wasn't the best. Although it is predictable, Scream 4 is starting to return back to the classic work of slashers. It's aggressive humor, colorful cast, and new spin on the mind of the killer made it much better than I had originally intended. However, I still don't like the predictability, the phony bologna acting on some parts, and the weak motif for killing, which suggests that more work is needed before we can return to the old favorites. If Wes Craven decides to do another remake, then I suggest he work on adding new twists and stop making them so predictable. I recommend this movie for die hard fans of either Scream or Horror films, as well as for those who just can't get enough blood in their day. This may also be a movie for fans who like to make fun of horror movies or are looking for a way to kill time in the day. Regardless I give this movie a 7 at the highest. Enjoy.",Scream 4
70,raulfaust,Unstopp4ble,7,1 September 2011,"I was about to rate this film very low and write a bashing review until the last 20 or 30 minutes. ""Scream 4"" spends almost of its length in criticizing horror movies and their sequels, stating they all just repeat the same story over and over, when in fact, they are doing the exact same thing. Ghostface killing everyone around and getting away with murder with thousand of incompetent cops dying like blind people in a shooting. Does that sound familiar to you? Not to mention they hired a ""Scary movie"" clown actor to portray one of these loutish policemen. If they really wanted to protect the girls in the house, they should have stand in the door of their room and in the window, not randomly around the house.But, when everything was going from bad to worse, the writer fortunately utilized all the publicity the film had to make a criticism to our actual modern society. He criticized the internet fame, the addiction we have for technology and gossips, and showed how someone really into these things can (sickly) behave. Brazilian's society isn't THAT into these things as American's, but we are slowly moving to that. In fact, I hope this crazy thing about cellphones ringing every time and people recording everyone's life has an end soon..",Scream 4
71,Sandcooler,"Starts of lame, but it grows on you",6,3 April 2013,"Given that ""Scream"" was a pivotal part of my (apparently traumatic) childhood, I had mixed feelings about them making a fourth one. I mean, the original is still one of my favorite ""scary movies"" of all time, but the first two sequels totally gave up on subtly playing around with horror movie conventions and just threw some random film references at us. And for a while, this one really seemed no different. What good can really come from something that opens with a movie within a movie within a movie? And one of the cops is named Anthony Perkins, har har. Oh, and writer Kevin Williamson also knows this movie, and that movie, and that movie, wow he's so clever and self-aware. The first half is really sort of a drag because of this, and also because the death scenes just aren't that interesting: the parking garage scene in particular is sort of an anticlimax. But then, just as I was ready to talk crap about this movie, it totally redeems itself with a truly awesome finale that is on par with the original. The obligatory jaw-dropping twist is so well thought-out in this one, it just makes everything about the movie better in retrospect. Obviously it still requires supposedly smart characters to be complete morons, but that's the whole point now isn't it? And from then on it's just anything goes, and that's what Williamson's so great at. ""Scream 4"" is not as good as the first one because it has some boring stuff in it, but it's easily the best of the sequels.",Scream 4
72,Matt_Layden,Don't F**K with the original.,7,15 April 2011,"Sidney has written a book about how she overcame her horrible past and returns to Woodsboro, ten years after her last attack. Gale and Dewey are married, she's trying to write fiction and he's now the Sheriff. Death arrives the same time Sidney does, people start dying and bodies start piling up. Now Sidney has to look after her cousin Jill, as well as her friends. The original scream, without a doubt, redefined the genre. So many imitators popped up after that movie came out and the subsequent sequels became exactly what the original was parodying. With each sequel in a horror franchise, the quality seems to be watered down, since we are treated to the same stuff over and over again. This happened to the Scream trilogy. I dug the second one, but the third was a horrible mess. The third works on paper, but not in execution. So here comes the fourth Scream film, trying to recoup what it had lost, but can a 4th film in a series really be fresh and exciting?I must say that Scre4m did surprise me, I liked it more than I thought I would. In fact, I think it's probably the best since the original. The film feels like the first two, mashed into one. Smart move not to try and copy the third. There are scenes that imitate the original and the sequel, it has a nostalgic feel to it. What Scre4m manages to do is bridge the decades together rather well. It feels like a 90's slasher, but updating for this generation. Mission accomplished to Craven and Williamson. It's great to see Campbell, Cox and Arquette reprise the roles that made them famous (ignoring the fact that Cox was in friends). Sidney has become a stronger woman, Dewey is more confident as the Sheriff and Gale, is still a cold hearted bitch. It's these three characters that we care about, we gives a crap about the new young cast. They're just there to get sliced and diced. I must say that Dewey does seem to have less screen time here, he's always coming in at the last second. He was never in any real danger, it felt off to me. This is probably the goriest out of all of them. It has to be, if it wants to compete with the films today. Simple stabbing deaths aren't going to cut it. The film acknowledges this, as well as all the crap that happens in remakes and sequels. I had an inkling as to who the killer(s) was before the reveal, I was never 100% confident though. We are still treated to the same thing that has happened in the previous films. Killer(s) reveal, then a spiel of their motive and of course the climax. Scre4m hits all the same notes the previous films did and it doesn't feel stale. I think fans of the series will really like this one. Characters do really stupid things, like opening doors and leaving their car when the killer is right outside, instead of staying locked in and calling the cops. Yet this is a series that thrives on that. We the audience, know they will be stupid, Wes Craven knows this, even the characters themselves know this. The film has humour and doesn't take itself too seriously. It manages to stay true to the original films and make a fresh new start.",Scream 4
73,vengeance20,Amazingly Gruesome!,10,28 December 2012,I have to say I did here about the Scream films but never let on to them! Such as seeing the Scream mask etc. It was only until I saw the poster for this film in 2011 while seeing another film at the pictures that I'd known what kind of a film it was. Then while seeing a trailer for this film thus finding out about the other 3 which got me interested as at this time I was starting to watch horrors! I thought I'd go see it!It was bloody great! The scares were on top form! The deaths were intense! Olivia's Death being the most intense out of the film! Which made me jump out of my seat in the pictures (Especially when this was my first time watch Horrors on the big screen!) & it was like WHOA!! The gore was great! Especially the effects which were amazing & the twist at the end when the killers Jill & Charlie reveal themselves they relate themselves to Stu & Billy saying that they are the next generation of them killers as well as Charlie claiming he is the new Randy & says he finally gets the girl. Then the twist when Jill kills him & says that him & Trevor are the killers & nearly gets away with the fame being on her until she discovers Sidney is still alive & with the 1 slip up she made about the matching wounds then Dewey knowing instantly that she was the killer! Ace!Overall a great film you'll not want to miss lets hope Scream 5 is great! 10/10,Scream 4
74,brando647,"Good Concept, Weak Execution",6,14 November 2011,"All right, I see what writer Kevin Williamson was trying to do with SCREAM 4 (the latest in a recent trend of unnecessary sequels) but it just didn't work out. It tries to recapture what made the first film awesome by calling out modern horror films and their recent obsession with remakes and reboots, but falls short of being anywhere near as fun as the original. It's nice to see the original trio of protagonists (Sidney Prescott, Gale Weathers, and the now-sheriff Dewey Riley) return, but most of the new cast leave no lasting impressions and only exist to become knife fodder. The film is rated-R (a reassuring touch in a time where most horror films are watered down to a PG-13 to ensure teenager ticket profits), but fails to use it to its full extent. The film begins a decade after the last Ghostface Killer terrorized Sidney and her friends as she returns to Woodsboro on a book tour to promote her memoirs about overcoming her persistent role as a victim in life. Within minutes of arriving in town, Sidney becomes involved in yet another series of murders as teenagers in Woodsboro are sliced and diced by a new Ghostface Killer with intentions of reenacting the original pattern of the Woodsboro murders.As I understand it, Williamson's script was subjected to rewrites and a lot of his intentions were lost before it ever went into production. The original SCREAM was a self-aware parody of the established rules in slasher films, SCREAM 2 tackled sequels, and SCREAM 3 focused on horror trilogies (I guessalthough it was pretty loose and I felt the series had hit a wall by that point). SCREAM 4 is all about the latest pattern of remakes flooding theaters, but the revelation comes late into the movie at the climax. I love the concept but the execution falls flat. Apparently there were a handful of scenes deleted from the film that would've supported the whole ""remake"" theme from the start, and I really wish they'd left them in. The Ghostface reveal at the end (which I won't reveal for those who haven't seen it) didn't wow me, and I had a hard time buying the character as a villain. Not because the motivations were weak; I actually liked the villain's motivation and sort of wish they'd succeeded. I think it would've made an interesting end for the franchise or at least shake things up a bit in the event of further sequels. No, it was the acting behind the villain that made it laughable. I didn't care about any of the remaining characters. With the exception of Hayden Panettiere, all of the characters felt flat. They were a bunch of one-note personalities: the creepy boyfriend, the money-hungry publicist, the tech geek, the horror nerd, the hot chick, the goofball cops, theotherhot chick. OK, so they ran out of ideas.Question: if you're going to go the extra mile to make your horror film R-rated, why not use it effectively? The first film had some real cringe-worthy kills: Drew Barrymore gutted and strung up in a tree, her boyfriend eviscerated, Rose McGowan's slow rise to a snapped neck while trapped in a dog door. In SCREAM 4, we get a stabbing, another stabbing, oh and I think I remember a stabbing at some point. Remember that one person getting stabbed? They didn't even try to get creative with the kills here. Just a bunch of quick stabs to the gut or back, or in one case the head (all right, that one wasn't bad). You've got to make the audience dread seeing what Ghostface is going to do next, but when all we have to look forward to are some jabs, well, who cares? There's nothing here to make the audience groan in agony as a victim is taken down, just a lot of the same. Ghostface pops out of nowhere, stabs someone I've already established I don't care about, and moves on. We're just following a formula at this point.The movie is entertaining enough as a slasher film but I believe that a SCREAM film, especially one ten years past it's prime, should try and break some new ground. This movie doesn't. I'm glad the original cast members were able to return for the latest film, but I suppose they haven't being doing much lately anyway. And I really enjoyed the meta-opening with multiple fake-outs. It gave the writer a chance to say his piece establishing his distaste for modern horror's obsession with torture porn and rehashes. It sets the bar high early on, establishing SCREAM 4 as the parody I was hoping for, but never tries to live up to it. The movie's no worse than the third film but doesn't exactly recreate the awesomeness of the original. I hope this film's poor performance means we're reached the end of the franchise and the Scream series is laid to rest before it falls any further.",Scream 4
75,moviewizguy,New decade. New rules.,7,18 April 2011,"Sidney Prescott, now the author of a self-help book, returns home to Woodsboro on the last stop of her book tour. There she reconnects with Sheriff Dewey and Gale, who are now married, as well as her cousin Jill and her Aunt Kate. Unfortunately, Sidney's appearance also brings about the return of Ghostface, putting Sidney, Gale, and Dewey, along with Jill, her friends, and the whole town of Woodsboro in danger. (Dimension Films)I'm a Scream fan to a certain degree, the first being my favorite while the sequels never really impressed me as much. Still, I enjoyed the trilogy since I'm a huge fan of slashers (probably my favorite sub-genre of the horror category). It's been 11 years since the last Scream film which means there are new things for screenwriter Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven to jab on, namely the rise of the torture porn genre, remakes, and reboots (among countless of other things) and new innovations to add to the mix, including the use of cellphones, Facebook, Twitter, and webcams. SCREAM 4 is, without a doubt, a film for the fans of the original trilogy AND the new generation.The first half of SCREAM 4 plays out like the previous films, in which we get some death scenes filled with some talking scenes. This may be good or bad news, depending if you preferred to keep the old style or have a new one. I found it pretty enjoyable myself, although it was the same ol' stuff we've seen before. On a related note, the opening scene was very clever and hilarious. It may not beat the opening for SCREAM, which is pretty much almost perfect, but it may be the second best opening in the series. There's a turn in the second half. To say I enjoyed this half a lot more is an understatement. This is where is gets interesting, but to say anything about it would be spoilerish. However, I will say that a lot of things happen. In addition, the third act is fan-freakin'-tastic. It's EASILY the best finale of the entire series. My jaw dropped lower each second until the terrific climax where I had a huge smile on my face. The film also managed to keep me guessing at who the killer(s) was. Honestly, I did not see it coming.It's true that since SCREAM 3, there have been more buckets of gore in horror films, mostly due to the torture porn genre. After the first kill in the film, we can see SCREAM 4 following the trend, which is ironic yet understandable at the same time. Now, a stab wound would produce more blood flowing out of a victim's body and the victims don't die as quickly, making the death scenes stretch out a lot longer than before. And yes, the death scenes are quite brutal. There are also some jolting moments in here, although nothing really scary ever happens. Actually, there's more intensity and humor than scariness going on. I mean, the Scream series are satirical films after all.The three main actors from the previous films, Neve Campbell, David Arquette, and Courteney Cox, reappear in this sequel (or reboot), and it's pretty great to see them reunite. They've gotten old, sure, but we remember why we love them in the first place. Also joining them are a new set of faces, namely Emma Roberts and Hayden Panettiere. Roberts is pretty great while Panettiere's character has to be my favorite. Another castmember I really liked was Marley Shelton, who's pretty great from her screen time. The others are pretty forgettable, although they get the job done.Although it's easy to suspect that SCREAM 4 is just another cheap cash-in, seeing the level of quality in the film proves otherwise. What Williamson and Craven did here was impressive and extremely ingenious. Some rare moments in the film were even mindblowing! The cast is great and the film is hugely entertaining. Needless to say, I found SCREAM 4 to be the best film in the series. It just goes to show you that a fourth film in a series may not so bad after all.",Scream 4
76,moviexclusive,"As devilishly funny and viciously thrilling as the very first ""Scream"", this fourth chapter proves that horror reboots can be as good as the original",8,15 April 2011,"Eleven years is a long time to wait for a sequel, but in the case of the ""Scream"" quadrology, the wait has proved to be more than worth it. The years since the slightly underwhelming ""Scream 3"" have given the original creators- director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson- fresh fodder for another distinctive entry in the franchise, and it shows amply right from the film's diabolically funny beginning.Besides being an intriguing whodunit, part of the fun of the ""Scream"" series was its self-referential cleverness, and ""Scream 4"" is no different. It begins with two teenage girls (Lucy Hale and Shenae Grimes) choosing which horror movie to watch for the night- among them ""Saw 4"", which one of the girls mocks for having 'no character development'- before receiving a phone call asking them about their favourite scary movie and promising to slice them up before the end of the night.But surprise, surprise- before this sequence ends, we learn that these girls are no more than mere fictive characters in ""Stab 6"", the slasher series in the ""Scream"" universe based on the Woodsboro killings; and watched by another pair of girls (Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell) in ""Stab 7"" who discuss if the ""Stab"" series should be updated by way of Facebook or Twitter. And who's watching ""Stab 7""? Well, a third pair (Aimee Teegarden and Brittany Robertson), this time from the supposedly real world of Woodsboro, whose deaths mark the return of Ghostface.Delivered with the right amount of shocks and giggles, these multiple false openings are just the start of a movie which shows both Williamson and Craven at the top of their game. Both are acutely aware of how quickly things have changed within the last decade, especially how social media and technology would have since changed the rules of the stalking game that they had once so cleverly turned on its head in the original ""Scream"" (remember that Drew Barrymore opening?).And so amidst countless other slasher sequels that have come along since the last ""Scream"", Williamson and Craven ensure that each one of the killings here remain as sharp, fresh and thrilling as ever in this era of iPhones, caller IDs, weblogs and live streaming. Indeed, two of the most suspenseful moments in the film are thanks to the latter- first, when our favourite goofily charming sheriff Dewey watches a live feed of Ghostface appearing right behind his wife Gale; and second, when one of a pair of high school nerds (Rory Culkin and Erik Knudsen) gets his strapped-on camera turned 180-degrees to film what's behind him.These last two characters are part of a new group of young nubile teens which Williamson introduces as fresh blood to spill, including Sidney's cousin Jill (Emma Roberts) and her two BFFs, Olivia (Marielle Jaffe) and Kirby (Hayden Panettiere)- of course, no ""Scream"" is complete with the original survivors, Dewey, Gale and Sidney Prescott who returns to Woodsboro to promote her new self-help book a decade after the last Ghostface murders. Each one of the new characters is a suspect until they get killed, and let us reassure you that the final reveal at the end of Williamson's teasing packs a wallop by not only taking the ""Scream"" series in a whole new direction (moving away from the connections to Sidney's mother which formed the backbone of the first three movies), but also by doing so in an intelligently vicious manner.Nevertheless, the challenge of balancing screen time between the new and the old characters means that there are less opportunities for the previous generation of ""Scream"" fans to catch up with Dewey, Gale and even Sidney, whose roles are much less defined than in the earlier films. Still, what the film lacks in character, Craven makes up for it with a much tighter and brisker pace filled with plenty of tense and frightening moments- his d.p. since ""Scream 2"" Peter Deming once again using well-crafted shots to generate suspense. Though his latest films have been lacklustre, ""Scream 4"" shows a rejuvenated Craven that recalls the best of the horror master's career.Craven's reboot of the ""Scream"" trilogy would not be possible without Williamson, whose meta humour cuts just as keenly as Craven's deftly-executed kills. One can imagine Williamson speaking through the two high school horror film geeks in the film as they go on about the rules of remakes and reboots, and Williamson's self-awareness of the genre's makings ultimately makes this smarter and more incisive than the average slasher flick.The first rule of remakes? ""Never f**k with the original,"" says one of the characters in the film. Nicely said, superbly done.www.moviexclusive.com",Scream 4

78,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Scream 4""- Now THIS is more like it! Sure, it can be problematic. But it's also definitely a ""Scream"" film through-and-through thanks to the return of the series creators!",8,23 May 2016,"There is something of a tragedy when it comes to ""Scream 4.""No, not for the film itself. Nor of the cast.More of the fact that after having been brought back to the big- screen after a decade, this most recent (and presumably final) installment in the beloved franchise was not met with the same wicked praise from critics, nor the adoration of the masses as the previous films had (mostly) attained.No, it came out and was met with a general sense of apathy. A palpable sense of ""Oh, look! Another 'Scream' movie. Maybe I'll watch it on cable or Netflix or something."" Largely ignored or even occasionally derided by the same audiences that had once ate up the previous films. Looked at as nothing more than just another quasi-reboot in an era filled with such franchise-revivals.Yes, the fact is sadly that compared to prior entries, ""Scream 4"" was a borderline flop met with mixed reception from critics and the general movie-going audiences.But does it deserve its less-than-stellar reception? Is it really a film that should have flopped?I don't think so. The second it was over, I was warm. Tingling with nostalgia, amused by the jokes and genuinely thrilled by the twists and turns. Especially after the underwhelming experience with the third film that I had, I found myself saying: ""Now THAT'S more like it! That was a real 'Scream' movie for the modern era!"" And I hope that as time goes by, more people will start to see it that way.Because to me, while far from perfect, ""Scream 4"" was a welcome return for a beloved horror franchise with just enough creative fun, subversive and postmodern meta-humor poking fun at the horror genre's newest tropes and ideas, and genuine shocks to give me a big, old sense of satisfaction!Upon returning to her hometown of Woodsboro years later to promote a self-help book she authored, Sidney Prescott and her friends are pulled into a new murder-mystery as it appears a new ""Ghostface"" killer has emerged, keen on creating a real-world ""reboot"" of the original murders all those years ago. ...and it seems that Sidney and her young niece Jill are the prime targets!The cast is an absolute blast, and really paves the way for the nostalgic sense of wonder that this film literally oozes. Neve Campbell's return is fabulous (especially as she hasn't been doing a ton of big-screen work lately), and her character is a great centerpiece to the story as is always the case. David Arquette is the same lovable oaf we've come to know and love over the past 20 years. Courtney Cox reclaims the sense of fun and shrewdness that made Gale such a great character, but was lost in the misguided third film. And series newcomers such as Emma Roberts, Alison Brie and especially Hayden Panettiere are just a blast and a half! (Especially Panettiere as the absolutely adorable and wickedly smart Kirby.)Perhaps the best aspect of the film, however, is the return of the series creator Kevin Williamson, who famously (or rather, infamously) didn't write the script for the borderline-poorly- received third film. Williamson is back, though... big time. His perfect balancing of wickedly subversive meta-humor and shocking displays of horror and gore is on full-display for much of the film, and its only compounded by the fact that since the last film was released, there have been a lot of changes in the entertainment world.Now, not only does Williamson have a lot of new riffing to do on modern horror conventions (such as the wave of hyper-violent ""torture porn"" films, although I personally detest the ""torture porn"" label; and of course the ""reboot"" phenomenon that plays a central role to the story), but also on the fact that his brand of hilarious postmodern and meta humor has been embraced by the masses. It's genuinely brilliant to see scenes where Williamson is writing a dissection of postmodern meta-humor by using... postmodern meta- humor. The layers of subversion and irony add a lot to the complexity and hard-hitting nature of the jokes that films-nerds like myself will surely adore.However, all this gushing does come with a bit of a trade-off.Wes Craven was a master of horror. And a darned-fine filmmaker. This cannot be denied. And he will always be sorely missed. But this is the one film in the series where I can't help but feel that he was on auto-pilot. His choice in shots is a bit more basic than in previous films, and his compositions and execution of key scenes just aren't as lush or hard-hitting as in previous films. Perhaps he was just bogged down with other things, but I do find this to be the ""flattest"" looking of the franchise. Not that it's badly directed. Just comparatively underwhelming when viewed next to the other films. So I do have to dock a point for that.And the other point I'm docking is for the same reason I took a point off in my review for ""Scream 2""- despite the freshness and pure geek-joy present in Williamson's writing... he does occasionally fall back onto the same clichés in some scenes that he so deliciously deconstructs in other scenes. (Case in point: A scene in a parking garage that had me rolling my eyes in all the wrong ways.) It's pretty subdued and minimal, but it's just enough for me to drop another point.Regardless, ""Scream 4"" is a wonderful and welcome return for the franchise. It's a true ""Scream"" movie through-and-through thanks to the return of the entire core creative team. In particular the return of Williamson. And it just makes me happy to have another good ""Scream"" movie to watch and cherish.It's a very good 8 out of 10. It'll leave you screaming in all the best ways.",Scream 4

80,m-47826,Disappointing and frustrating on so many levels.,4,17 August 2020,"Smart but ill-conceived anniversary movie.When Scream 3 was disappointing at not being a good Scream movie. This one is at not being good overall. It starts with an enjoyable opening inside of an opening. With popular TV actresses of that era. Inside another one, with first Scream movie opening death scenes homage added later, that don't work. And appear to be redundant, when other parts are mimicking it later on. The alternative version is better. The rest of the « new kids » are supposed to be the first trilogy's characters counterparts (?) Not by a long shot. The girls are the trilogy's mean girls clones. And the boys all have potential killers written on their foreheads. Sidney's assistant, Rebecca Walters was the only one that reminded us of that. Granted her character was extremely unlikeable, and you couldn't care less about her demise. But she was the new Gale Weathers through and through. Only seen through a distorting mirror. What remains are « Dewey Rileys », with Judy Hicks really standing out. Sidney's aunt, who is also Jill (the so called new Sidney) mother makes a cameo. Only Mary McDonnell is so absent, you don't even see the point in her being in the film. Until she's listed as one of the victims that is... The Stab-a-Thon segment, which would've been the apogee of everything meta in Scream 4. Is handled so poorly, it's just another frustrating missed opportunity added to several others before and after it. The infamous third act is extremely underwhelming, so is the killer's reveal. The first Scream opening homage is satisfying at first, but it ends so predictably, everything else is ruined. I'm not even talking about the « fourth » act. Let's just say it is when the film loses all credibility, and appeal for a second and more watch. One can only hope the upcoming new sequel will rectify both three and four fatal mistakes. Only time will tell. As far as this fourth movie is concerned, it is extremely frustrating to watch how cheapened the franchise concept was, and how lazily it was handled. It's a good criticism on the genre landscape, and society in general, since the last installment. Only it's done in a very messy and rough way. And what's with the cinematography? The movie looks so old, and it's only ten years...",Scream 4
81,saadgkhan,Scre4m is better than Sc3am but nothing compare to Scre2m and Scre1m.,4,20 August 2011,"SCREAM 4 – CATCH IT ( B- ) I've been waiting eagerly for Scream 4 ever since it has been announced and then the day came when it hit the theaters. In the beginning, I was hoping for some great shocking twist murderous scene which will leave us talking for years like Drewbarry Moore's scene in Scream. Sadly after 15 years they only came up with movie in a movie in a movie. Killing two girls instead of one is interesting but what's the point if the killing methods are so immature and typical. (O' I'm sounding like a creepy psycho :-P). After watching this I knew it's a lot to expect something really surprising and great from this movie. So, initially the movie came off very commercial and typical and it was hardly any exciting to see all actors back but after 30 mints or soo it gets interesting and things starts to happens. Spoiler: The ending and twist was surprising but I still haven't figure out whether it was good or bad. So, the surprise was that Emma Roberts turn into a villain? Shocker yes it was a shocker but I don't think she was able to portray much convincingly that she actually killed those people plus her performance is really average. Emma Roberts is one of few actresses who are pretty, act decent but don't have star charisma to it. They are plain and boring. Now let's talk about the returning cast which was pretty good Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette. Besides that Wes Craven cast almost all TV new comers tween in the movie. This made it kind of Teen TV Festival. All victims of first sequence Lucy Hale, Shenae Grimes, Anna Paquin, Kristen Bell, Brit Robertson and Amee Teegarden were okay. Now in lead Tween Victims we see Emma Roberts as I discuss plain and boring, she pretty much average as always. Hayden Panettiere is bold and sassy. Marielle Jaffe is hot. Eric Knudsen and Rory Culkin are typical gadget geeks. Nico Tortorella is good looking average actor. Adam Brody, Marley Shelton, Alison Brie and Antony Anderson did a decent job. Overall, Wes Craven's direction is average but the humor on today's generation and movies is really good. Scre4m is better than Sc3am but nothing compare to Scre2m and Scre1m.",Scream 4
82,michaeltrivedi,Yep,6,11 November 2019,"I didn't know I liked Scream movies until I watched this one. It was a fun ride, with a cool, recognizable cast. But what really kept me involved was the mystery about who the killer actually is. From the first movie, I guessed that it would be someone within the main characters. It obviously was the movie nerds, but I didn't expect Emma Roberts.The movie is about a killer on the loose in a small city. The main character from the first film supposedly went on to write a famous novel about the story, and returns to the city to promote the book. The Scream killer returns to the town, and starts terrorizing. People die, etc. Nothing really happens worth mentioning.There's all the regular things in any teen scary movie. There's the parties, the drinking, the cool kids, and the losers. The cops, the parents, etc. The hot blondes, the cougar, etc. But it's the mystery that keeps the movie going. Even the comedy, which is popular with these movies, is sort of kept at the wayside. It's not too horrifying of a movie, but it's a fun mystery.I liked it.6 stars",Scream 4
83,punishmentpark,What's my favorite scary movie? Not this one.,4,4 August 2013,"Once upon a time there was a scary movie trilogy, and now it's back. I've been looking forward to this one a little, but I also knew that Craven can disappoint from time to time. With the original cast, director and writer on board I had reasonably high hopes, though.The opening trio of attacks sets the tone with fashionable mentions of apps and things like that, but it's all too bland and standard. The same goes for the rest of it; it's watchable, with every old cast member doing his or her thing, but the new breed hardly impresses. Here and there Craven tries to educate his audience (go watch 'Peeping Tom', indeed!) and Williamson put together a fairly smart story, but somehow it doesn't come together like it did before. Did the formula die with Scream 3, where I stayed interested in what happened to everyone until the end? I think so, though many only liked part one and maybe two - for me the whole trilogy was a blast (I'll have to try it again some time soon).It's not all bad (some kills are pretty nice), but it certainly did not live up to my expectations. 4 out of 10.",Scream 4
84,chrichtonsworld,Enjoyable and better than the third but not on par with the first two in the series,6,24 April 2011,"Before I begin with the negative I want to point out that I really enjoyed this movie. As slasher movies go this one is pretty solid. However compared to the first two movies in the series it is a bit underwhelming. There weren't as many surprises as one would expect from a movie like this. The killings and chase sequences lacked the the thrills that makes the viewer jump up.This could be because we don't really care for the characters as we barely know them. The whole interaction between the characters was very limited and felt rushed.The deaths were basic stabbing stuff. Not once did you actually thought OMG,horrible! Don't know about you but you have to have at least one scene like that.Also I think Wes Craven was so right to fear that after the Scary movie series that Ghost Face would not be effective any more. And he is right. Every time Ghost Face appeared you just couldn't take it very seriously. Speaking of which. While there were some funny moments it wasn't nearly as sharp as the comedy used in Scream 1. Still I did like the ending very much.Even if more red herrings could made the ending have more impact.Overall Scream 4 still manages to be entertaining and enjoyable as long as you realize it isn't as strong as the first two Scream movies in the series.",Scream 4
85,Pumpkin_Man,Ghostface is Back With a Vengeance!!!,10,15 April 2011,"Eleven years ago, I had thought we'd seen the last of Ghostface. I was 10 years old when Scream 3 came out, and now that I'm 21, I'm glad to see that Ghostface has returned for a new generation. This sequel is just as bloody, epic, and awesome as the previous Scream movies. On the Anniversary that Billy Loomis and Stu Macher had a killing spree, Sidney Prescott returns to Woodsboro to promote her new self-help book. She reunites with Gale, Dewey, and her cousin, Jill. Soon after, Ghostface shows up and begins killing Jill's friends. Sidney, Jill, and Kirby seek help from two horror geeks named Charlie and Robbie. They discuss the new rules and how to survive. Who is re-writing the rules? Will Sidney survive again? I highly recommend SCREAM 4!!!",Scream 4
86,baumer,You're the dumb blond with the big tits (who then runs up the stairs),9,15 April 2011,"Scream 4 is a minor miracle. It not only furthers the story of Scream, it updates it. When Scream came out in 96, there was no social media, there was no Blair Witch Project. It was simply a couple of killers who took their love of movies too far. They terrorized people using a coded cell phone. That's about as inventive as they got.It worked brilliantly as Scream became one of top 25 films of all time. With horror legend Wes Craven directing a fresh and brilliant script by newcomer Kevin Williamson, Scream poked fun at and paid homage to all the horror films that came before it.Here we are 15 years later and the trick is to somehow stay true to the tone of the original while updating it for today's post-Twitter generation. That can be a tricky thing. Look at the utter failure of Zombie's Halloween. It was a reboot and it tried to walk a fine line between keeping the tone of the original and Zombie adding his own flair. It didn't work at all. But this time, Craven and Williamson have made a ridiculously brilliant film in Scream 4. All the witty dialogue, all the irreverent nods to the horror films of the last 50 years, all the hot young women, and all the goofiness of some of the other characters that we love, it's all here. The film even gets ballsy enough to tell you that it is basically following in the footsteps of the original. So when it tells you this, you try to piece it all together and see if you can figure out who's doing the killing.As much as I like to be surprised at the end of a horror film, or any good who-dunnit, it isn't very often when I can't figure out the Scooby Doo endings. But I was honestly baffled in this one, right up till the very end when all is revealed. Kudos to the script and to Craven for really keeping you guessing.The story has Sidney returning to Woodsboro for the ten year anniversary of the killings. She has written a book about her harrowing experience and it has gone on to be a best seller. As soon as she arrives, the killings start again and that familiar voice is taunting her and her niece and her friends. Emma Robertson is her niece Jill and Hayden Pantierre plays her best friend Kirby. David Arquette and Courtney Cox reprise their roles and then you can add in all kinds of excellent cameos or small roles from the likes of Anthony Anderson, who plays Deputy Anthony Perkins...wink wink..nudge nudge...and Kristen Bell and Anna Paquin.Soon the locals start getting bumped off, but in much more gruesome fashion than other Scream films. There are plenty of stabbings and the outcome is bloody and gruesome. In an homage to Wes Craven's original fright film Last House on the Left, one of the victims actually has their intestines laying beside them. It was a very shocking, albeit quick moment, but it was there.The film really plays up the fact that the killer wants to up the ante in this one. The killer is using the internet to broadcast the kills and this makes the killer incredibly sick. And when you find out (during the talking killer part, when the killer, instead of just killing their victim, explains the whole plot to them) what the motivation is for this killing spree, you just might stand up and cheer. I'm not sure if Williamson or Krueger wrote the last part about not having to work for fame anymore, you just have to have messed up stuff happen to you, but regardless of who did, it's one of the most brilliant and apropos lines I've ever heard.Scream 4 is miles better than the last one and imo it even surpasses the very good Scream 2. I am ready for a fifth. The movie really takes you back to what I loved about Scream 1 and 2. Sidney's been through a lot, but I think she go another round or two.9/10",Scream 4
87,suite92,Sidney Prescott returns home; bad things start happening.,8,6 September 2016,"The high school group (Jill, Kirby, Trevor, Olivia, Robbie, Charlie) will inevitably stumble over each other while dealing with the slasher. The Stab-a-thon was quite an opportunity for stumbling.The older crew (Gale, Dewey, Sidney, Judy) still have some unresolved issues after ten years. Gale's books spawned the Stab x films, which were roughly about Sidney's life. In response, Sidney has re-invented herself as an author, but the return home poses some contention. Dewey and Gale are together, but for how long, given Deputy Judy's presence?Just who is the slasher this time? Will we get a full resolution, or is another sequel in the works?How far will the screenwriters go in heightening the 'meta' experience? Apparently pretty far, considering the meeting Gale and Sydney had with the school film club. That was hardly the end of the wallowing, unfortunately.It was wonderful to see a great-looking, fine-sounding film done by professionals who chose a cast of real actors. On the other hand, there was enough meta to last a decade. The series is showing its age, all right. The same gag has been done too many times. I did like the bit with Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell, but that was the acting, not the meta.8/10",Scream 4

89,ASouthernHorrorFan,"My Review Of ""Scream 4""",7,24 July 2013,"The Scream franchise is the single most influential horror series accredited for the genre's massive come back in the mid 1990's, a come back which hasn't slowed down since the first ""Scream"" hit theaters in 1996. Flash forward a decade later through the creative killing fields of horror savvy teens in two more sequels and here we are again. Three years into yet another decade destined to be saturated by one of the most cultural game changing cinematic genre's in on the planet, here we are with yet another installment of the ""Scream"" series.""Scream 4"" finds Sidney back in Woodsboro along with Gale, who moved to the cursed town to be with Dewey. The place hasn't changed much. Parents live on moments of denial and fear while teens strut around in self ordained authority and importance. The perfect setting for Ghostface to become rebooted. It's nice to see the original characters in their home again becoming reacquainted and shaking up the scene. The blending of the original story with the next generation of victims is always a pleasant aspect in horror sequels. The thing that make this film work is the false sense you get that you know what is going to happen because you have seen it all before. The fact that this is actually addressed by the characters themselves lets you know you are only along for the ride. Not that there isn't some element of surprise because there are a few. Each kill is quick and brutal in classic Ghostface style. Sadly though the big reveal is not really a reveal. You can pretty much tell who the killers are two thirds of the way through the film. The obvious sign that lets you know –1. the way the direction focuses on trying to make you question everyone, except for two characters, who seem to be portrayed as innocent and hapless. Barely glanced at as merely harmless players. 2. a bit more hidden and subtle, every scenario of a ""Scream"" plot has been played out and discussed on screen, off screen, so where else could the story go but to venture deep within the family in order to validate the signature rage or misguided angst always directed toward Sidney Prescott.""Scream 4"" is a genius plot. One that you want to see happen, with the outcome it has. This film was a bit more toned down on the tongue-in- cheek humor that the first three movies boasted. Instead this script stays more dark and mature in it's approach, focusing on the seriousness of the story. This lets the kill scenes and plot build to the big twist at the finale. ""Scream 4"" doesn't blow your mind as many fans had hoped, yet it does make you say ""yes"" enthusiastically. This is a solid movie for the series, not that one was needed, but you are thankful that one has been made. Whether or not this is the period at the end of the sentence or merely a pause in the story remains to be seen. Thankfully I now have four films to satisfy my screams!",Scream 4
90,tim-764-291856,Tired - and long....,4,14 April 2012,"I'm not really a horror fan and so watching Scre4m 4 was not really a highlight in my film-watching life. So, I'm not able to compare every little detail/character change between all the Scream's in the franchise. I have seen them all, I just don't remember any except the original.I recognise and welcome back the three; Neve, David and Courteney. All the others just seem almost irrelevant and temporary eye candy, until their inevitable demise, at the hand of the now tired, Ghostface. I wasn't expecting plot - and certainly didn't get any. There's no pace or build up, or much suspense. Just the masked psycho jumping out of dark corners and cupboards....There is now a plethora of ringing and tinkling mobile phones as the maniac asks everyone ""What's your favourite scary movie?"" and of course, every poor creature thinks it's an ex boyfriend playing games. B-o-r-i- n-g.I think you can tell when any film is tired when to bolster both the story and the action, OTHER horror movies are shown, either on victim's TV or at horror-fests. Mind you, included in that, it was good to see the UK's brilliant 'Shaun of the Dead' being lapped up by hungry gore- diggers.The regurgitating media-seeking battle between original writer/star Gale (Courtney Cox) and Sidney (Campbell) soon gets boring and irritating. After an hour, one feels that one's continued watching is out of duty rather than out of interest, or passion. The pedigree and the hype keep us watching, though we really know by now that we're going to be disappointed.",Scream 4
91,adamscastlevania2,Please let this be the last!,1,2 October 2014,"(5%) An almost unwatchable borefest filled with big chunks of cringeworthy dialogue spouted by performances that wouldn't be out of place in a amateur production or perhaps a youtube fan short. Neve Campbell is borderline asleep and gives one hell of a dire turn; whilst everyone else is painfully annoying, particularly that little cretin with a camera strapped to his head (worst horror movie character ever?). It also constantly and rather lazily mentions better horror movies that I'd much rather be watching which adds to the already laborious and over-long run time (did they get anything right?). I hate this film as much as I hate the series a whole, it was garbage back in the 90's and it's still garbage now. And how can any movie with so many gory stabbings be so very dull? Shame on you Mr Craven!",Scream 4
92,carbuff,"In my non-horror buff opinion, the best of the Scream series.",10,3 May 2015,"I'm not at all into horror movies, but this is totally another classic, assuming, of course, that you can stomach some pretty heavy bloodshed. It's impossibly clever, witty, self-referential, meta, meta-meta, etc., etc., even pulling in the actual off-screen lives of David Arquette and Courteney Cox. Production values are over-the-top excellent, and the 103 minutes just flew by. I had absolutely no idea who was the killer or why, and I don't believe anyone who says that they did. It would deserve plaudits solely for being able to keep this franchise off life support, but it does so much better; as a matter of fact, I think that this is the best in the entire Scream series. It's just super slick and really, really well-done and, surprisingly, not at all stale or predictable, at least to a non-serious horror buff like me.",Scream 4
93,fernandoschiavi,"Craven and Williamson present oxygenated and quite creative references, with humor, more developed characters and an electrifying epilogue",6,25 July 2021,"Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven are aware of the importance of ""Scream"" to the horror movie scene, and they draw from it the motives and rules for the new wave of murders. The proposal is a reinterpretation of what Billy and Stu had done fifteen years ago, but adding elements more insane and technological, without leaving aside the humor, such as the total lack of respect for the purity of virgins, now replaced by a new group of people. If some of these elements are only in theory, giving the impression of not having been previously idealized, others help in the fun that is the film.What attracted so much attention in the franchise's opening episode is retaken with the same impetus in ""Scream 4"". The lack of seriousness is in every dialogue in the film, which fortunately never tires of making references. But now they go ahead, concentrating on works of the genre, but allowing them to expand through action, with the right to a priceless memory of Bruce Willis, and even through the series, as Hayden Panettiere is keen to emphasize. And there could be no lack of self-references, which are the great justification for making the film. The script of this fourth part brings a good police plot that makes any character a potential suspect.It wasn't possible to release a quarter of the franchise mocking the horror of the 90s, much less a fourth chapter, as there aren't many examples of them in cinema and there is rarely a specific pattern for them. Now it's a new decade, a new century. The public had already jumped on the bandwagon of the ""Saw"", ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Blair Witch"" franchise. With new horror attractions, new rules. Now everything has to be more violent, the unpredictable is the new cliché, it's no longer the virgin who survives (There's still a joke with the fact that the only way to survive a current horror movie is to be gay), everything is different. If ""Scream 4"" were to make fun of that time again, the new audience wouldn't understand and would likely make the new movie a laughing stock. Right in its opening scene, the film manages to mock the new franchise of the moment (""Saws"") and make a self-parody about how the opening repeats itself: a blonde girl answers a phone of someone mysterious and dies in a way brute by a masked assassin.Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson manage to bring a metalanguage never seen in the saga, playing with all expectations of the viewer. The duo also decides to release a critique, not only to the new generation of 21st century horror films, but also to the entire generation of today. In order not to reveal too many details, let's say that criticism explodes at the end of the film, that is, right at the turnaround. If in the first three the vision was more focused on cinema than on young people, now we can say that we have a plot that was not simply written, but that took years and years of observation to draw a rather satirical portrait of a futile and controlled generation. In addition to, once again, the media take harsh criticism of his self-centered and cold attitudes for a ""new Gale Weathers"".The main flaw in this movie is the focus on comedy. Violence is a use that, in the first films, was not comedy, in this copy it is. If in the first ones, comedy was not so present and was more present in situations of metalanguage and contradiction, here we have a much greater black humor. And that was a bit of a disappointment when we realized that the third movie had gone too far with comedy and that the moments of horror had diminished. But even so, the bedroom will not provide us with good times. About the final twist, I'll just say something, this one has a genius touch, this one is much more integrated, in relation to the others, to the idea of satire. However, it is somewhat absurd, but still, within this absurdity, we find metaphors and metalanguages. It's a meta-movie, after all. Rumor has it that the ending has been modified, re-shot, that the producers have called in Ehren Kruger (screenwriter of the infamous third film) to polish the script. Regardless of any fact, the revelation and justification have caused equal appreciation and irritation among fans of the franchise. But after Laurie Metcalf in Scream 2, and the lost child in Scream 3, I believe the choice was quite an evolution. Perhaps the speech that justifies the murders is a little too far-fetched, and ends up sounding ridiculous and underdeveloped.Wes Craven's tense direction also captures the public's attention, mainly due to the increasing intensity of criminal actions. The prologue itself is a show of its own, as has been the keynote of the series. Placing fiction within fiction itself, Williamson reassembles its initial clichés and stereotypes with a comic originality that is also frightening. With the premise that a new decade calls for new rules, Scream 4 doesn't go that far in its pretensions and doesn't even propose anything new to the genre, but rather a tribute to the previous films in the series and a retrospective look as the main references. So, even though it dedicates its main focus to a new group of young victims who are potential characters allied to recurring figures in the franchise, we have basically one more of the same recycled. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, considering the quality level of mainstream horror cinema this century.The deaths in this movie are sensational. As stated before, they are much more brutal than the previous films. In particular, a scene involving the closet is impressive. Craven and Williamson create an imminent scene in the viewer's mind and then relax and surprise them. Another scene in particular is the parking lot scene, it is well explored by Craven; but he could explore a few more corners, the director is capable of that; with all the tension building little by little, even though at the end it has a cliché that almost destroys the whole scene. Roger L. Jackson's voice comes back here more sarcastic than ever giving a provocative air to the new killer. The invention created in the third multi-voice film was, thankfully, ignored by Williamson giving more room for Roger to shine.With the killings happening in the city, it remains for Sidney to try to help her cousin Jill Roberts (Emma Roberts) not to become a new victim. Friend of the funny Kirby Reed (Hayden Panettiere) and Olivia Morris (Marielle Jaffe), and ex-girlfriend of the strange Trevor Sheldon (Nico Tortorella), the girl tries to understand the reason for the scary phone calls, since the return of the one who received the nickname ""angel of death"" or ""reaper "". If there isn't a Randy to set the rules for films, remakes and sequels, the role has been split between Robbie Mercer (Erik Knudsen) and Charlie Walker (Rory Culkin, brother of Macaulay Culkin), two friends responsible for an internet show he directs live interviews, with the participation of young people who attend the Cinema Club. Some good references to the genre depart from them, mainly in a challenge involving ""who knows more about horror movies"". Still, the main character in the story remains Ghostface. He no longer uses that annoying voice imitation device, but continues with his aggressive tone and threats, always one step ahead of his victims. He's not as messed up as in the other films, so his efficiency is higher, which brings more murders than the other assaults. He's also more violent, bloodier and more decisive - a comeback well founded by the current age.What harms the film revolves around its original characters. Sidney, Gale (Courtney Cox) and Dewey are sidelined, while young actors take on their sequels without the same competence, with the exception of the ""cool"" Panettiere. Dewey, in particular, returns more childlike than ever, while Gale no longer has the same vitality and ""poor face"" of years ago (the former reporter, by the way, is also ironically referenced through another character). Sidney, on the other hand, faces the same boring psychic ghosts that she already faced, such as the pressure of public opinion and the lack of true family ties that caress her in difficult times.While the new characters seem more aware than ever of the universe they are immersed in, that doesn't limit the growing body count. No matter how clever a horror movie is supposed to be, victims keep coming out of homes to investigate suspicious noises, opening doors to impending danger and climbing stairs while being chased by an assassin. These newcomers reiterate the main mistake of Scream 3 (2000) in excessively diverting attention from Sidney, Detective Dewey and journalist Gale, in an attempt to reinvent the franchise for a new audience.At one point, the film declares that the unexpected is the new cliché, and the whodunit here respects the series' recurring myth that the killer (or killers) must be revealed for an unlikely and unthinkable reason. Once again the final revelation about who is behind the Ghostface mask is extremely unlikely, but that is already the hallmark of the series and a change in that aspect would be far too...unexpected. Despite that, ""Scream 4"" is sure fun, especially for fans of the genre. Playing with caricatures and narratives, whether rewriting them or not, Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven prove that it is possible to rescue a franchise that was once brilliant, pleasing old fans and making new ones, used to a lot of blood but not used to a purposeful horror uncommitted. After all, it's not every day that, at the end of a movie with countless deaths, we leave with a smile on our faces.",Scream 4

96,Geeky Randy,Fails to Up the Anti,7,18 April 2011,"The first unnecessary follow up and the fourth installment to the 1996 film sensation that redefined the horror genre. SCRE4M hardly takes the lead in this one, but rather follows. All the films have been about clichés and many a homage--this film has plenty, and within universe nods--but this is the most violent of all SCREAM films, almost as if it's trying to compete with SAW or HOSTEL; really separating itself from the other three films. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has returned to her hometown Woodsboro, and people suddenly start dying who didn't see this coming? Dewey Riley (David Arquette) is now the sheriff not the deputy, but he's still as useless and foolish as ever. Courteney Cox's beloved bitchy character, Gale Weathers, has now turned into an ex-reporter and housewife--this subplot just begs for an excuse to have Weathers in the film. Something is very askew when the three returning characters (and the only three returning characters) are less interesting than the materialistic and twisted kids that are either getting butchered or doing the butchering. Brie, Jaffe, Knudsen, Panettiere, Shelton and especially Rory Culkin are all terrific in their roles. Keep an eye out for Nancy O'Dell as the reporter interviewing Sidney about her new book--she was also a reporter in SCREAM 2 and SCREAM 3. Williamson returns as the screenwriter (he wrote all but SCREAM 3), developing the most charismatic characters since the original and a very interesting plot that starts to ware thin. If the series has done anything perfect, it's the opening scenes. The opening scenes to all four films have been fantastic. Still, once the plot starts flying, you begin to realize how unnecessary this film is. Also, despite handfuls of salutes to the first three SCREAMs, the fact that the series is all about continuity--plus more importantly, Sidney wrote a book about her bloodbath of a life!--lends the story to have many open windows into the past. Yet, not a single reference to Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), a backbone in the Prescott family history. Thank God there were indirect references to Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan) and Steve (Kevin Patrick Walls), and the obvious references to Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy), Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), Stuart (Matthew Lillard) and Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore). All-in-all, pointless but memorable--it serves its purpose as entertainment, but there's really not much other purpose besides that. Yes, some of filmmaking is about business, but SCRE4M is pretty much all about the money; kind of lame.**½ (out of four)",Scream 4

98,DarthVoorhees,A Cut Above Hollywood,7,15 April 2011,'Scream 4' is an interesting experience. It isn't all that original but what I like about it is that it has great respect for the forefathers that preceded it. Kevin Williamson nearly killed the horror genre with the original 'Scream'. Horror films became comedies after Scream and I wasn't all that found of it. 'Scream' is a very original film and I greatly admire it's wit but it's copycats truly hurt horror. To have an original idea is a great thing and 'Scream 4' takes that to heart. 'Scream 4' is the horror film for the fan who is sick of the remakes. It's about the conflict between the old generations and the new ones.The problem I always had with the original 'Scream' films is that they spew a smugness. Williamson thinks himself better than the predecessors that he parodies. The problem that really really hurts 'Scream 4' is that it's characters are much more stupid than even the worst of slasher films past. I don't know if it is parody or not but some of these teens Williamson wants to butcher are really quite easy to catch. There is a moment when Sidney blatantly questions these teens for creating a perfect situation for Ghostface. Are these teens really that stupid? Is the film really that self-aware? I can't really tell but I will say that even if these traps are Williamson's conscious effort to say something they still display very lazy writing.I guess that is the problem with the slasher film creating the sacrificial lambs. We have to care about these lambs even a little bit or else the experience just is kind of boring and tedious. 'Scream 4' has killings that are very savage and brutal. These films have always kind of skated between parody but also with a semi-realistic tone. I for one have found it eerie to watch the original 'Scream' after events like Columbine. It's okay when a Jason or a Freddy kills cardboard cut outs because there is a ridiculousness factor in those films when we root for the killer but in Scream it's uneasy. In someways that is an asset to the film because it keeps us on edge but in other ways it loses a sense of direction and makes some scenes uncomfortable.I do care about Sidney Presscott a great deal and I was really quite surprised at how much I ended up missing her. I was never a huge fan of the Scream series but I really did enjoy Neve Campbell's performances in all three films. She is the glue that holds this picture together and it really works. We care for Sidney because if you've seen 'Scream 4' you've been on a journey with her for three films. Campbell has truly come full circle and I must say that her performance has a strength to it that really is much better than the film deserves. I kind of view Sidney as an Ellen Ripley type heroine. I don't think I would be as attached to this narrative had I not feared that Sidney would be killed off and I must say that Campbell plays to that fear brilliantly. She gives one of the better horror film performances in recent years here.In the end what does 'Scream 4' have to say? I criticize Williamson but I must give him credit where credit is do. He has created a strong character in Sidney Prescott. Campbell's performance and Williamson's writing showcase a character that has grown and evolved and that is something that few horror films of today can lay claim to. Williamson hates the remakes and I agree with him. Sitting in the theater I was brought back to how much I hated the Jackie Earle Haley Freddy Krueger film. Williamson gives Sidney a line that I would have loved to have seen Robert Englund deliver to Haley. 'Scream 4' acknowledges that people do take horror films seriously and that they invest themselves in the characters they have come to know and love. That is why I recommend this film.,Scream 4
99,acidburn-10,New decade new rules,8,22 April 2011,"Wow has it really been 15 years since Scream came out, which re started the popularity in slasher movies and then the sequels came out, Scream 2 was even though not quite as brilliant as the first, but was still a brilliant sequel and part 3 was well weaker and not as strong as previous but still managed to wrap up the trilogy pretty well, so did we really need a part 4, after all this time, I mean it has been 11 years since the last one came out.Scream 4 could have easily been an ill-fated disaster, just a money grabbing attempt with a weak plot, but luckily it wasn't, Scream 4 is a really strong sequel, okay not as brilliant as the original, but I found it better than 2 and 3. And bringing back the original cast was genius, it was nice to see Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courtney Cox back and quickly settle in they're roles again. Who apart from Courtney Cox have pretty much disappeared since part 3 came out.The plot = Sidney (Neve Campbell) returns to Woodsboro on the 15th anniversary of the original murders to promote her new self-help book. Being the ""angel of death"" that she is, the bodies begin to pile up as a new killer sets his sights on ""remaking"" the original events, recasting Sidney with her cousin Jill (Emma Roberts).From the opening sequence to final shot, Scream 4 definitely lives up to its tagline New Decade New Rules, and is even more brutal than before, of course we get the usual death then credits start, but this time we get 5 deaths before the title actually comes on, but with a twist, a pretty awesome one. We get 14 deaths in this one, definitely the most out of any of the Screamquels.The returning cast were again as I already said eased back into they're roles with pure ease, especially Courtney Cox who quickly became the fame hungry bitchy Gale Weathers, and the new cast were also enjoyable Emma Roberts (Jill) did seem a bit of Sidney No2 at first but she really became more and more enjoyable by the end and really came out on her own, Hayden Panetierre (Kirby) was easily the stand-out out of the new cast, she was fun sexy and quick witted, I loved the part when she was naming all the remakes in scene that bears resembles part 1. Rory Culkin and Erik Knudson were fun as the film geek horror buffs, both giving well rounded performances, as did Marley Shelton as Dewey's deputy/sidesick, a nice addition to the franchise. The only ones that I felt weren't as interesting was Mary McDonnell and the the guy that plays Jill's boyfriend Trevor, I felt that they're parts were underwritten. But other than that the cast were top notch.In my opinion Wes Craven has always been a bit of a bit and miss for me with greats like (Scream Trilogy, Last House On The Left, The Hills Have Eyes) and misses like (Deadly Friend, Cursed & Hills Have Eyes 2) but here he delivers his best film in many recent years and has a way of timing out scenes that build up the tension and suspense that goes beyond a simple jump scare. And after four films in the same series, that's definitely something to applaud.All in all a welcome back to true form and a brutal re-boot to the franchise.",Scream 4
100,Christian_Dimartino,"As much of a bloodbath as this movie was, it still brought a big smile to my face.",9,5 October 2011,"In the past 11 years, a lot has happened. Having a cell phone isn't a big deal. We have ipads, iphones, ipods, 3-D TVs, blah blah blah you get the point. So, thats part of what makes Scream 4, the latest in the series, such a good movie.It's been 11 years since Scream 3, which not many people liked. Except for me, who is a huge fan of the series. I always longed for this movie, then, in 2011, I got it. And I must say it was well worth the wait. But not many dumb Americans went to see it. Why? Thats the question I want answered.The three main cast members are back. David Arquette as Dewey Reilly, who is now Woodsboro's sheriff, Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott, the girl that can't get a break, and Courtney Cox as Gale Weathers-Reilly(Dewey and Gale married).Things have calmed down over the years. Until Sidney returns to Woodsboro for a book tour. Then things go wild. The Ghostface killer re-emerges, and starts terrorizing Sidney, Gale, Dewey, Jill(Emma Roberts), Sidney's cousin, and Jill's friends.The opening scene is perfect and hilarious. Craven knows what he's talking about. And the opening scene, along with a lot of the other horror movie talk(written excellently by Kevin Williamson, who wrote the first two), is smart. Scream 4 is at times hilarious, and it actually made me jump a couple of times. It's also a ton of fun, like the original three. The original trilogy was a lot of fun, and I am a huge fan, so I am mainly just happy to see the original three back together.Also, the twist is one you definitely didn't see coming. But I can't say that I was exactly happy with it. It was a good twist, I just wish it could've been somebody else. It completely changed my perspective on this person.These are three characters that we've grown to care about. And there are a lot of scenes that really hold you mainly because you care about them. In the scenes that you sense danger, you get a little scared yourself, if you're the die-hard Scream fan that I am.Scream 4 brought a huge smile to my face. Almost everything about it was just right. It's a great reminder of why we loved the first one so much. In all four films, they talk about horror movie clichés, and there are a lot of conversations, such as one between Anthony Anderson and Adam Brody, about saying,""I'll be right back"", that bring back the first one. That, and some of the last 20 minutes.Overall,I felt that Scream 4 was the funniest, the most thrilling, the most involving, and the most satisfying of the four films. And if they do decide to make a 5th, bring back the films three heroes. It just couldn't be the same. I must say, Scream 4 was well worth the 11 year wait. Bravo Wes Craven, you saved the best for last(unless there's a 5th).A-",Scream 4
101,Darkside-Reviewer,"""I'll be right back"" In 11 years time",7,16 April 2019,I saw Scream 4 in theaters when it was released and again recently on Blu Ray. I was skeptical about it as it was released when the whole remake craze was going on with horror and Slasher movies but to my surprise Scream 4 was a true sequel to Scream 3. The original cast return to the series and now with more acting experience under their belt the story is great and delivers on it's who done it premise that the Scream franchise is well known for. The kills are gory and blood filled right until the end.If your fan of horror and Slasher movies and the original Scream trilogy give this a watch it delivers like the first movie just modernised for today's audience.,Scream 4
102,jp_91,Cool but not amazing!,6,9 September 2020,"As a huge fan of the ""Scream"" franchise, I was hoping for a great fourth part. ""Scream 4"" is a weak film, not bad but not amazing, just enjoyable. Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette are horror icons and now they are together one more time against a killer. The script is thrilling and Wes Craven direction is cool but something is missing, could have been a better film.",Scream 4
103,Min111,It's the fourth best in the series,4,13 March 2021,"I think 'Scream 4' is the fourth best movie in the series. A lot of people think 'Scream 4' is better than 'Scream 3', but I think it's the other way around. At least we can all agree to disagree on the issue. I'm glad though a fourth movie happened, and I really hope there's another one. Anyway, 'Scream 4' happens ten years after 'Scream 3'. Sidney Prescott visits her home town Woodsboro. She returns to promote her new book. I don't understand why Sidney Prescott decided to return home considering what happened in 'Scream', 'Scream 2' and 'Scream 3'. She's better far away from Woodsboro even though it's her home town. As soon as she returned, Sidney is faced with more problems, and there happens to be another new killer in town. Sidney shouldn't have come back. Anyway, I wasn't surprised who the main killer was. Could you figure out who the killer was? I did. Let's not forget the other characters such as Dewey and Gale who happen to be married now. I wasn't surprised about that either. There are also new characters such as Jill Roberts who's Sidney Prescott's cousin. She has a mother named Kate Roberts who's also Sidney Prescott's aunt. Yes, Kate Roberts gets killed in 'Scream 4'. It's upsetting to see Sidney Prescott lose another member of her family just like her mother Maureen Prescott. The killer in 'Scream 4' is sickening! I can tell you that. The other new character I liked is Judy Hicks. I find her a very attractive police deputy. I'm glad she doesn't get killed in 'Scream 4' just like her fellow police deputies. The producers were spot on. Judy Hicks is one of the reasons 'Scream 4' generated interest. She's a wonderful addition to the crew. I like her. Some of the murders in 'Scream 4' were pretty graphic. I like the part, for example, where the police find the dead bodies of the two high-school students who were killed earlier. The killer though is a sadist. 'Scream 4' is a 'horror' and 'mystery' movie which is the same just like in the other three 'Scream' movies. I also think they're 'thriller' movies. I think 'Scream 4' is the fourth best movie in the series because the other three movies were simply that good. It's important you see the other 'Scream' movies before you see 'Scream 4'. What's your favourite movie in the series? Exactly! It's amazing the amount of people killed in Woodsboro across all the 'Scream' movies. How many people were killed? Why would anyone want to live there? Exactly! I'd run as far as possible from Woodsboro. 'Scream' is one of the greatest horror franchises.",Scream 4
104,raybennetthays,I actually like it more than the original,10,3 May 2021,"(Just a little bit) I just love this gem of a film so much, it's hilarious, it's suspenseful, and it's got some of the best leads in the franchise, I can't be the only one that laughed a lot at the lady shopping at midnight, and I love that part of it is still stuck in the 90's.",Scream 4
105,LoneWolfAndCub,"Not as good as I'd hoped, but still an excellent, funny sequel",8,14 April 2011,"I am a huge fan of Scream (1996), it gave a shot of adrenaline to a dying genre in an original and intelligent fashion...inevitably sequels were going to come. Scream 2(1997), although not as good as the first, was still very good, with a great new cast and story. Scream 3 (2000) was a disappointment, two of the main reasons being the change of writer and political climate at the time. There was a lack of interesting characters or tension, and the whole movie just felt like a comedy. Now, into a new decade, much has changed in the horror genre. Remakes are the go, with almost every horror classic receiving the remake treatment, and of course the sequels that follow the remake. Just recently reboots have become incredibly popular, especially in the comic adaptations department, with numerous series being redone to fit in with the modern audience.Scream 4 (or Scre4m, whichever you prefer) reunites horror director Wes Craven with the original writer Kevin Williamson and actors Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courtney Cox to deliver a fresh take on the horror genre and I must say, I am impressed. After a fantastic opening which takes multiple 'stabs' (excuse the bad pun) at sequels, remakes, 'torture porn' and movies-within-movies I knew Scream 4 was a step in the right direction not only for the franchise, but the horror genre. The plot is no different from the other films, it revolves around Sidney (Neve Campbell) returning to her hometown Woodsboro to promote her new self-help book. Unfortunately, her return has caused the return of Ghostface, who busily hacks through various citizens of Woodsboro.Scream 4 feels very familiar, but at the same time fresh. There are many references to horror movies, Iphones, Twitter, Facebook and blogs, with almost every joke hitting the mark. The new cast is fantastic: Hayden Panettiere, Alison Brie and Rory Culkin are amongst the many who bring their characters to life very well. Of course, the original actors are excellent, seeing their return will bring a smile to any fans face. The film is very fast paced, almost too much so for the amount of new characters introduced. At times it all feels very rushed, and characters are only in one or two scenes before being murdered. There are scenes which have been shown in stills and trailers which are not present, and it would have been good to see them as it may have fleshed out certain characters and allowed more of a connection (expect a director's cut/unrated DVD). In terms of violence, this is easily the most violent of the series, with the most victims and copious amounts of blood. The deaths are drawn out longer than in the other films, with some being particular nasty.I can't say I'm disappointed with Scream 4, because I'm not. It is very self-referential, and barely a scene goes by without a reference to a movie convention. Despite the film being too short for the amount of characters present, Craven and Williamson have successfully revived the franchise and once again parodied the horror genre with intelligence. If you are a fan of the series, this will not disappoint you.4/5",Scream 4
106,asda-man,Almost on par with the original,9,26 April 2011,"Personally, I loved it. Scream 4 exceeded all my expectations with 2 and 3 being disappointing, Scream 4 is almost on par with the original. The opening was extremely inventive and throughout the film some parts were just pure genius! What I loved about it was it went back to the Scream basics. Scream 2 and 3 were trying to be too clever with the third being on a movie set with some poor new characters. Scream 4 had some wonderful new characters thrown in to the bloody mix! It was 1hr 50mins long but it didn't feel that long at all! In fact I was still hungry for more. The great thing about the Scream series is that they really don't try and be something they're not, they know that they're a slasher series and play on that idea which eventually becomes something quite ingenious.Its also the bloodiest of the franchise with plenty of killings going on and the camera does not shy away from the action. And did I mention the ending was incredible? Every scene was just filled with really fun chase scenes and brilliant references to other horror classics which would make any horror fan go lar-lar! When it's not being scary its being funny and so it never gets dull. Funny, fun, entertaining, bloody, great characters, great story. Scream 4 has it all. Bring on Scream 5 and 6!",Scream 4
107,LazySod,An insult to the original film(s) and the genre,3,17 April 2011,"In 1996 the first Scream film came as a blessing. It came in a time where there just weren't enough horror films and the meta-film effect it carried worked wonderfully - it was a good fun film to watch and created the stage for a couple spin-off and parody films. It was followed by two sequels that got gradually worse - like most sequels do but they still worked. Now, 15 years after the original, 10 years after the last sequel, there's Scream 4.Scream 4 picks up the story in ""real time"". The town where the events took place a decade ago is getting ready for a memorial day and the survivor from the original one drops by to sign her book - a book she wrote to overcome her trauma and deal with what has happened. And surprise, surprise, it is all starting all over again. So far so good - this is a horror film so there's no real need for a deep story.Then for the film itself, it becomes clear all too quickly that attempts have been made to make a film that is both smart and classic - much like the previous ones - but, in contrary to the previous ones in the series, it failed miserably. The film isn't smart - it just follows the classic cliché rich path that many films like it follow. This, combined with the fact that none of the events that happen have anything interesting going for them - they are all the standard killings one might expect - makes the film dull and even irritating.3 out of 10 insults to the horror genre",Scream 4
108,baileycrawly,The Last for Wes Craven,5,18 September 2020,"This film will always be viewed a little more favorably as it's the last film to be directed by Wes Craven before his passing in 2015. It's the final entry in the final passion project he embarked on.That, however, doesn't mean this film is good.We continue on doing the exact same thing as the previous films, but ten years in the future. Sidney is doing a lot better, she's found a vice through which she can express herself and find healing, but she evidently comes face to mask (see what I did there?) with yet another Ghostface killer. And, as with all the others, she's totally prepared to save the day.Gail and Dewey are married, giving us a slightly different (but still equally as dull and uninteresting) story arc with them that is explored throughout the film.Reviewing all four of these films back to back is difficult because the reviews are evidently going to be as repetitive as the films themselves. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing multiple times and expecting different results. The studio should've pulled the plug after Scream 2, but instead we're stuck with this bland mess of a film as a reminder that a popular idea will be milked relentlessly until it can't stand on it's own two feet anymore by the Hollywood system, all in the name of profit.And now there's a fifth one on the way. God help us.",Scream 4
109,skybrick736,Scream 4 (7/10),7,14 August 2016,"Once hearing that Wes Craven was going to give Scream 4 a shot it was hard not to think that it was going to be just another stab at a payday, no pun intended. To delight of many though Scream 4 was a huge surprise that brought back the feel and atmosphere of the first two. The mixture of the old guard and the new class meshed really well together allowing other people to shine besides Courtney Cox and David Arquette. Emma Roberts and Hayden Paneittiere were absolutely stunning on screen and did terrific jobs portraying strong lead females as well. The duo of Erik Knudsen and Rory Culkin also provided great comedic performances and took over the job of ""meta"" kings that Jamie Kennedy has held in the series. What really took me by surprise was how well Wes Craven executed his ending of his Scream franchise capitalizing on a brilliant twist.",Scream 4
110,bob_meg,Kevin Williamson's sly touches give the Scream franchise a nice reboot,7,15 April 2011,"It's good to have Kevin Williamson back behind the wheel of the new Scream machine.The opening sequences of this franchise are legendary, from Drew Barrymore's Janet-Leigh-like tour de force of misery in Scream to the wryly disturbing, hilariously self-parodying theater opening of ""Stab"" in Scream 2 (which is reprised briefly in 4 with Heather Graham's so-earnest-it's-hysterical Casey Becker impersonation). Sure, Scream 3's opening kind of reeked, but the whole installment was on shaky ground with Ehren Kruger's script, which never felt like it knew where to go.Scream 4's opening gleefully brandishes barb-wire kisses at everything from social networking to mindless bimbos to hackneyed mega-sequel franchises...all at once. It's truly memorable and fresh and posits the reason this installment is back on par with Scream 2, at least: mainly, it has no ego and makes fun of itself without shame. It doesn't pretend to be something it's not.That doesn't mean it has no brain, either. From the outset, it appears Williamson is ready to serve up a fresh crop of teen victims who will be mercilessly dispatched very predictably. That's not really the case...I was genuinely surprised more than a few times with the writer's choices and pleased with the results. The new cast, which includes Emma Roberts, Alison Brie, and Marley Shelton have chops to burn and successfully walk the line between believability and camp, nicely mimicking the script's self-mocking tone.The only thing that seems to be getting a bit stale is, ironically, Ghostface. The phone calls aren't really even that scary anymore (Roger Jackson sounds like he needs to switch to Sanka...a good part of his menace in the first film was his sterile detachment). And even though the mask still creeps you out in its amoral splendor, there are far too many full-body shots of the villain stumbling around in that dime-store gown. If they *really* want to shake things up, give us a monster we're not so familiar with. There are a few times in Scream 4 when you almost expect someone to just say ""Hey G-face, what up?"" If you're a fan of the original trilogy, there's a lot here to like and I'd highly recommend it. You'll find it more funny than terrifying. Newbies will have the opposite reaction...so there's something for everyone, I guess. It's satisfying in the way your favorite fast-food franchise is, and this time, at least, it's service with a confident stab.",Scream 4

Here is a small review of all the previous movies. Scream-Good. Scream 2-Good. Scream 3-Good.Yeah, they were all good, but none of them were great. They all made me laugh, they all made me jump, and all of them had good twists and good gore, but I didn't love any of them, and this is pretty much the same.I laughed, i jumped, the gore was good, the twist was good, but I didn't love it.7/10",Scream 4
112,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,The beginning of Emma Roberts legacy - and only that,6,4 August 2020,"LOL. Ok, I watched this because I've become infatuated with Emma Roberts over the last decade and I remembered this was one of her first really prominent roles. Also, yesterday I saw someone claim, ""Scream 4 is way better than it has any business being"". I was like, ok, 9 years later, I'm gonna give this a chance. Maybe it will be fun now...First 40 minutes were satisfying. The blend of the old school cast with a bunch of new school actors who were up and coming at the time provides a really surreal sort of feeling when you throw all the characters in this world with each other. There was some silly layering stuff done with the writing, which writer Kevin Williamson is known for - really tongue-in-cheek stuff. Some of it still works, some it falls really flat, but overall the beginning of the movie is a lot of fun. Then, it falls into boring, redundant tropes for the entire body of the movie...a bunch of crap we've seen and heard before in the previous Scream movies. it's pretty much entirely throwaway. Then you get to the final act of the film, and it only gets worse as it goes, but I find major amusement in the fact that towards the end it feels like the entire movie was just set up as a vehicle for Emma Roberts career. It truly feels like the sole purpose of the entire project was to kickstart her legacy, and I believe that's the only purpose this film really serves. If you get a kick out of the legend Emma Roberts, you will have a riot with the final act of this movie. That's why I gave this a 6 instead of a 4 or 5. But without that, and the fun first act, this is on par with your every day bowel movement.",Scream 4
113,bh_tafe3,Good realisation of a sequel the world did not need,7,24 September 2012,"There is a lot to enjoy in this patently unnecessary continuation of the Scream series.What I liked: 1. seeing the old gang again. Dewey, Gale and Sid, how are you? Where have you been? The original actors return to play the original characters, and it's as if they were never off the screen. Dewey and Gale still together. Sid a lot happier than last time we saw her.2. The opening sequence. Films within films within films. Though they probably went one murder scene too long, this was an amusing, original and effective opening.3. the killer. Absolutely crazy woman, and probably the most genuinely threatening murderer since Billy in the original. I mean, Mickey and Roman did quite well in the previous two films, but this girl is a genuine nutter.4. the revelation of the second killer. What to do when the girl who you've pined over all through High School admits she has feelings for you? Stab her in the gut and tell her the damage has already been done of course.5. the female casting. Emma Roberts and Hayden Panetierre are great name additions.What I didn't like: the male cast: only one who was remotely interesting was the killer.So Unnecessary: why did they make this film again? Money making's about the only one I can think of.The kills: was really expecting some modern innovations, but nope, fairly routine slaughterage.THis was not a bad movie, but could have been better, and you just can't shake the feeling that there's no need for it to exist. I enjoyed a lot more on the second viewing, so it could be one of those movies that improves with age. And really, in the slasher genre, the worst movie in the Scream series is still better made and more enjoyable than the best of its imitators. So I won't tip my hat to Wes Craven on this occasion, but I will nod politely and wait to see how I and others view this movie in a few years.",Scream 4
114,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Makes itself worse by pretending to be unique.,1,1 August 2011,"Cheese beyond all cheese. If they were going for something mildly serious, they failed miserably. If they were going for something campy and fun, they failed miserably. The serious scenes are too out of place to work and the comedic scenes are just...dated and entirely without wit. The dialogue is horrific and the acting is even worse (although Emma Roberts does slightly elevate in the final act). This is what happens when veterans try to create something fresh and new for a younger audience; everything fails miserably because they don't know how to do anything different.This is the same film that came out ten years ago, it could have easily been made when the others were. They play the same old self-aware meta premise but it just feels old and tired at this point because everyone, including these same people, have already worn it out many times. In creating a world where breaking the rules becomes a rule in itself and so following the rules means breaking the rules, nothing is shocking because nothing can be unique. So when the killer is finally revealed it doesn't even matter, because it could have been anyone and it wouldn't have been shocking at all.In fact they end up not breaking the one golden rule of the genre and there lies the fact that this series, for all of it's comedic doses of not playing by the rules, follows them just as much as anyone else. Something like this is just as bad as any Nightmare on Elm Street remake or Final Destination 5 because it acts like it's different when it's exactly the same as anything else. I honestly have no idea how anyone could have liked this, and I know it got some praise, which absolutely blows my mind. The whole thing is tired, corny and worthless.",Scream 4
115,Jackpollins,Don't mess with the original..ain't that right,4,28 April 2011,"During the first ten minutes of Scream 4, I had hope. It seemed like it was going to be a good time that will poke fun at itself along with other movies. That being said, after that, the movie's plot starts. Yes, the first ten minutes are a fun poke at those horror movies we're all sick and tired of, but after that, it's the same thing as the first Scream, just not as much fun. The Ghostface Killer is back ten years after the original Woodsboro murders and this time he's out for everyone-both newcomers and veterans of the original series. I had some fun with the newcomers, especial Kirby (Hayden Panettiere), a perfectly sarcastic high schooler, and Robbie and Charlie (Rory Culkin and Erin Knudsen), two film buffs who know what the killer's up to. That said, this film focuses mostly on the veterans, who are so dull. I suppose these veterans, such as Courtney Cox, David Arquette, and, of course, Neve Campbell are tired after four of these movies, but that's no excuse for being so lethargic on screen. There's also a lot of stuff in Scream 4 that doesn't connect, and by that I mean contradicts the last 3 films. It might be a fun enough rental, but if it's playing at your local multiplex, which it probably is, don't pay movie theater prices to go see it.",Scream 4

117,Meven_Stoffat,"Sorry Wes, but you've forced me YET AGAIN",4,15 April 2011,"I'll start off by mentioning that I'm a big fan of the Scream franchise. All three are bloody brilliant and so as you could tell, when I saw the trailer for the fourth one, I was really excited. I actually counted down the days until it came out, and even went to go see this at the cinema today.In my opinion, Scream 4 was an alright movie. It wasn't one of the better ones, but it was way better than Wes Craven's insipid effort ""My Soul to Take"". However, it wasn't as good as I'd hoped, so instead of getting into a long ass review, I'll just break down the good and the bad.WHAT SCREAM 4 DOES RIGHT: -I loved the commentary on the remake/ridiculously long franchises trend. I've been thinking the same way that the characters in the opening scene did about the Stab movies- their thoughts echo my thoughts about the Saw franchise. I actually laughed when Wes fracked with our mind and gave us ""STAB 6"" *2 minutes later* ""STAB 7"". In fact, the last few Saw movies were so ridiculous, they may as well have done what Stab 7 did. And the remake commentary was hilarious too. Wes basically remakes the final act of Scream here, in a commentary about remakes. The kitchen scene and not to mention the spoof of Steve's gutting (the character here doesn't get gutted though).-Speaking of which, I loved the opening scene. The ""Scene within a scene within a scene"" was a total WTF moment, and in a good way. The audience shared a collective WTF moment, it was magical. -Ghostface is fast and brutal in this one. It's actually scary how fast the killer moved and what not. Totally angry and you could tell Wes cared about making this the ""Scream of all screams"".-The dialogue and characters. Two things, if you ask me, make a good movie: Characters and dialogue. And it offered plenty of good characters and clever dialogue. I laughed a lot of the time, Gale is her usual bitchy self and her ""YOUR LEMON SQUARES TASTE LIKE ASS!!!!"" at the beginning had me laughing. As well as the characters- Erik Knudsen's character stole the show with his geeky ""head-cam"" and what not. Hayden was really cool (it also helps that she is really hot too!!!) and overall, I gotta say they redeemed this rather uneven movie.WHAT SCREAM 4 GOT WRONG: -Is it just me or did the entire second half consist of the reveal of the killers??? Mind you I know Scream 1 did this, but it was done way better. For one, it spent equal time on Billy and Stu, but here the second half was the Jill show. It's like 5 minutes after the reveal of the killers and then suddenly BAM, she kills him off. It also doesn't help that they weren't that good of killers either. And we really didn't need to see her manipulating the evidence, stabbing herself, etc. Not to mention the hospital scene went on for WAAAAAAY TOO LONG. I liked the hospital stuff, it was intense, but I was checking my watch towards the end of it a few times, it was really that long.-I'm sorry but Erik Knudsen, as much as I love his character, is no Randy. Maybe I'm just too much a nostalgia buff but I just felt like Wes was trying way too hard to make him the new Randy. I still loved his character though and his pre-death come-out scene had me in tears laughing.-This movie was too spoofy if you ask me. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it but this movie relied too much on the funny stuff. Part of what made the first three movies awesome was the balance of funny and scary. Here... they just cared about stupid humor and what not and inappropriately placed w.-This felt like it was directed by about 10 different directors. I swear some scenes were beyond surrealism (and not in a good way). It's like Wes couldn't make his mind up about the type of feel his movie was supposed to have.-I found a lot of the movie too slowly paced. I mean, in the middle it kinda dragged and there were about like maybe 2 kills. It worked in the first three because of one thing: Character development. There wasn't here, it was just conversation after conversation after conversation KILL conversation conversation conversation conversation conversation KILL. I can sit through movies with a lot of talking but I found my patience kind of tested.-Sidney getting stabbed twice??? I'm sorry but that was just too unrealistic. So overall, this was an enjoyable movie. Not without its share of problems, but still worthwhile nonetheless. IMO, the worst of the series, but that said, I think Wes knows he's doing good, so he could make another 2 movies and I wouldn't mind.",Scream 4
118,Donatien3,A Welcome Revival,9,9 January 2021,"Reboots of popular film franchises have been a big part of 21st century filmmaking, as they have a loyal fanbase, nostalgia value, and are generally a safe bet for risk-averse studios.It's no surprise that ""Scream 4"" - a pioneer of the meta-horror genre - should poke plenty of fun at this reboot trend, while paying homage to the original trilogy.It starts off with a series a fake out openings for ""Stab"" (the film-franchise-within-a-film), featuring cameos from Anna Paquin, Kristen Bell, Lucy Hale, and Shenae Grimes. These small scenes parody the declining quality of horror sequels, and the predictability that invariably sets in when the sequel numbers rise.""Scream 4"" sees series originals Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), Gale Weathers-Riley (Courteney Cox), and Dewey Riley (David Arquette) returning to Woodsboro. Sidney has moved on from the Woodsboro murders and is a best-selling author, with her ambitious agent Rebecca (Alison Brie) in tow. On the 15th anniversary of the original murders, Sidney is pulled back into her nightmare when the Ghostface killer returns, and she's joined by her cousin Jill (Emma Roberts), her friend Kirby (Hayden Panettiere) and high school film geeks Charlie (Rory Culkin), and Robbie (Erik Knudsen), who are movie experts and film everything via a portable camera-headset.While ""Scream 4"" follows a similar formula to the previous films (with director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson returning), the commentary on the desire for instant internet fame keeps things fresh, as well as a killer reveal which pays homage to the original ""Scream"". There's also plenty of bloody kills to satisfy slasher fans.Unlike the ""Stab"" films, ""Scream 4"" doesn't decline in quality: instead it respects the originals while adding something new.",Scream 4

120,Emerenciano,Good film,7,28 February 2017,"How can a film be good when it has got so many clichés? Well, Scream 4 is good because of the action scenes and the many turns we see in the plot. Believe me, don't think everything is over until it is really over, meaning the credits popping up the screen.The countless clichés do not spoil the movie. It is the other way around. The dejá vu - another French term used here to disguise the word ""cliché"" - give Scream 4 a hilarious taste. So, that it. Scream 4 is horror, action and comedy at the same time. It is not to be taken so seriously but you should not merely think this is just another American horror production. Worth watching.",Scream 4

I liked how they tried to be a bit different from the previous movies like with the ending as I was a bit shocked to find out who the actual killer was.

123,SamJamie,The revival of the franchise.,9,25 September 2020,"Scream 4 is a 2011 American slasher film directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. The film stars David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Emma Roberts, Hayden Panettiere, Anthony Anderson, Alison Brie, Adam Brody, Rory Culkin, Marielle Jaffe, Marley Shelton, and Nico Tortorella. Sidney returns to Woodsboro for her book tour, and reconnects with old friends Gale and Dewey . However, Sidney's arrival also sparks the return of Ghostface, putting Sidney and everyone she loves in danger.Welcome to the one of the best fourth parts of a horror franchise ever made. Scream 4 is a fun and witty reminder of an old horror master's unparalleled talents, combining the three constant players from the original trilogy with a new cast of fresh faces -- old meets new in the best, most genuine kind of way. The films true strength, though, lies in the young cast. Alongside Hayden Panettiere's Kirby are Kieran Culkin and Emma Roberts. Their performances elevate the film from simply a great movie to a re-watchable classic.Where the film works best is in its sharp, self-aware attitude toward the rules of the horror genre, mocking and rejecting every current trend of the genre. The series remains smartly unapologetic in toying with meta-references and horror-film expectations. After a disappointing third film, the fourth film is made more for fans of the original than for new audiences, this installment has plenty of fun and horror goodness to please them while possibly picking up a handful of new converts. It does what Scream 3 failed to do: further the franchise while keeping it fresh... certainly a better conclusion than where the previous installment left off.Wes Craven has taken the ideas of the first film and twisted them in on themselves, using the technological advances of the last decade and society's celebrity-obsessed culture to give the series an invigorating kick. He guides us expertly down a series of blind, bloody alleys, a journey that's more pleasurable than frustrating. On account of his steady hand, the last act is as good as could be expected: skillfully conceived and entertaining in its preposterousness. If you like the tricks and the jolts and the jokes of the Scream series, you'll have fun at Scream 4, which immediately plunges the audience into a funhouse-mirror of suspense mixed with self-reflexive humor and doesn't let up. Compared with so many of the rebooted slasher flicks, Scream 4 remains a cut above. No, that is not an intended pun. I seriously hope the fifth film does not disappoint!",Scream 4
124,revival05,Only bad if you're dumb enough to take it seriously,7,21 April 2011,"I just had to post a review now, after the itching in my fingers got the best of me. The breaking point was a recent comment stating that Scream 4 meant a ""sad day for slasher evolution"".Wow. Slasher evolution. My head just exploded. I think those choice of words are so unintentionally amusing that it should have been in the... wait, it is. Only they call it ""slasher innovation"". That did make me giggle a little too, as I recall. Slasher innovation? Correct me if I'm wrong, but there's no such thing. The height of slasher ""innovation"" was probably reached when they called Friday the 13th part V ""A New Beginning"" after calling part IV ""The Final Chapter"". In fact, I'd say, the very reason a lot of people who liked the original Scream didn't fall for Scream 2 or Scream 3 is due to the fact that there is no innovation to be had in this genre; and that's the point of it. Making a satirical meta-slasher works, because its fun. But the sequels, though amusing to a lot of people (me included), indeed forced the audience to feel more sympathy with the characters than I think the audience really wanted to. The whole soap opera concerning Sidney Prescott wasn't really why the original Scream became such a hit. At all. And around Scream 3 the series really did start to run on fumes.Its truly delightful to see that Scream 4 goes back to the first movie's core concept; it lets you know instantly that it's a complete Meta Movie. From the very get-go the pacing of Scream 4 is almost at a Mel Brooks level, and the various layers of referencing are so many that you'd think Kevin Williamson wrote the script on a constant caffeine overdose. I liked it, I friggin loved it. This movie had me laughing and jumping at every corner. It even stops to let us know that the original Stab was directed by Robert Rodriguez.That being said, it's worth mentioning that I'm totally biased towards this series. The movie is 100% nonsense but I was shamelessly enjoyed by it. If you just want to have a fun time with a slasher, I'd recommend it warmly, but if you never cared for the Scream movies to begin with - and never really liked its geeky humor (I admit, I'd even call these movies dorky) - than you are to be warned because Scream 4 takes the whole Scream concept into massive overdrive.But there also seems to be a few Scream fans out there who are disappointed. I don't know why. Maybe some of them are younger than me and were toddlers when the original movie came out. This might seem like an arrogant line of thinking, but I'm really just thinking out loud. See, I too grew up with the original Scream, to me it's a classic. I like Scream 2 as well, in fact seeing it for the first time happens to be a great movie memory for me. I can even say I enjoyed Scream 3, though it was flawed. The way I see it, Scream 4 has got the same edge and idea that the original Scream movie had. What was so great about the first one was the fact that it was a genuine post-modern satire. It wasn't just that the characters knew a lot of horror trivia - The point was that they almost knew they were characters in a movie themselves. I always saw the movie as big fourth wall-joke. As I said before, Scream 2 and 3 seemed to put its weight on the plot as if it took place in the real world. To me, the original Scream always took place in a half-real world where one minute you could buy the characters as ""real"" (Neve Campbell's presence did a lot of the work automatically) and the next you we're laughing at lines like ""Behind you, Jamie, behind you!""Basically, Scream was in on its own joke. That was what made it special. Scream 2 and 3 were pretty entertaining, and jokey, but they didn't have that same hardcore self-awareness. Thankfully, Scream 4 goes back home to Woodsboro once and for all. I think I felt the first REAL vibe of this delight when Gale early on quotes Randy by reminding Sid that ""everybody is a suspect"". Now, Mr Smartypants will say, how could she know that line? Why is she using it? Randy was saying it to the killers in the video store in the first movie, right?Well, she's saying it because she kinda knows that this is Scream 4, not real life. Just like the first movie it's kinda real, kinda movie. ""This isn't a movie!"" Sid says to the killer but to me, Billy Loomis line ""It's all a big movie, Sid"" is the essential quote of the series (or at least the first one, and this one). Of course, in 1996 it was creative enough to just make a horror film that knew it was a horror film. Scream 4 naturally has got to be a horror film that knows its a horror franchise. It doubles, triples... completely ""scr4ms"" the fun.Finally, Scream 4 was a nostalgic experience. I'm not referring to the movie itself. I'm referring to going to the movies, to see a horror film, and have some FUN again. After ten years of pretentious and depressing butcher house sadism (no, Saw isn't any good; not the first one either) its such a relief to see a slasher where one of the cheap shocks involves a dangling flower pot. It definitely falls under the Only-bad-if-you're-dumb-enough-to-take-it-seriously-category.",Scream 4

126,zac-04879,More Refreshing Slashings,6,25 August 2021,"Craven's fast, refreshing and extensively bloody return to the Scream franchise is either a weak or relieving surprise for the fans. Similar to the previous chapters, there's the return of the main cast, appealing new characters and Ghostface's brutal slayings. Due to these chief components, Scream 4 is pretty much exactly what the fans want.Also alike the past instalments, there's a fresh setting and new suspects. But despite the new survival rules and a big focus on horror movies, Scream 4 just misses the target. Somehow, it's just not as engaging or exciting as the other Scream movies. Of course it's quite likeable, but it feels like a bit of a letdown. The story is mainly just not too fascinating or interesting, and surprise, the characters aren't even as gripping as they used to be.At least it's much better than the disappointing Scream 3. And most fans will likely love how extreme and bloody the kills are. Ghostface is definitely much more rough and fearless in this slightly weak but decently watchable slasher.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Scream 4
127,MikesIDhasbeentaken,shpitspingboya,7,28 April 2011,"Scream is and always will be one of the best slasher films ever made.People will come back and say what about 'Halloween' or 'Black Christmas' (which is amazing) or even 'Peeping tom', as this film credits as the 'first slasher film'. I'm sure if i was around when peeping tom came out i'd have found it scary back then, but the fact is films have progressed, and people that moan that horror films aren't what they use to be need to realize that.Scream sparked a new era of slasher films, which was amazing... until scream 3. After that, the genre was dead. since then, clinging onto what i could get, as a lover of the slasher culture, i've found myself liking films such as 'fear island'!!... that would never have happened in the 90's. So when I heard the Scream franchise was returning, i was excited, but also worried it would turn out like the previous installments. I can tell you now, Scream 4 is a good slasher film, no matter what the pretentious twats on this site may say, you will keep guessing who the killer is and you will still be surprised.This film has what you expect, but unlike many films of the same class, it actually delivers. Yes the main characters are a little too old to be staring in a teen horror film, and courtney cox looks like she's melting into Janice Dickenson. also, the Hayden girl from heros, donning a mans haircut, and named after an 80's computer game, is very annoying, and your left hoping the future of the genre doesn't lie in her or any of her friends hands.All this aside, if you like scream... or any slasher ever made, you will like scream 4.

This movie is an excellent example what should not be done. Recycling waste may be good for the environment, but movies - no thanks. This movie recycles itself. It's like making a fourth cup of tea with the same (dry) teabag. There's nothing new or exciting or original in this movie, except for the(really) bad and unmotivated acting. Everything else you've seen before. There are so many movies which should never have had any thought of a sequel (or remake). Scream (1) is one of them. Don't waste your time on this one (as I did).

129,Aly200,How do You Survive a Remake?,6,9 November 2012,"Well Wes Craven's ""Scream 4"" answers that question with assistance from some old friends. First off is the return of Sidney Prescott to her hometown of Woodsboro as the last stop on her self-help book tour, but after 15 years her past returns to haunt her. Ghostface once again has come back to terrorize Sidney and her remaining family; her late mother's sister, Kate Roberts (Mary McDonnell) and her cousin Jill (Emma Roberts) and Jill's friends. Joining Sidney in the fight against the psychotic murderer are Gale Weathers-Riley and Dewey Riley who are stuck in an embittered marriage with Gale's career at a standstill and Dewey as the new Sheriff of Woodsboro. The film is a re-imagining of the original fright-fest packed with some frightening moments amid the drama. But the fact is that the film is a remake of the original brings down the impact of horror.

130,Jerique,What we've been missing...,7,15 April 2011,"This is the first time I've seen the Scream franchise on the big screen. I'm happy to say that this is the second best of the entire franchise.You know that movie everyone talks about when you go to a party? This is it. You and your friends can be happy talking about 'who killed who' in Scream 4. It can be your own theory. It can be plausible and it can be fun to discuss the possibilities of how and when.Scream 4 follows the plot of Sidney returning home to Woodsboro just when the ghostface killer comes back to the surface again. Neve Campbell and company return with a bunch of new faces to add to the table. Along with some funny puns, good old insults at the current remakes and reboots happening and the long-over-the-top Saw sequels, Scream is a horror delight. It follows suit with the original trilogy by being suspenseful, and full of memorable quotes. It doesn't do the horror clichés of needing to show nudity/sex to get the audience's attention or give a reason for a character to die.It does give a few annoyances, but I won't give away any of the details, to keep this spoiler-free. It does a good job of keeping in theme of Scream franchise, and I have a feeling we'll be seeing Scream 5 and 6 coming along soon enough. This is the thing we horror fans have been missing. Scream returns to form with this new addition and gives a little more hope to us movie-goers telling us that Hollywood has something else in their arsenal besides a remake, a reboot, or a sequel that is just made for money.

134,Toronto85,Scre4m,8,17 April 2011,"I probably had more fun watching Scream 4 then any of the other brilliant movies. That doesn't mean it's better than the others, because it's not. Scream 1 and 2 were amazing, and even part 3 had charm. But Scream 4 has a whole different feel to it. There was a sense of dread to the first three, and while the poked fun at themselves, Scream 4 takes ""spoofing"" to a whole different level. It has one of the most laugh out loud introductions to a horror flick that I've seen in years. It takes the idea of a movie inside of a movie, and uses it numerous time to ease the tension of the audience. Eventually, there are two high school girls murdered the day before Sidney Prescott is set to return to Woodsboro. She has written a tell all book about her survival from the original movies.Meanwhile we meet some more teenagers, one of which is Sidney's cousin Jill (Emma Roberts). They quickly get calls from the ghostface killer who - of course - asks them what their favourite movie is. They think it's a prank until they are told about the two students stabbed the night before. We also see Woodsboro favourites Gale and Dewey Riley. Gale seems to be struggling with small town life while Dewey is enjoying life as the town sheriff. Sidney meets up with them and they have a nice little reunion. But the film does a good job making us wonder what's going on with Gale. She see's Sidney getting all the attention with her new book, and it appears that she is very envious. Is it petty jealousy, or a motive to kill? Dewey meanwhile is getting hit on by his fellow police officer Judy (Marley Shelton) who frequently makes him lemon bars. When Gale is around Dewey, we see that Judy is definitely infatuated with him which almost mirrors Fatal Attraction. She adds to the suspect list quite nicely in a sly, Laurie Metcalf (Scream 2) kind of way. The two film buffs Robbie and Charlie (Erik Knudsen and Cory Culkin) are obvious suspects. The Scream films always send the message that horror contributes to a troubled mind. There are a few murders along the way, quite gory in fact. There was always tons of blood in the original films, but it is done overload in this fourth one. We see the wounds more clearly, including some organs as well.What I love about Scream 4 and all of the Scream movies is that anyone could be the killer. They are all suspects, even the survivors Gale, Dewey, and Sidney. There are some really well done stalking scenes as well, including the parking garage murder and the Stab-athon party at the old barn. And I have always loved the idea of the ""Stab"" movies which mirror the Scream series, once again using the movie inside of a movie idea. I won't reveal the killer's identity, but for me that was where the movie failed. If this was to be a Scream reboot of the series, that was a very weak way to go. The whole ending felt silly and made the movie not quite at the level the first three were.Scream 4 is a good movie in a different way then the first three were. They were truly horrifying scary movies, especially the first two. This one makes fun of itself, the previous sequels, and other horror movies at a great pace. The acting is very good. Hayden Pannetire who plays the horror loving Kirby makes the character very likable. Marley Shelton adds to the comedic role of Deputy Judy who mirrors Dewey from the original. Culkin and Knudsen were good as well, especially Erik Knudsen as film geek Robbie. Emma Roberts too, the whole cast did a very good and believable job.Scream 4 doesn't take itself seriously like the other three did, and that made it more fun to watch at the movie theatre. We were all laughing out loud at a rapid pace. Wes Craven does a good job at easing the tension before each murder scene by adding a little comedic quote or action to it. I liked it less then the other films, but on it's own it is a very good horror/comedy flick. You've got to check it out.8/10",Scream 4

Scream 4 is very much a comedy horror that's super meta and discusses many horror movie tropes within the characters dialogues. It's both suspenseful and hilarious with a lot of characters who are super dumb. It honestly makes fun of itself so much that I you can't help but remember Scary Movie scenes and then every serious moment just seems funny.

I don't know why anyone may actually like this but well, maybe the scene where drunk youngsters seem to enjoy similar slasher may help. I think it may take approximately six beers or one and half bottle of wine to actually start to like this mess. Or about six shots of whiskey, preferably administered in regular intervals to keep your IQ and expectations reasonably low.The suffering would be more bearable if it would fit into say 75 minutes. This would more than enough for all the new ""twists, turns and jokes"". The movie unfortunately spends almost two hours running in circles, repeating all the old clichés and adding one level of frustration over another one. Yes, we know from the start how this ends and we do know the killer is some unimportant clown with some absurd reasons. We know he will be eliminated, because it allows the series to continue in the same manner forever. The last ""surprising set of twists"" in the hospital has been seriously unbearable for me.Someone may think that it is somewhat funny if the authors add all the clichés in the order you expect in advance. You may feel, well, as an ""slasher expert"". This may be amusing for someone, ideally with the bottle of alcohol at the party. But as a standalone ""thriller"" it fails miserably - this ""thriller"" is not thrilling at all. It is just 2 hours big bag of old and boring tricks repeated again and again.",Scream 4
139,MJB784,The end of Scream,5,22 May 2018,I didn't find it scary or very interesting. The acting was forced. The characters acted like they knew they were going to die at the exact moment the killer was showing up and they usually did nothing to defend themselves.,Scream 4
140,dormesher-21565,Great return to form,9,2 March 2019,"Scream 4. My second favourite in the series and a great comeback for this series.
New Generation New Rules and this movie delivers on that promise.This focuses more the tropes of Horror Remakes and does brilliantly and is a fantastic return to form for the Scream series.Neve Campbell is fantastic in this one and proves she has still got it In her to play Sidney.
I also love every character in this one no annoying In this one again like the first two you care about these characters.This has my favourite opening to any Scream movie the whole Stab 6 and then Stab 7 fake out is just hilarious and the best meta moment in a Scream movie. Also the biggest surprise when watching it for the first time.The kills are alot more graphic in this one which is fantastic and the twist at the end with the killer reveal is brillaint I also love the fact it plays on the idea of the first film and does a remake of it playing on the deconstruction that has been In this franchise from the beginning.Unfortunately this would be the last Wes Craven would be involved in this franchise due to his passing and I have to say he missed he was one of the best directors in the business and he created characters that I just adore.
Creating this and A Nightmare On Elm Street just proves why I miss Him R.I.P Wes you truly was a legend and will always be remembered.9/10 a fantastic return to form for Scream and my second favourite in the series",Scream 4
141,Sober-Friend,Best Scream Sequel,8,10 May 2017,"This is much better then most horror sequels. This film has moments that ""Scream"" fans will get a huge kick out of. The story does go a little too crazy however at the end. It does perform as an excellent chapter in the ""Scream Series"". If you have never seen a ""Scream"" film that is okay. This film works on its own and you do not have too know anything of the previous films.In this film On the fifteenth anniversary of the original Woodsboro murders, high school students Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper are attacked and brutally murdered by a new Ghostface.The following day, Sidney Prescott returns to Woodsboro to promote her new book, Out of Darkness, with her publicist Rebecca Walters. After evidence is found in Sidney's rental car, Sidney becomes a suspect in the murders and must stay in town until the murders are solved. Sidney's teenage cousin Jill, who is dealing with the betrayal of her ex-boyfriend, Trevor Sheldon, gets a threatening phone call from Ghostface. She and her friends Olivia Morris and Kirby Reed, are questioned about their calls by Dewey Riley, who is now the sheriff of the town, while one of his deputies, Judy Hicks, assists him in the case. Meanwhile, Dewey's wife, Gale Weathers- Riley, is struggling with writer's block. She gives up the writing and decides to investigate the murder instead. This film was so good I ended up buying it. Now if your looking for something knew in this film then you will be so disappointed. If you want to see a film that will scare you then RENT THIS. I hope one day we will get a ""Scream 5""",Scream 4
142,PCC0921,Tone down the satire. Bring up the serious side.,8,3 October 2020,"To prepare myself for this film I tried my best to catch the other three Scream films before seeing this one. I think I saw all of them at one time or another, but I wasn't sure. I got the first film (Scream - 1996), through Netflicks, but was forced to see the second film (Scream 2 - 1997), through Verizon OnDemand, which sucked because I had to watch it in 4:3, lame. The third film (Scream 3 - 2000), I never got around to seeing, so my biggest question was how did Dewey (David Arquette), completely loose his limp from the second film. I seem to recall something about reconstructed surgery, but I'm not sure. Maybe someone can explain that to me.Anyway, this film opens up 10 years later. Dewey and Gail (Courtney Cox), are living together in Woodsboro now and Sidney (Neve Campbell), who looks great and hasn't aged a bit, is on a book tour about her nightmarish past. As you would expect, Ghostface returns and it's up to our heroes to figure out which two people are the killers this time.I was impressed by this film for a few reasons. First off, it seemed like this film toned down the frantic, satirical, silly side that the other films thrived on. This film felt more controlled and methodical and actually allowed you to breath a little. Also, Director Wes Craven updates the series by keying in on ""sign-of-the-times"" issues like webcams, Facebook and the Internet and tone doesn't fall back on the same old thing, so it actually felt fresh, like the first film. The opening sequence is exciting with great cameos by Kristen Bell and Anna Paquin. I have always felt that these 21st century slasher films are ok, but they can't hold a candle to some of the classic stuff like Psycho (1960), Halloween (1978), and Nightmare on Elmstreet (1984). This one was pretty good.7.7 (B- MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",Scream 4
143,colinrgeorge,Nineteen Ninety Now,5,18 April 2011,"Self-referentiality is the soul of the ""Scream"" series, but its fourth installment carries so much franchise baggage that director Wes Craven never really gets around to making a new movie. ""Scream"" and its sequels skewered then-modern genre tropes—a decade later the mind reels to imagine how the modern horror landscape might lend itself to parody. From the proliferation of ""torture porn"" to the endless deluge of remakes, one would think the 21st century meant easy pickins for satirists. But if ""Scream 4"" is any indication, the barbs are only as sharp as their inspiration.To be fair, the savvy deconstruction of cliché is still present in this addendum to the trilogy. Unfortunately, it's marginalized in favor of enriching ""Scream"" fiction. Instead of constructing a self-sufficient narrative, writer Kevin Williamson unfairly forces a cast of up-and-comers to contend with familiar characters that have a lot of catching up to do. As an audience, it's never quite clear who ""Scream 4"" is about.Naturally, Neve Campbell returns as Sidney, on tour with her New York Times best-seller when a flash of fatalities crops up in her home town. Instead of gracefully passing the torch to a new generation of snarky high schoolers however, she flimsily becomes embroiled in the bloodshed and subsequent media frenzy and police investigation. Enter Courteney Cox and David Arquette, reprising their roles as Gale Weathers and Dewey Riley respectively, and you might as well cut the new characters altogether.Which is a shame, because ""Scream 4"" might have worked better had the newbies been trusted with the spotlight. Williamson should have at least left his veterans more on the periphery of the story. Instead, he jumbles their reunion with the new tale he's attempting to tell and neither plays out satisfyingly. It feels like an eternity before the plot gains traction because our focal point is perennially being adjusted.Even once the masked antagonist shows up in earnest, ""Scream 4"" is an exercise in redundancy. Not only because it follows three prior ""Scream"" films, but because internally it fails to up the stakes. Encounters with Ghostface play out virtually identically from beginning to end, with a volley of phone calls, the inevitable bait and switch, and a gruesome death. Scares were never the series' primary concern, but at least the original never lost sight of the punchline. In ""Scream 4,"" I'm not even sure there's a setup.Part of the problem is that Williamson's stab at modern horror is tethered to an outdated formula. ""Scream 4"" is still a slasher, and Ghostface is a less topical villain then ever, especially when his would-be victims are dissecting Jigsaw. Several scenes manage to smartly pinpoint new clichés, but they have little bearing on the clockwork of the narrative, and you've already seen most if you've seen the trailer.Missed opportunities abound in ""Scream 4,"" which pitches new material but ends up trotting out a tired routine. Though it scores easy points with in-jokes, its hokey humor quickly grows stale. Instead of fostering a conversation that might prove why the franchise is still relevant, Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven seem content to remix their smash hit for a new audience. They make tiny modern concessions, but it's apparent the pair hit an artistic plateau back in the '90s. If this is their indictment of 21st century scares, our modern perverted sadists and Japanese ghost children got nothing' to fear.",Scream 4
144,Fields201,Something To Scream About,8,15 April 2011,"Scream 4 is the first film in my existence where I actually went to the theater and was able to see my hometown in a Hollywood film. That's pretty neat. Every area in this film was shot around me, and I been to a lot of the locations. I actually attended a wedding ceremony in one of the opening shots with the fountain. That was cool.With that aside, I did enjoy Scream 4 immensely. I was worried after seeing Wes Craven's awful My Soul To Take that this film was going to completely suck. It didn't. In fact, it felt like the franchise never got stale. Throughout the movie, just like the last two films, I kept hoping that they don't kill off Dewey or make him a killer... and I won't spoil that fun.The film centers around, once again, with Neve Campbell's character Sidney Prescott. She has a new book out and she reunites with Dewey and Gale. However, it doesn't take long for them to realize that the Woodboro's killings have returned, and yet again they have to protect Sidney from an unknown killer in the ghostface costume.The film is a lot of fun, and I like the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously. There were a few instances where the victims would say some random stupid thing before they die, and even though I full well know that no one would act like that before they die, it was still funny. The killings themselves are a lot of fun, in which this film is all about. There's even a scene where a girl gets brutally murdered next door, and probably the most gruesome kill in the whole series.The actors bring their A-game to the film, with some witty dialogue to boot. The phone calls from the killer is often pretty funny, as well. I also found some of the characters to be pretty likable this time around, which was something that was missing from the last two installments.My only beef with this movie is the lack of character development, especially for Sidney. For a movie to center around the main character, I really didn't feel like she was in the spotlight as much. After watching it, and if I didn't see the first three movies, I could have sworn this would be the Dewey and Gale movie, and Sidney was just a supporting role. Some of the other characters in the movie never really felt developed enough, either. I think it's because there was too many characters to begin with. I guess one more beef is that the ending felt too abrupt, and lacked any kind of resolution or epilogue. It just ends, which was disappointing because it really needed that one last scene. I guess they were running out of time.However, if you are a fan of the franchise or wanting to see a movie just for a fun time, then go see Scream 4. It's not as good as the first, but miles better than the last two installments. I also liked who the killer was. I didn't at first, until I saw where it was going and therefore, I'm satisfied with this film. I hope they make Scream 5. These are some fun movies.",Scream 4
145,mirwais-orbit,"Clichés are the new clichés, right?",7,19 April 2011,"Wes Craven has always stood out for being a director/writer responsible for creating or innovating the clichés in horror and thriller movies being somehow one of the fathers of a formula that we know for so long and also a reference in the genre for four decades in a row with titles such as The Hills Have Eyes (1977), Nigthmare On Elm Street (1984), Scream (1996) and Red Eye (2005). Now he's after his 5th decade of success.After director's two disappointing titles as Cursed (2005) and My Soul To Take (2010), and other bad attempts of writer Kevin Williamson, seems a lot appropriate for both getting together again to resume one of the most profitable horror franchises of the 90's.Scream (1996) was refreshing and no one can deny that. The first movie revived a genre that was long dead and drowned into clichés that were more laughable other than to feel that delicious shiver down the spine. The initial sequence of the movie instantly became a classic that technically was replayed endlessly not only in horror movies but also in many other genres. Scream 2 (1997) managed to do what seemed impossible having another initial sequence and also great thriller moments as well as the original although fatigue signs were appearing by the results of several copycat titles released after the success of the first film of the series. Scream 3 (2010) was a joke, perhaps for replacing Kevin Williamson by Ehren Kruger, a screenwriter who never was good and clearly knew nothing of what was the series about, not knowing at any moment how to keep the elements that made the first two movies something remarkable. Therefore, Scream 3 is absolutely forgettable because it was a product by the pressure from the fans and not because everyone involved really wanted to do it. Scream 4 always was in Wes Craven's plans because he always knew that Scream 3 wasn't what he or the fans were expecting. The constant pressure from fans together with the lack of other great works of the director, screenwriter and actors after the death of the series in 2010 made them all excited to make another installment in the best possible way. And so it was done. The film really brings a little fresh air to the genre once more, trying again to renew the obvious when saying that now the clichés are the new clichés and also showing to the public that doesn't matter how much they try to leave it, movies will never burst this secure bubble.This is the way Wes Craven has been working, because that was how he decided to end the Nightmare On Elm Street series, and this was the way he decided to end the terrible and relentless sequences of 'B' slasher movies that have popped in the 80's and 90's. So, what was left to Wes Craven? It was left to resurrect the genre that he once wanted to drown. But the new generation may have some resistance to accept this movie and not able to get its primal idea as happened in the 90's first of all because Scream (1996) and Scream 2 (1997) isn't impacting as it was at that time anymore because after the great number of inferior quality movies that just followed Craven's success the series may seems unoriginal for those who are not familiar to it. The new generation are now in another horror level after the exhaustive Scary Movie sequences that simply misrepresented in the most impossible silly way the intelligent satire atmosphere that Craven and Williamson already built with Scream series. In another hand we have the Saw sequences, which blood and free violence seems never enough, so... analysing by this point of view, yes... Scream seems a little out of date, and the new generation may not get it as it should. Which is sad, because the new generation doesn't know that what they are consuming today leads most to Craven and Williamson's credits.You cannot talk about the movie without spoilers and give a real review of it by now, but surely we can say that everyone is much more engaged than the previous one. Like any installments, Scream 4 is a sequence made for nostalgic fans and also to embrace a new generation and we will always been thinking ""it could've been better"", but comparing to other sequences, Scream 4 is better than the expected. It's not a pure horror movie but a movie that gives some goose bumps between one funny moment and another. Its initial sequence was thrilling, because we could feel that the series is back to its form because it is as good as the classical first one. Kevin Williamson seems a little rusty because he tries hard to give some complexity in a genre that never has it being a lot redundant instead. Also, the sequences somehow doesn't seem to have a real connection between them and seems like sequences placed together to make a movie. But anyway, as I said before, being the 4th installment, it's far better than expected. Like Wes Craven did in his last movies with Neve Campbel and Rose McGowan in Scream (1996) and Rachel McAdams in Red Eye (2005), now his young new artist of the time is Emma Roberts, she just gave a great performance in which the series was in need. Since many of the qualities of the first two movies are placed together again in this new attempt, the 4th installment may not have breath for a new trilogy in another new decade, but it's a great way to forget the 3rd-shame part and back up a genre that is cyclically being renewed thanks to directors like Wes Craven, but also cyclically dying thanks to directors who simply copy the same formula without any further interests.",Scream 4
146,Beyondtherain,"Very fun, almost just almost, felt like the original Scream.",8,3 July 2020,"Gorey, fresh, feels like the original films but the cell phones and internet obviously makes it a bit up to date... And the humor is half and half bad/funny",Scream 4
147,blacklist-1,The Scream franchise makes a most welcome return. It's time to scream again!,9,18 April 2011,"I saw the first Scream back when I was thirteen (I know I was far too young!). I can't actually remember if I enjoyed it or not at that time, but what I do know it that it scared the heck out of me. And from then on that night of first viewing it I had nightmares for three weeks straight. I used to imagine where I lived that when I came out of my room at night to go to the bathroom, Ghost-face would be round the corner wearing his black cloak, with the ghoulish white mask and the silver stabbing knife waiting to gut me. It was pretty freaky, ha ha. Anyway years later when I actually turned eighteen I decided to watch the first one again and thought it was excellent. Since then I have watched that and Scream 2 and 3 numerous times. (In fact I watched the first three again in order recently to familiarise myself with the stories and characters again in preparation for Scream 4.) What initially attracted me to the Scream films (when I watched the first one again when I was eighteen) and I'm sure it did for the millions of other fans of these films is the parodies in humour of the horror clichés. And how they were looked at in an intelligent and witty way, thanks to the terrific script in the first two written by Kevin Williamson. But it did more than that. In particular Scream 2 director Wes Craven even dared to admit that movie violence (not forgetting Hollywood in the film made the movie Stab based on the original Woodsboro murders) can inspire real violence, which I thought was imaginative and mature. Wes Craven also in the first two in particular managed to generate real suspense, tension and general horror at the murders as they built up in pace, mainly in Scream 2 because the characters know the clichés and watch out for them, which makes them all the more vulnerable. You got sense that young lives were being wasted (I mean you come to care about the characters).After Scream 3 which I thought was the weakest of the franchise, but I still quite enjoyed it, it took a well earned rest and now it is back after ten years. Scream 4 has been hugely popular with most people who have voted on here giving this a 10 out of 10 and on the overall rating a 7.7. My hopes for Scream 4 were extremely high and it delivered. The basic synopsis is after ten years Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) returns to Woodsboro for her book tour and conveniently coinciding with the ten year anniversary after the original killings. She meets up with old friends Gale (Courtney Cox Arquette) and Sheriff Dewey (David Arquette) and ends up staying with her Aunt Kate (Mary McDonnell) and cousin Jill (Emma Roberts). There she comes into contact with friends of Jill and her ex-boyfriend Trevor amongst other characters. Of course again everyone Sidney comes into contact with and love is hunted and killed, though this time the rules has changed as the killer is filming the murders (amongst other rules). Like before Wes Craven expertly creates a tense atmosphere when there is a murder and keeps you constantly on your toes as I jumped quite a few times. The murder sequences still feel refreshed (as I was worried they would be repetitive) no small achievement, but as Wes Craven is the master of horror it's no surprise. Also I would like to welcome the return of Kevin Williamson (who unfortunately did not write the script for Scream 3). This time the script was excellently written with some witty one liners that were very funny. Like when Sydney says ""Don't f*** with the original,"" that is one of many. Also the film was beautifully structured with not knowing who was going to get killed and who the killer is as you suspect everyone. The twist though with the identity of them is very surprising and I did not see it coming. The acting was great amongst the cast as well. Campbell and the Arquettes were great as usual but the new generation cast held themselves extremely well particularly Emma Roberts as Jill, she was superb. In the end Scream 4 should please most fans of the franchise (though not everyone as demonstrated on here) and anyone who is a genuine horror fan. I loved it and can't wait until Scream 5 (as there is apparently going to be one). It should be interesting how they do it, but can they do it? Or should they just stop here? Well that's debatable, but in my opinion the fourth one is on par with the first Scream and certainly more entertaining than the third. Craven and co definitely deserve that chance. In the meantime until then keep screaming!",Scream 4
148,krycek19,Boring and predictable,2,22 August 2011,"Take everything that worked in the first two movies, replace that with a boring story, replace the interesting well acted psycho killers of the two first movies played by Skeet Ulrich and Timothy Olyphant and replace them with a killer who is a hysterical annoying teenage girl who craves fame enough to kill for it. And then you have Scream 4. A snooze fest with more graphical murders but that does'nt make up for the boring story, the complete lack of suspense and the overall annoying new cast, that I had a hard time telling apart and rooting for. Especially the teenage girls. Except for the annoying bitchy Ruby but that's only because she has short hair.I'm glad I borrowed a copy of this movie from a friend and did'nt waste money seeing it.See the two first movies instead. They're classics and the original Scream at least has scary moments. Like the opening sequence and the end of the movie.",Scream 4
149,tequila101,"""Do I sound like a Trevour to You?""",8,19 April 2011,"Wes Craven still has it. Once upon a time, a film in 1996 called Scream and a sequel called Scream 2 came out. Scream 3 then arises but failed miserably from re-cycling sh**t from Part 1. Now in 2011, we get a flashy gem with some humor called Scream 4.I actually thought it was an OK film. Once again Wes Craven is very smart in fooling the audience with many different scenes, new antics, over the top, outrageous gore and cunning kills. It's still very smart when it gets into it. I don't find it to be better than the first Scream but it is better than 2 and it is a major improvement over 3.This 4th Installment is excellent because a new leaf has turned, we have old and new characters which are likable and we now have clean story with a clean slate. I'm not giving any spoilers or anything away cause you have to see it.All I have said above adds up everything that there was a lot to like. I only have one problem is that it wasn't scary, still proving that Horror movies can't scare. The mystery was also dying towards the end of the film which was ashame but oh well.Not much negativity on this. A massive improvement over the 2nd and 3rd.8/10",Scream 4
150,cadillac20,Good Sequel to a Great Series,7,15 April 2011,"It's been 11 years since Sydney Prescott graced our screens, but somehow the time seems right for her return. For all intents and purposes, Sidney is the last great slasher heroine, joining the ranks of Nancy and Laurie. With all the stale horror films going around, it does seem like the perfect time for a new Scream, which once redefined the slasher film and gave the genre a much needed adrenaline shot. And for the most part, Scream 4 does it's job.So, briefly, Sidney returns to her hometown, Ghostface re-appears, new cast of teens die by the blade, another Scream film. What can I say, Scream is Scream. What you could always count on ten years ago, you can count on in this film, and then some. The series is still good at playing up the emotional factor and making the teens both sympathetic and organic. Sure enough, here, the cast feels real. They aren't cookie cutters getting mowed down one at a time. They're a mixed bag and it certainly helps things. Above all, these are enjoyable characters. Sure, they're staples of the slasher franchise, but you actually care about them, which is nice for a change.But, as I said, Scream 4 gets the job done. This film, by far, has the biggest body count. It's mostly stabbings here, nothing Final Destination creative, but satisfying for the horror buff, even a little refreshing in an old fashioned kind of way. The scenes are also effective, preying on typical trappings, using the realism of the franchise, expertly placed positions, and a few jump scares here and there to keep you on your toes. Never Campbell and Courtney Cox are highly enjoyable, though David Arquette is not quite as entertaining as he once was. New performances that really stand out are Hayden Panetierre as the new Randy-esque horror buff, who wit and humor make her very entertaining, and Emma Roberts who gives a great performance as Sydney's cousin. There are also plenty of nods to the past films and plenty of talk about where horror is today. The film does have it's pits, with both the killer reveals and motives being fairly weak, especially in comparison to the other films. However, it mostly saves itself by being relevant to the direction of the horror genre today and by having a deeper message about society as a whole. The film brings up some interesting points, and as a separate slasher film, it might be even more justified. As a Scream film, it's arguable if this is indeed the best sequel, but it is still highly enjoyable and as a slasher film in general, it's a very good one.Fans of the Scream franchise may come away a bit disappointed. The film doesn't recapture that same magic as the first film. However, as a slasher film in general, and even as a sequel, it's a very well made film. Craven aptly directs it, proving he still has the touch. This will certainly be known as one of the better horror films in the past couple years.",Scream 4
151,Minus_The_Beer,"Let's Face it, Baby: These Days, You Gotta Have a Sequel!",6,4 October 2011,"When the ""Scream"" trilogy wrapped itself up nicely at the turn of the century, it seemed like it was one of the few franchises that would stay down. Well, money talks and certain other things walk and here we are in 2011 with ""Scream 4"" (typeset ""Scre4m""). Once again directed by Wes Craven and scripted by Kevin Williamson, this fourth installment in the teen-slasher series/pop-culture phenomenon brings the core cast of Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox-Arquette and David Arquette back to Woodsboro for yet another round with Ghostface.It's more than ten years later. Everyone's a little older, a little wiser. Dewey and Gale, like their real-life counterparts, are now married and settled into small town life in their hometown of Woodsboro. Finishing the last leg of her self-help book tour, Sidney returns to her old stomping grounds, sans demons and visions of dead mothers. Faster than you can say ""I'll be right back!"" local kids start dying off in a familiar fashion and before long it's up to our heroes to take a page from the younger generation (consisting of Rory Culkin, Hayden Panetierre and Emma Roberts) and try to figure out the new rules of the genre and put a stop to whoever is the Ghostface de jour.The film takes plenty of well-deserved jabs at the horror genre's current obsession with remakes and faceless torture fare, but never does it acknowledge its own short-comings. As fun as a reunion of the ""Scream"" crew is, the whole feels recycled and surprisingly formulaic. Sure, the humor is there (and kept in check much better than in ""Scream 3"") and the kills are as surprising as they are grisly, at least by teen-slasher standards (a return to the original ""Scream""). Regrettably, the film never breaks from the formula set by the original trilogy which makes bringing it back to life at this stage in the game a bit of a cheat. Sure, the generation that grew up with ""Scream"" being their ""Friday the 13th"" will find much to celebrate with the belated sequel and of course it's a boatload of guilt-free fun, but once you get past the surface, ""Scream 4"" is exactly the kind of film Randy from the original film(s) would have torn to ribbons.",Scream 4
152,MovieProductions,"Inconsistent, messy, ""Scream 4"" is just a cut above average",6,18 April 2011,"**1/2 out of (****) Being a die-hard horror junkie, and ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2"" holding a soft spot in my heart, you'd think ""Scream 4"" would do the same. Eh, not so much. This highly anticipated installment made by horror legend Wes Craven, is undoubtedly better than his atrocity known as ""My Soul To Take"". And maybe even a cut above ""Scream 3"". However, don't expect classic Craven. Don't worry, I miss that guy too. Okay, maybe I'm being a tad harsh. I actually liked this movie, and think that it's actually better than some of the garbage that's poured onto the screen now-a-days, but it's just that I know Craven can do better. The acting? Our ol' pals Sidney, Gale, and Dewey are all great, and their characters have evolved for the better. How are the folks? They can act, but god were they annoying. Hayden is okay, but sometimes she feels out of context. Emma is alright. Not the greatest. And lastly, Trevor and Rory were just annoying. I seriously didn't care what happened to them. Zero development.The script? Still pretty clever, and Williamson still shows his colors in his writing, but at times the film is pretentious. It is so self absorbed that at times I wished it was a generic slasher. Ironically though, it felt like a generic slasher. Typical screams, typical chase scenes. The kills? Craven wasn't kidding when he said it was the bloodiest of the four. The body count has increased, the kills are more grisly, and makes ""Scream 3"" look like Bambi.Anything the film improved on that the others didn't? ""Scream"", definitely no. ""Scream 2"", no. ""Scream 3"", yes. What works here that didn't in the third is that the climax is more engaging, the kills are more satisfactory, and the film kept my interest throughout. Also, the social media topics were very indulging. All in all, it sounds like I hated ""Scream 4"". I didn't. I actually sort of liked it, but Craven could do better. The man is seriously a genius. Having both ""Scream""'s and ""A nightmare on Elm Street"" on your resume certainly doesn't hurt, but having ""My Soul To Take"" surely does. I say stick with a matinée. I think it's more deserving of a rental, but not satisfactory of a full price.",Scream 4
153,80sHorror,Something worth SCREAMing about,10,20 November 2011,"I was a big fan of the first two SCREAM films when they were released in the early 90s, the mix of suspense and horror and the fact that the characters were all aware of the conventions of horror films and as a result all thought they knew a sure way of out-smarting their killer. However the third film was a serious let-down, the acting seemed poor and the story was a dull recycling of some of the worst bits of the first two. But SCRE4M is completely different, it is the conclusion to the series that the third film couldn't muster and a must-see for anybody who loved the first in the series and anybody who enjoys a good thriller. This film is a great example of what can be achieved within the horror genre, and it shows up the ridiculous remakes that studios are currently churning out thinking that they will be good enough to satisfy horror-fans.WOW it's already be 10 years since the last Scream movie was released how crazy is that? Anyways i must say this is one of the Best of the Scream Movies, It has lots of murders and a lot more blood and gore than the other Scream Movies. So in this movie Sydney is back to her hometown her last stop in promoting her new book, but as soon as she hits the town people have been killed and everyone including Sydney is a suspect but after the killers identity is revealed you will be in for a HUGE shock for who it is... I'd give this film 10/10 star!!!",Scream 4
154,themissingpatient,"Fun, twisted fun!",9,16 April 2011,"To the younger generations of movie reviewers: Take the stick out of your ass before watching this movie! Thank you.Scream is Wes Craven territory. It's comedy-horror, it's suppose to be twisted fun and that's what this is. Unlike the 3rd film, this didn't try to insult our intelligence with over-the-top gags and an overly serious ending. This film stayed very true to the first two films and yet, at the same time, did not feel like just another sequel. Having the ten years between really made this a one of a kind, intimate experience with these three unforgettable characters. The fear for their lives was as real as the first time we met Sidney, Gale and Dewey.The entire films was and stayed tongue in cheek and for a sequel, it was just as refreshing as the original.Hands down to directors like Sam Raimi, Robert Rodriquez and Wes Craven, for making horror movies fun!",Scream 4
155,edwardrevans,I give it eight because,8,22 April 2011,"Movie wise 8 is a high score normally reserved for the top end of the films that one is likely to see, so why 8 ? Well the clever thing about this film is that its self referential and a parody not only of its self but the horror genre in general. Scream4 and its makers have learnt a lot in the 10 years they have been away and realise that we live in a more technical world and this is used as a plot device quite well. Its also nice to see the 3 original cast members back too which without them the movie just wouldn't work. I also felt that there was plenty of satire in the movie reflecting the nature of todays movie business with not only remakes of perfectly good films but the constant sequels too. This is a fine reboot of a really good franchise but not sure if they can move it on for a Scream 5 ?",Scream 4
156,rebecca-ry,A decade later....,7,2 June 2012,"'Scream 4' is the much anticipated sequel to the Scream series which finished ten years ago. The acting is fine, the new characters are probably the best so far in the series, despite them all going to die anyway as with the rest they are certainly not wooden and show a real capability when it comes to acting. Like the first film it has went back to a slightly more black comedy type of movie. The script was better than I had expected the clever decision to have the killers think of this as a remake of 'Scream' was interesting and put a new twist to the story. The beginning can be a bit confusing at first mainly because it is supposed to confuse. The endless references to the 'Stab' movies can be a bit tiresome but they have a central role in the story so I guess they are necessary. The ending was not predictable and did shock people but at the same time there were some scenes which were entirely predictable. Overall, this is a decent sequel and an amicable addition to the 'Scream' series. Don't watch this film if you have not seen any of the other ones, despite it being set ten years down the line it still refers to the other films' events throughout. This is a very good film but I think it should be the last in the series, despite its great reception it could easily be ruined with the making of another film.",Scream 4
157,IamROCKAS,A good jab at all the horror movie remakes,7,21 July 2020,"More of a cliche movie than a commentary on cliche movies but I appreciate how Scream 4 corrected the tone of the series after Scream 3 strayed too much towards comedy.It came out when everything was being rebooted, horror franchises included, and, being meta as always, this movie kind of takes a jab at the reboot frenzy and introducing us to the rules of horror movie reboots. Though I'm not sure where the fact that you have to be gay to survive a horror movie reboot comes from. Maybe I just haven't watched enough reboots but that just seems a bit forced into the script.",Scream 4
158,sammielimehouse-84658,A Surprisingly Good Revival of the Series,8,15 August 2021,"This film was better than it had any right to be. Usually, horror revivals/remakes don't go too well, but this was actually a good slasher flick. I really like how this movie incorporated new technology into this film and the new characters, which are actually pretty good (especially Kirby and Jill). I guess if I had a complaint about this movie it'd be the weird, greasy filter they slapped over it and that none of the characters of the original trilogy were killed. Both Sidney and Gale were attacked and they both survived, while Dewey didn't really have anything to do with this entire movie. That fakeout ending was amazing, though, and on my first watch, I genuinely thought that Sidney was dead. Overall, this was a great continuation of the franchise, which was way better than I thought it'd be.7.7/10.",Scream 4
159,mdnobles19,Yet another poor attempt to cap off the series or will there be more?,5,17 April 2011,"The best sequel yet? Not even close and like a character says at the end don't fu!ck with the original and also in this case the trilogy! The opening of this film was almost a complete spoof an insult of itself with horrible acting from two actresses who are Aimee Teegarden and Brittany Robinson who probably got cast because they were hot and that's it and like Sidney says in the original classic they are just some big breasted girls who can't act who always runs up the stairs which they should be going out the front door it's insulting and yes it is indeed. I did kind of like the Kristen Bell and Anna Paquin bit it was entertaining but in a Scary Movie way but they completely under used Lucy Hale and Shenae Grimes who were actually good and believable and likable in their parts and didn't force it but they're not even real characters in the actual film oops did that just slip out, who cares. The film reintroduces us to the main characters Sidney Prescott, Dewey Riley and now Gale Weathers Riley but took a little bit too much time I mean tell us something we don't already know people but Courtney Cox brings her A game and is the highlight of that bunch David not so much and Neve just looks bored and I don't blame her! The new characters were OK Emma Roberts surprised me here and she goes bat sh!it crazy never seen that side of her it was entertaining to an extent but I really liked Hayden Panettiere as closet film geek Kirby that naming all the remakes bit was priceless and kind of sad because of the state of horror movies now, Marielle Jaffe as Olivia was good eye candy but the rest are not worth mentioning. The kills are bloodier but not really inventive and where were the suspense and chase scenes when you wanted them it's just ghostface shows up and you die that's it and some of them were cheesy like one victim saying ""f!uck Bruce Willis"" after being stabbed in the head, lame but the parking garage part with Sidney's publicist was great! The reveal of the killer or killers was a bit shocking but in a bad way and wasn't convincing at all and the hospital scene was just hysterical in a Black Christmas remake type of way, too silly like one character says, you're right again! I just can't believe how bad this movie ended up being for me I mean this is Wes and Kevin's worst collaboration since the god awful Cursed maybe this was heavily cut too because some sites say that it's 1 hour and 43 minutes while others say 1 hour and 53 minutes or something maybe I saw the bad cut but I bet both are just as bad. This movie poked to much fun at itself that it pretty much becomes a sad and pathetic parody of itself and that pisses be off because I love the Scream series and people are saying that it's better than the third one not really maybe darker but that's it and I know it's Wes Craven's film so he can do what he wants with them but why would you shoot yourself in the foot like that and butcher your own series it's almost like an cop out in a way and you officially need to retire now because this ain't no New Nightmare and you lost my faith and your touch it was great while it lasted. Kevin Williamson still kind of has the witty edge still when it comes to writing and I like how they were hating on remakes and reboots and technology in general how anyone can get famous off sites like youtube etc. but it shows that the other writer from Scream 3 did some rewrites for sure and that's probably when the cheesieness came in and it had a fair share of those. Another thing I want to say is that some parts from the previews weren't show in the actual film or the picture shown below and that's probably why because it was cut and edited for the worst what a shame and false advertisement. Overall the worst sequel of the bunch and I'm a avid fan of the series but they completely missed the mark with this one and it's an embarrassment and sad state for the series that once was hip, innovative, suspenseful, scary, fun, witty but it's just a tired old joke now unfortunately and for peeps sakes no more Screams after this one, you guys did enough damage already. Not recommended!!!!",Scream 4
160,cezbanbelubo,nice,6,2 June 2020,This movie is nice. ok but not wonderful. not is horrible,Scream 4
161,WasiReviews,Scream 4 is a Great Reboot,9,10 March 2021,"I have to defend my rating of Scream 4 as I know many people hated this reboot. When you're rebooting a franchise that has been dead for 11 years you have to take extra care to make fun of every horror reboot trope you can think of because this is a Scream film after all. After the disaster that was Scream 3 we finally get a return to form by Wes Craven, the worst aspect of the movie is probably the lack of realism; this is a heavily romantic film. I don't mean romantic in the sense of smooching between David Arquette and Courtney Cox, I'm talking about the fact that 50 police officers can't catch a serial killer that kills his victims with a prop knife that gimmick might've worked in the late 90s and early 2000s but in today's surveillance state there's no way! Ghostface wouldn't last longer than 3 days especially in Los Angeles. Now looking past the negatives (way too much self-referencing, some bad characters, and sequelitis), we can talk about the good aspects, and oh boy are there a lot of good aspects. First off I love, love, love the new characters in the film (some of them), the short-haired blonde girl Hayden Panettiere was cute and likable for me, and the fact she wasn't the killer surprised me and made her death all the more heartbreaking. Anthony Anderson as the dumb cop was hilarious for the first 30 minutes of the film especially his death although I wish that was on screen. Emma Roberts as Sidney's niece was sweet for like an hour and a half of the film and I did not see the reveal coming. I'm not sure if it was intentional but all of the character names are based on the real-life actors and actresses' names which isn't funny but it's much easier to keep track of their names.
We start the film off with an incredible intro that may be one of my favorite horror movie intros. We wake up in Stab 7 that references Stab 6 then finally back to real life where two friends get hacked to oblivion. In the first half of the film, there was a bit where Emma Roberts and Hayden were stuck in Emma's room while across the street their best friend and neighbor gets slashed in a scene so obvious it will make you facepalm although the gore is great and the most realistic and ambitious of the franchise especially after watching the PG-13 blood in Scream 3. We go through Shaun of the Dead references a publicist of Sidney's dying in high octane and scary parking lot scene we get arguably the best scene of the movie where Courtney sets up cameras then all of them turn off Courtney goes to investigate and we get a fight scene where we think she's going to die but she doesn't. Finally, we get the seemingly final battle between five teenagers, Ghostface starts picking them off one by one and we get a hilarious scene where he is about to kill a high schooler that is recording his life (Wes Craven has no idea what teenagers do), and he says that he's gay in a horror movie so he can't be killed but Ghostface kills him anyways the joke was spoiled for me but I still laughed at my screen. We're at Hayden's house, 3 / 5 of the kids die including the video streaming gay dude, Jill's boyfriend and Hayden. One of the video streamers is Ghostface and the other Ghostface is Jill Roberts which surprised me apparently she killed them all for notoriety by becoming the teenage queen girl that saves the day kills the guy in the Ghostface mask framing her boyfriend all in an elaborate scheme to become famous. This was a great plotline and incredibly unique; she even goes as far as to smash her head and make it seem like she was assaulted and acted in self defense. The more I thought about this movie the more I liked it, after initially watching this film I was like at a 6 or a 7 out of 10 but upon further reflection I was thinking about what I could find wrong about the film and I decided you know what it's an 8, it deserves an 8, screw the consensus I f with this film.A few critics and fans wanted Sidney Prescott to finally die at the end of the film where her niece Jill Roberts (Emma Roberts) seemingly kills her but oh wait guys Wes Craven saves her through plot armor somehow she wakes up and fights off her cousin after arriving at the hospital almost dead. Then crazy stuff happened. A defibrillator started flying, it felt like an action movie. It was freaking awesome. Then Sidney lives so a sequel can be made but oh wait Wes Craven dies the same year which means we have to wait until 2022 for the sequel directed by some other dude, my only disappointment about there being a fifth movie is the fact they killed all and I mean all of the new kid characters which means the next movie will have to reboot the reboot with an entirely new cast in the same city for the fourth time.",Scream 4
162,trnjamesbond,"Scream series, MPAA Madeness!",1,5 October 2011,"First of all this series was developed in the era of MPAA superiority. (motion picture association of America). They were the rulers of every film, this actually created releases known as ""Directors Cut"", and also why there is such a genre in DVD and Blu-ray releases.The MPAA outlawed everything in the 80's and 90's when it came to showing nudity or gore(while filmed in the USA, but in other countries they had no power while American directors made films. Why do you think there are so many independent films made today?) This ""SCREAM"" series as we all know to be, didn't show any nudity, or gore as we know it today(maybe a lot of blood but nothing more), Scream 4 seemed to continue us from how we left off, with the original ""Scream"" films, but years later, making us feel like nothing had ever changed. This film offers us what we call PG-13 Horror rating, which seems to cut everything that is supposed to be gory in this style of film. I know this supposed to be a ""Who done it!"", mystery film, I personally call it ""Who Cares!"" And now we begin my review...................... Come on Wes! Your the creator of ""The Last House On The Left"". Yes as a horror fanatic I got your humour of this technological time we live in, while watching this film.But I just got the impression that you must dupe the audience three times, or whatever how many times we see a fake scene at the beginning! This idea is stupid! Scream 2, well, this is just fine with me, except for the popular ""Rosanne"" throw backs starring Laurie Metcalf, she was cool on television, and acted excellent in ""Scream 2"", but.... this in itself made the film cheesy and outperformed, because of Laurie Metcalf's popular face at the time. But then part 3 happened, after this mess, this was it for me! Then Scream 4 comes along, after time, once again trying to rehash old characters with a beginning that is fake within fake. Yes, I get it Wes, your making fun of ""pop culture beliefs"" this is just silly, and so is what they think of the history ""rules"" of slasher films, in this instalment. After seeing this film, I have no respect for this director named Wes Craven. None whatsoever! This film comes from a guy who directed the most horrifying documentary style film of it's time, along the side of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I think that he needs to get back to the basics, while he still has life left to live, considering how old he is.Wes Craven needs to shock us and out do the latest horror/gory films from today, he needs to impress us, and also out do such films like ""SAW"" and ""HOSTIL"" also ""MARTYRS"". These films really make us think about our daily lives and how we go about them. Wes Craven seemed to have done nothing inspiring since the first ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"". Where a group of hormonal teenagers are afraid of the nightmarish boogie man, that lives in their dreams. Then comes along his later film ""Shocker"" which was pretty cool for it's time, but he doesn't seem to have anything on ""old school"" directors like John Carpenter, with his masterpiece ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" which followed films such as ""Escape from New York"" and the unforgettable ""The Thing"" and the classic ""Halloween"". Craven has definitely cashed in on teenagers ever since ""Nightmare"" and took that as an example how to make films(and money. Yes, mostly money!). Making horror films isn't easy, as a fan of them, I suspect they are pretty hard to make, and I give all the credit to the people that are a process of this genre, but let's keep the ""Bubblegum"" out of the picture and move on, shall we? Scream 4, is nothing but a glossy version of it's own self, it does nothing but mock the intelligence of people watching it, all along while they think ""Why the F@ck am I watching this?"" This film does nothing but trying to rehash the original to a newer younger audience, it's nothing like the original, and should be marked as awkward and incoherent.I think in the end that Wes Craven has been bought out by Hollywood, and this fourth instalment is just another money grabber trying to make us dumbed down, and not let future ""Indie Filmmakers"" have their chance at the piece of the pie(who seem to have more talent than this ""hack horror writer"", that we know as Wes Craven. This is a sad day for horror film making, trying to make us feel stupid, when we are not a part of this kind of logic, we are much better than this ""bubblegum"" garbage force fed to us. We are not ""Candy coloured clowns"". This film also offers us nothing but, ""da da dee dumb"" older woman and more experienced vs. younger fan frenzy ogling chick in your face humour. How boring. This dumbing down, once again of it's current fan based audience is just appalling, and Wes Craven should be ashamed for bowing down to monetary gain. Too bad they mention the film ""Shaun of the Dead"" in Scream 4. (Which is a great original film and is a much more superior film than this one.)Scream 4, did nothing for me. Actually it just wanted me to jump into the stupid movie and murder the pathetic characters myself. (all of them good or bad!) I felt the same way while watching the ""Friday the 13th"" remake, which was filled with annoying, self righteous characters, that are too indulged in their own selves. This film had the same feeling for me.",Scream 4

164,drawlife,"An improvement, but it's showing it's age.",6,4 September 2015,"The opening sequence hooks you in immediately and it's brilliant. With Kevin Williamson back as the sole writer, any Scream fan feels at home. It just feels like Scream again. But even with that being said it's a tad bit disjointed, despite it being a little better than the third entry. There are lots of self-aware and meta references, poking fun at the endless amounts of horror sequels that have came out as well as reboots and remakes, and while they're great, the film perhaps depends on that a little too much, to keep the film's momentum going or to keep people on track. While the first two were a little more subtle in that remark, Scream 4 or Scre4m, whichever you wanna call it is a little more reliant in making sure you're aware of everything. This time around the cast is just as expendable and aren't as engaging. I liked them just a centimeter more than the cast of the third film, but thats not saying much. What I can say is that each of the new group of teens including Emma Roberts, Hayden Panettiere, Nico Tortorella, Rory Culkin, Erik Knudsen, etc., at least try to bring something new to the table, but you can't help but notice that they're trying to emulate someone from the original cast, making it hard not to compare them to the original characters. I'm surprised almost all of them ended up dying, considering fact that this film was originally intended to start a brand new trilogy. I did however liked Anthony Anderson, Adam Brody, and Marly Shelton as Sheriff Riley's deputies. The films looses some steam throughout the middle act, it has a hard time giving some depth to the new young group of teens, as well as expanding the main trio's roles. Not to say it wasn't done well, but a lot more substance could have been shown. Speaking of the trio, Campbell, Arquette, and Cox all play their roles well, at this point they can play these characters in their sleep. The finale is quite absurd. Not in a bad way. It's very shocking and out of left field. Craven and Willaimson keeps the guessing game going and it's quite fun, so the finale was a massive payoff. Finding out Jill(Roberts) and Charlie(Culkin) as the killers is something that I didn't expect. The whole showdown sequence is very reminiscent of the original Scream film so it gets some nostalgia points.I did enjoy Scream 4, but the franchise is clearly showing it's age. I don't expect another film to be made because it the film's somewhat mediocre returns at the box office, but as a Scream fan I'd like to see the story continue. Perhaps they can take the next approach like Wes Craven's New Nightmare, it could be a good excuse to bring back the original cast, where they can play themselves. Again I don't expect it to happen, but I'd like it to. Being that this is Wes Craven's last film before his death, I thank him for making a horror franchise where all four films are watchable and not complete garbage. So thank you Wes for that. Rest in peace. 6.4/10",Scream 4
165,austin-takahashi,Scream 4 - 2.5 Stars,5,20 March 2013,"""Scream 4"", also known as ""Scre4m"", knows its genre well enough to prove its superiority over the dumb horror films it proudly mocks, but it doesn't come close to matching the quality of some of the great horror films it celebrates. Considering the franchise's satirical nature, the past decade has provided director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson with much material to work with. The movie succeeds when it sticks to the self-aware antics that it's known for. Too bad this sequel often abandons this clever concept for ideas we've all grown familiar with.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), one of the survivors of the first three ""Scream"" films, has returned to Woodsboro to promote her new book. She unwisely decides to visit her hometown near the anniversary of the first Ghostface massacre. Since it was death anniversaries and her surprise visits that triggered the massacres, you would think Sidney would keep a safe distance from Woodsboro, but no worries. Upon news that a new Ghostface has started a killing spree, Sidney re-unites with fellow survivors, Dewey and Gale, who are now married. The mature age of the three has granted them a major advantage over the new generation of students. We all know that, in horror movies, adults have a lower mortality rate than teenagers.The best thing about this franchise is that it occupies a world that acknowledges the existence of horror movies and the people who are obsessed with them. Almost every horror flick made in the past 30-40 years takes place in a different time and universe where there are no horror movies that could serve as a lifeline to its young characters. As a result, teenagers would always commit the same mistakes that would get them killed, or raped, or eaten. For example, when a victim is chased in her house, she would immediately run up the stairs instead of going out the back door, trapping herself and assuring her own death. The characters in the original ""Scream"" were fun because it was populated by smart, informed teenagers who ended up dead because of a smarter, better-informed villain.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/scream-4-movie-review/",Scream 4
166,darkwizard404,Almost as good as the first one,8,29 October 2021,"After the disappointing Scream 3, this was a good addition to the franchise because it brought back the vibes of the original movie. The killings were gory and very well done. This movie focused on Sidney's extended family which is a great way to take the franchise ahead. The twists were great and unpredictable. The acting was very good and the pacing of the movie was great. Sadly this is the last Scream directed by Wes Craven who passed away in 2015. I'm eagerly looking forward to Scream 5 and I truly hope it turns out to be good.",Scream 4
167,SPaS,"Better than part 3, but a mixed bag. Worth a ticket, though.",6,18 April 2011,"Fresh out from the theatre, my initial reaction is ""meh"".I had been waiting for this ever since the Weinsteins announced it. Wasn't too keen on the idea of a whole new trilogy of ""Screams"", though. And after seeing part 4 I kind of hope parts 5 and 6 never materialize- unless they can do better than this.The biggest problem here is lack of fluency. Seems like Williamson had collected these suspenseful little scenes that played out a bit against his ""old rules"" in order to be fresh; along with comments about remakes, sequels and changes in pop culture and media in the 11 years since the last Scream. All good material for a script, but it all seems to be more or less crudely ""hammered"" together. Craven's directing is as good as in parts 1 and 2 (thus far better than in part 3), but the movie still has kind of a ""stop and go"" feel.Also, the movie doesn't seem to happen in the ""Scream 1"" - reality but instead in the ""Friday the 13th part 19"" - land where people don't seem to realistically relate to the situation of a killer on the loose, or be affected by deaths of neighbours, friends or local kids. Everyone's quoting horror movies, naming clichés and talking to killers on phone when they should be getting out of town, buying pepper spray or at least staying in groups; and every once in awhile reminding themselves that instead of something supernatural, the bad guy is just a person with mental disorders in a suit. You can almost say it's ironic how Scream 4 has somewhat turned into the very thing Scream 1 was made to make fun of.However, despite being uneven Scream 4 carries to the end. It drags here and there, but there are also some good scares. And as a whodunit it works; the identity of the killer remains a mystery up until the end.So there you have it.",Scream 4
168,LinkGoku,about as good as number 3,7,18 October 2011,"Scream 4 starts off with an amazing opening scene.But then it started to just be the same type of movie, it was really predictable and the end wasn't anything amazing.Kevin Williamson returned to write though his ending was removed and instead they went with Ehren Krueger's ending.But it was still really fun and gory.Also the cast all did great. I loved the additions of Anthony Anderson, Adam Brody, Hayden Panettierre, Rory Culkin, Erik Knudsen, and even Heather Graham.Definitely see it.",Scream 4
169,Tender-Flesh,Re-inventing the Meh,5,15 April 2011,"So, here we go again with the re-inventing of the genre and all that nonsense talk. This movie was incredibly predictable. I won't give away the killer's identity. And it doesn't really matter at this point in the series. Now, the writing is more about ""oh my gosh, who could it be THIS time?"" and less about how can we make this terribly weak killer, Ghostface, into something as scary as our other standard beloved slashers. While you're so wrapped up in thinking about who is on-screen the same time as Ghostface to rule out potential killers, you sort of forget that this story is absolute garbage. It seems Craven is after laughs and in-jokes and ""Horror Trivia Night"" than actually doing something different for a change. He and George Lucas must drink together a lot.To try and be brief, Sidney is back in town promoting her book. Dewey and Gale are back, with plenty of painfully obvious references to their real-life actors' relationship issues. Then we have a series of throw-away characters who you immediately don't care about upon meeting them because YOU KNOW by now that they are all meat. So, once again, someone is parading as Ghostface since Sidney is back in town, and it's the anniversary of the killings and all that bunk. Really, Neve, Wes, Courtney, and David need to pay their rent, so you get a substandard flick with pretty much no surprises, aided in its own downfall by a music-stab(get it?) film score that is constantly tipping its hand to practically beat you over the head to know a scare is coming.Now, to the killings themselves: totally unimaginative. Simple as that. Ghostface is a one-weapon sort of guy. Now, while constant reminders are thrown at you, via lame trivia, about what weapons other famous slashers use, any fan worth their salt knows that it is the primary weapon, but other instruments of doom are also used to great effect in the other films. And the copious blood in this movie is so dark it's almost black ink. It's very sad to think Craven and Williamson are going to make another trilogy out of this garbage. They will, unfortunately, never learn that Ghostface is not a scary killer. He's annoying because he's always someone new, and his motives are beyond stupid. The ending to this film cements that.Craven needs to learn a little something about what re-inventing the genre means. We are riddled throughout the film with tidbits of Horror 101, wherein practically every run of the mill movie is named, with only a slight reference to Peeping Tom being thrown in to make the average viewer think, wow that's darn obscure! I'm sick of the re-inventing gimmick when all we get is the same old trash. Here is a tip for Wes: learn the true meaning of horror-of-personality. You want a truly scary character? Take away his motive. The motive is what humanizes that character so that, even if we don't feel sympathy for them, we can fully understand why they started a killing spree, even if it's the dumbest of reasons, ie, this film. Now, Wes, imagine a man who has a job, a family, hobbies, a life in the suburbs, and he can go and brutally kill just because he wants to. The police would never find him. I think back to Max Von Sydow playing Ming the Merciless. When asked why he would want to destroy planet Earth, he replies, ""Why not?"" That's some scary horror right there. To have a character kill indiscriminately, breaking all the ""horror rules"" that Sidney and CO keep referring to: killing children, the mentally and physically disabled, the elderly, men, women, anyone. The killer doesn't have to be a zombie, like Jason, or a dream, like Freddy, or a crazed, deformed cannibal, like Leatherface, or a white-trash loser with mommy issues, like Michael. Just an average Joe who comes home from work, eats his spaghetti, goes out to the garage, gets an axe and goes into the soda shop and puts it right between your eyes. Then he goes home, has a beer, pets his dog, and sees what House is doing.Another tidbit for Wes: kill all your heroes. You want to give the audience something it won't see coming? He tried something similar by having semi-famous actresses get killed in the intro to Scream 4, only to be more nonsense from ""Stab."" But, remember back to 1996. Scream came out, but, so did Mars Attacks. Remember all the big name stars in that movie who got killed by the aliens? Now, while not a great movie, Mars Attacks did have some big balls to kill off major Hollywood actors who normally would never die in such numbers in a film. But, since Wes needs to pay the rent and you have a sawbuck burning a hole in your pocket, he's going to crank out a new trilogy off the same tired premise instead of going for the jugular and having a scene like ""The Raft"" in The Burning. Have Ghostface wipe out all the major cast, including the returning characters, halfway through the movie, in a single horrific scene of carnage. Then, have a couple of characters who already didn't have much screen time or any real connection to the plot have to solve the crimes, and make everything else come out of left field, but in a believable way, not really out of left field like throwing water on Ghostface a-la Signs.Now, whew, I didn't hate this movie, though perhaps it seems that I did. It was just more of the usual from Hollywood. Nothing surprising or shocking, and the attempts to circumvent horror rules backfired. I've seen way worse films in the theater. But, sorry, this is the last Scream I will be seeing on the big screen. From now on, dollar rentals for you, Wes.5.5/10",Scream 4
170,jonnyhavey,Stab: Are The 90s Still Cool?,6,18 April 2011,"After a decade of new age horror, Director Wes Craven's ""Scream 4"" audiences back to the cynical roots of the 90s horror franchise. The series has not lost its self-acclaimed satire and begins of a very familiar note. Two random teenage-aged girls home alone watching a scary movie are destined for death. However, this time around the viewer experiences this scene multiple times in a series within a series (known as Stab). Eventually the viewer finally sees the beginning of ""Scream 4"" consisting of two obvious killings. These are the first killings in ten years coincidently occurring after Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell, ""Scream 1-3"") returns to Woodsboro to promote her self-help book on the fifteen-year anniversary of the original killings. Old school news reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) is also back known for writing a book of her own about the Woodsboro Killings (The ""Stab"" series is Ironically based on the book). Gale is married to another returning character, Dewy Riley (David Arquette), who is the new sheriff of the town. New cast members worth mentioning include Sidney's cousin Jill (Emma Roberts, ""It's Kind of a Funny Story""), who becomes the alleged new victim and her friend Kirby (Hayden Panettiere, ""I Love You Beth Cooper""). The movie also includes a couple horror film geeks, some cops including Deputy Perkins (Anthony Anderson, ""Scary Movie 4""), and a few blonde bombshells including Rachel (Kristen Bell, ""Burlesque""). Events ensue as the creepy phone calls resurface echoing the renowned Ghostface question, ""what is your favorite scary movie?"" While the new killer may not be as ambiguous as its predecessors, Craven brings the paradox of horror to the new decade with a cast that must run for their lives to survive.The new cast embodies the shift in the horror genre and the transformation of the slasher film in the last decade. However, the old cast consisting of Campbell, Cox and Arquette run the show in the end redefining old school horror, while keeping in touch with their roots. The parody runs rampant trough the film making fun of almost every aspect only missing a couple chances. Ghostface has never been more violent and adds to the entertaining mockery of a blood bath that the film becomes. The laughs are there, the blood splatters and the purposeful generic dialogue and narration of each scene shows promise for a rebirth of the series.Viewers who did not like the original series probably won't like ""Scream 4"" either, however, as a viewer that always thought the series could have been better was fulfilled. The sad part is that ""Scream"" will never be more than just a B horror film because of its topical content and basic screenplay. It is a series that must be very careful about becoming the punch line to its own joke, which ""Scream 4"" barely escapes after a very slow start. The new cast fails to stand up to the original three and in the end cannot carry on the series on their own.",Scream 4
171,A_Llama_Drama,"Great opening, great closing, really rather bad in the middle.",9,4 September 2011,"Kevin Williamson, or Ehren Kreuger, must have paid attention in English class; open an essay with a strong introduction and close with a persuasive conclusion and you can be forgiven for the middle part (heck, markers hardly pay any attention to that part so what the Hell). This is the case with Scream 4. The not so anticipated sequel to the freshest slasher film of the 90s offers an opening so shocking that you'd think they've struck gold once again. Sadly, after an incredibly brutal murder a quarter of the way into the movie, it loses a lot of steam and becomes a confused puddle. It builds to a suitable conclusion and ends how it began but there are quite a few problems getting there.Craven's direction isn't as slick as it once was. He still plays with lights and shadows very well but the chase scenes (if that's what they're called) aren't half as satisfying or tense as, say, Sidney in Stu Macher's house in Scream or Nancy in her 3rd nightmare in the original Nightmare on Elm Street. He seems quite happy to get the murders out of the way as quickly as possible. His editing skills are also a bit out of touch - he's kept the most cringe worthy line of the movie in and thrown out a lot of (possibly) interesting scenes. He has forgotten to build suspense or present a feeling of foreboding; a total of 11 are butchered before the final party but at the rate they die and with the lack of any other outcome visible, you are left feeling a bit bored.The writing suffers from tampering. It's easy to see the differences between Williamson's script and Kreuger's. Williamson presents some sparkling, bitchy prose and finds the humour in the demise of characters. Kreuger takes a sledgehammer to subtlety and gives us closing lines like ""F*** Bruce Willis"" and ""I'm gay, if it helps?"" which effectively kill any suspense that could have been built. Kreuger also hasn't learnt to find inventive ways to kill people (you can see his murders coming a mile away and they all happen with such ease you'd think murder was easy). Majority of the middle comes from his pen which means majority of the kills are boring and uninspired. Apparently, 15 years after the original said ""Kids know their horror movies,"" they've all forgotten about the biggest clichés (don't leave a party on your own, don't play dead to spook someone, don't investigate a strange noise or think you're too old to be one of the victims). He also allows his killers to be revealed way too easily.The sound is another problem - Marco Beltrami's score in the original was hip, spooky and had some really nice moments. This time around, it seems Marco Beltrami was smacked by the wand of excess and has managed to fill out the original sound with so much junk that it's completely distracting. Horns herald the end of almost every single character whilst a choir chimes in whenever someone is giving their slow, death gaze.The return of Sidney, Gale and Dewey is handled well. Williamson uses them to flesh out his themes whilst allowing the younger cast to shine. Haydyn Panettierre as the bitchy, best friend steals most of her scenes until the finale where Emma Roberts really breaks out. The always cute Rory Culkin and Erik Knudsen make a good pair as the Randy substitutes but aren't half as cool as the film store geek. Marley Shelton gives deputy Hicks a creepy side that I never would have thought possible.The movie is cynical. Williamson is cynical. There's no doubt about it. He hates young people; he finds them stupid, callous and happy to make the same mistakes the older generations did. He hates horror films. He hates this movie. It manages to parody itself better than Scary Movie did. The older characters (Gale and Dewey) are taken out of the picture early and have trouble keeping up with the changed times. Sidney is as brave and thoughtful as ever, it's just a shame that the younger generation are too selfish to notice. Themes of ageing are presented with such cynicism, it must be that Williamson wrote the film for those of us who hate youngsters. He also hates critics - his comments on 'meta, post-modern bullshit' are exact and display his frustration over those who climb all over movie's meanings.In closing, the film manages to redeem itself with a killer reveal that beats out that of the 2nd and 3rd movies. Even if you did realise who the killers were a half way through the movie, the motive is sooooo twisted and cynical (there's that word again) that it makes the whole thing almost fresh again. A scene of self-mutilation is so shocking you have to laugh at it's audacity. There's also a nice 'meta' moment in the hospital where the killer remarks ""it was supposed to end at the house; this is just... silly."" There are some great ideas floating around at the end but it's closed a bit too neatly for it to have any real effect. This prevents it from becoming a rival to the original.The film, as a 4th in a series, is the best 4th in a series ever; it beats Hallowe'en 4, The Final Destination, Friday 13th part IV, Saw IV, Star Wars Episode 1, Scary Movie 4 and every other 4th part ever. But I think it's best that Scream goes out now. Williamson said he had planned a new trilogy but with the shape of the script, it would seem utterly impossible unless they did the exact same thing for 5 and 6. That would be a crime.",Scream 4
172,CalDexter,Not great like Scream and Scream 2 but far better than Scream 3,6,18 April 2011,"Scream and Scream 2 were out within a year of each other and made a box office killing at the cinema, so by the time Scream 3 was released, everyone , even the fans, found the film dull and predictable with even the revelation of who the killer was falling like a stone. The Trilogy ended on a whimper and not a bang.However I'm just back from Scream 4 and I'm happy to say the film is fun and entertaining, hooray for Ghostface! Back slicing and dicing. Wes Craven and Kevin Willamson make Scream 4 more interesting than Scream 3 because the potential victims are actually more impassive and desensitised to what happens around them in Woodsboro, here the script resolves around social commenting on how the Digital generation find out about the latest murder through their i phones, there's even a send up scene of the killer lurking within the cyberspace Network of Facebook which would have been an interesting concept if it had been the main plot of this fourth instalment.A lot of the film is just more rehash attacks of Ghostface pouncing on his victims, there are many comedy moments (as well as gruesome) as far as fourth instalments go, Scream 4 is mildly entertaining and laughably enjoyable.Cal",Scream 4
173,benjaminwest-242,A great addition to the franchise,7,27 October 2021,"Scream 4 is everything the audience wants it to be. The twists are thrilling, with new revelations that continually help create a more scary environment. The acting is solid, with good performances from the original and new cast, highlighted by Campbell and Roberts. The plot is exciting and convincing, impressively being less predictable than the previous film. This addition is wonderful because it breathes new life into the franchise, meanwhile cleverly bringing the landscape back to the original's. Emotional depth also plays another key role in the film, being an assisting component to solid character development. Overall, a well written, worthy film.",Scream 4
174,culmo80,More Absurd than any of the previous Scream films,4,24 March 2012,"The original Scream was supposed to be almost a satire on the slasher ""horror"" films. I laughed at that movie more than I was scared, but at least it threw some curves.SpoilersBy now in the Scream series, you come to expect the unexpected. You know there will be some last-minute twist to who is really the killer. So in this film, you can see the cousin-as-the-killer coming a mile away. You also kind of figure that it's one of the geeky computer guys because they are obsessed with it.I didn't buy for one minute that Neve Campbell's cousin was responsible for all of the murders or that she somehow got the nerd to go along with her. Sorry, that was just a really weak story.Scream has become a parody of itself, but at least it is making fun of the slasher series, which is about as far from true horror as you can get. Scream, Saw, and the other films just need to go away. Give us good horror!!",Scream 4
175,alexcomputerkid,The Scream series should have never gotten to this point.,4,29 July 2013,"After two pretty solid films, the Scream series hit bottom with Part 3. Actually the whole horror genre kind of went downhill in that early 2000's time frame. Ten years after Scream 3 came Scream 4.Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell ) is back in Woodsboro after ten years to promote her new book in her old town. Ghostface however is back and has struck again killing off a new set of victims.The film has a difficult task of reviving a series after ten years. It does brings us new cast members and characters from Emma Roberts as Jill Roberts to Hayden Panettiere as Kirby Reed. Some of the old stars are here also including David Arquette and of course Neve Campbell. The actors seem to be giving a pretty good effort but without a good plot which we don't have here, it doesn't matter much. The plot is full of dull antics with poor kill scenes marked by bad gore. The new characters are a little hard to get used to and the movie does have a rather long opening and ending too. The first couple of Scream films were not really scary they could possibly scare someone. That said, if you are scared by this one, you don't what scary is.While Scream 4 is marked by flaws and holes, there are some highlights. The new killer is an interesting idea and there is a movie club that felt right up my alley. Also a couple of party scenes felt like the good old Scream films were back.I know people still love this stuff but to me the Scream series is gone and played out. It really has no ideas to it, tries to go over old successes and really feels like something that was just thrown together. The Scream series should have never gotten to this point.",Scream 4

Now, you are at the bottom of the barrel. Not only were your last 3 films utter garbage, but you sold the rights away to your very own classics. You have become the Michael Bay of the thriller department. Yes, i did say that, and try to argue with me otherwise. Try and tell me that ""Scream 3"" was good. Try and tell me that ""Cursed"" was worth watching. And i double dog dare you to tell me that ""My Soul To Take"" is anything past decent. They are the same parlor tricks used over and over again. At least John Carpenter knew when to call it quits. But, i will give the man a second chance.For starters, the movie preaches up and down how it's 'A new decade with new rules'. They talk about the 'Saw' series and......well, that's all they really talk about because the past 10 years have produced next to nothing in the horror/thriller department. So what new rules have been established? Well i'll tell you right now......the answer is NOTHING. It's the same damn set-up, with the same damn parlor tricks. The only thing that makes it different, is they play another 'who done it' game with different characters.I think we all can agree that the original ""Scream"" is a classic. The second one came out, we played along, and were mildly entertained. But by the third, we kind of got tired of the same ol' crap and didn't really care who the killer was. And now with the forth installment, i'm pretty damn annoyed. Just because they waited 10 years to introduce the same concept, doesn't change the fact that they're still knocking on a door to an empty house.I honestly was hoping for something fresh and original......much like the first ""Scream"". I will admit, the ending had some potential......but like every other modern day thriller, they gotta take a giant dump on it.Bottom Line.....i know some and maybe most people will welcome this return with open arms. But i don't. The reason why there has not been a decent horror/thriller movie in the past 10 years, is because they keep repeating the same damn idea over and over again. And this movie just jumps right into the same pool. It's movies like ""The Decent"" that offer something fresh and different. And if i want to be apart of a mystery 'who done it' game, i'll go into my basement, and find my old ""Goosebumps"" books. Honestly people, if you want something new and different, go and see ""Insidious"". Because that will be more remembered that this repeating garbage.",Scream 4
177,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,They made up for Scream 3!,8,12 July 2016,"If you wondering why I'm reviewing all the Scream movies. It's because I got all the scream movies on blu ray, at a Miami Pawn shop for a dollar each. So I decided to rewatch them for the first time in a while.In the beginning, one call stated it all. Now a new generation will meet a ghost from the past. Not Matthew Mcconaughey in Ghost of Girlfriends Past. I'm talking about that old school ghost, ghostface killah (not the one from the Wu-Tang Clan), the return of Ghostface in Scream 4. Scream is back for a new decade, new rules, a new game, a new group of people to kill.I believe Scream 4, is the second best Scream movie in the franchise. Now many people, including myself, believe that once we got to Scream 3, we were screaming, and not in a good way. This film recognizes more than just horror eliminates. It recognizes how a new generation acts, new rules, how entertainment has changed due to technology, what people are willing to do in order to achieve fame, sequels, reboots, references, etc.Kevin Williamson is back as the screenwriter, and I'm glad he came back. He brought what Scream 3 lacked. He brought originality, and a new direction. Even though we've seen the same template before. The film has the ability to stay one step ahead of the audience, and stay ahead of what you think is going to happen.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Scream 4. Scream 4 doesn't pack a punch like the first film. But, it was fun, and it was like going down memory lane. I'm glad they didn't end the series with the third film. I believe Scream 4 earns a...8/10!This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading, and viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)",Scream 4
178,HorrorFanatic4Life,"Perfect ""remake"" to an already perfect original",10,3 March 2019,"Having been a huge fan of the original Scream, I was more than thrilled to see this one. Although I still loved the 2nd and 3rd additions to the franchise, there was a little disappointment in how much I ended up liking them. Then this one came out and had me falling in love with the Scream franchise all over again. This one did not disappoint one bit!In a more modern setting (being as it was filmed much later than the first 3) it still manages to tie everything back to the original which is amazing itself. The original characters are still there with the addition of plenty more just as amazing characters adding their own Individual personalities to the mix that create a mystifying storyline of guessing who the killer is one final time. Having watched Emma Roberts in her Disney Channel days growing up, I had never expected to see her in a horror film and ultimately end up being the killer herself, but I was not disappointed by how well she carried that role out and was ultimately impressed. The characters of Robbie, Charlie, Rebecca and Kirby combined in this movie made it even better. There wasn't one character that didn't fit in with the whole atmosphere of the film.The tieback to the original was phenomenal and only added to my already hightened obsession with the Scream franchise. Wes Craven delivered yet another, what I thought to be, slasher horror classic with the added twist of being a modern day remake. That classic slasher horror feel with the tons of added dark twisted humor in there made for another favorite and an astounding (but sad) end to the franchise.I have now added this to my list of all time favorites right behind the one and only original Scream.",Scream 4
179,arnieiam,There's only so much that could have been done,8,23 April 2011,"I still give this a solid rating because I got so much love for this franchise of self-aware meta-fiction slasher films. As the characters themselves tell you that the rules of another sequel are that the body count is higher and the murders are much more gruesome. What stagnated this film that it (spoiler right here) still follows the two killer system with half-assed motives, the original characters still live, at the end the killer seems apparently dead- wakes up for one last scare- but then gets shot by the heroine. What is sort of new is that the killer(s) could have been anyone, no seriously I wasn't able to figure it out until a few minutes before the climax, unlike the first film in which we strongly knew it was Billy and Stu. Also whats new is that the characters are aware of self-aware horror films. And finally whats new is that one of the killers was made to look like a target. So within this framework not so much could have been done, so it sometimes stuck to formula and sometimes it didn't. Also it could have done without all the new decade technology advertising, we get it iPhones have taken over the world.",Scream 4
180,briandwillis-83825,"Not Needed, but Not Terrible",6,5 January 2021,"It's hard to know how much of Scream 4's problems was due to usual Weinstein meddling and what problems were inherent in the script. It's not that Scream 4 is a terrible film, mind you, it's just not a very essential one. One could say it was made to right some of the wrongs of the overly silly Scream 3 which, to many fans, was not a fitting end to the franchise. Sid, Dewey, and Gale are all back, but the latter two have precious little to do. This time, it's all about Sid coming back home to promote her book about the Woodsboro murders that she survived all those years ago. This triggers a new killer to embark on a spree of grisly murders in order to get her attention.The new cast of characters, minus Hayden Panettiere's charming Kirby, are an uninteresting and woefully underdeveloped lot which makes it hard to care for them. One of the strangest new characters is Mary McDonnell as Sid's aunt who has about 4 lines in the entire film and seems strung out and bored the entire time she's on screen. One wonders if there was originally more to her on the page than what ended up on screen.",Scream 4
181,fritzlang,Scary Movie 5? (spoiler free),6,20 April 2011,"Just got back from a matinée showing. I deliberately read little to nothing about the movie so I could go in with a fresh mind.The first Scream films had a definite 'vibe' to them. They were, after all, horror films but with a nice comedic/satiric wink to them.This film? Confused.It starts out as a straight comedy. So much so, that if the words ""scary movie 5"" were flashed on the screen that I would not have been surprised.The jokes were lame.. The characters almost cartoonish.. dialog was so cliché.Yes, they were killings but I was never scared nor really cared about any of the characters (which is ironic since the opening scene talks about the problem in slasher films is that the characters are those that the audience doesn't care about).Of course, I don't want to see anybody die, but none of these deaths affected me.. I just didn't care.The deaths were bloody, but unimaginative (again, ironic since the opening scene talks about how at least Jigsaw's kills were imaginative).The identity of the killer was a surprise to me, but - again- but the time the identity was revealed - I just didn't care.This film neither worked as a comedy/satire nor horror film for me.Until the end..About 20 minutes near the end of the film, it was if they said ""okay! Let's make a REAL horror film!"" The jokes were put aside, and it became a standard slasher film.I have read some comments that this is the part where they think the film got weak. In my opinion, this was the only enjoyable part of the movie! it had some real scares, twists, and the humor (for the most part) even worked! However, I had to sludge through over one hour to get to this...Perhaps rabid Scream fans might enjoy it more than I did (though I did see and enjoy the first 3). Not sure if people not familiar with the first three would even get the supposedly-comedic references to those films.Looking back, it wasn't a bad film..and the last third was a hoot! But one that I will definitely wait to get in a Scream 1-4 box set and would never think of getting by itself...6 out of 10.",Scream 4
182,nexus-37,Very well done sequel total surprise,8,24 April 2011,"Once again I was totally surprised by a movie. First I thought this would be boring scream-like splatter and failing 'cause little tired of the whole Scream-scenario. I was mostly wrong.I didn't fell asleep while watching, from the beginning the movie stunned me and made me want to watch it with brains.Very refreshing in mainstream horror movie scene, very much blood, few good jokes (not those boring ones) few connections of course to the other ones but not stupid ones.This didn't make me any kinda of scared when I was in some sort of lousy mood but what movie does that to me these days :)The script was really well and actually kinda amazing this movie stands on its own feet and feeling is really original. Opening was actually lot more interesting than in the first one. Second and third were kinda boring but some kinda watchable, first one I liked pretty much with the humor.Do not recycle the same stuff too much ;) This didn't (atleast too much)It's like Halloween or something sequels must simply be somehow connected otherwise no-one would scream.I recommend this to anyone who likes horror and splatter etc. stuff and have some brains.",Scream 4
183,MatthewLong23,Great twist I did not see coming,10,15 April 2011,"This is one great movie. It has a lot of very funny scenes and has some great scares. The twist in the end is what makes this movie. Throughout it I was thinking who could possibly be the killer and was very surprised with who they made it out to be. Throughout the movie the characters discuss remakes or revitalizations of various horror movies and what is usually done to make them better then the original. The movie follows those rules which makes it funny as there doing everything that is in a scary movie. Some of the deaths are gruesome but I would not consider it hard to watch. The whole threatening phone call and hearing ""ghostface"" was parodies a lot in this film. It was actually quite humorous what the person was saying and not sure if that is what was intended by the director. The beginning of the film was very funny as well but I can't say it was memorable. Nothing will ever beat the opening of the first film as that was generally terrifying. The only thing good about the beginning was that it parodied how horror movie series like saw for example make way too many sequels and they just get silly. Lots of young actresses, who star in TV shows are in the beginning and are used well. If you like the other scream movies most likely you will enjoy this one.",Scream 4

185,Jona1988,Best of the sequels,7,4 March 2012,"In my opinion the original Scream was great. It brought something new to the horror movie genre with its combination of horror, humour, parody, self-awareness and clever plot twists. The first sequel was also good fun and while not as good as the original Scream 2 was still a well worthy follow-up. But then came the pretty much rubbish Scream 3. The rule of number three in series hit once again, just like with Spider-man 3, X-men: the last stand and Terminator 3. After that let down one would think that the crew would be tempted to just have let the franchise die with that. Maybe they actually had considering that it has been eleven years since number three. But then Scream 4 has happened and I am glad it did because it takes the series back to its feet, a satisfying series ender and even more it is actually the best since the first. Well in my opinion at least. One thing that they have succeeded so surprisingly with is the characters. In many long ongoing series the big main actors tend to pass on to other projects but Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette are all back for the fourth time which is great as it maintains a continuity which is a big strength for the series and us viewers wanting to come back to follow what happens to them. It is no spoiler to say that several are killed throughout the films and so new once must be introduced. Even if Scream 2 was good the characters never managed to live up to the cast of the first one. And those in Scream 3 are just so thin they could be transparent. Scream 4 has great new characters and thanks to both the script but also the actors, one can actually remember who is who this time. Emma Roberts and Hayden Panettiere are good in managing to create characters that you get some connection to and interest to follow not just being background material to the recurring ones. Something else that works great with this film is the plot. The mystery is interesting all the way both in the build up and the resolution. From the clever and even more funny opening to the mind f*** ending. The story has some great twists that I no way saw coming. I think the whole motive makes the most sense since the first. It might seem strange to state that the motive for killings make sense but it's not in that way I mean. What I meant is that the whole reveal of the villain is less far-fetched. I could not entirely buy the deus ex machina ending of Scream 2 and the less said about the absurd, predecessor ruining twists of Scream 3 the better. But then this is a horror movie, so what about the scary moments? Well that is where the film does not succeed completely. The film is very bloody as expected but this time well considered by Wes Craver to not go too much over the top. However the murders go very fast and the music while good at making the right feel not necessarily scary. There are some jump moments but on the whole the film is more fun than scary. The first is still scariest and this and the second are about equal. Still while not terrifying it works well enough.Scream 4 is great. This could work well as an ending to the series. For now I'm at least satisfied that it makes up for the rubbish conclusion that was Scream 3 which can now be just ignored. A great thrill ride with its clever plot and surprisingly well done characters.",Scream 4

I thought that I would start of with Scream 4 because it is only rated 15 whereas the other three are 18, I was expecting it to be a lot more gory and scary than it actually was. I attempted to watch it once, before I really got into horror films and was scared s**tless. This one was good because as it was recent there were elements that I could relate to. Like the previous ones it had great actors and a good story-line. I would say that this should be the last instalment as any more would just drag it on too long and ruin what is special about them.

I like scream, I really like scream 2. Which is by way far the scariest. And I don't like scream 3 much. Only a little bit. This movie I hate. It's complete trash.

188,KaZenPhi,Absolute schlock :3,6,26 October 2016,"Scream was a series of progressively ridiculous meta-horror movies that thought they were being clever by pointing out the most surface- level, obvious horror-movie tropes and by following them exactly ironically turned out more and more dull and tiring with each sequel. Granted the first one though did a much better job than Wes Craven's previous attempt new nightmare, did reinvigorate the snoozing horror genre and inspired other horror comedies. It's a bit too on the nose for my taste but it's still watchable and an interesting relic of its time.Enter Scream 4 or SCRE4M as it is spelled in the title (oh lord...), basically a soft reboot of the original with the surviving cast members reunited once more. It's got everything you know from the other scream movies: a barrage of fake scares, jump scares, false leads, the invincible slasher bad guy who keeps disappearing at convenient moments, ineffective protagonists, a constant drone of witty meta commentary and amid senseless violence inflicted upon disposable stock characters there's of course the BS double-cross twist ending (which I won't give away) where the bad guy explains everything like a classic Bond villain. I think I loved it. Every tired trope mentioned above and fittingly done to death in the other scream movies is back but turned up to 11 in such a way that the whole movie crosses over from ineptly bad to absolutely hilarious, especially with some of the performances that came straight out of a Zucker brothers movie. I don't think Wes Craven was aware that he was creating total schlock - with all the less than subtle commentary about the modern ""torture porn"" era of horror movies I must assume this was an honest attempt to show them young ones how it's done. Instead we got a great Scary Movie sequel, an accidental masterpiece and a fitting swan song to a ridiculous series and a very creative director who will be missed.",Scream 4
189,MarcusJ13,Ghostface lives,8,25 April 2011,"The Scream series appeared to be dead in the water prior to this film, while I enjoyed all three films I thought it would be a big ask to make another one that it capable of reaching the levels of entertainment that the previous films did. I like many others though knew that Scream 4 couldn't just be aware of itself in the genre but also had to be aware of the current trends in the horror genre. This was making a change from films horror films which are basically knock offs (sorry remakes) of the original presented in a modern setting. Where Scream 4 went right was that it knew itself and tried to have fun with these aspects. It basically acknowledges all of the aspects of horror in our day and age and brings some of the old characters back into it. Sidney, now an author returns to the now infamous town of the Ghostface murders just in time for a new killer to strike, with Gale and Dewey (now married) in tow to solve the mystery and avoid death once again. The film does not try to be anything different from the others per say other than making itself known of the time frame it is set in. This wasn't a huge problem but if you want a horror film that will surprise you this isn't it. It knows what it is and really tries to make the audience have fun with it. These films were notorious for having humour at the forefront as well as horror and Scream 4 cranks it up. That is not to say that the film is all gags and punchlines, when the killings take place they are bloody and intense. Of course if you are familiar with these films nothing you haven't seen before but still has the power to make you cringe. The killings also look far more realistic than what is offered in films such as Saw. In this Scream 4 makes for quite compelling horror. As far as predictability goes it gives some and takes some. There are plenty of parts that are predictable but plenty that aren't making for a great ride. If there is one thing that the film continued to get right is that it continues to make the audience play the guessing game. As I mentioned earlier there is more humour in this film so if you aren't prepared for it it will come across as being silly despite being interchanged between murders. As performances go Neve Campbell did what was required of her but Courteney Cox and David Arquette still stole the show giving the most memorable performances. I going to give honourable mentions to Hayden Panettiere and co who were engaging and weren't put into the trap of being so annoying you want them to be killed off. To conclude Scream 4 is a great film for fans of the series and genre and tries to include genuine intensity for the purpose of making it genuine horror which it what I wanted from the film given that what the series is all about. When those intense moments come you will still be on the edge of your seat and shows how much effort they put into a horror film being shown in this day and age.",Scream 4
190,alandeza,Better than the previous entry,8,7 November 2021,"This was a much better followup than 3. All of the cast were great, with Emma having a great time going from scared to crazy. My only complaint was it went a little too meta at times, but other than that it was a fun slasher.",Scream 4
191,TourettesPersonal,Scream Again,5,15 July 2011,"Last year, Wes Craven returns to direct slasher flicks but his last movie(My Soul To Take) ends up pretty bad and I thought he is losing it. But the good thing is, Scream 4 is fun. Everything is back. Yes, the movie is so back there's nothing much new about this sequel. The killing scenes are repeated from the first film. The main characters still had the same old problems. It's just repetitive and it's slightly disappointing. At least it's still fun but again, there's nothing new.Sydney Prescott is back and she is being stalked by the Ghostface killer again. But that's not all, Officer Dewey is still having trouble to look for the identity of the killer. Gale Weathers is still hated by the public. The guys are talking about the rules. Some tricky twist in the end. Aside from that, they also repeat the killing scenes from the first Scream movies since The Ghostface Killer's plan here is redoing his same stuff from the first Scream.There is nothing about this sequel except the new atmosphere. It's new decade but it still wanted to be postmodern. The movie is still fun. The cast actually made this film. Neve Campbell, David Arquette, and Courtney Cox does their thing. The new characters are also good to watch. The only problem here is the revealed Ghostface. I won't tell you who the killer is but in recent Scream movies they are usually twisted and full of rage but the revealed Ghostface here is kinda low key.Overall, it's fun to watch because of the characters and it's more violent but the version I saw here in the Philippines has cuts which kinda ruined the film. But again and again, it's not new, not big either, it's just another Scream movie. Wes Craven haven't lost it yet but this deserves a less repetitive story.",Scream 4
192,cthetrancedone,"1, 2 & 3 Were Trash. 4 Is Brilliant!",8,21 February 2021,"I wasn't expecting much after watching the appalling Screams 1, 2 & 3. I rated those movies 2 Stars for the only bits worth watching when GhostFace keeps falling, absolute genius. The rest of those movies were just 90s trash, it's so hard to understand why movies this bad actually get made.However, Scream 4 is brilliant!Yes, GhostFace is still falling about which is hilarious and there is so much more to this movie. This one has a serious feel to it. The production is fantastic.There's a lot more GhostFace action here. When he turns his face quickly to the side to look at us, a super skill shot.The movie has quite a lot of twists, you will NOT see them coming, especially at the very beginning of the movie. If you say you knew that was going to happen, you're lying, unless you've read the script!Excellent twisty beginning and a serious slasher of an ending.This should be a standalone movie. THIS is Scream.",Scream 4
193,Victor_Fallon,Back on Form,7,1 May 2011,"When Wes Craven gets it right, the whole movie seems to click and you're happy to be in its world for a while. As a fan of Scream 1, I was underwhelmed by the sequels because they fell for the same old traps. They tried to take the elements from the first movie and ramp them up, so the gentle humour became silly, the 'whodunnit' structure became clumsy and the brutal horror became cartoonish.But, thankfully, everyone is Scream 4 looks like they're acting in the same film, and they all live in Woodsboro, which feels alive again thanks to Wes's acute sense of location - something lacking in the sequels.Instead of the childish experiments of horror movies lately, Scream 4 relies on classic dramatic elements of light, shadow, eavesdropping and plenty of red herrings. The sound design is a little heard-it-all-before, but retains enough of the classic 'Scream' cues to keep the action rooted down. The acting throughout is intentionally somewhat comic-book, but it's well directed so there isn't a wild clash of styles that can plague movies like this. The whole thing grooves along confidently and ends up being a satisfying modern take on the classic murder mystery.",Scream 4
194,Remy_Azhary,WOW! There's only one word to describe SCREAM 4.EPIC!,10,14 April 2011,"t's truly epic right from the beginning to the end. Without giving too much spoilers, the beginning was a pure tease and I don't mean like a teaser but it teased you silly yet you feel the suspense. The ending felt like there's a need prolong the story a little further and it did. One of the signature elements to the Scream series is the prologue murders where the audience would immediately be gripped into the story without having a chance to catch a breath. It is as what director Wes Craven had intended for when he signed up for the very first installment. And like I said in the beginning, everything in Scream 4 is EPIC; and this even include the prologue murders.The entire movie was indeed a rehash (or in its proper term, a ""reboot"") of the whole Scream series. And indeed it was. Any Scream fan or those who really followed the series closely would feel the essence of the earlier films redone in this version but with a twist. A twist so contorted that there's that certain freshness to it. Thank God for Kevin Williamson's return to revitalize the movie after the mess that Ehren Krueger left in the Scream 3 (who refuse to yield as he played as an executive producer for this one).Nevertheless, Scream 4 was an epic (not in The Lord of the Rings way) but in terms of the numerous characters involved and massive yet compact storyline.And the trailer that you've seen? Forget about what you've seen in the trailer. Like the beginning of this film, the trailer only served as a teaser. The actual movie felt like an entirely different one.As for the killer, I was somehow affixed on one particular character yet my suspect was the wrong one.In short, Scream 4 managed to redeem itself out of the mediocre Scream 3. Like I've described in the beginning, Scream 4 is an epic in its own right as with the tagline, ""New Decade, New Rules"". So we would see a slight departure from the first three Scream's.All these while, I've been feeling that something was amiss after Scream 2 (which was one of my favorite along with its predecessor). And I managed to figure out that the missing component was actually the character of 'Randy' who was killed in Scream 2. It was he who provide the genius to the whole horror-slasher rules thing. Yet it felt dry in Scream 3.Anyway, Scream 4 is a fun movie that you would enjoy with your friends and which is meant to be watched with friends. So grab some snack and enjoy the ride!",Scream 4
195,Dfschohr-532-549658,Scream 4 Review,7,17 November 2013,"I am a huge fan of the Scream trilogy, so I was reluctant to the news of a fourth film coming out, but also extremely anxious to see what the ""master of horror"" Wes Craven would bring to the table once again. So I sat with anticipation waiting to see the set photos of Ghostface, along with the cast. Then when the trailers were released I geeked out over them a thousand times, looking at every frame to see if they gave anything away. They did not. Plus nobody could see the absurdly odd twist of an ending to come. On the last stop of her book tour, Sidney Prescott(Neve Campbell) returns to her hometown of Woodsboro, CA . Dewey Riley(David Arquette) is now Sheriff, and Gale Weathers now Gale Weathers-Riley(Courtney Cox), has a bad case of writers block. Sidney's cousin Jill(Emma Roberts) and her friends Kirby(Hayden Panettiere), Charlie(Rory Culkin), and Robbie(Erik Knudesen) all have a tradition with all the students every year where they have a Stabathon, and watch the series of horror films called Stab, which are based on Sidney's life. With all this going on the body count piles up, and everyone scrambles to find out who the killer is. There is much to like about Scream 4. The first fifteen minutes are incredibly funny and genius. Then the film falls into a bit of a slump. I found myself not caring about Gale and Dewey's relationship, and Emma Robert's acting skills are not up to par with her other cast members. Anthony Anderson and Adrian Brody don't add anything special to the film, and Marley Shelton, who I think is not a bad actress, was awful as Deputy Hicks. Hayden Panettiere looks gorgeous, and surprisingly she can act. Panettiere's character, Kirby is the one with the best dialogue, the coolest name, and what felt to me the least amount of screen time. Then comes the explanation of the killer's motive, which somehow in my mind would definitely be plausible but it was not executed properly. Overall its the least favorite of the series for me, but I have talked to other people who really enjoyed it. So I say check it out, but you might be disappointed. I give Scream 4 a 7 out of 10.",Scream 4
196,waterman_harry,Succumbs to its Own Parody,5,26 April 2015,"Whilst Scream 4 or ""Scre4m"" is good, it's not necessarily a film that you'd remember. If you're stuck for choice, have seen and enjoyed the previous entries to the Scream series and/or just really enjoy slasher films then Scream 4 will probably be one you'll enjoy...if however you are looking for something with a little more substance, then you should probably steer clear of Scream 4. The film is so polished that it seems to have lost most of its edge along the years,its almost unrecognisable as is Courtney Cox. Some of the performances are quite good for example Hayden Panettiere who is always a joy to watch, but Cox, Campbell and Arquette all seem to be doing the exact same things they've done for the past decade - rooted firmly in their archetypes and doing nothing to surprise us. Scream 4 goes for semi-spoofing the 'reboot' phenomenon and seems deeply confusing most of the way through, is it satire, is it silly? No idea whatsoever.",Scream 4
197,alexart-1,Stab Me Gently With a Machete,8,24 April 2011,"""What's your favorite scary movie?"" whispered a faceless killer in the opening line Wes Craven's original Scream. And now, fifteen years later, it may not be the opening line anymore, but it's still that same, jarring punch of a phone conversation opener. Scream 4 shows a return to what the original was: a great, fun, and self-aware parody of the horror genre. Maybe this is for the better, maybe this is for the worse, but in the bloodiest and most meta installment yet, Craven moves the story along faster with even less horror and more comedy. Most of what the movie shows the audience is things they have seen already in the other three Screams, but it's so damn fun to watch it all unfold all over again.Scream 4 is a similar plot to the first few. A killer strikes and people die. If you want a few more details, you can keep reading: Ghostface strikes again in Woodsboro. It's not just any coincidence that Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is back in town promoting her new autobiography of her struggles in the past fifteen years. And as the teenage bodies continue to drop, it becomes increasingly more apparent that Sidney is next. Courtney Cox and David Arquette are brought back for their original roles. The new cast members include Emma Roberts, Hayden Patteniere, Adam Brody, and Rory Culkin.Scream 4 offers a fair amount of suspense. There are some legitimately disquieting sequences, however most are marred by blasts of annoying albeit funny comedy. The kills are notably more violent--guts and blood are everywhere by the time the kills are done--but it's not necessarily to the film's advantage. Still, as sadistic as it may be to say this, the murder sequences are planned nicely and are definitely entertaining to watch.Comedy is used in Scream 4 more nicely than it is in all three installments. It may be used too often because it ends up replacing most of the horror, however it is certainly funny. The opening sequence is no longer scary or creepy, rather it is one convoluted joke involving three simultaneous movies. And it's all in good taste, but true fans of horror may not be happy with this one.The cast and their characters are a major improvement over Scream 3. Hayden Patteniere is wonderful as the sarcastic Kirby, a closeted horror film geek who poses as the hot popular girl. Thankfully, Neve Campbell is featured less in this one because, as her career has progressed, she has just done more of her ""pouty-face"" expression for her role as Sidney. David Arquette is still insanely annoying as Dewey, but Courtney Cox is always a treat as Gale. The new cast members are satisfactory enough.Despite a surprising ending, Scream 4 is more of the delicious same material as the first one. Scream 4 was not a needed installment. In fact, the Scream series did not need to be rebooted. But, and there's a big ""but,"" Scream 4 is very entertaining. Scream 5 may be overkill (oh, don't you just love puns?), but for now, Scream 4 is a fun watch. See it in theaters with a large group of friends and enjoy.",Scream 4

Acting is solid as usualNext to the original this has the best ghost face.

Whenever you watch a scream movie you have to talk about the opening scene and this is probably the worst one of the 4.The motive behind the killers is bad and doesn't make sense. I like the idea of it being Sydney's cousin but the killers themselves didn't have the same creep factor the first two scream movies had.Ghost face is just as clumsy as beforeNot a huge fan of the deputy she unnecessarily creepy and annoying at the same time.Enjoyment rating 8.5/10Critical rating 7/10.",Scream 4
199,PeterWorthers,Scream 4 Spoiler filled review,7,15 April 2011,"SPOILERS AHEAD YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!Back in 2000 i was sad to say goodbye to this franchise (even though 2 and three left it lacking) but did and felt the trilogy was good as is.Now, years later we have the NEWEST addition to the trilogy (?). If it had been anyone else But Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson, I would have walked past it and not given this movie a second thought But with the ORIGINAL creators on board, I had to give it a try.The movie was good, not as bad as Saw 4 (Which is referenced in the movie as sucking-Right on) or the before mentioned Halloween 3, but then again its also nothing new. The same old Scream plot line thats been used 3 times before really. FOr a second there it almost felt like Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (The veteran handing the reigns to the younger one) But Jill was WAY better than Mutt.The entire original cast is back (Except Jamie Kennedy, which let's be honest, would have just been stupid seeing as how he had died in Scream 2) along with the 'younger, hipper' cast who claim to be ""horror movie experts"" yet STILL do the same stupid things when put in the deadly situations.I want to add that I think Wes Craven is a GENIUS. Plain and simple. He created the Horror genre and is constantly re-inventing it. From Nightmare on Elm Street to Scream to...well...Scream 4.The movie knows what it is, and does not try to hide it. It is another tired horror movie with a stupid plot that has been done over and over again, Craven knows this, and that is what he makes fun of in the beginning of the movie. It is classic. Only he could make fun of HIMSELF and still make it new and hip. THIS is why he's the master.But, as with everything, I did have a few problems (or complaints, if you're nasty) and thought i'd share them with you if you don't mind.#1- Seriously, EVERYONE in this movie has a cell phone, half of them USE the phones as the killer calls, yet once he attacks the service suddenly goes out? They must use AT&T.#2- The killer is attacking, what should we do? Go rescue the victim ourself, not call the cops WHO ARE OUTSIDE THE HOUSE, or use those cell phone things were were talking about earlier.#3- When we are first introduced to Jill at school, for a second you'll see a statue head by her locker. Its Henry Winkler (AKA The Fonz) who was the principal in the FIRST Scream.#4- Hayden Panettiere, what did you do to your hair? YOU LOOK TERRIBLE. Cheerleader, you should have saved your hair.#5- All the 'IN' jokes in the movie are AWESOME, especially the one about how Gale and Dewey must have had a screen relationship, because they would never cut it in real life. How true you are. Also note all the references to previous Wes Craven movies. Awesome.#6- The killer is on top of your car, you look around, he's gone. You OBVIOUSLY scared him off. So what do you do now? Get out of the car. Give me a break.#7- It bothered me that all these kids have phones, but none of them have personalized ring tones or wallpapers. They were all the stock ones installed on the phone when you first get it. How realistic is that? #8- The murders are starting again, so what does Dewey do? Post 2 guards at Sidneys house to watch over her. Good job, that will work. You may have been in the 3 other Screams, but you obviously did NOT pay any attention to them.#9- When Mary McDonnell (AKA the Aunt AKA President Rosalyn from Battlestar Galactica) comes home from the store, Sidney starts to unload the groceries. Look at the box of Cheerios she takes out, its already open.#10- Another Hayden Panettiere rant. Sorry, but you can NOT act. No joke, just thought your acting was terrible.#11- Knives can go through sturdy wooden doors? Who knew? #12- There is a serial killer on the loose, coming after you, its night time, the door is locked, so obviously its the perfect time to check on your potted plants, or wind chimes as the case may be.#13- Anthony Anderson, I don't care what role you're in, or how hard you try, you will ALWAYS be comic relief. Sorry, thats just the way it is. At least you'll always have a job. Oh by the way, lay off Bruce Willis.#14- The cameras are being moved, as you can see on your screen Gale, obviously messing with your laptop is going to fix this.#15- All the stuff plugged into that lap top, how much battery life do you think it would have? It would have drained its battery before Stab 1 even started.#16- Deputy Hicks - You are just a bad actress as Hayden was. YOU WERE TERRIBLE. And weird, like a not so freaky looking Christina Ricci...If you can imagine that.#17- For that matter, most of the time the NEW cast was trying to be the OLD cast really hard. Anyhow, you get what I mean........I have to say though, it was nice to see a usual slasher film that I grew up with back again for todays kids to see. If you're going to see Scream then you know what you're getting into, its not thought provoking nor will it change your life. But it will keep you entertained for a few hours.This is how its done. Not all the crap that Hollywood is putting out, its done Cravens way. The Right Way.",Scream 4
200,mad_mandonna,Great fun and I was pleasantly surprised,7,15 April 2011,"Who could forget the first time Drew Barrymore met her end after being hunted down by ghost face in the original scream film some 15 years ago. Its been a decade since scream underwhelmed everybody with its lacklustre third instalment and with a fourth on the way I was sceptical about how the fourth would go and how it would affect the introduction to the review I would to write about it.In my second paragraph, I can now write about how much I enjoyed the film and how I can now use my summary in that Scream 4 (or Scre4m)was ""great fun and I was pleasantly surprised"". I can't begin to tell you how true this statement is, the plot manages to weave a tidy little knot of a mystery that comes to a surprising and comical climax. The body count is large, making killings in this instalment come thick and fast. Though with a reduced age rating, scream 4 is far more gruesome than the previous threesome and a lot more in keeping with the current horror movie gore fest. To finish off the second paragraph of my review I will conclude that Scream manages to stick to its guns, but modernise itself not unlike the remakes it satirises.Paragraph 3 contains scenes of critical nature. Now the film is paced very well, however there are a lot of characters to get through. And despite its self aware nature the two-dimensional characters are so underplayed that its hard to feel much for them as they quickly get stabbed to death. The only characters you feel much dread for is Gale, Dewey and Sidney as familiar faces that you don't want to meet there bloody doom,however the new cast have so little characterisation that you really couldn't care less if their stabbed to death and left to dry on their parents lawns. The film also wasn't as scary as the original and despite the ""kids"" knowing the rules of the horror movie they were starring in they all seem to go outside to investigate a strange noise when they know they're all being hunted by a killer. Whether this is done on purpose, as to mock other horror films is a possibility, but to be honest it would make the film a lot less predictable if they didn't make there predecessors mistakes.So my conclusion is gonna be as sharp and concise as a horror movie should be. Scream 4 is entertaining, funny and thrilling. And one of the last lines of one of the survivors is bloody great.",Scream 4

This one however was really boring, predictable, the cast was not convincing, their plastic surgeries were blatantly obvious (Courtney Cox, I'm looking at you), the jokes were blunt, and the mistakes the ""victims"" made were so unbelievably stupid it was a wonder how they managed to survive so long. People started leaving the theater half way through, but I did not follow their example because of my curiosity to discover/confirm the identity of the slasher. I'm glad I didn't, because the last 20 minutes or so were the only ones worth watching. The identity of the criminal and her motivation is very realistic and her declaration ""I don't need friends, I need fans"" proves that Scream 4 is not a simple re-boot, but a true movie of the 2010's, where Facebook, Twitter and Youtube govern our lives and ambitions. Unfortunately it is the only re-deeming thing of this flick. Don't waste your money on it.",Scream 4
202,patrickwigington,"It's A Nice, Fun SCRE4M",8,12 June 2011,"Master of Horror Wes Craven revitalizes his Scream series with this ridiculously entertaining fourth installment. Scream 4 is constantly self referencing to the point where movie-fiction and movie-reality are blended into a twisted, surreal slasher experience. With constant discussions about stereotypical slasher movies, and a movie-within-a- movie beginning, Scream 4 is not a dried out sequel, but a fun, gory film.The film takes place about 15 years after the events in the original Scream. All of the characters that survived the original trilogy are now grown up and have moved on. Sidney Prescott, the girl who has been tortured by serial killers for some time now, has published a book about her experiences. Her old friend, Dewey, is the sheriff of the small town, and he is married to the ex-reporter Gale. The film also focuses on the new generation of teens living in the townnot that it matters much; we all know what will happen to them.The actual plot is simple enough: Someone is dressing up like Ghostface and killing everyone in the town. This brings in many a reporter to ask questions, but for some reason the FBI never bothers to send someone to investigate. Instead, it's up to the bumbling but lovable sheriff Dewey to find the killer. David Arquette is wonderful as Dewey, who gives off the aura of simply being too incompetent to die. And Arquette's real- life wife Courtney Cox is wonderful as the ex-reporter trying to find some fun in her life.Director Wes Craven seems to be done with trying to scare his audience, and instead strives for ridiculous antics that will either leave one stunned or laughing hysterically. Craven's perfect mix of humor and gore keeps the film at a nice pace, with only the explanation scene near the end being a drag. But the final scene in the hospital does more than make up for it.Scream 4 is an over-the-top slasher film that has more in common with movies like Machete rather than horror films. This works for the better; the self deprecating humor gives the film an enjoyable quality that is almost always missing from other teen-screams. Wes Craven and his crew stick with what they know, and it works.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com/",Scream 4
203,mwcanadian,I tried to like it,3,31 July 2020,"I tried to like this movie, but it had one too many issues for me to enjoy it from ""the killers"" to the ""killers motive"" to who they tried to kill and so forth. Nothing personal to Sidney or her character, but I feel the movie would've been better if she wasn't actively involved. I don't want her ""killed off"" I want her story to end and then t should've ended after 3. The rest of the cast was fine until the end when the killer and the motive is revealed then i really disliked it. The movie had classic Scream stuff and it wasn't all bad except what the killer wanted and when an ending leaves you groaning it usually drags a movie down.",Scream 4
204,scootmandutoo,Wanted to like this but...uggh,4,23 August 2011,"I have to say that just getting through the final 20 minutes of Scream 4 was pure torture.We get that the Scream franchise is all about self-reverential humor, but the phone device was so overdone that it just became annoying. And even with a filter, there is NO WAY that voice was produced by either of the 2 killers.But what really makes this film bad was the combination of having to watch Neve Campbell do this entire film in agony-face (she always appears to be having cramps) and, even worse, listening to her niece explain why she chose to kill. It was thoroughly unbelievable.I won't bother rehashing that message here, but it is a sorry, cynical statement about the state of youth that Wes Craven is making. After the recent Norway slaughter it's not especially amusing.Additionally, knowing about the real-life breakup of Cox and Arquette made their scenes especially painful to watch. Yet, they seemed to be referencing it.Oh, one more thing. The killings are quite prolonged and violent. What it doesn't show in explicit gore, is more than made up for by extremely loud shredding and ripping sounds.Not a great night of movie-watching.",Scream 4
205,siobhanmckibbin,I am Screaming for them to stop!!,2,6 September 2011,"So Scream, it had original ideas and a new concept to the horror genre in the 90's. Then came Scream 2; it was okay but not memorable. Scream 3 was a disaster and Scream 4, well it was even worse. The Scream franchise should of definitely quit while they were ahead.Sideny, Dewey and Gale are back for another instalment to fight against Ghostface. This time the movie has been revamped, and the fresh outset of the film takes on a new youthful cast for more blood and gore. Unfortunately, thats where my enthusiasm for the movie ends.The new plot is predictable and quite frankly old. The new cast are pretty wannabes who cannot act. And as for the original cast who make a reappearance; will you ever die??? The only thing i was unsure of with regards to this film was who was the new ghostface,, which was actually laughable when it was revealed. There are twists (predictable i may add),but by the time you had gotten through to the end of the movie, i didn't actually care.As a fan of the first Scream, to say that i am disappointed by yet another instalment in the Scream franchise is an understatement. Wes Craven is capable of so much more, so i am giving him the benefit of the doubt for directing this one.So what's your favourite scary movie? Definitely not Scream 4 thats for sure.",Scream 4
206,nickzbekool,4 times the terror!!! a true horror masterpiece,10,20 April 2011,"1 of the greatest horror sequels ever and the best 4th movie ever!!!!! a true roller-coaster ride that never lets up... funny, merciless, terrifying, fun,twisty, smart, and incredible!! the terror starts when Sydney Prescott returns to her hometown Woodsboro after she survived many vicious attacks from Ghostface.

A true Scream of terror and laughter.",Scream 4
207,Braindead09,Scre4m,8,15 April 2011,"The film is that rare commodity a bona-fide good sequel, especially for a franchise. The return of the trio from the first three movies actually works simply because they are no longer fresh faced and in the years between part three and four have lived lives.The film cleverly opens on a series of false starts, and I hope more were shot as a DVD extra.The only faults are it drags a little in places,mind you name one Wes Craven film that doesn't. In retrospect the final section of the movie was sign posted in the first third of the movie.If there is another sequel, time to leave Woodsboro and Neve Camobell behind, this is a good film to end this chapter. Move the Scream legacy elsewhere and with new characters.Some nifty tunes are played during the closing credits.In the UK this received a 15 rating and I honestly believe the distributor was lucky to get that rating, the killings were pretty graphic and in close up. The previous three films were actually less violent and received an 18 certificate.",Scream 4
208,oscarxp25,Scream 4 Review,4,19 April 2011,"We have all been waiting for this movie to come back. You can count on both hands how many horror movies have borrowed or down right stolen the formula that the ""Scream"" franchise has created. There have been some successful copycats, but most of them fall short because they couldn't capture the fine line that ""Scream"" perfectly walked. So how is ""Scream 4""? Sadly, it has become a victim to it's own success.Usually, when things in a franchise go south, you can blame it on the departure of the original director and screenwriter, right? Nope, not here. Both director Wes Craven and screen writer Kevin Williamson have returned. You can't blame it on the disappearance of any of the old cast members either. Survivors David Arquette, Neve Campbell, and Courtney Cox have all returned to be in the movie that made them stars. The problem is that the five people I just mentioned all return, but seem like they are all phoning it in.Heroine Sydney Prescott (Campbell) has returned to the town where it all began. She is now a published author, who returns to do a book signing. Dewey and Gale (Arquette and Cox) are now married, and he is the sheriff of the town. Prescott, is staying with her Aunt and little cousin, Jill (Emma Roberts). The rest of the characters, outside of Kirby (a surprisingly good Hayden Panettiere), are are expendable and don't have the charm of any of the characters of past ""Scream"" films. Usually, the victims have little to no character development, which is understandable since they are just meat for Ghostface to stab into, but to call these characters one dimensional would be a compliment. The original ""Scream"" characters had a certain character trait that connected them to us: Randy's humor or Cotton's bravery. We feel nothing for these characters when they get knocked off.Williamson's screenplay doesn't do anything different. He sticks too close to the formula he created. The digital age part of the movie was a nice touch. He gives us a good insight into how a killer from this generation would do everything more elaborately than a killer from the 90's. Once again, the answers to the questions of how the killer operates is in the hands of the cinema geek at the local high school. And once again that person is a main suspect along with the creepy ex boyfriend of Jill. Williamson tackles the theme of remakes in this, but while he tries to do a commentary on it, he sucks the fun out of it. Many of the elements in this film, outside of the recycled characters have been seen in the other three movies. Nothing feels fresh or new outside of the insertion of the media devices (twitter, facebook, etc). The great Wes Craven seems just as lazy as Williamson. Yes, there are a few brilliant moments in the film, but nothing really stands out. All the kills are pretty standard. Even though it does carry an R rating, the violence isn't as bad as the older films. Finally, the ending...the motive, killer, and end scene are just too much of a parody. The performance by the performer (keeping it gender neutral) is just so hammy as is the reasoning for the murders.FINAL MARK UPS (out of 10) Acting (6): It is a slasher film, so you aren't expecting anything resembling Shakespeare. Panettiere, gives a performance that surprised me. She is the most fleshed out of the new characters. The killer will be nominated for a Razzie (the awards for worst acting) Directing (5): Nothing new here. Craven sticks to the same routine and it never feels dangerous.Writing (4): Some funny one liners, but very weak material. The ending...Oh, God.. How did anyone think this was a good idea? Wild Card= Horror/Scares (6): There are some good boo moments in the film, but for the most part it feels very tamed for an R movie.Final Word: Has the golden age of horror really passed us? ""Scream"" was the king of horror, but this film just falls flat on almost every level. Is the standard of horror going down thanks to the cheap scares we have endured over the last ten Pg-13 years? Will it ever come back? I hope so, because Wes, you can do MUCH better than this.Star rating (out of 4): 1.5 Stars",Scream 4
209,jwtrox08706,"Say What You Want, They Still Got It...",8,3 May 2011,"OK, so SCRE4M isn't nearly as good as the original, but I could easily call it the best sequel of the series. What Scream did to the minds of audiences in 1996, SCRE4M does to the likely more sophisticated and savvy minds of 2011—not that people were stupid in '96, they just hadn't seen what Scream brought to the table, yet. If you liked all of the Screams so far, this one is for you. If you haven't seen the first three, it's probably best you check them out before you see this one, but not overly necessary. I recommend it to anyone who likes a scare, and a good murder mystery. I give this one an 8/10.*OK, IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MOVIE SPOILED, STOP READING, NOW* *FINAL WARNING* *OK, THEN* SCRE4M truly brings the series into the 21st Century with all the mass comm. tech. we have right now, and uses every bit of it. Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson did a phenomenal job of keeping the audience on their toes. Only right before the big surprise at the end did I figure it out, and that's saying something...usually. The big surprise at the end brings to light certain social issues that are prevalent in today's society. Issues like everyone wanting to be famous instead of make a living and privacy becoming harder and harder to find. With cameras, phones, Internet and other mass. comm. devices we all have, the curtains have been drawn, and there you are for the whole world to see. The film is well-casted, well acted, well-shot and well...not as scary. It's more of a action thriller with a twist of horror, another ""who done it"" murder mystery like the first three. But in today's world of Saw, Hostel, The Ring and Paranormal Activity being considered horror, this film is made out to be more of an action thriller. I went into this film thinking I was going to see another bad sequel. I was just going to see how my favorite characters are since the last time I saw them 11 years ago. They've aged a bit, moved up and down in the world since last we saw them, and even had some work done, but they're still there. Excellent work Kevin and Wes as well as the entire cast and crew. You get my approval and recommendation. 8/10",Scream 4
210,0maro0,a way to destroy scream trilogy,1,14 July 2020,"To be honest, from the poster and year of production I expected it to be somehow worse than the original - to lack certain atmosphere 90s and early 00s films usually have. I just didn't expect it to be so bad. I guess the main problem is the film not being able to reconstruct this sweet 90s vibe due to change of times and change of tech, but in the same time not being able to recognize some other atmosphere, to invent something new. while scream 1,2,3 was a series of grandiose meta-commentaries on horror genre, while they just so harmonically worked as a whole and felt so alive due to authors having a firm grasp on the epoca and its cinematography, scream 4 just seems like a piece no coherent person would ever create. times changed, but it seems the authors didn't change with it, since the whole thing appears to be a futile attempt to be hip and aware of current cultural logic and cinematographic tendencies. ""futile"" is the key word here, since every time fourth wall is broken it's just embarrassing - it feels just like a bunch of random commentaries of questionable truth being brought together without any connection to each other or the plot. the incredibly weak plot that lacks interesting story, and suspence, and empathizing characters, and god forbid even lacks good killings. so, all the good things about scream trilogy are completely gone - the gore, the plot and the grand commentary here are nowhere to be found. why anyone would watch it and genuinely decide it was good is beyond me... people like that either enjoy films of obviously low quality in some ironic way or just lack any taste in cinema. probably. regardless, this film doesn't worth anyone's time.",Scream 4
211,Silberfalke,To much of everything,6,22 October 2011,"I liked all 3 Scream movies and was pretty much looking forward to the unexpected sequel, glad that Wes Craven directed it again. But was it worth the wait? Not really. It was literally to much of everything that made the Scream movies great, but lacking story and dramaturgy. I loved the beginning gag (and the cameo by Anna Paquin, but thinking about it now, it was symptomatic for the development. The references to ""how horror movie sequels work"" became annoying after a while. The acting was not really convincing (especially Emma Roberts was horrible towards the end), but it was cool to see the whole crew (Sydney, Dewey, Gale) again reunited. All the killing did not really help the character development that makes you ""care"" for the victims... It was entertaining for nostalgic reasons, but unlike 1 to 3, I don't really want to see Scream 4 more than once...",Scream 4

But Scream 4 is a very good movie, both as part of the franchise, but also as a stand alone.It is far more self-referential than you would expect. Barely a scene passes without the characters referencing movie conventions. But it does so in what I think is an intelligent way. And most importantly (for our enjoyment) Scream 4 makes fun of itself before we can get there. Just when you start to roll your eyes, they roll their eyes.But it also stands as a good slasher flick - perhaps the LEAST slasher-y of the lot so far (it can't be everything after all) but there are plenty of jump-in-your-seat moments.The combination of old generation cast and new generation is actually seamless, again lots of self-referencing about that too.The highlights are too many to name - but the opening of the movie will have you laughing far harder than you'd have expected to.Overall, Scream 4 is excellent.",Scream 4
213,phaylen,Scream 4 blemishes the franchise.,10,26 April 2011,"What made scream legendary in the Horror genre was it's bravery. It took pop culture awareness along with an entire cliché drama and made Horror films FUN again. That's what won the world over, it was fresh, clever and a roller coaster of excitement and unpredictability! They fearlessly took familiar Hollywood personalities like Drew Barrymore, Keri Russel, Portia Di Rossi, Rose McGowan, Parker Posey, Liev Schriber, Sarah Michelle Geller and Jada Pinkett-Smith and had the battling (or succumbing too) the menacing and mysterious Ghost Face as a gripping mystery unraveled throughout the trilogy. I was one of those young people waiting in line on opening night of all 3 Scream films, and watched as die hard fans relished in excitement over the films immeasurable iconic ""Opening Death Scene""!I waited 11 years for Scream 4. The 3 core characters were all back together making the perfect storm once again! I expected a cast of recognizable figures, another brilliant mystery and a fun-filled roller coaster ride of white knuckle chase and death scenes.What I got? A long, boring, unintentionally funny slasher flick. The death scene was swift and terribly uncreative. There was more blood - MUCH more blood than any of the other Scream films. Ghost Face may as well have stood around with a pellet gun and knocked off the cast like ducks in an arcade game. It was quite like Scream 4 succumb to the very thing that it was famously spoofing. A bland, inferior sequel.The opening sequence was more like a series of brief, resounding WTF moments, and with the exception of Anna Paquin, containing actors I had never heard of. It could be that I'm older now and perhaps they were trying to reinvent the franchise for the next generation, but I found the casting dull and uninspired. The schtick of casting familiar names, which gave the Scream series so much novelty, seemed lost this time around. It came across more like what one might expect a direct to DVD film to be.I appreciate the effort made in telling the story. The plot was not terrible, there was this unexpected moral statement that they seemed to be making about fame and the consequences of it. The primary core cast, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette seemed reduced to mere props intended to set up carry the story since the execution of a very good and provocative concept was so executed so weakly. In my opinion, one of Wes Cravens worst films. There was so much incredible potential here, but it failed miserably on delivery. It made his last revisit to a popular horror franchise, We Craven's New Nightmare, seem like a masterpiece - and truth be told, I DID love that one!",Scream 4
214,tonyjea92,Scream 4 made me JUMP!!!!!!,8,14 April 2011,"It's a rare occurrence in the horror genre where a sequel can be better or just as good as the original. Scream 4 is 1 of the few exceptions i think that exists. This sequel is just as good as the original but double the scares and double the ghost face killings. Its also good to see Neve,David and Courtney back together again after so many years apart and also Wes craven as the horror director. Plus seeing new faces like Emma Roberts or Hayden Panetierre was a nice touch to the franchise. However i noticed somethings in the movie that MAY have been a little too similar or just very different. Emma Roberts (Jill) well i found her motive the exact same as Roman's from scream 3 just out of pure jealousy for Sidney. And something was ""new"" about Ghostface like before he had to work at his killings by chasing or stabbing the victim a few times before they died except in this movie he stabs the victim once and they just fall which i thought was anti-climaticbut still Scream 4 met my expectations very well and i hope that it makes enough money so there will be a Scream 5",Scream 4
215,boy_in_red,The Scream series back on form,8,15 April 2011,"I've just come back from an early showing of Scream 4- I was adamant that I would watch the film before anyone revealed any spoilers, so rest assured this review will be spoiler free.Scream is a series I have a lot of affection for. The first film was released while I was in my teens and it seemed to single handedly revive horror films on the big screen. As a fan of old school franchises like Elm Street and Friday 13th, it was a very exciting time, and more so the Scream films seemed particularly fun for those who had a knowledge of horror- naming the rules and clichés while twisting them enough to keep us glued to the screen.Scream 3, however, was a limp entry into the series. Kevin Williamson's writing was missed and somehow the horror series had transformed into pure Hollywood pastiche with some kill scenes (Jay and Silent Bob cameo, anyone?).The return of Kevin Williamson was the reason I actually held hope for Scream 4, and in short he doesn't disappoint. Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette all reprise their roles in this instalment, but we're also introduced to a younger cast of high schoolers, including Sidney's niece Jill.I was initially afraid that this film would be Scream- The Next Generation with a bunch of younger faces reducing the characters we know and love to nothing but bit parts, but thankfully i think a good balance is found to please old fans and new. Sidney, in her attempts to protect her niece, is now the voice of wisdom, a survivor who can share the strength she has in protecting Jill.In contrast, Gale Weathers- Riley (nice nod at the double-barrel name there!) locks horns with the younger generation. She wants to reignite her journalistic career, to reclaim her identity post-marriage, but she's at odds with rapidly moving technology- live streaming video blogs, boys with their gadgets, even a killer who appears more techno savvy. Perhaps it sounds like Im reading far more into a horror film than I should, but as a writer Kevin Wiliiamson has always given his characters an emotional hook to draw audiences in.The film has some fantastic tense moments, as well as the occasional jump scare and plenty of comedy too- even mocking it's own self referential loop of commenting on films within films. A perfect mix of comedy, human drama, social commentary and scares- the Scream series is truly back!",Scream 4
216,DylanCanonge,Poetic Cinema!,10,27 October 2020,"Scream 4 is my favorite (after part 1), one of the best slashers I've seen (the movie is super underrated) ! A film that was undeservingly overlooked. It is so fun and really adds new elements to a concept that had been played out 3 separate times. This is horror satire at its best. It is so funny, while also thrilling with a side of some genuine terrifying scenes. If only we would've done it justice we could've had Wes on 5 and 6. The Scream 4 opening is so brilliant. I miss you Wes Craven.",Scream 4
217,drakula2005,"""The old generation's tragedy, the new generation's entertainment""",8,16 April 2011,"Back in 1996, the first Wes Craven movie from the Scream franchise ended, or should i say, began a whole new generation of horror movies.The suspense became bigger than before, and the hackneyed stories of torture, abandoned roads and stokers came to a relative end.The new-age horror began back then-a nice mix of humor, suspense, jump-scenes, blood and gore..and of course, the merge of some typical killer profiles in one.The result-Ghostface.So many movies have been made as a parody of the notorious killer and some of them have succeeded with it.But only one movie will come in mind when we speak of Ghostface- the Scream franchise.And this one sticks to everything we wanted.Saying that, i must admit i was very annoyed at the beginning of the movie, mainly because of the brainless chicks, with a ""135"" IQ, who got killed so stupidly.Maybe it should have been 13,5, who knows.But at the end, when i finally managed to control my anger, i come to realize, that was a satire, and a needed one.It comes to show that the series are still a lot of fun throughout and that's what matters.And speaking of fun, i must say that i was laughing in tears in some moments, and i was at the edge of my seat at others.This is, for me, the most important part of the movie, along with the twists, of course.Not many movies do that, and i surely don't remember the last one i saw it do that.Wes Craven did a great job working on his child, collaborating alongside Kevin Williamson, a very talented screenwriter, who shows why he's on board the movie.He did a great job making a very difficult story, considering the fact, that this is the four Scream installment.The movie was very creative as a new-age collaboration between young newcomers, some TV stars, like Hayden Panettiere (whom you probably haven't heard of, if you're not a TV geek, although it's hard to believe, or Emma Roberts, most famous as Julia Robert's daughter for now, although she is talented.) and the old dogs in the sight of David Arquette, Courtney Cox and Neve Campbell.So, this mix-up was cool to see.There weren't some off the chart performances, if i have to choose, i would say that David Arquette and Emma Roberts were the highlight-actors of the movie.There were some obviously comedic introductions, such as Adrien Brody and Anthony Anderson, playing two of the cops in the movie.What surprised me the most, was the sheer entertainment of the script, the twists and the movie connections, that were added.I can't think of any other movie, i've seen, that has so much references to other movies or people.They began referencing to the Saw franchise, The Hills Have Eyes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Psycho, Friday the 13-th, A Nightmare on Elm Street and so many others, including references of many of Wes Craven's previous works and actors such as Bruce Willis.But the movies were so many, and many, i couldn't remember them all.Let's say, that there was about 90% of the horror classics in the last 50-60 years or so added as a build-up quiz game to some of the murders.They were that many.Even the weapons those killers used, were added as trivia Q&A's.So the sheer entertainment, the laughs and scares and twists(which are very incredible, but convincing and untraceable for audiences until the very end, when they tell you about them, are great).The acting of some of the characters was great as well, and i was pleased.All those things being said, i think, that, as a fourth installment, this movie is sheer entertaining brilliancy, and a history in the making as well.I won't be surprised, if there is another sequel being planed in the future, because the movie was great, as long as it doesn't make you a little angry at the very beginning, in the few opening scenes.Then, you should be alright.So a fun, memorable ride and the Scream franchise is at it's entertaining best, alongside the first.You will laugh and you will scream but eventually, you'll definitely like it.My note 7.5/10 for the best horror movie in the last couple of years and the best Scream since the first.A great entertainer! P.S.Go see it with as many friends as possible-it will be fun as hell!",Scream 4

They were great the first time, but they've lost something after being microwaved.

POSITIVE
Its great to see our 3 main characters again and how they've changed the last couple of years. How they've grown to stand on their own and grow through everything that's happens to them especially Sidney.
The acting is excellent, I cannot complain about anybody except Anthony Anderson, he's just not a good actor and he always makes things humorous that shouldn't be humorous luckily he dies quickly. Never still shines as Sidney and so does David and Courtney. Loved Hayden pannetiere , and that her characters fate was left ambitious. Great scares and locations . The ending was amazing!! Possibly the best ending of them all. The movie reminded me allot of the original in some ways which was greatNegative
Anthony Anderson is the only actor I will complain about, he's just an awful actor and he always bring his stupid humour to everything , luckily he dies quickly so he doesn't hurt the film too much
Too much humour and self awareness, nothing horror comedy like or anything the story still treats itself as very serious, just too much humour at times , liked silly Anthony Anderson pransing around after his been stabbed in his forehead with a long kinfe! .
The score was not Marco beltramis best .
Great kills, the goriest of the series, especially Olivia s death which was so brutal",Scream 4
220,deandraslater,"An OK Time, But It's Not All It Could Have Been",6,26 June 2019,"The Scream series returns, but it's missing something that's hard to put my finger on. There's something so stale about much of the film. Campbell, Cox, and Arquette seem as game as ever, but they're mostly sidelined to make room for an unexciting group of new blood. Besides Hayden Panettiere as Kirby, these new teen characters don't make much of an impact at all and seem like a far cry from the usual victims that occupy a Scream film. One new addition in particular named Olivia feels more like a vampy cheap 80's slasher character who only exists to get killed. She has no personality whatsoever. This is the big issue with the film - we don't care when people die.Because of a lack of characters to root for and because the main trio rarely feels like they're in any real danger, it's hard to care a lot and the film turns into less horror comedy and more pure spoof. There are moments in this film that feel much more like a Scary Movie sequel than a Scream sequel and that's a shame. In the other Scream films, there was always a huge helping of humor, but there were also big dramatic stakes and tons of suspense and scares to balance it out. Scream 4 tries to go too heavy on the humor and it doesn't work at all.The film does come to life a bit during the finale where the killer is unmasked and the film finally hits just the right balance of humor and horror. The killer's motivation is truly both the funniest and most disturbing part of the film.With a few tweaks, Scream 4 could have really been something special, but as is, it's simply too goofy.",Scream 4

WRONG! This movie was intense from the very first 5 minutes! I was very impressed with the acting I didn't think some of the actors and actresses were ready for it but I was so wrong. The plot was great, I liked the twists and Wes Craven never disappoints for an amazing suspense movie.But Scream 4 can make you go from your heart racing from the suspense to making you laugh...a lot! All in all Scream 4 was a great movie and if you like horrors and suspense and thrillers then this movie is definitely one to see!",Scream 4
222,votesmall,So-so remake,6,21 October 2013,"It's no doubt that the Scream franchise is iconic horror. The harrowing twelve minute opening of the original film still sends shivers up and down my spine, and that is something few scary films ever do. It would seem that the Scream films didn't get worse over time, but rather just showed their age. Scream was original and intense. Scream 2 was almost as original and intense. It featured a better pace, more suspects and overall was a worthy follow-up. I may have been one of the few who actually liked Scream 3. It seems like really good movies like Jurassic Park 3, Jaws 2 and Scream 3 are always underrated. I liked how Scream 3 gave us more insight to Maureen's life and the history of the murders. In my opinion, Scream 3 had the best Ghostface as well. So, what's wrong with Scream 4?Well, not much. Scream 4 is still a Scream film, which means that you're in for a ton of fun. Laughs and gore galore combined with some pretty decent suspense to boot. That being said, in my opinion, Scream 4 is inferior to its predecessors. Scream 4 is all about the clichés of remakes. Nobody really asked for them and to be honest, nobody even knows why they're around. The script writes itself when you are spoofing an entire genre of needless remakes. However, it seems like Scream 4 almost becomes a remake. All of the new characters, in some way shape or form, are clones of the original characters. Scream 4 is technically a remake, not a sequel. This is clever, but it does lead to another downgrade. In Scream 4, instead of trying to develop new characters with unique personalities, like Williamson does so well, he pretty much creates annoying characters who are hopelessly dependent on their original counterparts. It's quite sad because the previous characters in the original trilogy were all so memorable. I feel like rather than working to its advantage and only furthering the satire on remakes, making Scream 4 into a remake itself only hurts the film rather than makes it better. The killers have an interesting motive and I'd be lying if I said that Emma Roberts didn't do a pretty good job as the sociopathic Jill, but these killers are hammy as hell. Their motive is downright terrible and they are not even close to realistic killers. I thought Charlie would be so desperate for acceptance that he would kill, but Jill? Come on. The only characters in this film that I found enjoyable were Kirby and Olivia, and they were both killed off! (Well, technically all of the new characters were killed off, but that only furthers my point that the remake theme hurt the film). But I think my biggest problem with the film is how far it strays from he darker themes of the original trilogy. The killers in Scream 4 are horrible, and the fans of this film are likewise. A generation of teenagers who are only familiar with garbage like ""Paranormal Activity"" are exposed to this and don't realize the importance of the original films. Due to the fact that Scream 4 is technically a remake, it is beloved by this crowd. And whereas the fans of the original trilogy had respect for the films and their importance, these fans are much more obnoxious. They make up bogus theories and worship characters that are bland. One of my least favorite of these theories actually suggests that Jill survived, despite being shot IN THE HEART. Yeah. I'm a teenager myself yet I know that Scream 4 is not better than the original trilogy, but try telling that to these people. This brings me to another point. The killers in this film suck. Plain and simple. I mean, they suck. But again, try telling this to the teenagers. There was a poll on the Scream Wiki about the best killer, and 291 people voted for JILL. Yeah! Billy was second, with 91 votes. These people actually suggest that these lame villains with a horrendous motive are actually better than Billy and Stu. WOW. Again, this fan base is out of control in how little they understand why the original films are so great. In short, Scream 4 didn't really need to be made. Scream 3 was a pretty decent conclusion to a dying concept for some cash. Unlike the previous films, Scream 4 feels entirely made for profit. It seems like it wasn't done to further the themes of the trilogy but rather spoof the remakes as an easy way to make money. This isn't without saying that this is still a great film. It's a Scream film, and despite being inferior to the previous films, mainly due to a forgettable cast (with a few exceptions), it is still really good. It's got some funny moments and also some frightening ones. It's not as good as the others, but it is still good. I still bought it, and I'll watch it occasionally with the others. Why keep kicking a dead horse?",Scream 4

224,Filmaholic78,As good as the first film if not better!!!!!,8,24 April 2011,"If you are a fan of the Scream series then this is a must see.If you liked the first film but thought the next two were rubbish then this is the film to watch.If you haven't seen any of the Scream films....what rock have you been hiding under?...but go and see it anyway.I loved it. The first film will always be a classic and I felt that the second and third instalments were a bit over the top, they under achieved and a left a sour taste in my mouth.This instalment saves the franchise hands down. It sticks to its roots planted in the first film and is great to watch from start to finish. I have to say I was a bit apprehensive about going to see Scream 4 as I wasn't sure if they were just milking the brand for more money but they didn't.The only slight issue I had was Courtney Cox's botox. My god she has had some work done and at one point I wasn't sure if she could smile, frown or do any other facial expressions. Still she reprieved her role as Gail brilliantly.Go and see this film. It gets two thumbs up from me and it's just great fun to watch, you won't be let down.",Scream 4
225,FanPerspective,"'Scream 4' is smart, hilarious and unpredictable!",9,25 April 2011,"It has been ten years since the last Scream film and finally Wes Craven has taken another 'stab' at the greatest horror franchise of this generation. From the opening sequence you are glued to the screen as the film does not miss a beat. Reminiscent of the original film from 1996, Scream 4 finds Sydney returning to her hometown of Woodsboro on the anniversary of the original murders and only one thing can happen when Sydney is in town... Ghostface returns to butcher a new generation of teens, this time in bloodier ways than ever before! Everything that has always been so great about this series shines through, brighter than ever, in this fourth installment. The film is smart while delivering the laughs as it pokes fun at awful horror clichés while also building up a brooding suspense that really unnerves you. To top it all off, throughout the entire film you are in a wild guessing game of who the killer is and the ending is the most unpredictable of the series, yet! The writing is so swift and smart, only enhanced by the film's wonderful alumni and young cast! It truly is a new decade with new rules and it is one fun time at the movies!",Scream 4
226,WandrinStar,Scream 4 (2011),6,24 April 2012,"69/100. What is it about fourth installments in slasher franchises that make them a cut above the rest? Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, and to a lesser extent A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master all delivered; but Scream 4 may be the best of the bunch. Kevin Williamson makes a welcome return to the franchise, and it's his witty script that is the catalyst for the film's success. If Scream 2 played on slasher sequels, and Scream 3 parodied film trilogies, than Scream 4's motive was to make jabs at Hollywood's current slate of green lighting disappointing remakes and torture porn. This in part helped create the best ending killer reveal/struggle since the first Scream. Seeing the series' three main survivors Sidney, Gale, and of course Dewey ten years later in life was a treat. The new crop of teens that led some before the release of a possible reboot featured an entertaining group of new teens highlighted by the gorgeous and irresistibly quirky Hayden Panettiere who somewhat steals the spotlight from Emma Robert's character whom many thought would take over Sidney's role in future installments up to the release. With that said the movie did have some glaring flaws. Some of the acting was pretty lousy (I'm looking at you Alison Brie) and the score was pretty lifeless which is surprisingly given Marco Beltrami's work in the original trilogy. The opening sequence was praised by many critics, but I wasn't nearly as crazy about it. Although Williamson's meta dialogue has always been a hallmark for the series, Scream 4 tended to relay it a bit much which may have overly affected a new generation not familiar with the series to perhaps not take the film as serious as they maybe should have. But for those of us fortunate enough to have seen and enjoyed the proceeding Scream movies, Scream 4 is great entertainment that celebrates the original while also positively continuing the franchise's story arc. Scream 4 successfully makes the transition to a new decade by commenting on current horror trends rather than recycling old 90's material. Here's hoping Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, and Wes Craven churn up a fifth Scream in the future.",Scream 4
227,ChristophCinema,Takes the fun out of the genre,5,21 June 2013,"I think it's no news to anyone that the horror genre has been slightly lacking in recent years. All we see is sequels, prequels, and remakes anymore, and fans are sick of it. Thank God there's movies like Scream 4 around to remind us how terrible modern day horror films really are. Now, the first Scream was a pretty clever horror flick. A slasher movie where the main characters know the rules and clichés of past slasher movies. It's no wonder people call this ""the film that brought an end to the slasher genre"". Then part 2 came out, and I really enjoyed that one too, maybe even more than the original. Then the 3rd one came out, and we thought, ""This is getting kind of old"". Then, like most franchises of the 80s and 90s, we got the delayed sequel, Scream 4 (or Scre4m for those who are impressed when the sequel number is fused with the title), which people should be calling ""the film that brought an end to the horror genre in general"". I thought that this was a very entertaining movie, and I only watched it because I knew it was going to be dumb, but my God, there is so much this movie gets wrong.First of all, I'd like to say that I didn't hate this movie, I found it pretty entertaining, and there are definitely worse horror movies out these days, I just want to point out what's wrong with this film, because it belongs to a famous franchise.First of all, I immediately lose interest from the opening scene. Phone call, ""Who is this?"", ""What's your favorite scary movie?"", stab stab. But there's a twist; it's all just a movie. Then one of the people watching the movie stabs the other one in another twist. But oh no, it's two girls watching two girls watching two girls get murdered. It's a movie within a movie within the movie. Next, the killer comes in and kills the girls, but why should we care. All the excitement was already faked out twice, so who cares if these two girls we don't even know get killed in forgettable ways? Moving on. One major flaw this movie has is that it's just predictable and forgettable. After the opening scene, I had this movie figured out. I knew exactly what was going to happen, and I could even predict what some of the characters were going to say next. Also, there is not one memorable kill in this movie. Say what you want about the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Friday the 13th"" franchises, but at least they make their kills different from the previous films. I get it; it's making fun of slasher flicks. Well in slasher flicks, the killers usually use more than a knife. It takes all the fun out of the genre, and it gets old real fast. The main thing I hate about this film is how pretentious it is. It's big on bashing remakes and reboots, and it acts like it's this groundbreaking, intelligent, post-modernism horror film with something to say, when really, it's just all the same crap we've seen before. This film acts as both a sequel and a remake, but this movie doesn't really add anything new. You've got Sidney, the friends, the expendables, the family, the press, the cops, the horror movie nerds, the ""obvious"" suspect, and the killer, add a few classic horror references and horror fake outs, and that's it. Yes, just like every other movie in this franchise. Even the ""climax"" is a rip-off of the first film, and it comes off as lazy rather than clever. And possibly the worst thing about this film is the killer's motivation. I know I'm spoiling it, but I have to say something about this. First off, there are two killers, and their reasons for killing is probably the stupidest in the whole franchise. The one guy wanted one of the victims to ""show interest in him"", and the girl was jealous of Sidney's fame from her encounters in the previous filmsreally? That's it? That's why these people kill? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. That's not the motivation of a slasher movie villain, that's the motivation of a Scooby Doo villain. And what makes it worse it that the Scream movies are supposed to be more realistic than other slasher films. These villains aren't at all believable, and their motivations don't make them the least bit sympathetic. I would buy it if they were portrayed as mentally unstable, but no. They killed because they wanted something they could've easily gotten if they had just spoken up.The problem with the Scream franchise is its refusal to change. The heroes never change, the fact that the killer is always someone new makes the villain very uninteresting, and the whole self awareness aspect of it all just takes the fun and charm out of all slasher films. I think the film tried to say something about how our society is obsessed with tragedy and violence, but all I got from it was, ""All horror movies today suck, and audiences are too stupid to see that"". Only one problem Scream 4that's exactly what you are. It's a cliché, unoriginal, bad (yet still enjoyable) horror movie talking down to other cliché, unoriginal, bad horror movies.",Scream 4
228,NozinAroun81,GHOSTFACE RETURNS for more of the same.,5,7 September 2011,"THIS FILM IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO REVIEW PROPERLY WITHOUT SPOILERS!The year was 1996. I was at the peak of my horror flick obsession when my favourite Horror Meister unleashed his latest creation upon the world, Ghostface! Like most people, I loved every minute of the original Scream. Wes Craven had singlehandedly reinvigorated the ""Slasher"" genre. What followed was an endless string of poor imitations such as I Know What You Did Last Summer & Urban Legends as well as ""fresh"" installments of Friday The 13th & Halloween, to name a few. Regardless of how hard they tried, they never managed to ""Wow"" the audience in quite the same way as Scream.Unfortunately it wasn't long before Mr Craven tainted his original masterpiece with 2 lackluster sequels. The main flaws in these follow- ups were the introduction of a whole host of new characters, most of whom would serve as mere dagger fodder, whilst 1 or 2 of them are randomly selected as the new killer(s). I was hugely disappointed by the ending of the Scream 2. It's almost as if Wes picked his 2 new killers out of a hat. I was really hoping the twist would be a little more exciting. Oh how I would've loved to discover that Gale or Dewey were involved from the start, preferably Dewey because he's a cop and he always ends up ""left for dead"". No such luck. Timothy Olyphant & Laurie Metcalfe were the new killers. These characters uttered a few lines each throughout the course of the film and I couldn't help but feel cheated by this outcome. Especially the revelation that Metcalfe was Billy's Mum, a corny nod to Friday The 13th. Needless to say I was even more disappointed by Scream 3. The fact that there was only 1 killer is bad enough (if anything there should have been 3 or even 4), but to confound matters by making the killer Sidney's recently introduced long-lost brother left a very bad taste in my mouth. In the closing moments of Scream 3, as Sidney stares at the back door of her home, I truly expected something astounding to happen. Then the credits rolled.It's a decade later and Wes has somehow convinced Neve, Courtney & David to reprise their iconic roles. The price must've been right. Scre4m has a very impressive cast and some rather cool cameos, chief amongst them being Anna Paquin & Kristen Bell who share quite an intense moment near the start of the film. It might just be my imagination but the 3 lead actors seem a little bored. Emma Roberts (Niece of Julia), Hayden Panettiere (The Cheerleader from Heroes) & Marley Shelton (Planet Terror) do an okay job considering. Macauley Culkin's little brother Rory doesn't seem to be trying very hard. The rest of the cast aren't given much time to win you over.The tongue-in-cheek humour is still very much present and this 4th installment still has plenty to recommend it. Sadly there are too many moments that will have you screaming at the screen... for all the wrong reasons. Ghostface has all the time in the world to stab Gale and yet for some reason the blade ends up in her shoulder, which would've been great, if Gale turned out to be one of the killers.Obviously the finale of this film affected my review the most. As you can imagine I spent the whole film trying to guess the twist (or lack thereof) and who the killer(s) would be. It's safe to say that I wasn't very surprised. To make matters worse, Sidney gets stabbed in the gut and the killers chat with her for about 10 minutes before stabbing her in the gut again. They assume that she must be dead. LAME! Almost as lame as Dewey getting knocked out by a bedpan... at which point Miss Shelton gets shot so blatantly in the shoulder.In a nutshell, Scre4m is just like Scre2m & Scre3m. The first 75 minutes has it's moments, but is ultimately ruined by the finale. Will a 5th installment make up for it? I doubt it! That's what I thought the 4th installment would do. Scratch that! That's what I thought the 3rd installment would do.",Scream 4
229,One_slice_of_pizza,Let's Play Hide and Stab,4,13 May 2011,"I love slasher movies and it's one of my favorite genres. The first scream movie was an epic come back after all those unsuccessful attempts. Nothing was as good as Halloween and Friday the 13th series and we slasher fans were craving for a new beginning, and Scream (1996) gave us what we wanted. Unfortunately like many other franchises, Scream lost its mojo and things started going downhill pretty fast. After 11 years of waiting, was Scream 4 just like what we were waiting for, or was it another disappointment?The movie starts with a hilarious opening scene and surprises the audience. You hold your hopes high, relax on your seat and start enjoying your delicious pop corn. But then, while you expect some extraordinary twist to happen, it keeps you waiting, waiting, and nothing happens...Boring conversations, anti-climactic dead end sub plots, bad acting ruins your mood and you realize that the pop corn you are holding might be the only entertainment option you have for the following 90 minutes. Scream 4 literally falls flat on its face and fails miserably. The dialogs, acting, directing and the story feels awkward and never gets anywhere. You feel like you are watching a cheap low budget imitation rather than the original.The only performance i liked was Hayden Panettiere's (Kirby), the rest of the cast looked like a bunch of amateurs who recently graduated from a no name acting school. They were 2 dimensional, dull, unlikeable characters therefore we did not care when they died.One of the best parts of a slasher movie(besides the story)has always been the creative killings. Like the ones we have seen on Saw, Final Destination (wasn't a slasher but close) Valentine etc. Scream 4 clearly does not give you that. Killings are cliché and most of the time they end with chasing, hiding and stabbing.Most importantly, the ending sucks as well. Because the film lacks of character development and building tension, when it finally ends, you feel empty. Not only the reason for killings does not make any sense, you also don't care. Of course, poor acting performance plays a big role in this as well. When you don't connect with the characters, you naturally couldn't care less about their destiny.Scream 4 is definitely doesn't have the fabric of the first one, nor has the quality of your favorite slasher. It may still be OK with a slice of pizza and your favorite beverage on a Friday night, just don't expect too much...",Scream 4
230,kat_777,thumbs up for Hayden and Emma...,7,2 January 2012,"this is definitely not a great like people say it is. Scream was good. Good thriller. But I was always against the idea of innocent victims dying for no reason. Or I would just prefer that the victims were blamed for one thing or the other. But this movie is the second best among the scream movie series. Because this movie had a twist, especially in deter ming who the killer is.Neve Campbell stuck with Sydney Presscott. She is more braver and tougher in this movie. Courteney Cox and David Arquette too were good.But the real acting credit should really go to the next generation. Emma Roberts, Hayden Panatierre, Rory Culkin etc.Emma Roberts was just superb. I became a fan of her after seeing this movie. She is beautiful and brilliant. She does reveal the dark side of her in a very stylish way. Hayden Panatierre is definitely a very promising actress. I loved the way she performed the scene.

I was very excited to see this film, and I am now at home eagerly waiting to go and see it again as well as really hoping this is the beginning of a new trilogy.First, nothing is overdone in the film. Second, nothing is contrived. Third, the script and plot is very inventive, has humility, yet plenty of scares. During the film, several scenes are reminiscent of scenes from the original trilogy.The film clocks in at almost 2 hours, which is long for a horror film.

234,nicki9112,Blast from the past...,7,17 April 2011,"Let me start off by saying that I'm a big fan of the Scream movies. The original Scream was the first scary movie that I ever saw. Last fall when I first heard talks of a Scream 4, I was pretty into it. I saw this movie last night and it took me back to my teenage days. It was kind of exciting to see Ghost Face back on the big screen.The thing about the Scream movies, is they are all about what you make them. You can't really take them too seriously. I never really go into them expecting to be scared. There more of a guilty pleasure really. The first was the best...nothing too ridiculous about it. Scream 2 & 3 were not as good but are still a couple of my favorite movies. I enjoyed Scream 4 up until the ending. Was not real pleased with who the killer/killers were. (won't tell you how many there were) The good thing about this movie is that it's entertaining and isn't afraid to make fun of itself and the horror genre. It also keeps you wondering who can be trusted and who can't. I think that all of the Scream fans will enjoy it. It does reference the other Scream movies quite a bit so I'm not sure how much you would get into it if you weren't already a fan of Scream. Will be looking forward to a Scream 5 & 6....",Scream 4

I thought when I saw that they were making this months ago I thought they were turn the franchise on it's head and come up with something new imaginative but frankly i don't believe they really cared about anything,fans or even the actors themselves I think it was simply a money maker. I think that if they make another one which I have heard they really really give it to someone else to see what they do with it because if that happens then it will be fresh and new. Also i have something about the dialogue whatwas that all about not giving any hints but just annoying. Oh well there's always Thor to look forward to.",Scream 4
237,jademcpherson18,Wow! Amazing.,10,29 December 2017,"Wow. What a movie. I'm a huge fan of the original trilogy of Scream movies and I was a little apprehensive about watching the fourth movie, afraid it would ruin it somehow. However, this film is superb.The core trio from the first three movies remain: Sydney is obviously the heart of the series but it's nice that Gale and Dewey are kept as supporting - they all survive every movie! While retaining the best of the first three, a fresh new cast are brought in also. I have to say Kirby is a personal favourite of mine for her sarcastic wit.The franchise is modernised by bringing in ideas about needing fans instead of friends and the hunger for fame. These really make a powerful commentary on society, I feel, and make the film starkly relevant.I love Wes Craven's work on this movie and I think his direction is perfect - God bless his soul. I really hope to see a Scream 5 someday to carry on his legacy.",Scream 4

239,AJ_is_Awesomness,SOOOO Much Better Than Scream 3,10,13 April 2011,"It has been too long since Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson teamed up to deliver the goods what with Craven concentrating on his rehash of remakes and Williamson penning the likes of the Vampire Diaries. It has also been too long since a good ""Scream"" movie hit theatres, after the dreadful Scream 3 passed by in a whimsical, so you can imagine my horror when Dimension announced they were reviving the sequel and adding a fourth movie on the end. Not only did I feel that the Scream franchise belonged soley to the 90's (and thus it avoided the campy 80's slash era and the 2000's torture gorn obsession) I also wondered how on earth would they pull it off, after more than ten years since the last intalment. Scream 4 or (Scre4m as it is being cleverly marketed) follows the usual concept behind a re-visited sequel. The main characters from the previous movies end up re-uniting for whatever reason, the killer has an even more ridiculous motive that is as nonsensical as it is insane (or in this case obsessive), the body count is once again cranked up and the in-joke references are gracelessly thrown in. The result is a good rehash that hovers somewhere between the greatness of Scream and the finely rendered shocks of its first sequel. The plot is fairly thin, and sees the series protagonist, Sidney Prescott returning to her hometown of Woodsboro following the 10 year anniversary of the famous Woodsboro Murders, to promote her new book. Here, Sidney's younger cousin Jill (excellently portrayed by the fantastic Emma Roberts)attends her old high school and the towns sheriff is non only than Dewey Riley who is now married to the cantankerous Gale Weathers. Unfortunately, a serial killer cottons on to the fact that Sidney's last stop on her book tour is Woodsboro, and takes it upon him (or her)self to start a new reign of terror, evoking horrifying memories for Sidney, Dewey and Gale who must once again solve the mystery behind Ghostface.There you have it- a simple minded plot that strides on familiar territory whilst managing to twist the story elements enough for the audience to focus on solving the mystery. What Scre4m does well is to build up enough tension for the audience to be scared whilst also being funny enough for the same audience to laugh out loud. There are some genuinely gruesome scenes in this one. The opening is gut wrenching and very well thought out, but it is also hilarious and sets the overall blackly comic tone the rest of the movie glides on. The kills are actually quite original, and there are plenty of them. The acting borders on very good to corny and wooden, as does the writing (they had to pull Williamson's script and make changes and this is very noticeable.) Overall the cast do a good job, especially Neve Campbell who gets stuck into the role once again, and Emma Roberts as the lead. She is a great actress and she almost carries the movie when the three headlining stars are out of the picture. It is nice to see Courtney Cox post-Friends in her gorgeously over-the-top dramatics routine and David Arquette is as campy as ever. The rest of the cast are generally OK, especially Hayden Panettiere and Anna Paquin. Rory Culkin also does well filling the shoes of Jamie Kennedy in the comic role.Everything from the script to the direction is carefully painted. You can tell that despite the production problems Craven and Williamson had a blast. They throw in a few nods to recent movies, add in the old cat- in-the-closet scare and even take the pi$$ out of the Saw franchise so Scre4m is as playful and funny as it is scary. Don't get me wrong, there are some terrifying moments littered in there, but it all comes with a nicely polished laugh track that reminds us why Wes even bothered making the original in the first place. Now for the negatives. Whilst Scre4m makes good use of its young cast, it appears that Cox, Arquette and Campbell were underused in some scenes. Also Emma Roberts was not given enough screen time which is a shame as she plays a big part in the finale and yet we don't see her develop much as a character. She is just ""Sids cousin"" which is odd as she is is supposed to be the new lead. I found Culkins character slightly obnoxious and cliché at times, but he did a good job with what material he had. The ending was good, if not slightly absurd. The killer's motive is obviously well thought out but it seemed a bit far fetched for my liking. Overall though a great movie.So... here it is. Ten years in the making and finally Scre4m is ready for mainstream audiences. Craven and Williamson have crafted together a nice sequel that is funny, scary and a LOT better than Scream 3. Here's hoping Scre5m and Scre6m follow this lead.",Scream 4
240,edfie_f,Nothing to do with the originals,4,16 August 2020,The reason why I write this is because I don't understand a reboot full of young fresh new faces. The original trilogy is a contemporary masterpiece. When the cliche of self parody goes right up to the end with a few non-sense and self-referential jokes. Let's pretend the MTV show never happened because if you are a fan of Carpenter's nineties work it can be hurt. So if you are part of that established fandom do yourself a favor and turn off the TV.

241,squirtsquirt7,After ten years the 4th Scream film does not disappoint,9,15 April 2011,"I DON'T THINK THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT SOME OF YOU WOULD CLASSIFY AS A ""SPOILER.""When you think of the 4th sequel in a horror series, most people would groan or roll their eyes, but the Scream series is different. I have always been a big fan of these movies, the first one is a classic and the next two were worthy sequels. They aren't like other scary movies, where nameless characters get slaughtered by an unstoppable killer. The Scream movies feature real characters who you connect with and the 4th film is no exception.Sidney, Dewey and Gale, the 3 survivors from the original trilogy are back and it is so good to have them back, to revisit them after all these years. Neve Campbell doesn't seem to age, she is such a beautiful woman and great actress. David Arquette is a treat to have as clumsy yet brave Dewey, and Courtney Cox does a wonderful job once again in portraying the ruthless Gale Weathers. The new characters feel real as well and the actors, most notably Hayden Panettiere, do a great job in bringing them to life. I was also thrilled to have Roger Jackson back as ""The Voice,"" because it would not be a Scream movie without his chilling, ""Hello Sydney."" Seeing Sid go up against Ghostface again is so much fun to watch, especially for die hard fans of the series.Now to the story, I thought it was good, funny and entertaining. At times it felt like it was moving a bit too fast but the writing to me was still very sharp, it brought the characters together in a way that felt real, not cheesy or far-fetched. There is plenty of great humor and references to other movies as well as the previous 3 Scream films. The opening, as always in this series is fantastic and scary. It is so good to see Ghostface back and doing what he does best. The kills in the movie are central to the plot and have just enough gore without going over the top. At times it is very intense and exciting.Wes Craven also does a fantastic job, you can really see the direction he was taking the movie in. Bottom line: If you are a fan of the Scream series, you will love this movie, it is another great chapter in the Scream saga. And even if you haven't seen the other movies, first of all, where have you been all these years? And second, it's a fun movie to see, a good slasher flick, unlike most of the other horror movies that get made these days. 10 years is a long time, but in my opinion, after seeing Scream 4, it was well worth the wait!!!",Scream 4

It was violent and brutal at times but not as good as the first trilogy.",Scream 4
243,MovieCritic33-6,Scre4m,10,10 October 2011,"Scre4m is just as good as its predecessors (yes Scream 3 included), but is definitely the strongest sequel to Scream. Once again, Scre4m adapts to the new ""era"" of technology and film, and a lot has changed in eleven years, ""a new decade, new rules"". Sidney, Dewey and Gale, are reunited once again to put a stop to yet another madman's (or is it madmen?) bloody rampage. All three characters return with their usual solid performances, and it is a pleasure to see the chemistry of all three actors back on screen again.The new generation of Woodsboro High teenagers are also a pleasure to watch on screen, and as all Scream movies, delivered perfectly well rounded performances no matter the part, big or small. Character development for most of these characters is about the equivalent of Scream's first two predecessors, maybe a little more developed at best. But it never seemed to be an issue for me, as I always felt that the actors in the Scream movies did a good job bringing their characters to life and allow us to either feel sympathy and or empathy on some level.Although Kevin Williamson writes the script for Scre4m, Ehren Kruger should have been given credit for his involvement also (but then again after the reception of Scream 3 the producers probably didn't want to lose any of its core audience). I personally feel all of the dislike towards Ehren Kruger is merely because it was Kevin Williamson who started and created Scream and therefore only he can make a proper sequelI beg to differ, but then again I am a fan of the franchise not the writer.The only criticism I have about Scre4m is that it had a few noticeable hiccups with the story and script that made some plot elements ambiguous to the viewer, and didn't make too much sense if we are to believe the event is happening in real time, some elements just seemed a tad improbable. Also there was a moment I noticed a mistake in editing which also deals with continuity. Just don't overthink and you'll be fine.Wes Craven delivers another horror masterpiece with a terrific blend of wit, humour, pulse pounding suspense, horror, and a twist so twisted its sick. Scre4m is definitely one for the fans, the story grabs you and refuses to let go until the end credits. This successor will either make you jump or SCREAM! -MovieCritic33-6",Scream 4
244,arlum_meow,boart back the feeling scream 1 had.,8,28 July 2012,"scream4 had the strongest opening since the first. with 2 teenagers getting gutted by ghost face,then turns out to be a movie. after Kristen Stewart stabbing Anna paquin that was a shock, but the biggest shock is that was a movie iswell. then the real opening is here and as ushal ghost face kills 2 teenagers discussing horror movies.the new generation involving Jill Sydney's cousin, Kirby Jills best friend, then Charlie and Robbie friends of Jill and Kirby. all four i suspected were the killers.i would say this scream movie was probably the scariest of all. scream4 was full of twists turns and laughter.i must point out Rebbecca's death was very disappointing with her being killed quite early on in the film, especially when she was meant to be the new generations gale weathers.i must say i thought every single person in the movie was the killer at one point. because they did have a lot of characters. some say it was good having that much characters but i don't think so. the reason is because there were so many characters to get threw. most of the characters didn't have there own scene until there time was finally up which was quite disappointing.the big shock was the killer reveal 1)=JILL Sydney's cousin never in a million years i would think she would kill all her friends and her mum just to take the spot light of Sydney.2)=CHARLIE i was quite shocked that he joined in with Jill but if im honest i don't think he should have been the killer.overall scream4 boart back the feeling scream 1 had. i would 100% recommend this to a slasher fan. 8star",Scream 4
245,CinemaFrostedBetty,Fun and Fresh,8,17 May 2011,"Despite the lack of enthusiasm in the area, I was SUPER excited to catch horror icon, Wes Craven's, newest bloodbath, Scream 4 (2011)—along with only seven other Scream enthusiasts who made up the pathetic turn out at the 5:30 showing on opening day. In this self-satirical sequel of the highly popular Scream franchise, Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell), with completion of her most recent self-help book, is in the midst of wrapping up her nationwide book tour. Final stop—Woodsborro. Here she is once again greeted by familiar faces—Dewey (David Arquette), Gale (Courtney Cox), and of course, Ghost Face. But, amongst these veterans, you'll see some young, fresh faces including Emma Roberts as Sydney's teenage cousin, Jill, and Hayden Panetiere as Jill's sassy best friend and horror buff, Kirby. The fact that Craven chose ACTUAL teenagers for the fourth installment truly provides an interesting tone to the film. If we think back to the original Scream, the ""teen"" ensemble included a cast of full-grown adults PLAYING teens. Neve Campbell was 23 when she took on the role as 17-year-old Sydney Prescott. But because our protagonist, Sydney, has grown into a strong, mature, almost motherly female figure, we have to identify with her this way. We have walked through the four-part narrative in her shoes, and Craven's choice of younger casting only reminds us of how old we've grown with the Scream story. 15 years! It's a nostalgic feeling. Now, this is a great ideain theory. However, there was still something keeping me from appreciating the new characters (almost a ""what do they know"" feeling; they're only kids!). Sexuality remains a huge part of the horror genre and in terms of this particular film; I could not recognize the young cast as ""sexual"" or even ""desirable"" beings. This installment probably involves the least amount of hyper-sexual teens ever depicted in Scream—maybe even slasher movies in general. Sex does NOT sell in this case. What Scream 4 DOES sell is intelligent humor and brilliant predatory scenarios—what the Scream story has always sincerely given us. Though the story's grown old, the content certainly hasn't. In Scream tradition, we assume we know all the tricks and trades of the horror genre, but this sequel's fresh shockers teach us otherwise. Scream 4 tastefully utilizes traditional elements in combination with creative slaughter surprises. Ones that may or may not make you pee yourself, but will ultimately deliver a guaranteed great time. Although, I must say, I'm still a little impartial about the ending. Everything builds up so well in terms of plot, but the last half hour, one might feel a tad let down. It's an original ending, and certainly not a cop out, but it just seems like it doesn't fit. It just does not represent what the Scream franchise is all about—you'll know what I'm talking about after seeing it. Perhaps the DVD will provide alternate endings! Hey, a girl can dream or scream",Scream 4
246,abjerg01,"3rd one was bad, this one makes up with that...",8,4 December 2011,"Even though there's a lot of people hating on the 2nd movie it's actually my favorite in the series. The 1st one is of course a classic, but the 3rd was not even good at any points in my opinion. Silly, stupid and just awful to look at.Then so many years later a 4th one is made and my good my hopes were high for this one! I liked the way it was done, that it kinda made ""fun"" of some of the others in the series and of course still had that classic ""Scream""-humor to it. The only thing that disappointed me was the plot. I'm sorry but that was a little too stupid in my opinion and didn't make sense at all. Rest of the movie was great and exiting though and definitely worth a watch for fans of the movies, and horror overall.7/10 WATCH IT!",Scream 4
247,5h4d0w,Sums itself up in the first couple of minutes.,4,11 August 2011,"It's just as painfully kitschy and the characters just as stupid as it makes fun of in the beginning. Especially since Scream 4 makes this mistake of making people aware of it's stupidity right in the beginning, the following scenes seemed even more awful and it is even more difficult than usual to accept the illusion.But contrary to one misinformed character in the beginning, horror lovers of course know that there are slashers that don't adhere to the worst mistakes of the genre. Sure, they're not be perfect but e.g. Trick 'r Treat, Halloween (2007), Behind the Mask or Hatchet still provide the quality entertainment one expects from a slasher. And then there are of course foreign movies that go far beyond even that - like High Tension or Inside.I still gave it 4/10 mostly for technical reasons and because I guess there is some validity to its existence since sadly, there are probably many people who can actually identify with those characters. And for them, I suppose the movie could be a great ride. Because what destroys it for me is that when the characters are so awful, their lines so corny, I pretty much don't care about anything that is going on.",Scream 4
248,stinger01,a slash above the rest,9,15 April 2011,it is very very rare that you get a sequel that is equal and in some cases better then the original scre4m is one of those films the kills are not only impressive but also imaginative the characters are well drawn out and you really do start to like them overall it's a great film from the master of the genre Wes craven and writer Kevin Williamson who thankfully didn't go all vampire dairy's on us. The return of ghostface is very welcome and as always he delivers big time it's like all this time he was thinking of ways to kill Justin Berber ermmm i mean Sid this film is beyond awarsome you'll be scared when your meant to be you'll laugh when your meant to laugh,Scream 4
249,sidekicknick43,"""F*** Bruce Willis""",8,17 April 2011,"Ah, good old Ghostface makes a return in this age of reboots, remakes, and long awaited sequels to old favorites. This particular slasher makes a return in a movie that is commenting on a bit of them all.First, I give you my opinions on the others. Scream 1: 9/10 and certainly on my top 10 slasher list. Scream 2: 6/10. Just couldn't get into it. It had an opening that made me laugh, but not in a good way, and that awkward felling it left me with just stayed with me the whole time. Scream 3: Now, I haven't seen this one in a while, but I remember liking it more than 2. If memory serves me right, it was an 8/10.And now, Scream 4.As you know by now, we have the original cast returning (Arquette, Campbell, and Cox) and the parts are performed as good as ever, along with some okay to good performances by the new characters. Some of the smaller characters were a little ""meh."" Arquette could have upped his game a bit better. The suspense is good and so are the killings and make you go ""Oomph! That's gotta hurt!"" The humor is also pretty good most of the time and the movie never gets boring. That's probably the best thing I can say about it is that I was always into it and never even thought of dozing off.If you listen to many other reviews, they seem to like the opening says. Personally, I disagree. I could see how it may have worked in the script, but it didn't work on screen. When you see it, you might get what I mean. In the middle, the movie's problems are very minor. There's too many jump scares, most of the humor is good, but there are others where it feels like they're trying too hard, or it's just inappropriate. They could also have done a better job at reintroducing you to the characters. It's been a decade and we don't get much! The last gripe is the ending: The movie tries to make a statement at the end about how the appeal of fame can affect people and about why people get famous. It feels crow barred in and it maybe should have been brought up earlier in the film. Another thing is that the reveal and the explanation of motive and the laying out of the killer's plan-- I bought it, but it addresses an issue of overnight sensations and what people are getting famous for and I thought that should have been brought up sooner.Summary: Where the movie hits are the important parts. The parts where it misses are mostly minor, except for the beginning and end and some bad bits of humor and lack of reintroductions. I could see people come out loving it, I could see people not loving it.For me, it's 8/10",Scream 4
250,jamesba-640-753446,Solid Reboot,8,6 February 2021,"The second best in the Scream franchise, after the original of course. The humour was spot on and the gore and horror elements were back (relative to 2/3). The characters were memorable and did not do stupid cliched things. The twist was refreshing, which is hard to do in this franchise. The only issue is what to do with Gale, she had very limited amounts to do and was a waste of a character, real shame.",Scream 4

'Scream' was rumored to be over but returned in 2011.Now Sidney returns to Woodsboro and is reunited with a now wedded Dewey and Gail and her cousin Jil (Emma Roberts) 10 years after she was attacked by her step-brother. The opening scene is rather confusing however it starts with a phone call and ends with two deaths by ghost-face as always in the 'Scream' movies.The killer appears to tape the murders now as the new trilogy of 'Scream' begins and the suspect list grows again with a number of suspects Jil's ex Trevor Sheldon (Nico Tortorella) her friend Kirby Reed (Hayden Panettiere) and many more. Again the comedy grows throughout the movie contrasting with the horror killing and gore.The tension grows throughout the movie but the climax towards the end everyone becomes a suspect and who ever you thought it was it's probably not, it's a very unexpected killer.",Scream 4

They just get into it too fast.The movie is a joke, killings happen every second, it is too much of a comedy instead of a serious whodunit? Lastly, there is no development in determining who the killers are. They just randomly happened. Emma Roberts as the killer makes the most sense, but is very generic. Again, there was virtually no clues other than her motive that would make her the killer.Definitely skip this movie.",Scream 4

254,ScreamingBlackEyedPea,"Well done, with a few minor issues",8,16 April 2011,"As a huge fan of the 'Scream' series, I walked into the midnight screening excited yet nervous. This film could have been a hit or miss, a great addition to the series or a redundant, weak sequel. Ultimately, I enjoyed the film. The infamous opening sequence was hilarious, yet very brutal. However, I was disappointed that the real Woodsboro victims part was so short. It seemed to last only 4 minutes, which did not feel sufficient. The middle section of the film seemed to drag a little bit, especially the introduction to the characters following the opening. Once again, a minor issue. Once, the murders start happening, the pace really begins to increase. My final overall complaint with the movie was that it was too comedic and self-referential. There's only a certain number of times you can throw in a clever one-liner or a pop culture/horror film joke before it starts to get a bit annoying. Other than that, the film was a great experience as a die-hard fan. The ending was pure insanity, and did not end when I expected it to. 8/10",Scream 4
255,timesplitterz,"Ghostface returns for a 4th installment, but is it the scream for the current generation?",7,26 August 2011,"So here we are again back with the returning cast of the Scream series, but is this a new fresh film much like the 1st one? Or another Scream 3 with some upgrades? Truth is it's a bit of both in my opinion however let me start off by saying I found this to be a REALLY fun film to watch something I didn't find in the 3rd one. This film for me is 2nd only to the original and is how the 3rd film should of been, in fact if this was the 3rd one then the Scream trilogy would be one of my favourite horror trilogy's. That's not to say that this film isn't filled with flaws because it defiantly does have some but I'll get to them soon enough first let's focus on the positives. Scream 4 has one of my favourite openings for a horror film, this opening in my opinion is just as brilliant as the first one. The only thing it lacks is a brilliant performance like Drew's in the 1st, the girls in this opening just give off the typical 2D slasher performance of terrified hot teens. However thankfully it's not their performance that sells the opening it's how the opening is constructed, and how Wes so cleverly spins the audience on themselves and then begins to reel them in. The soundtrack in this film is awesome I loved the tracks right from the start when the title is displayed. Which brings me to reveal of the actual title, it's a wicked little thing just before we get the plot rolling. Rodger Jackson as Ghostface is brilliant as always but in this he's more terrifying then ever before, you can hear some much more twisted venom in his words this time around. I really liked the new cast of characters in this film, which surprised me because I was certain before watching the movie that I was going to hate them. I've found that in recent slasher flicks I've seen I just can't find a liking to any of the main characters which is important if you want your audience to feel a sense of urgency and worry during scenes in which the killer attempts or is succeeding in killing them. A lot of the time the film made me laugh and jump which is sort of the fun of slashes that I think are missing and is what I loved about the original. I did not see the twist coming until the very last minute it was revealed which means well done kept me guessing throughout the whole film another fun aspect I loved about the original. Now the flaws The main problem scream 4 has is that it forgets to do what made the original so brilliant which is to be self aware, now that's not to say that it doesn't completely, they mention how horror films have evolved through the years commenting on things like Saw and the whole torture porn aspect but that's about it. In one scene to try and get an idea of what the killer might do next they ask two film buffs about the new rules of horror films, which they reply ""modern audience have become savvy to the rules of the original"". Thats it!? That's all your gonna tell us? They do state other things that add to the new rules but it doesn't really show how they've evolved at all. People die in this film and yet their friends don't seem to care all that much, a girl dies and and a few scenes later her friends are fine about it. The film relies on the success of the 1st one a little too much and at times and forgets to be it's own film. some of the characters in this film feel out of place like they belong in a cartoon instead of a horror film. However most of the performances by are well played especially by Neve Campbell There's a few loose ends that never get resolved as well but they're hardly worth worrying about. Overall this is the best in the series 2nd to the original, it's fun, it's scary and jumpy and it's funny. Scram 4 is one of the best slahsrs I've seen in a while and also one of the most fun horror films in recent years. It has flaws but with this much fun it's easy to over look them.",Scream 4

The opening scene is epic and funny as well i loved it, the story it self is great and fresh, i really liked the movie and you should watch it in cinemas or buy it on a DVD when they release it on DVD, for the acting i liked Emma Roberts a lot she convinced me really, i really hated her in the movie after discovering that she's behind every thing i was like what the hell??? seriously?? _this is a good thing by the way_ so i grantee that you'll have a fun ride while watching this classic horror flick :D",Scream 4

The movie did its job entertaining and I enjoyed the pieces of wit laced throughout that felt Kevin Williamsy.In that first viewing of the movie the lack of real character development ala some people are merely caricatures, more like one note cartoon folk, did not detract from the experience. However, when this movie came out on Blu-ray I gave it another watch and: I was bored out of my mind. The second time through all of the flaws were too much to want to sit through and the charm it had on the first viewing was all used up.This is a must see for Scream fans, as it brings back all of the beloved characters, and it is rental worthy for sure. However, it just does not hold up for repeated viewing in my opinion and truly the only ones that do for me are part 1 and 2. Would I go watch a Scream 5? Yes. Would I watch ""Scream 4"" again? No.",Scream 4

Unfortunately, Scream 4 really didn't do it for me. I found Scream 4 to be the worst in this film franchise.The beginning of the movie reminded me of the very horrible Scary Movie franchise. Some of the cast's acting was also extremely lacking and amateur. And the plot/killer was ridiculous and horrible.I enjoy Emma Roberts and Hayden Panettiere as actors, but the plot of this movie really wasn't giving them anything to work with. Although, I found Hayden's acting and character to believable, I cannot say the same for Emma Roberts. She seemed really out of her element.Unfortunately, for Scream 4, the best part was the concept of rebooting the Scream franchise and Hayden Panettiere's haircut (so cute).",Scream 4

260,KidDrehmann,Return of the Horror King,10,23 April 2011,"Since his start as a director, Wes Craven has captivated audiences and left them at the edge of their seats with his suspenseful and nightmarish films. From the particularly gruesome tortures of Krug and his associates to the horrible suffering and murdering of Nancy and her colleagues in their dreams, Wes Craven has instilled our minds all of his terrifying visions of fear and terror and it has bestowed itself into our deepest and darkest nightmares. The trials and horrors of Sidney Prescott are no exception to this.Spanning over a 15 year period, the savage and brutal attacks on the life of Sidney and her friends has continuously remained both horrific and surprising throughout the years. Whether it was vengeance, jealousy, or just complete psychopathy there was, as Randy put it in the original masterpiece, ""always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend."" In the most recent installment of this iconic franchise Sidney finds herself returning, after writing a successful book, to her home town of Woodsboro, the spawn of the dark side to her story. And with her return brings about the revival of Ghostface. The very night she came back, two teenagers met an untimely demise at the hands of someone looking to remake the story of the Prescott family. And as the body count continues to rise the famous trio learn how the rules they have followed to survive before are no longer the rules of horror movies that the world abides by. With a fresh new cast supporting the three returning ones, the fourth film in this series proves to be just as creative and clever as all three of its predecessors. And with a revelation just as shocking as in the movies before it, it will leave you begging and demanding for more.",Scream 4

You get the feeling that the actors are just going through the motions just to churn out another scream film, but that has happened for decades now with slasher movies. I shouldn't of expected much if scream 2 and 3 was anything to go by.But with all the bad acting and terrible script its worth a watch if there's nothing else on the TV, just don't waste your cash on this film.",Scream 4
262,dlo540,Really? 10 years?,4,16 April 2011,"A whole decade has passed and THIS is the best story Craven could think of?! Let me start by saying, I did not have high expectations going into this film, I really didn't. It's a typical slasher film, a sequel to a franchise that is known for it's mindless victims, and semi-surprise revelations. However, after so many years, why would the writers and Wes Craven choose this script as the final product? For one, I guessed who the killer was even before I saw the movie. It's that obvious, my friends. Second, the acting is atrocious (especially during the killer's rant of motive/explanation). Third, the suspense was never there. I don't know if this franchise lost it's touch with me because I was 15 when the ""Scream"" movies were hot and popular, but Scream 4 did not deliver any suspense. An example is, the crowd I sat with would say ""This one's getting killed."" when we would see an opening of a new scene. The problem with the outbursts from the crowd: They were right! That's how bad the writing was, people! Save your $10. Don't even rent it. Wait to see it for free on HBO.",Scream 4
263,mlunsworth,Scream Louder,7,21 April 2011,"By the fourth entry in almost every slasher film, you can guarantee it'll be nothing but pointlessly ludicrous. Scream 2 and 3 couldn't live up to the glorious original, so going into the cinema to watch this I was feeling very pessimistic. However, I was relieved to see that the brilliantly executed opening 11 minutes took away my pessimism, and for the rest of the film I was more than happy to see Wes Craven going back to his horror roots.As ever, the ghost-face killer is back to cause murder and mayhem to the unsuspecting townsfolk of Woodsboro, as the community prepares for the 15th anniversary since the first murders. It may feel like a remake of the first, but Craven makes use of a new decade of horror clichés and rules, as well as it feeling very modern indeed. It's also great to see familiar characters back on form.For genre buffs, Scre4m is a joy, with subtle references to many classic horror films, and even though the film is at its best when it's mocking other shameful cinematic slashers, it's by no means the razor-sharp reboot we were all hoping for, and sadly in some parts, it feels like the storytelling and suspense has been replaced with the fact of being in on the joke; a joke that's aged a lot since the first film. But taking all this into account, on its own terms, Scre4m is pretty good for a sequel.Those who love Scream for shocks, blood and kills, there's absolutely no shortage here, as it's easily the bloodiest entry of them all (which makes me wonder why the BBFC was so generous on the certification for this film).It's not perfect, but Scre4m is a worthy entry to a franchise, that (like the ghost-face killer himself) will never seem to leave the back of our minds, and is easily the best one since the original.

266,jermdown,Bravo! Haven't had this much fun at the movies in ages.,8,15 April 2011,"I discovered the Scream films long after their initial release. Though being of a suitable age when the first film debuted, my trepidation towards horror films kept me back. But since then, I have embraced the horror genre - more specifically the slasher sub-genre - and Scream has always been at the top of my list for the perfect example of the formula done right; while offering more than just the run-of-the-mill formulaic slasher film.With a mediocre sequel and odd-ball third film, I wouldn't have thought I would be so excited to see the fourth installment. I enjoyed both sequels, but they were nothing on the first. Once I found out that not only Wes Craven was back, but the whole gang of actors, I was pretty darned excited.Was my excitement warranted? I think so. This film is on par with the first - maybe not in the originality department, I mean how often can you reinvent the wheel? But because it is a fourth installment, I was really happy to see that the film was enjoyable, and didn't treat its audience like idiots - as most ""4th films"" are just a waste of time.I'm sure there will be fans of the first films who aren't as impressed, but as someone who came to this series late in the game, I feel Scream 4 offered up everything the last three did - and actually was a film that clicked.

The style and feel from the first 2 are captured well,the scares and jumps are excellently timed and the dark humor (which didn't work for part 3, and so much of it, making it more of a bad comedy then a good horror) adds a nice touch, and works a lot better. Overall entertaining as balls. the 2 hours flew by. The last 2 movies i saw in the Cinema - Sucker punch an green hornet - i couldn't stop looking atmy watch to see when it was gonna end.

268,Philattio,They Finally Did It!,10,29 March 2012,"I grew up with the Scream films since I was 8 - which was when I first watched Scream 1996. By the time Scream 2 released on DVD I had vivid nightmares of Ghostface stalking me outside my house. When I went through my faze of horror movies Scream was always the one that I loved. The start is the most memorable part of the film. It left me speechless and shocked with it's complex and playfulness and self aware humor that it played with. When we are finally reintroduced back to Woodsboro with Sidney, Gale and Dewey I was suddenly in my element. I felt as though I was back in the 90's; not only are we reunited with the iconic Ghostface and the stars, Neve, Courtney and David, but the film also looks, feels and sounds like a 90's film without being outdated. Its warm cinematography, tight shots, dutch tilts, catchy soundtrack and the genius of Kevin Williamson's script flowed together creating this satisfying sequel which was worth waiting for. Sidney Prescott is now much stronger in this film; this time she battle's Ghostface, confronting his first appearance and helping our new younger characters as she knows the tricks and suspicions of trust towards the other sinister characters. The new characters fit well into place, Emma Roberts, Hayden Peneteire, Nico Tortorella, Marley Shelton, Rory Culkin, Alison Brie, Adam Brodie all deliver the most pleasing comedic performances. The twist caught me off guard; you will never guess who the killer is! Although it felt anti-climatic and almost too-soon of a revelation, it still made it worth watching as our killer handled his/her post- revelation-performance even more twisted and even funny at the same time. The film is not like Halloween 4, Saw VI, Nightmare on Elm St 4 or Final Destination 4. It honors the original very much and its one of the few sequels that have left me feeling satisfied, scared, thrilled and inspired. Scream 4 left me speechless and lost for words. Everynow and then I pick up the DVD and think ""oh my god... they actually finally did it."" Thank god Neve, David and Courtney returned with Wes and Kevin.The film is satisfying on its on. I don't mind is Scream 5 never happens, but I'd love for it to happen.",Scream 4
269,dgefuller,Stab in the dark: more gash than slash...,2,24 April 2011,"If anyone in horror deserves a stab at critiquing horror remakes, it must be Wes Craven (Elm Street, Hills Have Eyes, and Last House on the Left... all fairly recent)- and after the groundbreaking self-awareness of Scream, who is more qualified to attempt such a post mortem? If this is a post-modern exploration of horror remakes, perhaps it's intentionally awful to reflect that remakes are usually sub-par. If, however, it's an attempt at creating a convincing horror sequel that lives up to the reputation of its predecessors then it's sorely lacking in quality. Just to get to the point: this instalment is an insult to the original (like so many horror movies- perhaps this is intentional? After all, Elm Street just got a remake- which tarnished any memories of the original Freddy caper- is it really necessary for Krueger to be a paedophile for the audience to fear him? Is that frightening or just simply unpleasant?). There are no surprises- in fact it's quite likely that the ideas you have while watching the film will be far superior to anything that unfolds on screen- and whereas I always believed Scream 3 was weaker than earlier instalments on purpose, it feels like this film has been crafted by a hack amateur.For Wes Craven fans, this film isn't even better than Cursed. I don't think anyone will be disappointed, the general consensus when this franchise resurrection was announced was that it was a desperate move to squeeze more cash out of a story that was wrapped up 10 years ago, part of a self-aware post-modern teen pop movement that has been done to death and can't even be assessed ironically because that's what the whole thing was about. It's the same joke done in like David Arquette's head with a bedpan (spoiler?).Ghostface has lost all its anonymous terror thanks to Scary Movie (a franchise that lives better in recent cultural memory to be honest- not for the better!), and frankly I got bored of people being stabbed. There's none of the tension, none of the ferocity and just a pale imitation of the humour of the original, seminal Craven masterpiece.",Scream 4
270,to_see_you_smile_again,This movie doesn't make any sense!,4,16 April 2011,"As a teenager, I liked the first Scream. But the second and third were just plain silly. And so is this. The dialogue is terrible, the plot doesn't make any sense & the characters are just plain ol' unlikeable. The film claimed to have reinvented the slasher genre, but it is literally just the same thing repeated over and over again... The killer has an incredibly petty excuse to kill everybody - ""I just want my fifteen minutes of fame!"" This is a generally bad movie. You may laugh, but its for all the wrong reasons. Avoid this at all costs, or at least download it illegally so Wes Craven can't make any more money for making these shitty sequels.",Scream 4
271,niceguy95,best since the first one,10,23 April 2011,"ever since i have been introduced to the scream movies i wanted a fourth movie. Just because it was that good of a film series, and I can honestly say that this movie was worth the wait. I am also prepared to say that this movie is one of the best horror films in the last decade.It is the bloodiest film to date so be prepared for one scene( you see some guts). Also I actually cared about these characters. unlike other horror films where all the people who die are shallow and uninteresting.My personal favorite in the movie is Kirby.The original trio are back and better than ever,and so are their witty one liners, and mannerisms that you have come to love from them.This is definitely for the fans, but it is still a great movie nonetheless.A must see for all fans of the scream series, and the horror genre itself",Scream 4
272,drewfp,The Ultimate Scream Movie!!!,10,23 June 2011,"Scream was A Historic Movie, Scream 2 was the Perfect Sequel and Scream 3 Concluded the Greatest Horror Trilogy of all time. Them Came Scream 4 and it was the absolute perfect addition to the Series. It wasn't stupid and jumpy like most horror movies today. it brought back the things that scared us in scream and combined it with things that scare us today. it was extremely well written thanks to Kevil Williamson and it was intensely Frightening thanks to Wes Craven. Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox are Back and better than ever. Emma ROberts, Hayden Pannetiere and Rory Culkin were a great addition to the cast and they all give grade A performances as teens in WOodsboro. If you love Classic Horror Movies that are terrifying, fun, and clever, then you will love Scream 4",Scream 4
273,redfoxagent,It's both a sequel and a remake brilliantly wrapped into one movie,7,16 April 2011,"If you like any of the horror genre you owe it to yourself to go see this movie. I found myself sitting in a half full movie theatre of nighttime creatures such as myself. It so happens the entire theater was actively participating in the movie. Always a good sign during a horror movie. A group of six was sitting in the row behind me and the entire time all I could hear was ""No the killer can't be him because he was at the other party"" and so on. It's quite frankly one of the most enjoyable movie going experiences I've had in a long time. The original Scream was groundbreaking for being the first movie to feature characters who had seen other horror movies and were aware of Hollywood itself. They knew the rules of slasher movies and realized they were in a slasher film situation. This became the new trend in Hollywood and has since been dubbed ""self-aware horror"". The other thing that makes the Scream series so special is that the original group who made the first film (writer, producer, director, actors, etc.) went on to make number 2,3 and now 4. The effect of which so happens to be a movie series of rather decent quality compared to most horror movie which all get ten sequels while being run into the ground. Being aware of this is something the series has been known for, following the ""rules"" of sequels.Now we come to Scream 4 which decides to take a poke at the horror trend for the latter half of the decade which been to remake every famous horror film from the seventies and 80's and to do a very bad job at it. Even going so far as to list every single one of them during a very intense phone conversation. Scream for acts as a sequel, a remake, and a reboot all at the same time and it does an amazing job doing it. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is returning to the town of Woodsboro, the town in which the original took place, on a tour promoting her new book about how she managed to over come the troubles and hardships she's faced in the events of Scream 1,2, and 3. Upon her return someone suits up as ghost face and starts killing again as a ""welcome home"" for Sidney. Now sheriff Dewey (David Arquette) and his subordinates (Marley Shelton, Anthony Anderson, Adam Brody) to find out who's behind the murders and protect ghostface's latest targets Sidney's cousin Jill (Emma Roberts) and her friends Kirby (Hayden Panettierre) and Olivia (Marielle Jaffe) who are preoccupied with avoiding Jill's Ex-boyfriend Trevor (Nico Tortella). Dewey decides to investigates without the help of his wife reporter turned author Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), who has become famous for writing the book ""the Woodsboro murders which has been turned into a slasher film series ""Stab"". So Gale decides to do what has helped the last time Woodsboro was under siege by ghostface, she finds the local high school film geeks and join up with them to attempt to solve the mystery of who's behind the mask.The first half of the movie has very old school slasher feel to it, which is both fun and slightly dull. It wasn't super intense (at least for me it wasn't) but had some good jumps in it. All of the dialogue is well crafted and very entertaining. It holds onto the notion of the characters not believing that a killer is on the phone with them until it's to late and he's not actually hiding where you think. The violence in not as graphic as the first movie considering this is number 4 we're talking about. After achieving the appropriate body count we get to the part of the film where it all comes together. The core teenagers of the movie are gathered in a house and the mystery of ghost face will be revealed to Sidney at the end of the final massacre of the movie. This is where the movie really shines. It gets extremely intense and jumps out with a surprise that you will not see coming. It makes what would've been a decent movie into something that's really worth seeing.",Scream 4
274,bigpapapumpct,Scream 4 was God-awful!,1,17 April 2011,"It wasn't nearly as deep or character driven as the first two. Pretty much the only character I cared about besides the original trio was Kirby. It didn't take the time to properly flesh out most of the other characters (go figure; how ironic; especially with what was said in the beginning).It didn't take itself anywhere near as serious as I had hoped it would (was hoping for a level of seriousness equal to that of S1/S2). There were a lot of dead end story lines; stuff that was built up but never paid off (such as Gale's book and the love triangle).There wasn't much ""cat & mouse"" at all, if any, between the killer and the victims. There was almost no mystery or sense of urgency to figure out who the killer was by any of the characters (nice try Gale).When Sidney realized a new killer was starting up, she didn't seem to care much at all (This should have been an epic and significantly emotional revelation for her). Although Jill turned out to be one sick puppy, I never took her seriously as a villain. She's a good actress but when it came time to flip the psycho switch, she failed (whereas all the other killers hit it perfectly); by that I mean, it didn't feel real. I don't think it necessarily felt forced, but it was definitely on its way.Above all else though, it just didn't feel like a true Scream movie. It felt more like an imitation; like a Stab film. After all this time, I honestly said to myself as I was walking out of the theater... ""I waited 11 years for this? This was the best they could come up with?""To say that I am ""extremely disappointed"" would be a massive understatement. This film was a repugnant farce and a slap in the face to the rest of the series and its fans. Shame on Wes Craven and the Weinsteins for butchering Kevin Williamson's script.",Scream 4
275,isaiahc-72408,Better than expected,8,30 July 2021,"Scream 4 was much better than I thought it was going to be. The characters were fun and the plot developed really nicely. The kills and killers were surprising and intense. Never would have thought that they were the killers. I'm sad that they got Kirby and Robbie but nothing you can do about it. The twists once again were surprising and caught me off guard. Sid, Gale, and Dewey were all fantastic and seeing Gale play such a critical role felt like I was watching Scream 1 again. Neve Campbell played Sidney to perfection again as always. I have to say this was better than I expected. Can't wait for Scream 5 to come out. 8/10.",Scream 4
276,jaredperalta,The Best one Yet!,10,11 April 2012,"Scream 4 is one of those movies that you can see over and over again. it has a great plot, great actors, and great development. scream 4 was not a let down at all so if you think it is think again! yes it is the same thing; a guy/girl with a knife killing people. But there is a different reason why him/her does it.also scream 4 is not like other horror movies in the world, it doesn't have a corny tone to it.last the jokes are funny, the scares are scary and this can actually happen. so its even scarier. Wes has still got it. so i am up for scream 5 or (5cream) when it comes out. to be completely honest I'm more than up i cant wait to see if they make another one.",Scream 4
277,Climinator,New Decade. No New Rules,8,13 April 2013,"Being too young to watch Scream 1-3 on their initial cinema release, I was disappointed. Then, ten years later, came along Scre4m. After the less admirable Scream 3 I went in the screen room open minded. The lights faded. The film started. What can I say?The plot line sees Sydney return to Woodsboro whilst on a book tour. Whilst she's there a new Ghostface targets a new bunch of teens including Sydney's cousin Jill (Emma Roberts). The opening scene surprised me. A tad over long but entertaining enough. Unlike Scream 3, where Ghostface's killings there tended to be rather brazen and daring, the killer here relies on being stealthy. As the film pokes fun at horror films, particularly reboots, there are some references to Screams 1,2 and 3. The twist at the end is a shock.Once again the main leads of the series (Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette) put in great performances as do their new co-stars Emma Roberts, Marley Shelton, Hayden Pannittiere, and Rory Culkin.Thoroughly enjoyed the film although I only have one complaint. The tag line says 'New decade. New Rules.' Where are they as I never saw or heard them??Other than that roll on Scream 5 & 6!!!",Scream 4
278,FireWave,This one rocks... again,10,23 April 2011,"Let me say that I'm very pleased with Scream 4. At first, I thought that this one stays far away from the original trilogy, but that is normal for period of eleven years. Through the whole movie I had a feeling that it might turn bad, and parts where new actors acted just convinced me at that more and more. Sure, acting is not on the very high level, but script is very clever and story gives enough character development expect for, maybe four characters but that is not that bad. When you see the original trio, you will know that this movie can't be bad. They acted very well, and maybe if the opening scene was longer it'd be great and if they payed attention to the minutes of the movie, where logic really doesn't play well. I have to say that I saw this movie several times, before I came here to rate him and write review. It's really entertaining and scary in parts, brutal and very bloody. Conversations between Ghostface and it's victims is creepy and smart but corny, too. However, that factors are charm in these movies. My final rate: 10/10.",Scream 4
279,PennyDread,Successful passing of the torch!,9,15 April 2011,"Teenage movie experts: Check Creepy boyfriend: Check Desperate fame whore: Affirmative Slightly inept but lovable cop: Yup Oh, and all the original cast members we love so much: You betcha!As always, Wes starts with a bang and just keeps going from there...the central theme and feel of the Scream franchise is back in perfect tune with possibly some improvements. The plot is not at all tired when picking up where the last film left off - it's totally believable, whatever that means in a horror film, and was pretty unexpected. At first, I hated the ending, but the more it played out the more I got on board. The plot is not only relevant to the Scream saga, but also packs some serious social commentary, making it relevant to today's pop culture. Scream 4 is a rare victory in the genre of horror, but really, what did we expect from the series that changed the game forever?",Scream 4
280,robin-mckay80,"It's a Scream, baby!",8,15 April 2011,"I was expecting this to be a thrill ride from start to finish - sadly, that's not what I got. In all truth, I was disappointed, but that said, its still a blast and it was a lot better than a lot I've seen recently.The beginning is very inventive indeed and involves a movie within a movie, within a movie. I didn't think the real victims' scene was very good. I thought the first three were really good. This just seemed too short and one of the deaths you don't even see, which makes for a chilling scenario, but takes the gloss off, to some extent, if you can call it that.Then we zip forward to the current day and Sidney returns for a book signing and we also learn Gale and Dewey are married. Someone said this is drawn out. I didn't think it was.The problem with the deaths in this film is that they are very lightweight as opposed to the others - in essence, they are very primitive. Yes they are gory but not to the same degree which some fans might be disappointed with. Some of the scenes though are clever and leave a lot to the imagination.Don't even TRY to guess the ending - quite simply put... you won't. There aren't any clues in the film to suggest who the murderer or murderers actually are, which I was, I admit, disappointed with. In the others, at least there were clues to some degree. In this one, we're just left to accept the ending as it is.However, I did note the film was disappointing - yes it was and no it wasn't. It was still great to see a Scream film and although it doesn't match the previous entries, it is still a good film in its own right.I certainly will add this film to my collection as it was a good film, just a little less than what I was hoping for, but there is certainly a lot of depth and strength to the film. Its just a shame that the film wasn't structured enough to really justify the ending, which was good.Still, some films you don't get any clues, you're just left to use your imagination, so I feel maybe I am being slightly harsh, but this is not a bad film at all and it should do well and I left the cinema feeling happy if not completely satisfied. It was only minor things that made me feel a bit disappointed but it is hugely fun and enjoyable.Watch out for the death of the cops in the police car - that scene is absolutely hilarious! Hopefully you'll find it just as enjoyable as I did.",Scream 4
281,marioarp1995,F**K Bruce Willis!,10,29 July 2011,I love this movie. Can't compare to the original but certainly is entertaining nevertheless. Having a comical actor like Anthony Anderson in this movie provided comical relief even ***SPOLIERS*** after getting stabbed in the forehead! the twists in this movie were really great as well with not knowing what's going to happen next or who the killer(s) was? Some of the killings might of been a little brutal but overall really cool in a sick-cool type of way. Nice thing is bringing back the original characters because without them this movie wouldn't of been as great as it was. Even though this movie was great the 1st is and always will be the best of the four movies. And also I was really wanting to stab Emma Roberts Character in the face at the end of the movie.,Scream 4
282,BottomLineReviews,Classic,7,10 December 2012,"This movie works. It just works. From the three beginnings (one of them a GREAT cameo with Kristen Bell and Anna Paquin) to the 1, 2, 3... something endings - it's a horror movie that isn't really a horror movie and isn't afraid to make fun of itself along the way while still managing to take itself seriously. What makes this movie so solid is that it never strays from the original 1996 Scream premise and the original cast members - what would Scream be without Gale, Sidney, and Dewey? The ones who have been through it all and mock the new crowd for their inexperience. They all see everything coming but manage to get there just a bit too late. Of course this movie is almost entirely predictable but it's SUPPOSED to be. Trust me, it doesn't ruin the twist ending that I honestly DIDN'T see coming. Pretentious, know-it-all movie snobs will tell you, ""Of course I saw it coming!"" But what's the fun in figuring out the ending before it happens? Watch, enjoy, be surprised. It's a sequel, so the rules have changed - but have they? One thing Sidney is sure of, ""You don't f--- with the original."" And this movie doesn't. Classic Scream.Bottom Line: I'd pay $10 at the theater to see this one.",Scream 4
283,wryterz,"Bloody, fun, hilarious and creepy, yet not the best of the series.",7,21 April 2011,"I think I'm UK's biggest Scream fan so my expectations for this film were very high. The first time I watched this, I felt disappointed but the next day, after thinking hard about this, I realised I was wrong. And the second viewing really allows you to focus on the smart content of the film.The opening montage is quite funny and quite bloody, yet personally, it could have been better. Lucy Hale and Shanae Grimes are up first and their section is by far the best and the blend of comedy, acting and suspense is by far the most impressive of the opening 10 minutes. Though most people will disagree, I found the Anna Paquin and Kristen Bell sequence surprising but pathetic and finally by the time Aimee and Brittany are on scene (their acting was below par), it felt like I was watching SCARY MOVIE and not SCREAM.The best thing about this film is the pace, which I didn't appreciate at first. It's a fast action ride of blood and and more blood as the body count in this is pathetically high. This does prevent the suspense factor from taking a hold of you, but it really is in your face death scenes, especially the brilliant yet extremely intense closet death scene. Phew! Courteney, Neve and David are brilliant in this and though the new cast is much better than anyone in Scream 3, the original members are the real reason this film is what it is. Obviously, the script, though some lines needed to be tightened up (Kev Williamson is so much better at writing than Ehren Kruger) is like Scream 1, where it manages to poke fun at itself before the audience can and provide a new convention in terms of rules and regulations.The new cast, especially Hayden and Emma are fabulous and Rory and Erik prove to be surprisingly positive. Many people may not appreciate Marley Sheldon but I found her fantastic. The two others coppers (Brody and Anderson) are completely wasted. Alison Brie's character is mean, surely giving Gale a run for her money.Scream 4 does have its flaws, and quite a few of them, including silly one liners just before a victims death and the actual motive for killing all these innocent victims. Yet, I did not see the ending coming and for that, I was grateful. In fact, because so much is happening, you don't try to guess the killer or killers and are surprised at the revelation.Gale Weathers' chase scene had me on edge and the ending, though quite long, was very fulfilling. I also really liked where Sidney's character and Gales are going, because it's believable. Gale being married and bored not to be a reporter anymore, and Sidney dealing with the killings quite directly.This is surely a return to form for Craven and I personally think it's on par with Scream 2, though I noticed not a lot of people liked Scream 2. Nothing beats the original and this is mentioned at the end.Overall, this is a very fun and extremely tongue in cheek movie with lots of excellent ghostface moments. It's not scary, but neither of the other Screams were. They were fun and intense and so is this. however, one final flaw is its comedy value. Scream managed to blend all emotions in quite well, but at times, you feel this is a comedy and not a horror flick! If this is the last in the series (I secretly hope not) then it would suffice, but I would love to see a new trilogy.There are many more talking points but to discuss them I'd have to give away much more and for that, you'd best watching this on the big screen. It's very, very good, but remember, ""don't f*** with the original!""",Scream 4
284,stormcatcher-2,Did I see the same movie as everyone else?,2,30 April 2011,"Wow. All the glowing reviews of this one honestly makes me wonder if I was watching the same movie. I enjoyed the first two ""Scream"" movies very much (not so much, part 3), but after hearing of a fourth sequel well over a decade after the original premiered, I kind of wondered if even the wonder duo of Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven could pull it off.**PLEASE NOTE: SPOILERS FOLLOW. Stop reading here if you plan on seeing the film.**The short answer is...they didn't, really. There's only so much you can do with a meta-franchise, and this one's finally run out of steam. And to be fair, I'm really not sure what Williamson could have done to give the script more punch, short of maybe making one of the original three survivors (Gayle, Dewey, or Sydney) the killer - this would have been a risky move, as most fans of the series really like these characters. So ultimately, Kevin went with the safer route; namely, he made one of the least likely characters one of the killers - and while I won't spoil the killer's motive for killing, I WILL tell you that my mouth dropped open when I heard it, and I literally said out loud, ""You have GOT to be kidding me."" It was that lame.It didn't help that several other parts of the film seemed to have content that Kevin Williamson pulled out of thin air strictly for filler. At one point, while discussing the so called ""new"" rules of horror movies, one of the cinema geeks makes the offhand comment that about the only way you can survive a horror movie...is to be gay.Uhh...Excuse me? Not to clutch at straws here, but does ANYONE remember the last time you saw a horror movie with a gay character in it that either wasn't the killer, outright, or that was put in the movie for anything other than comedy relief? Me, neither. And it doesn't help the fact that one of these cinema geeks proclaims to be gay when he's trying to convince GhostFace not to kill him (and of course, GhostFace kills him anyway). Uh...wow. Given that he's gay IRL, that's a heck of a way to pay tribute to your gay fans out there, Kev.Overall pacing for the movie was pretty bad. The opening scene was decent, the mini-teaser following it just kind of made me blink in confusion, and nearly every murder in the film just kind of made me roll my eyes. Jump-out scares have never really done it for me, and none of the ones in this sequel even made me flinch. Even the gore was unbalanced. I'm not a gore-hound, but a certain amount of blood in a horror movie is to be expected - and most of the deaths were fairly light on the blood with the exception of one, and in her case, there was enough of the red stuff caked all over her room to suffice for three bodies. That's not to say that every moment in this movie reeked; it was really nice to see Gayle, Sydney, and Dewey together again, although there really wasn't a whole lot for them to do. Also, it was kind of odd to see relatives that Sydney had never talked about before showing up in this installment. The newer and younger additions to the cast did fine, although none of them really stood out to me personality-wise except perhaps Hayden Pennettiere, who made Kirby a likable and sympathetic character (although why she'd go for creepy looking Charlie is beyond me).It was also nice to see Woodsboro again, although if I were Sydney, I'm not sure I'd want to go back, given what transpired before. Some bad memories simply hit too close to home, especially when they INVOLVE home.Overall, I suspect that the people who will like this movie the most will be the folks who haven't seen the first three films, or who enjoyed them so much that there's really no way this one would lower their expectations. And if that's the case, more power to you.Personally, I'm kind of hoping that this'll be the last nail in the coffin of this franchise - and that's not me trying to be witty; I just think it'd be the merciful thing to do, both for the fans, and the characters.EDIT: I actually didn't realize until recently that some of the script got re-written by an apparent hack before the final cut of the film, so I might actually be blaming Kevin Williamson for poor dialogue that might not have been his fault (re: the ""gay"" line). Kruger, I think his last name is? Whoever he is...he deserves to have the OTHER Krueger (as in, Freddy) track him down and go berserk on his ass with those glove knives of his for butchering the script so badly. If I'd had known that before I went to see the film while it was in theaters, I wouldn't have bothered.I mean...if the director and producers had so little faith in the writing ability of the guy whose script for the first movie made it such a success, what does that tell you about what they must think about their audience?",Scream 4
285,yeaimdaman73,"Meh, Not Satisfied",3,16 April 2011,"After being a fan of the Scream franchise, it was inevitable I would jump at the chance to watch Scream 4. Was not satisfied to say the least.The character development as well as the actors/actresses portraying these characters were poorly executed. While Arquette, Cox, and Cambell perform their roles with no issues or flaws, the new generation seems to have a lack of actual talent into giving their character life. The story lead me into believing something great and unpredictable would happen, and (call me crazy) something revolutionary to both this franchise and horror flicks would take place. Instead, we are left will a plodding story, with poor character development, and a predictable reveal of the Ghostface Killer. The reason for the ""unknown"" killer is even dull, bland, and unoriginal. The kills didn't even try to gross the consumer out or affect them in anyway.I'll keep this short and sweet - Some of the jokes, puns, and/or one liners are funny and witty, but the movie as a whole is a plethora of mistakes that are poorly executed - making this a film not worth watching. Recommend skipping this.",Scream 4
286,nZulauf71,"""I never said I was in your closet.""",8,1 November 2011,"WOW! I thought to myself ""The original will never be beaten""....boy was I wrong. Scream 4 is funnier, more modern, and most of all the best out of all the films. Things that ticked me off ended up making me laugh. And the twist at the end was very good. 10 years after the first killings Sydney returns to Woodsboro, but upon her arrival begins more killings by the famous Ghost Face. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times. I want to watch it over and over again. I have never been so at edge in a horror movie ever! I can't say how much I loved this movie. I don't want to say anything to ruin the movie. All I will say is that if you like Scream this is the best one and you will love it. I highly recommend it! My Final Review: 9 out of 10",Scream 4
287,ruddaga,"Very ""Meh""",5,15 April 2011,"So I just got back from Scream 4 and I've just read through all the reviews that were put up before me... I'm wondering if they were all written by the cast and crew of the movie because I was totally underwhelmed by this addition to the Scream franchise.I enjoyed Scream 1, found the 2nd one to be a bit meh and thought the 3rd one was a nice way to tie the movies up. This one starts off with the original trio living their respective lives, but we don't get an insight into what they've been doing the last ten years - just that Gale and Dewey are happily married - and Sidney has moved on and written some self help book about surviving. Then along come the next generation in the franchise and I know they're supposed to be a rehash of the original Scream/Stab characters... But it feels stagnant and stale. Haven't they done this already.. The self parody of the first movie with the original ""stab"" in the 2nd and 3rd one.. Feels like Wes is just scraping the bottom of the barrel.Maybe it's because I've seen one too many movies... But if you couldn't pick the main killer in this from the get go... then you probably shouldn't be watching horror movies. I think a better ending would've been the killer actually gotten away with it.. and this led into a ""I know what you did last summer"" Scream 5... Maybe taken a chapter from the Halloween series when they killed Jamie Lee Curtis.. TAKE A RISK WES!! I actually found myself looking at my watch during the movie.. It's just repetitive and we've seen it all before. Girls in house - Phone rings - Killer jumps out around every corner - if its a character that isn't one of the main trio they die, if it is they managed to get away barely - Wash, rinse, repeat. This is literally how the movie goes. There aren't any exciting death scenes... The violence is meh as is the acting. I really wanted to enjoy this... Feels like a money grab at the end of the day. Oh well.. Sucker Punch disappointed.. As did this.. Here's to Thor next week.",Scream 4
288,stephenjamesb-1,Best line in the film and also very telling..,8,17 April 2011,"Although I didn't think this film re-invented the wheel it was also better than I expected...The only film I remember was the first since it was the best and most memorable, I've completely forgotten the 2nd and thankfully the 3rd.. But the most memorable thing about the 4th film was the one of the very last lines spoken by Neve.. ""1st rule about remaking a original movie... You don't .... with the original.."" This may be a line in the film but it tells a lot about the the film industry today and especially when it comes to the needless remakes of older horror movies... If you look at all these remakes, there's very very few films that actually are better than what their original counterparts were..The line also has a side meaning as well, not directed at the horror film industry as a whole.. But directly to Warner Bros and New Line Cinema in general.. After the abomination of the REMAKE of a Wes Craven's masterpiece A Nightmare on Elm Street in 2010, it was in my view pure garbage and a slap in the face to the true fans of the film.. The film had so much promise but was a massive let down and I think was an insult to Wes Craven himself.. SO when that line was spoken I just smiled and I couldn't agree more..Scream 4 might not be memorable, but that line and that meaning.. WAS",Scream 4
289,savvas172007,Pure enjoyment,8,20 April 2011,"It all started with Scream and me having watched it in my early 6. Now that I am 20 it was a great pleasure to have the opportunity and watch SCREAM 4 in its first release week. Many will certainly argue that they did not enjoy it. Others will probably admit that it didn't thrill them and that they expected to have at least a jump from the seat. Well, as a scary movies fan what I have to say is that you can't expect from a movie to be your great fear when you've already watched a few others. So, yes. It didn't scare the f*ck out of me. But, at least, it had two great moments where it left me speechless. (I won't say which two for I don't want to spoil it for no one). SCREAM 4 had also something that only a few movies have nowadays. It had a plot that we have seen again but still have some moments you don't expect and a Ghostface I didn't expect to see. What I think is the greatest of all the parts of this film is a message it carries about how our lives have changed and the role media have on it. Everyone need their 15 minutes of fame. (I may seem foolish but when you'll watch it you'll catch the point). So, to conclude, I highly recommend SCREAM 4 for all those who want to have a 2-hours great time and most of all to those who have loved the original ones. GUYS DON'T MISS IT!!!",Scream 4
290,lcampbell022892,A good addition to a wonderful Scream series,8,30 April 2011,"Assuming most are familiar with the previous Scream plots, I'll spare you the summary of each. Getting right to the point, Scream 4 will be discussed.Being a huge fan of the previous Scream movies, I had extremely high expectations. I waited for a year for this film to be released. I was not disappointed. It was good to see Dewey, Gale, and Sidney together again on screen. Sidney has lost her surprise and fear as the killer strikes again. She is tough and fierce, but even that is not enough to scare off the Ghostface Killer. It was intense. In addition to the reunion of these well known characters, the writing is fabulous and the plot will take you by surprise on more than one occasion. I found myself tensely sitting in my seat, eyes glued to the screen. There were even moments where I had to cover my eyes. If you are a fan of the previous Screams I highly recommend watching this one. You will not be disappointed. The timing and camera angles are superb. If you look closely, there are parallels and references to previous Screams. And it is fun to make the connections. Highly recommended.",Scream 4
291,ct_brandon,The best and most honest review from a life long Slasher Kid,4,17 April 2011,"***THE FOLLOWING REVIEW REFERS TO ONLY THE SLASHER GENRE****** First off, when I look for a review, I like to know what kind of films does this person like because if they don't like the same things I do than maybe we are not on the same page of our tastes in films. EVERY movie will have a lover & a hater! What I like to know do they love or hate the same things I do before I can trust their review. So with that being said, let me tell you what I like and don't like. My favorite is John Carpenter's Halloween. The fourth installment I feel was the closet to the original as they got. The rest sucked. Other favs of mine are SCREAM, SAW, HOSTEL, HELL NIGHT, PROM NIGHT, MY BLOODY VALENTINE, Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. ALL OF THOSE ARE THE ORIGINALS. In the sequel dept I like most sequels just because they are an extension of the originals. Not nearly as good but kinda like going back to a high school reunion. The 1st time, 2nd time, 3rd time, and so on. each time it loses it magic a little more. Now you get my likes...on with the review. SCRE4M is what it is. It's a sequel. Predictable, Commercial, & Enjoyable. The scares that made the original great have lost its magic with each passing sequel. The same storyline, the same characters except this time Gale, Dewey, & Sydney kinda lost their chemistry along the way. The opener: Pushy and Parody, which takes away from the scare. I was waiting for the Wayans brothers to come out during it. The new cast: mediocre at best. zero chemistry. the twists: predictable and pressing the realm of believability by really stretching why someone would go on a killing spree. What's next: SO and SO copied off me in high school so I went on a killing spree! But in tradition of sequels...it will fit right in. Friday the 13th Part IV, Halloween 4, SAW 4, Nightmare 4, and now Scream 4. Its in the same club. So, final thoughts: If your going to see a new kick-ass scary movie by Wes Craven...you'll be disappointed. If your going to see another sequel in the SCREAM franchise...you'll probably like it...not love it...but like it.",Scream 4
292,jaysser,They killed the original plot!,3,5 September 2013,"I do not understand why Kevin Williamson was so eager to complicate an already twisted plot. The original story line of Scream 1, 2, and 3, which was revealed at the end of Scream 3, was adequate. Scream 4, on the other hand, was a total disaster. It felt like Kevin just added to it because he was bored. In my opinion, it was a waste of time. I would have stuck to the original plot. The one thing I actually liked in the film was the murder scenes. It contained more violence, more brutality, more shocks and suspense than all other Scream films. This doesn't change the fact that it was a horrible film due to the lack of creativity and the meaningless, complex plot.",Scream 4
293,eyesmalloy,In Defense of Scream 4,7,22 April 2011,"There have been over a dozen horror remakes, reboots and reimaginings in the past decade and most of them were pretty bad. Sitting in the theater on opening night, I had mixed emotions about Scream 4. I hoped it would bring the series back to the level of the original, but feared it would only stray further. As I left, I found myself pleasantly surprised. It was a lot of fun and had a knockout ending. The next day I found it had a solid 7.7 on IMDb. Since then, I've read post after post in which fans have not only bashed the movie (which is fine) but spoiled the ending (which isn't). In my opinion, Scream 4 deserves better.Scream 4 is a genuine sequel. The original cast reprise their roles and do a great job. Since it is eleven years later, everyone is at a different point in their lives. Sydney is a writer, Dewey is Woodsboro's sheriff and Gale is married to Dewey trying to write her first novel. The characters are older, stronger and smarter. Then there's the new cast. While most slasher sequels offer little more than another batch of doomed sex-crazed teenagers, the Scream teens have always been pretty intelligent with significant time taken to develop their characters. For the most part, this continues in Scream 4. Best of all, original screenwriter Kevin Williamson rejoins director Wes Craven to create a story that's equally fresh and familiar. Yes, Scream 4 not only packs plenty of surprises; it turns the original trilogy on its head!The Scream series openings have always prided themselves on being shocking and clever and this one is no different. From there the film proceeds to reintroduce the three stars as well as the newbies. Most of the new characters have pivotal roles, some of whom are deliberate reincarnations of past characters. This might make some nostalgic for the days of Tatum and Randy, but I think most will find the new characters interesting enough on their own. The passing of time is captured through the use of technology including Facebook and Twitter, webcams, and smart phones. Like its predecessors, Scream 4 makes several references to other horror films including Saw IV, Shaun of the Dead, and that hilariously long list of remakes used in the trailer. Finally there are the Stab movies, the series within a series that began in Scream 2. In Scream 3, Stab 3 is in production, and by Scream 4, they are up to Stab 7.While I won't reveal anything about the ending, I will say that it's awesome. In fact, Scream 4 in general is a lot of fun. You'll notice a few scenes that are obvious counterparts to the original, much like what Wes Craven did in New Nightmare. Scream 4 is brutal, funny, clever and scary. If you liked the first three Screams, you'll probably like this one too. If you accept that times and ""rules"" have changed you're sure to have a blast. I think the main reason some fans have a problem with Scream 4 is that it does not follow the original rules. Others have complained about ridiculous or illogical moments. All I can say to that is...Dude, it's a Scream movie! They all had those moments! Though the films have always been smart, they all came with a side of cheese. Perhaps the best thing about the Screams is that they make fun of horror films while being horror films. So relax, have some Jiffy Pop, and don't take it all so seriously. After all, it's just a movie.",Scream 4
294,BarbaraEvans,Completely Full of Moviegasms,9,20 April 2011,"The only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because it's not the first movie! So yes, it was THAT great. What I absolutely loved is that Craven (the master) captured every single detail of the new generation of scary movies. I found myself agreeing in everything the characters mentioned of the new rules and the deaths... OMCraven, they were beautifully creepy. Assuming that you've already read the other reviews and/or don't care to be spoiled too much and/or already watch the movie, I'm focusing on the moviegasm parts:-The beginning: Amazing how a scene of a movie within a scene of another movie within a SCENE of ANOTHER movie really made me realize it was going to be a different, cooler scary movie than today's. For me it was all ""Scream is back, b!tches"".-The closet line: How amazing was it that one of the creepiest moments of the movie turned out to be a cool surprise? ""I never said I was in YOUR closet"".-Cool references: Throughout the movie there were a lot of references (apart from the scary ones, obviously). My favorites being the one where the Movie geeks presented their club as below the Glee Club but above the Nintendo Wii fans and the one where Gale W. says (referring to Sydney) ""She's the Daniel Radcliffe to my J.K. Rowling"". As a big fan of Harry Potter, you should know I almost fainted. -The police men: ONE OF THE MOST BELIEVABLE PARTS! They were sitting in the car talking about the next round of Sydney's house. I laughed a lot because they were all like ""I'll be right back"" and then O.O ""I'm not suppose to say that, am I?"". I say it's real because that's what I'll be thinking if something like that happened in my town. I'll be all crazy about the rules! And the Bruce Willis line made me love this 2 guys.-The trivia question for Hayden Panettiere: It was unbelievable. She mentioned a LOT of scary movies in a row and with the background music and the feeling of tension in the scene, the moment she was over and said ""I'm right, right?"" (or something like that) and Ghostface didn't answer... Wow. -Emma Robert's self destructing sequence: It was SO creepy you couldn't believe how f*cked up this girl was.-The first rule of remakes: ""Don't f*ck with the original"". Enough said. SEVERAL moviegasms. The only thing that DID bother me was that the trailers ruined some parts for me. A LOT of times I knew what was going to happen, but Hey! who blames me for seeing it like a zillion times? LOLAnd I warn you: if you plan on seeing it while eating popcorn on your first time... Well, you should say goodbye to them or eat them as fast as possible while you can.",Scream 4
295,michael-892-52682,You Won't Scream But You Will Love It,9,12 October 2011,"Scream 4 or Scre4m is the best Scream film since the original and dare I say better. Scream 4 revitalizes the horror genre yet again just like the first did way back in 1996. It takes elements from the more modern horror films and makes them its own again whilst making mock of them. There are MANY references to the original Scream and other horror films most notably the Saw series of films which in this is portrayed as the Stab films which is interesting. They actually mention at the beginning of the film how much the Stab films are based on the Saw films when you watch it you will see what I mean. This time around it has the best story of the series with the new teens giving it a unique take on modern culture and it really draws you in and it is also the goriest because you see a character (not going to say which one) which their stomach sliced open with their guts all over the bed in great detail.

I thought, they touched and dealt with all the issues of skepticism that watchers have on Horror teen slasher films in the opening scenes which were both funny and creative.The rest of the movie itself was very enjoyable,the whole way through the film you are guessing as to who the killer is. It's definitely worth the watch, especially if you like guessing games.It's amazing how much difference good acting can make in a storyline like this. Conversly poor acting stands out like a sore thumb. I thought the Character played by David Arquette was just about as weak as his acting.

299,HorrorCreepshow,A worthwhile entry in a legendary series!,8,30 December 2011,"Back in 2000, Scream 3 left a lot of people cold. Sure, it was the ""last"" Scream movie, but it didn't have the sense of finality so many of us fans were hoping for. The movie was goofy, cheesy, and tame as could be. I'm sure a lot of people were thanking God that the franchise was finally coming to a close before it had the chance to embarrass itself further. It was with great trepidation that I entered Scream 4 back in April. The film came out to a scattering of mostly mixed reviews, surprisingly very little publicity, and a cold audience reaction. Surprisingly, Scream 4 is one of the better entries in the series. It's just as good as the extremely entertaining Scream 2 and is almost as good as the original. Scream 4 follows the beloved Sidney Presscott returning back home to Woodsboro to promote her new self help book, but, of course, as fate would have it, a certain someone doesn't want her to leave alive this time. Can the poor girl ever get a break?Filled to the brim with fresh young talent, Scream 4 manages to do the impossible - still feel fresh and interesting more than 10 years later. If there was anything to nitpick, it would be the rather half-cooked opening sequence which starts off as fun and cute for 5 minutes or so and then becomes remarkably goofy, unscary, and outright stupid. Considering the fact that the Scream series is known for it's brutal, scary, and suspenseful opening sequences, this is a huge let down. After a fun fake out or two, the real prologue to the film just can't seem to live up to what's come before it. In fact, it's one of the worst things I've seen in a long time. Thankfully, the DVD/Blu-Ray release comes with the much better alternate opening. As to why it wasn't used? Anyone's guess!The film also gets very brutal at times, which is welcome, considering the Disney movie that Scream 3 was. I don't want to give much away, but I can tell horror fans that there's a lot to love about this sequel and it's worth seeing.",Scream 4

301,Diorafan05,Good addition to the franchise,6,12 November 2012,"When 'Scream' released in 1997 it created a roar. The movie was a runaway blockbuster. Directior Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson together redefined the horror genre with a unique combination of horror and humour. This was something rarely witnessed before. This concept became instantly popular with the youth at that time and many directors For horror fans it was a breath of fresh air. Many copy cat movies such as 'urban legends' and 'I know what you did last summer' followed. I was studying for my degree and can still remember seeing the first three movies of the franchise. On the scale of a re watch I still sense dejavu. The sequels were honest follow ups and the plot thickened with every movie. The characters of Sheriff Dewey, Gail Weathers and Sydney Prescott developed as the story continued.'Scream 4' is the latest instalment in the franchise. I have no clue as to why we had to wait 10 years for it. The young audiences of today may have had to introduce themselves to the first three to actually give this it's deserved credit. Sure the characters have progressed in their life. Gail and Dewey are married and Sydney wrote a book that she has come back to Woodsboro to publicise. However I'm not quite sure why she had the need to do this so late especially after she was previously a guidance councillor. Years have moved on and once again the ghost face killings have started. As usual the entire town is on a state of panic as innocent college students begin to get slaughtered. It is surprising to notice that a majority of the victims happened to be females. But this understandable. The essence and atmosphere is very evident. However the tone of comedy outweighs the horror content in many scenes. And as usual the clinched killings come at no surprise. I'm not sure why Williamson had to do this. The structure and format is the same as the preprocessors. The opening sequence as two girls killed and it turns out to be a movie within a movie. This was ingeniously depicted on screen. But the death of Aimee Teagarden was typical.Many familiar faces form the younger generation have been casted in the movie. This movie gives them equal exposure. Hayden Panetieere and Emma Roberts are impressive. They give good support and manage to sustain the audience's attention. They helped to bring the story forward and at many occasions overshadowed Neve Campbell. It was a pity to see how Sydney's character was not at the forefront or even at the centre of attention. In fact the less focus on her gave the writer the opportunity to integrate many others in the goings on.The interesting element of this movie is how many characters were developed before they reached their demise. One can sympathise with a character when he/she is killed. This was something missing in the first three. On the subject of discovering the killer, it was pretty difficult task to do while watching. Every sequence of event moves at a fast rate so it doesn't give the opportunity to think. But when the identity of the killer is revealed some may be surprised, some may not be. The clues are very limited to guess. So one has to watch on to see everything unfold. There are two characters involving the female cop and journalist that were at suspicion list. The killings happen in the traditional 'scream' routine which die hard fans appreciate. In comparison to to the sequels this does compete. It is okay as a stand alone movie. But two and three were more deeper in quality and Sydney's character was more at the core. Number four is a added bonus but would not disappoint the fans. Those fans that search for extreme blood and gore will be very pleased. At every corner there is blood spillage and fast paced action. My judgements and opinions may differ to others because I am not a teenage any more. But I found this latest offering very similar and the element of originality was limited in certain aspects. The whole 'rules' theme was a little pointless. Neve Campbell gives a reserved performance and her performance is on the mark again. As her appearance has changed over the years, it's emotional seeing her character overcome from the ordeal she suffered. Courtney and David add good support.In general fans of the franchise will enjoy the feature. Every moment is engaging to watch and the interactions between the characters is exciting.Watching it in the company of others is recommended. My mixed reactions give it a 6. I was initially conflicted with a 7. But is it definitely a movie to add to your horror collection.",Scream 4
302,sonnyrainy6,Meh. Nothing new here.,5,9 March 2014,"Aah, the 'Scream' franchise. One of the most successful franchises in horror movie history. What's the worst thing you can do? Give it another sequel when the last one sucked. This one was supposed to reboot the franchise, but as this one didn't do great at the box office, the franchise has ended. This movie has Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) returning to Woodsboro on the eve of the horrific murders that occurred years earlier only to have them occur again. The bit before the title was the best part. The rest of it was average, with uncreative kills and unimpressive acting. Some of the attractive cast manage to convince (Hayden Panettiere, Courtney Cox, Marielle Jaffe, Aimee Teegarden), while others provide acting so wooden that a floorboard could have easily replaced them (sorry Neve Campbell). Emma Roberts's character was the most annoying of the bunch, with her whiny voice and damsel-in-distress personality, so it definitely surprised me when it turned out that she was the killer. Speaking of surprises, this movie has lots of good shocks and I-didn't-see-that-coming moments, but ultimately the movie fails because of a weak script, bad acting, annoying characters and unsatisfactory kills.",Scream 4
303,marklynn-15497,One of my favourite horror movies/movie sequels,10,1 November 2021,"Undoubtedly, an improvement to comical Scream 3 (2000), brings the horror gene in it.This time, in Scream 4, I correctly worked out the killer(s)' identities in this movie. Surprised they didn't kill off main characters, like Dewey, even though Courteney Cox (attractive looking like in Scream 2) sidelined in movie as Gale. Openings with Stab was confusing moment, kills are mainly stabbings and shootings - Oliva was most brutal - disemboweled on blood-soaked bedroom (brilliantly intense phone call Ghostface to Kirby prior to it), Trevor shot in the crotch and in the head by Jill - big ouch, etc.Great acting, some attractive female cast members, Neve Campbell again as Sidney (in her 20s), Emma Roberts as estranged cousin Jill, Marley Shelton as attractive Olivia (such as brutal death), and even Hayden Panettiere as Kirby, and rest of cast with Marley Shelton (seen in Jamie Blanks' Valentine which another favourite slasher) yet plays some deputy falling for ""precious"" Dewey (David Arquette), Rory Culkin (Macaulay Culkin's brother!) as outcast Charlie Walker falling for Kirby, Nico Tortorella as red herring boyfriend Trevor Sheldon (Billy Loomis counterpart and movie's main suspect - I sort of knew he was genuinely innocent and framed by true killer(s)). Didn't like other, meaningless/unnecessary, characters like two pervy cops Perkins and Hoss.I worked out it had to be either or both of the two know-it-all teenage dudes: Robbie Mercer (Erik Knudsen) and Charlie as they're knowledgeable in horror movie remakes and the killers' intentions where and when to strike. When Robbie murdered and then Charlie gagged and tied up when Jill some reason disappeared, it clicked. How she covered up her true colours by initially sweet, curious, innocent, and vulnerable (Ghostface intended target to Sidney's assumption) before revealed as really evil and jealous, and clever by framing her ex-boyfriend/prime suspect Trevor and betraying her sidekick Charlie so she be sole survivor.Love the soundtrack at ending credits Bad Karma by Ida Maria

304,ThomEure,Let's Keep Screaming!,8,17 April 2011,"Fifteen years ago, I saw the original Scream during its opening weekend. The box office for that opening was relatively low, typically meaning that the film was destined to be less than a success. How could this be? It was the best genre film I had seen in a long time. However, each weekend for several weeks, the box office grew. Word of mouth made the original Scream a box office success.Attending Scream 4 during its opening weekend, I found a return to the feel of the original. It successfully mixes some witty comedic moments with suspense...and let's not forget gore. It also managed to pull off a pretty good twist ending. It seems that Scream 4 managed to do what many sequels or remakes try to do and fail, and that's bring a fresh twist to the genre. It also managed to reinvent the franchise with its good-natured take on the original and inspiration of the remake trend creating new rules for the sequel.Box office results for the opening weekend are being deemed as less than impressive. I say to my fellow Scream fans who may not have ventured out to see Scream 4 this past weekend - GO SEE IT. You will not be disappointed. Well, some of you may not...true fans will not.",Scream 4
305,charlie-westt,Ghostface is after young and middle aged blood...,7,28 April 2011,"The latest film in the Scream trilogy, takes a whole new approach, introducing us to a whole lot of new characters, whilst giving us the memorable original three (Sidney, Dewey, and Gale). Scre4m also takes the approach of reboot and remake, giving us the rules to survive a remake, sort of. The film opens very strongly, with us jumping straight back into the trilogy we all love and remember, whilst giving something very new and definitely brilliant . We then from the beginning get a very small twist, and the opening just continues to improve, and as soon as we see the titles fly on the screen we feel very happy to finally see the film has returned. And many devout fans may even faint in there seats to see Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) walk out of her car. Although saying this the film through the middle seems to be the same, but don't get me wrong you will be literally on the edge of your seat, and may even let out a little scream yourself, but some of it feels same old, same old, but some will like that. But when we do reach the ending (and by the time the film has finished we have seen a blood splattered 15 deaths, just to warn you) we do not expect it, now i will not reveal much of the ending, but it is brilliantly performed and played out, while leaving us thinking what next what next? I will now go on to review the performances and characters in the film which were not on top par, but we do see a few brilliant stand out performances. There are some new and old, but one of the new is Alison Brie's performance as Sidney's publicist. She does bring a sense of humour to the film ,whilst giving her own little character in her own world, which she does manage to do perfectly. The other new character is Hayden Panettiere, Jill Roberts'(new main character, Sidney's cousin) she may not be laugh out loud funny but she will make you smile, and will always make you hope for her life when you see her on screen. Now, one of the golden oldies who stands out is Courtney Cox, in the fourth instalment she is at her most bitchy, and is still again funny in the film. She is always coming out with narky one liners, and manages to hold her own little show through out the film. Meanwhile, all other performances are mediocre and never overly brilliant or under par. But, over all these positive comments, their is one main negative comment, and that is the character build. In Scream 4, the main character is meant to be Jill Roberts, the new Sidney, and her little gang of friends, while we do get a little look into the lives of our original three. All characters do not seem very developed, and we never have one concentrated scene, it almost seems like the film is confused between which character to look at next, new or old, and we don't get that original, ensemble feel of the first, second and even third film. And in my opinion, writer Kevin Williamson should have made the decision, new characters or old, and do not get me wrong, the idea could have worked brilliantly, but instead we have many very short scenes instead of one concentrated scene. So, to sum up, Scream 4 is still very original and is definitely a reboot of the series. It is tense, and some performances are very good, but it almost never reaches the brilliant film it could have been.Oh, and one last note, you will NEVER guess the killer...",Scream 4

Although this would make a good final movie, i just wanna be shocked one more time by the ultimate killer ""Ghostface""A MUST!",Scream 4
307,reynahernan,"New Decade, New rules, thats for sure.",10,17 April 2011,"BEFORE YOU READ THIS YOU MUST BE WARNED I WILL HAVE SPOILERS ON DEATHS, SCENES, AND THE KILLERS IDENTITY. [ SPOILER ALERT ] Lets begin with the first scene, the very big opening sequence what Scream is known for. Well first we start of with Shenae and Lucy and then at first I was like, wait, the call from the killer was lame. Shenae was funny though. Then once Shenae dies and then Lucy dies Iam like what the f*ck? That was it! NO! Then we figure out it was a scene in the movie Stab 6 or 7 idk. Then we have Anna and Kristen, I loved Kristen she was funny. Then Anna is on talking about how the movie Stab was lame then Kristen starts stabbing her and her line was hilarious! Something like "" Shut the f up and lets watch the movie"" Then we figure out oh wait its another Stab 6 or 7. And Iam like what the hell ;/ And THEN we have Aimee Teegarden and Brittany Robertson. Then we have Aimee go investigate a strange noise up stairs, sooner or later the other girl Britt dies but you don't see it you hear it from the cell phone. I don't think this opening scene was very good. We have Aimee crawling on the floor stabbed in the back and she get her hip broken by the garage door and Ghostface pulls her. I was disappointed. I felt like that was it? Where was the gore, the tragedy, you hardly felt anything for her! I really felt that they edited a lot of the scene's out. And they should of kept some stuff!Lets go on. I thought Alison Brie's character was funny! I loved seeing Sydney back! And also Dewy and Gale. I felt like Dewy was hardly in this. I felt like he was excluded and he didn't really get any good action. I thought Anthony Anderson and Adam Brody where really good in this! Especially ""Betty Crocker"" I mean Marley Shelton. Jill seemed nice and innocent, Olivia seemed like a slut, and Kirby seemed like the smart one. Acting was excellent. Again and seeing TV spots, trailers, and stills they edited a lot of stuff :( I knew this movie had a lot missing. The music was decent. This movie was really funny. I loved how Gail was back with her old mean ways! HahaNow lets get into the deaths. YUP! After the disappointing begging scene, we have Oliva who dies first. I liked her death cause I felt kinda sorry for her as the killer stabs her and she has no way out. And also how the two girls watch her being killed. And her guts are out and its just gruesome!! Then we have Alison's characters death. Her was kinda thrilling but she just gets stabbed and thats it. I liked how her body was thrown from the building! Next is well idk. But there are the cops death scenes with Anthony and Adam. Adam just gets stabbed in the back. Anthony's death was so unrealistic. He gets stabbed in the forehead and he gets out of the car and when he finally drops dead he says "" F*ck Bruce Willis"" And i'am like really? Mary McDonnell's was sorta good, but one thing.... how did the killer know she was on the floor? And this time it was Gail's turn, it usually Dewy but now shes the one who got stabbed. And she lives :)!!! Now Erik Knudsens death. His was kinda funny but far stretched like Anthony's. No one would say a dumb line before they die. Now Kirby's, I really felt sorry for her to be honest I liked her. Sucks she dies. Now this I did not see it coming but the killer is Charlie who kills Kirby cause she thinks he was going to killed but she unties him since he was tied like Steve was and he stabs her. We then find out that the other killer is in fact...... Jill. I did not see it coming. You will have to see the movie to find out her motive. I didn't get Charlie's motive but I guess it was like Stu's in the first. They try to frame Trevor, and they kill him the worst way possible, Jill shot him in a mans special area and then in the head. I think Jill is just flat out co co crazy and wants attention. It was crazy this movie. At first I thought to myself, what was this? Then I think, It was pretty good. Its a new decade.. New rules.. I felt like this movie was more like its own movie. So don't expect this to be the exact Scream movie cause its similar but in its own in a special way. One thing I will never forget from this movie it what Sydney said which was something like"" One rule about remakes... YOU NEVER F*CK WITH THE ORIGINAL"" That made me smile. Sydney, Dewy, Gale are truly like a family. I hope there are more Screams to come and I hope they continue to top the first and this. This movie was a Scream and Way better then other slasher movies. Well It all began with a scream over nine one one and ended in a blood bath. My grade for this movie: 8 out of 10",Scream 4
308,OmNomNom_NomNom,I held my pee to see the entire movie. I made the the right choice.,8,20 April 2011,"Before taking one of the longest leaks in my life, I saw the fourth installment to Wes Craven's horror franchise, Scream. I absolutely loved the first one, I thought it was one of the best horror films ever. I did not like Scream 2 however, and have no intention to see the third one.Surprisingly, the latest sequel almost beats the first, ridding of what predictability it proposes, accompanied by gory deaths and great twists.One of the best things about Scream 4 was that it had the most humor out of the other entries in the series. Finely making use of its clichés, the comedic spirit of Scream is plentiful.The actors are brilliant too. Considering that most of them are relatively young, their very own scenes are made watchable. This made a lot of their deaths a little emotionally   intense.Most importantly it is entertaining. If this is the first Scream film you would see, there's a well chance that new fans of the saga would spawn. If you're already familiar with the films, you may get a mixed reaction for some parts. But most of it is great, and it is one of the year's overall best movies.",Scream 4
309,i_like_circles,A brilliant new entry.,8,23 April 2011,"I went into Scream 4 thinking it will be another so-so sequel to the awesome original from 1996 although I did have high enough hopes that it would be better than the lack luster Scream 3. Scream 4 was not so-so. Scream 4 was not only better than Scream 3 but also Scream 2. It's funny, gory and sometimes quite jumpy even making me jump out of my seat more than a few times. Ghostface is still as cruel and calculating but I believe the gore level had been kicked up a few notches in the years between the original film and the new release. Character wise, there are some really strong, fun characters and some ones that I couldn't really care for. Obviously, the originals (Sidney, Dewey and Gale) were my faves along with the comical police woman. Gale is definitely at her sarcastic, kick-ass best. I didn't really like Hayden Panettiere's character; just thought she was trying too hard to be a tough chick but that is probably just me. Plot wise, it's pretty much the same as the others just played out better. Scream 4 is definitely the best out of the sequels, just topping number 2. Not as good as the original but which horror movies are?",Scream 4
310,emo_boi1012,Long awaited film.and it was worth it...,7,16 April 2011,"I watched the first three films before watching this film and I thought all of them were so good I didn't think Scream 4 can beat them. After watching it, I came out of the cinema satisfied and shocked. There were so many things that was very excellent compared to the trilogy.First, the beginning of the film were so unexpected. Although it was a bit silly that it kept carrying on, it certainly made me jump and worried about what's going to happen next. It was nice to see the recurring characters like Sydney, Dewey and Gale and I thought they did a really good job with the film, especially Sydney. She wasn't the same woman like before. She was never afraid and you can tell she's sick of the whole ""Ghostface"" murders. Gale was the same as always, seeking attention and fame. The new characters were very good as well like Hayden Panettiere, Emma Roberts and Rory Culkin. I thought Anthony Anderson was very funny in the film especially how he got killed. The funniest murder in the whole franchise even though it's not supposed to be funny. That certainly made me laugh. The murders was more gory than ever before. There's so much blood and guts in this film, I can't believe this a cert 15 film. I'm 16 so i was lucky enough to watch this film.What was wrong about this movie was it was more of a comedy horror than a suspense horror. Although it has some jumpy scenes, there was more humour than chills. There was some scenes that quite was boring and sometimes pointless.It was very clever that the film is about re-inventing the film and that's how the killers based their murders, by following how the first film occurred. It is certainly the best horror i have seen in a while since horror sequels and remakes these days are terrible (like A Nightmare On Elm Street...)it was certainly worth the wait. Like what Sydney Prescott said in the film, ""You forgot the number one rule about remakes. Never f*** with the original.""",Scream 4
311,nosiru,Gripping... Yet So Funny,9,17 April 2011,"Scre4m (Scream 4) is a Thriller Mystery Horror film directed by Wes Craven (same guy that brought us all the previous Screams & Last House On The Left, 2009). Ten Years has passed and Cindy Prescott has managed to piece back her life one book at a time. She goes back to where it all started and unfortunately for her she gets a visit from the Ghostface Killer. Its Starring David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Emma Roberts, Hayden Panettiere, Anthony Anderson, Alison Brie, Rory Culkin, Adam Brody & Mary McDonnell.THE REVIEW:So... What's Your Favourite Scary Movie?Scre4m is back for the fourth instalment in its series and trust us when we say it's something special. The whole production team went that little bit extra to make this one a success. What we have here is a quality & entertaining slasher film. Die-hard fans are in for a special treat as Craven gives us a whole new angle on the Horror genre. This just might be the best Scream since the first one. #DebatableSlides and Smalls had the opportunity of sitting in for a screening and watching this suspenseful piece of film making. It should be illegal to laugh some of the killings that happen in this film, stab after stab after stab the whole story easily grabs your attention (its actually ridiculous how many stabbings occur). From the opening scenes the laughter naturally starts to roll in. One other thing director got right was the element of surprise, the camera work was perfectly done. The whole not knowing what was aroused the corner and who was where kept us at the edge of our seats. The music also helped a lot (multiple make you jump scenes). Once the first kill happens we naturally started trying to guess who the killer was, they hide it very well until the reveal it right at the end. It's very scary and funny at the same time (good combination). We recommend anyone who wants blood and laughter will thoroughly enjoy this flick.The cast as a whole was brilliant. Cox, Arquette, Campbell & Roberts all pull off strong performances that helped it all come together.#OVERALL: Very Good Horror Film.",Scream 4
312,LydiaBianca,"Guts, gore and begging for more.",7,15 April 2011,"Scream 4, is a great way to welcome a contemporary audience to the horror franchise started more than a decade ago.The film begins and ends with enough guts and gore to keep the audience begging for more.I enjoyed the film, however, the 'who dunnit?' element, left a lot to be desired, and became rather comical.Most of the characters worked well and were able to create suspense -though I just didn't feel terrified compared to Scream 1,and 2...though in it's own right, this film is worthy to be added to the Scream collection.7/10",Scream 4
313,chrismrrw,A Tired Formula,5,13 January 2012,"Alright for 2 hours of entertainment, I suppose, but there's nothing new in there really, and I wonder how many more sequels the Scream franchise can have before it is finally killed off.It's not scary and the only time you're likely to get a shock is more down to the intense musical score when a character gets surprised by the killer(s) etc. than any genuinely scary atmosphere throughout the film.The characters in this 'horror movie' constantly making reference to 'typical horror movies' or earlier Scream films wears thin very quickly (the 'film within a film'). The dialogue is riddled with characters discussing what victims and killers do in typical horror films/earlier Scream films, and how they themselves should act in order not to be killed. It's as if the film's writer wants you to know that he knows how typical horror films/earlier Scream films pan out and that he wants to make sure, that by acknowledging this, Scream 4 won't fall into the category of being 'typical' and cringe-worthy. The writer is constantly trying to tackle and outwit the viewers' anticipation by telling the viewer what that anticipation is, and then deviating from it. It might seem clever to some, but I found that it (the format itself) ended up becoming predictable, and it was certainly no substitute for times when a good horror film really generates a scary atmosphere throughout.The way characters part acknowledge that they are in a film will have to be further developed for any future Scream films; I'm not sure how, but I wonder how many more Scream films it would take before the characters were actually looking into the camera and talking to the viewer. There's no harm in watching it, of course. It's entertaining to some extent, but don't expect it to be anything more than your average slasher flick.Good luck! :-)",Scream 4
314,peaceandcalm,Excellence in horror,10,19 April 2011,A masterpiece of horror. As exciting as the original without detracting from the movie within a movie element from Scream 2 and Scream 3. Sydney Prescott returns to her hometown after 10 years in exile to promote her biography. After Ghostface makes a glorious and gory return Sydney is ready with lessons learned. A new social network is ready to use the rise of viral videos as Ghostface is determined to make the world remember the old ways with a 2011 technological twist. A classic horror film that set a chilling new standard in 1996 becomes a new standard that builds and strengthens the original leading into a new trilogy that is hopefully on the way.,Scream 4
315,azerman18,Not to be missed,8,28 June 2015,"Scream 4 is much like its' predecessors in the sense that it gives us the best of both worlds, horror and comedy. Similar to the other films, numerous references are made to other horror films and they tease and mock many elements of the slasher film such as plot twists ( Friday The 13th),and miraculously reviving when the killer is presumed dead (Halloween). The creators of Scream 4 thought outside the box and they incorporated their own elements rather than following other slasher films (sex, one survivor). The gore in the film is plentiful but at times it is exaggerated to the extent that it is unnecessary and the makers of the film wanted large amounts of gore in order to make it a ""splatter film"". In films such as this, we tend to focus more on the suspense and elements that build up to the big scenes rather than the acting of the characters as individuals. The acting is fairly good for a horror movie. The actors do a good job at portraying terror and horror throughout the film. I would classify Scream as a dark comedy. There are many people who say that Wes Craven can't direct like he used to. Well, they are wrong. Wes Craven proved with this film that age doesn't affect ones performance in film. Many sequels are boring and they are mere duplicates of the original. But what is unique about Scream 4 is that it takes its' own path towards creativity. See it!",Scream 4
316,moviecroc,"Yes, it's THAT good!",10,17 April 2011,"I saw Scream back when I was six and nearly pooped my pants. Terrifying movie. I saw Scream 2 when I was thirteen and loved it. Scream 3 right after, it was meh.Wait 2 and a half years and now we have Scream 4.Characters that are fleshed out, a clever and funny opening, and great kills make on HELL of a fun ride.The opening was fantastic. Some people criticize it, but I loved it. The kill right before the title card was amazingly haunting. Everything was perfect.The rest between the scene after and the Stab-a-Thon was a little rushed, still was good. There could have been a little more character development.The finale was crazy. It was intense, surprising, and was just a mind fvck. I loved every second of.SEE THIS MOVIE.",Scream 4
317,b_evans,Scream 4 your ten dollars back,1,15 April 2011,"Why do people even make movies like this? Oh ya, because guys will be dragged to them by their girlfriends and they will still make a profit. Basically this movie is like any other remake of an old, boring horror movie: same old, same old. Sensationalist (meaning bad) acting, too many teenagers, retarded plot, people being stabbed by a dude who just shows up out of nowhere (how original). The characters in this movie even talk about horror movies and all the clichés, and how the killer must 'one up' these scenarios. Despite this, the filmmakers clearly had no ideas of their own, as they do these very same scenes they were discussing, and do not, indeed, up the ante whatsoever. Wes Craven is an asshole, and a shitty director/producer/anything to do with movies and he is getting rich off of this crap, so stand up, and say no to this piece of shite that brings nothing new to the table.",Scream 4
318,No-Explanation,Scream for Scream Four.,7,20 April 2011,"Review One: Scream 4To explain anything of the films actual content would ruin the film entirely. While this film does have replay value, the emotional and comedic value will fizzle, so I suggest avoiding spoilers. As such, of course, this review IS spoiler free. The fourth of the Scream franchise (aptly named Scream 4), currently showing in theaters, is a strange comedy-horror film. Combining comedy and horror is a hard task, as previous entries in the franchise have demonstrated (Scream 3 being somewhat a failure in both regards), Scream 4 may in fact be handling both well. On the comedic front, we have maybe one or two jokes falling flat, but others which can prompt tears. Horror wise, you'll be cashed up on jump scares and suspense.What will bring a smile to everyone's face is the reuniting of the cast as we return to Woodsbro with Sidney, Dewey and Gale fifteen years after the first of the Ghostface murders for the release of Sidney's new book when, wouldn't you guess, all goes wrong when Ghostface returns to create a REMAKE. While the premise is a clever satire of the current generation of horror, you'll be left feeling somewhat too far back in the past. Many of the elements are still stuck in the 90's, and some of the new rules aren't employed enough to show significance. You'll want to have a basic knowledge of both teen-slasher horror and the 00's horror's to understand the many jokes throughout, some more subtle than others. But fear not if you don't, or perhaps you should fear, as the horror in the film isn't easy, either. Horror veterans won't see much in this regard (though their appeal is likely the satirical elements of the Scream franchise, anyway), but there are time's when the suspense stabs you in the shoulder, stomach and leg all at once. Jump scares, while the lowest form of Horror, are used in typical Scream fashion, more reminiscent of Scream two.Bringing the film down, unfortunately, is that some sections drag on. While some argue the final scene over did it, I'd argue it was brilliantly done. However, sometimes it gets almost so dragged out between killings you stop worrying ghost-face will jump out and start hoping it'll happen already. The cast size is also far too big, so we spend the entire film trying to love a new-comer, but in 3 minutes we're looking at the next. Finally, the ending was quite expected, unfortunately. Gone are the surprise twists, this was easily guessed. Though this isn't entirely a negative, it's not in typical scream fashion and detracts from the feel of the franchise. Having said that, the opening sequence to the film is absolutely superb, and one of the most hilarious yet daunting sequences in the history of film, better than any scream opening prior. Not a second of it drags, despite you'll expect otherwise.Rating: For fans of the franchise and general horror film fans: Eight Ghostfaces out of Ten, a solid return which is almost, if not better than the original. For newcomers and lesser horror fanatics: Six Ghostfaces out of Ten. Recommended viewing of Scream (1996) prior to make it worthwhile. Overall: A solid 8, as the target audience is clearly the fans of horror and scream, of which this will appeal to completely.",Scream 4
319,dylan-walker1,a very good movie best scream since scream one,10,4 April 2011,i was very happy walking out of scream 4 i could not stop thinking about the first kill it was funny and brutal this movie was made by the same people that made pariah 3D that movie was horrible but this was a good way to start fresh. this movie being directed by the mastermind Wes craven the director of all the other screams the 3rd one may have been bad this one was 10 times better even maybe 100 times. There are still problems in this movie like how the end drags a little the dialogue could have been better at some points and right after the amazing opening seen it tries it inter dose all the characters again which takes awhile also the kills are all stabs not like saw where bones and blood are flying everywhere. To me i liked the stabbings more than death traps in saw. This movie brings back slashers and puts paranormal activity back in the trash this is good old fashion horrors and the best scream movie and it is better than most reboots which this is. so in the end i have one thing to say go watch SCREAM 4,Scream 4
320,alex-ramdhanie,Simple excellence,10,15 April 2011,"Scre4m gave an ambiance of sheer horror! No one was safe! The brutalities were high and the humor was also (a little too high, but acceptable). The plot excelled in every way. The opening was quite strange and I preferred to just have a real kill, rather than two brutal teases! The film was well produced and directed. Sidney returns, once again, and causes the town of Woodsboro savage gore. The best moment was when Olivia Morris gets brutally murdered. I felt so sympathetic for her! It was tear-jerking sadness! There are incalculable jump scenes and when you suspected someone, they died! The killer(s) are evenly predictable and unpredictable. The killer was one psychotic maniac! It was insane at Scre4m Premiere Night. It's always best watching slashers with a crowd! The additional information is below. Rating: 9.3/10.0 Rated R For Some Strong Graphic Bloody Horror Violence/Gore, And Pervasive Language (my rating) Pros: Killer Twists/ Brutal deaths/ Fresh plot/ Teenagers/ Cons: Everyone gets stabbed! The beginning was Horrible! Final Result: Scre4m is the second best installment, second to Scream. The movie is amazing and worth a watch! It's on my top 15 best movies for sure! Rank (in best horror film collection): 34 (out of top 100)",Scream 4

322,SzamarCsacsi,Kevin Williamson is back... with a vengeance,8,29 October 2013,"Scream is a masterpiece, which I like to attribute to the excellent screen writing of Kevin Williamson. Don't get me wrong, I hold Wes Craven among the best directors in the genre of horror, but Scream was just something else.Then came Scream 2 which, although enjoyable, sunk into a disappointing mediocrity. As Williamson's draft was scrapped while making the 3rd, it fell even further from the brilliance of the original. Many years passed with a possible fourth installation up in the air. Craven himself stated he wouldn't return unless the script was as good as the first Scream. Did he make the right call? Absolutely. The returning Kevin Williamson delivered a stellar script.Scream 4 is a strange mixture of a sequel and a remake. It both continues the events of the trilogy while replays the first part. The self-reflexivity of neo-slashers is taken to whole next level. It's no longer just a cheap cop out self criticizing your on movie's weaknesses before someone else does.Scream 4 pays a great tribute to the genre of horror, something Scream 2 and 3 failed to do, while also being refreshing. Dumb blonds are no more, instead the movie is filled with intelligent female characters to the point they are over-represented. The final twist is also a surprising and brave one. The original still holds up, but Scream 4 finally makes a really good sequel. Those who were disappointed with the series after part 2 and 3, should definitely give this one a chance, because it returns to the right track.",Scream 4
323,lilicedude227,Similar to Scream 3 very campy.,5,15 April 2011,"If you like your horror movies with extra cheese then go see Scre4m. The kill scenes were the most brutal out of all of the films but to me this was the least funniest out of all of them. Also it is the least original and least plausible. All of the newer teen characters were one dimensional and no character development. The old cast was also weak and poorly written. Neve Cambell is the best part, still gives a good performance but Gale was very one dimensional and seemed like her and Deweys scenes were just time fillers with no real point to them.This Scream is very similar to a Friday the 13th film.",Scream 4
324,derin-nehir-goksu,I like it,6,2 April 2013,I like the film. It is enjoyable. Actually I do not like scream series. But I think that it is better then other films. The topic is a little different. I used to fear while I was watching the scream series. But now I think that it is really enjoyable. I really like and of the film. The girl who look like guiltless is killer. End of the film is the best part of the film because other things are ordinary. I think Sidney Prescott who is the main character will never die. I saw her in the first film. People who are in the film died quickly. But the main character could not die. I think this is a bit absurd. The actresses and actors is successful in the film.,Scream 4
325,horrornerdsdotcom,Scream 4 is Scream on Steroids but is it Enough?,6,2 January 2013,"""Scream 4"" opens with a self-effacing skit, as always, mocking its own revolutionary logic to horror movies with a stocky caricature of a scary introduction. It sets the tone for the rest of the film, which accentuates the comedy while downplaying the horror—at least the believable horror that made the first film so inviting. Scream 1-3 were devised as a trilogy, and so the fourth installment was somewhat of a relaunch, though a few familiar faces pop up, including Sidney (Neve Campbell), Dewey (David Arquette), and Gale (Courteney Cox). In this world of Scream, life has returned to normal after ten years from the events of Scream 3. The only menaces out there are the unending sequels of ""Stab"", a film within a film, snarkily criticizing the criticisms of Scream 2 and 3. Despite a zany fake out introduction that will tickle your funny bone (or test your patience), the movie devolves into a series of horror movie clichés with a new ghostface killer on the loose pulling some familiar tricks. Kevin Williamson's dialog, once killer-smart and intricately balanced between parody and terror, seems more like an apology than satire by now.Horror and GoreNevertheless, Scream fans will find plenty to gush (blood) over, and the film does manage to introduce a charming cast to the shenanigans such as Anna Paquin, Emma Roberts and the fairly normal-looking Rory Culkin, (Macaulay's brother) who undoubtedly got the last laugh of that family. The violence level is impressive and the Ghostface killer is particularly nasty this time around, since CGI is used for the first time in the franchise's history to make the gashes more realistic. While this might be familiar territory and not nearly the shocker that was the original Scream, most horror fans concede this is easily the best film since the original. How to Watch ItScream 4 is best reserved for drinking nights with a few close friends, but not the entire lot. After all, watching the umpteenth Scream film may start putting ideas in your heads that it's time to grow up and move on...at least to a new horror franchise",Scream 4
326,RicCarr,Reivindicates the saga after more than a decade.,9,19 April 2011,"Never before have I seen a horror franchise spawn 4 movies and still be taken seriously, usually when a franchise follows this path it means that the producers are making annual cash-ins trying to milk the franchise as much as possible while it is still popular and relevant (see Saw, Final Destination), well for Scream 4 (or Scre4m)that's not the case, this movie makes an effort to continue a saga which was put to sleep for more than a decade, without it being a re-imagining, re-make or re-boot like the hideous Rob Zombie attempt at a Halloween remake(although the movie makes fun of this in a brilliant way). Scream 4 is more than that, while a sequel, it feels like a complete new beginning, it carried the bad stigma that the failed Scream 3 left behind, yet it proved that the series is still relevant, and with the adequate script it takes off on a delightful new killing spree.10 years have passed since Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) last encountered the Ghostface killer, she has moved on with her life and now dedicates to writing her most intimate memoirs and book touring the country with her publicist, making her last stop at her hometown of Woodsboro, the place where it all started. Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) and Dewey Riley (David Arquette) are living their peaceful lives in that town, the same as Jill Roberts (Emma Roberts) Kirby Reed (Hayden Panettiere) and their friends, which, begin being stalked by a new masked killer.When at it's best, Scream 4 manages to make you laugh hysterically but at the same time, in the same scene, give you heart-stopping scares, other reviewers think that the only characters you care about are the main threesome (Sidney, Gale and Dewey) but in my opinion, it is precisely the ""new rules"" factor that make you doubt whether they'll make it or not, meanwhile, you start caring about the other characters (specially Kirby Reed, played by ""Heroes"" cheerleader Hayden Panettiere) who shares her love for horror films with an unusual crush.While some of the decisions made by characters really fall into the ""dumb-blonde-who-goes-upstairs"" category, it is precisely the killer that takes credit for this decision making, since you don't know where he'll pop up next, thus making going outside an even scarier choice.Scream 4 is really better thought out than it's predecessor, there's no doubt about that, this time, the gore is even more gruesome, the body count is larger and the truth is that you'll never guess who the killer is, it really could be anyone, and director Wes Craven really makes this a possibility.In the end, Scream 4 perfectly combines comedy, horror, action and drama to create a new formula, while not a perfect movie, it's shortcomings become less important by one aspect, it really doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time it makes a homage of the saga and utilizes itself as a tool to further immortalize the Ghostface killer as one of the most popular icons in the horror genre.",Scream 4
327,brandon09,I LOVED SCREAM 4!! Best Since the Original,10,17 April 2011,"I saw Scream 4 the Friday it came out and I just would like to say Welcome back Scream!! This movie to me was very good, fun, funny, scary, and Brilliant! It was so great to see Neve Campbell back as Sidney Prescott I truly missed her character. She is no more a victim but instead a fighter and a Strong Women mentally, physically and emotionally! Courtney-Cox is Back as the Bitchy Gale who is dealing with a Writers Block and is so Bored with her life for the past 10 years and once Sidney is back in town and killings start to happen she becomes excited again doing everything from crashing parties with hidden cameras involved (ala. Scream) and Hiring people to film her investigation! Dewey is now the Town Sheriff and is more matured and fun and lovable as always! The new generation of victims/suspects are a great addition to the franchise with a few personal surprises. The biggest surprise to me was Emma Roberts who going in i was not sure how she was going to do in this movie as far as acting. let me just Say she really surprised me and to me this is a big turning point for her career! Lets just say she is no nickelodeon actress anymore! Hayden Was my favorite of the new generation she was just the definition of Awesome. Nico Tortorella was great too even though he wasn't used as much as the others. Marielle Jaffe as Olivia was great and I felt really bad for her character once it became her time. and of course Rory Culkin did great. The new deputy's (Anthony Anderson, Adam Brody, & Marley Shelton) were a great team and all felt like Dewey in the first. They were very funny! The opening was INSANE I will just leave it as that!! It's not better than Scream Drew opening but its on par with scream 2 opening! Its shorter than all of them but it gets its point across and delivers the goods! Great Movie I hope everyone will take the chance to go see scream 4! Scream 5 I hope you get made cause Im ready",Scream 4
328,johndough07,DON'T F**K WITH THE ORIGINAL!!!!-Sidney Scream 4,10,16 April 2011,"I have been waiting for this film to come out since February 4th, 2000. The time has finally come.....and they did a beautiful job. It definitely has a different feel to it than the other films, but in a good way. The dialogue, and the intensity are amazing....it's unpredictable and addicting I have already seen it twice. The only thing that I have a problem with was the opening sequence....I understand what they were trying to do, but I was really hoping to have a suspenseful opening scene...because that was one of my favorite parts of the original three. But after my second viewing I definitely warmed up to it, and enjoyed it more than the first time. Same thing goes for the entire film....the second viewing made me love it more. The music in this one had a very different feel to it...and I was disappointed they didn't play the song Red Right Hand. Also, I think that this film should have had a Cast Poster....that's also one of my favorite thing about the films. But none of that has to do with the quality of the film...and this film definitely has quality. if you are a fan of Scream, GO SEE THIS MOVIE....HAYDEN PANETIERRE KICKS ASS!!!!",Scream 4
329,MatthewKerr,"Very good, especially for die-hard fans",7,27 March 2011,"THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE: READ ON FOR MY REVIEW ON SCREAM 4 (2011) I was pleasantly surprised. This was a great movie, especially for fans of the original. It makes up for the awfulness of Scream 3, and includes many very talented new actors and actresses. I was very surprised to walk into the screening theater and see a fantastic horror film. As soon as the Dimension logo appeared on screen, my heart began to race. The opening scene was brutal and hilarious, and it was great to see all of the original characters back on the screen again. I found the Wes Craven cameo, and was laughing as I spotted it out. This movie was great to watch, even though there were some things that needed to be fixed. Very minor problems though. There were some parts in the dialogue that seemed unrealistic (Ehren Kruger re-writes), but it wasn't a huge deal. Also, the ending was kinda long, but it was also very suspenseful. I would most definitely recommend this to a friend in search of a good horror movie.",Scream 4
330,mileydurbin,"I was afraid I was going to be disappointed, but I was wrong.",7,5 November 2011,"Okay, so usually I don't go for sequels, especially when there's only so much you can do with slashers; it ends up getting old (Friday the 13th, Halloween). But with Scre4m, I gave it a chance. After all, the third one was really good; they were able to give the plot a sort of fresh twist (which I was glad, because with the second movie, I felt like I was watching the first Scream movie all over again), so I figured ""Sure. Why not?"" I really liked the beginning. It was unexpected and fun; it was nice to get away from the typical Scream movie beginning but still keep the idea. I was really happy that the over all plot was simple and practical. This tends to be a problem for a lot of sequels, because they always want to try to outdo the previous films in that franchise (this is partly why I gave this movie a chance).The good chunk of the movie wasn't really anything special in my opinion. Like I said: there's only so much you can do with slasher films. No matter how different you make the plot or the characters, you still can't escape the fact that there's not much to a guy sneaking up on you and stabbing you. Now I will say that the ""fight"" sequences throughout the movie were very well done. It looked graphic and painful without looking fake (which is, again, another big problem horror movies tend to have).Once you learn that the killer is going for a ""horror movie remake"" killing structure, you worry that it will become predictable. I sat there thinking ""Okay, this is kind of neat"", and then when the boyfriend left the room and Robbie gets killed by Ghost Face, I sort of slapped myself and say ""Of course! It's supposed to be a remake, so it's the boyfriend!"" I became disappointed, because the thing I love about the Scream movies is how surprised you are when you find out who the killer is. I thought that the movie was down the toilet, but then Charlie stabbed Kirby and then I got sort of confused (I figured that there had to be more than one killer; there was a short list of overall characters and all of them encountered Ghost Face at least one time). Then I was like ""Okay, he's in cahoots with the boyfriend, Trevor. Then Ghost Face takes off the mask-and it's Jill! I was completely taken by surprised. Throughout the whole movie, I would watch every character and say to myself ""Don't be surprised if it's this person because..."" but Jill never crossed my mind. Ever. I thought the dialogue between her and Charlie was sort of cheesy (including the kiss, which I honestly didn't get), but luckily it was short and quick. Hearing Jill's ""villain speech"" was sort of head scratching, because it didn't seem like her motivation was big or important enough (I killed all of those people because I wanted to be famous!) but you soon see how psycho the girl is, and it makes up for it. When she kills Sydney, I was basically like ""Shoot"". I've always like Sydney, and I was like ""Surely, she's not going to die"" and of course she didn't. I really liked how it didn't end with a blood bath at the house; it continued at the hospital. Overall, I thought the ending was very well-done, and I applaud Wes Craven on that.",Scream 4
331,metalheadstef,"Yet another terrible ""Scream"" flick. Don't bother!",1,15 April 2011,"""Sidney Prescott, a prolific horror book writer, returns to her hometown Woodsboro as part of her book tour. Incidentally, her visit coincides with the anniversary of the first Ghostface massacre. Quite incidentally, the Ghostface is back, too.""Having watched the first film, which did not appeal to me at all, I was invited by a friend of mine to the premiere of Scream 4 in Greece. Despite my doubts, the tickets were free, so I thought I had nothing to lose.So, Ghostface is back... again and doesn't have much to offer... In fact, I was kept on the edge of my seat during most of the film! Not because I was afraid (since I wasn't...), but because I was terribly bored. This film has the cheesy clichés of most Wes Craven's films, whom by the way I would never trust for any good horror flick anymore, since his works in the new millennium have been horrid (""The hills have eyes"", ""Nightmare on Elm's street"" etc.) This one is pretty much more of the same... You still get the old Ghostface weird phone call conversations, you still get the same shallow characters, yet almost no innovation. The only addition is the ""dramatic"" character of Sidney Prescott (having not seen any other Scream flick apart from the first one, I have no idea if she played in any other ""Scream""...) whose addition tries to make things a bit more, well, dramatic. Still that is not achieved... Although her character is the one developed the most in the film and despite the fact that Neve Campbell brought her in life well with her so-so acting, the terrible script did not let the whole drama part take its place well in the film, despite it wasn't much of a short film and there was plenty of room for more dramatic scenes.So, the only thing left, are the killing scenes. That's were you get the typical Wes Craven scenes. Over the top bloody, gory and long! There was also no imagination, nothing too spectacular to talk about. ""Friday the 13th"" for example, in its remake form was terrible but there still were those awesome killing scenes you would skip to on you PC back home, so that you can whisper a few ""wow, what a kill!"" kind of phrases. Scream, however, fails in that, too. Nothing awesome, nothing a horror film fan would like. Let alone the main characters always end making the obvious mistakes so that the killing spree goes on, which in my opinion would spoil any horror film. To add to that, the actors (or mostly actresses) were not that convincing in the killing scenes, with only an exception or two which I will not spoil.Therefore, you must be asking ""why didn't you just leave the theater and leave us all in our misery?"". Well, that's because there was something that kept me back to my seat. Despite the fact the film was terrible, it was actually... funny. Just like the first one, there were scenes I just burst into laughter, not because there was a joke (although some lines were in fact funny), but because some scenes were just ridiculous, particularly while we get closer to the ending. And that's sort of good, especially compared to the ""Scary Movie"" awful (yet vulgar and crude) sense of humor. That is pretty much the only reason to stick around during Scream 4. Pretty much, nothing more...So, to bring this hole review to a conclusion, I did by no means enjoy Scream 4. It was around two hours of wasted time in quite a short life. It fails in pretty much every aspect, which brings it quite close to unwatchable. If you are a fan of stupid, senseless, crude horror films or the horrid Scary Movie series, go ahead. If not then pick something else, pronto!!Overall Rating: 2.8/10 Acting: 4.2/10 Scenario: 0.00000000000000000/10Alternatives:If you liked it: ""Scary Movie"", ""Friday the 13th"" (the remake), ""Nightmare on Elm's Street"" (again, the remake)If you didn't: ""Ils"", ""The Descent"", ""Rec"", ""Wolf Creek"", ""Stephen King's IT""Thanks for reading, Steve P",Scream 4
332,Horror_Fan_JB,I don't usually say this...but the persons who brought you the original...just beat their original with this one!,10,20 April 2011,"I just saw Scre4m...and...Oh My...I was more than surprised! Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson teamed up again, and here is the final result: a hilarious, scary, schocking experience. If you're totally familiar with the horror genre rules, it is possible that you can have an idea of whom the killer might be, but that doesn't affect the experience of the movie at all. It keeps you guessing from the beginning to the very end. It was a totally fun ride, it was worth the waiting! So grab a bag of pop corn, cup of soda, have some friends with you and watch how horror movies are made of. Great Directing, Great Writing and Awesome Performances.

What add more dumb blondes? What a crappy thing. I was not even scared, and that is worst of all. I could piratically laugh the whole way through the movie. I would like to add that it was so god damn predictable. You just as might as made Sidney Prescott the serial killer. Plus it had nothing to do with the family that stared the killing.

Just die your the most annoying teen horror star to hit the stage God!! I can not believe I step foot in to watch a cheese cop and more!!! Saw was better than this, and hands down.

334,tatamand,SCRE4M review (Spoiler free),7,14 April 2011,"Hey guys. Awaiting this as a big fan of the franchise, I tried to tone down my expectations, but when the time came at the pre-premiere in Denmark, I found it hard not to be intoxicated by the atmosphere around the Palads Theatre.First off, this will not contain spoilers! The opening scene: Simply great. Almost reaches the heights of the original, and this - indeed is original as well. Knocked people off their chairs, and everyone busted out in celebration. I was very surprised how the ""feel"" from the first film really worked it's way into this scene.The middle: Great character building - loads of suspects, and constant twists and turns (most in the end though - obviously) The new generation is great as well, even though I would say that one or two characters is a bit misplaced. One character that I was really surprised with, was Hayden Panettieres! She did an outstanding job, and stole most of the scenes she was in. The old gang, Sid, Dewey and Gale was very important to this movie, and also the main reason why it works (as you want a Scream film to work 10 years later) The ending: I won't give anything away, not even.. Anything. But look out: It's heavy, and it's great! I was very surprised with this one, it really did well, and I would place it in between the first and the second. It was very ""screamish"", and that was the most important thing for this film to do to the audience. It was a ride back to 1996, but at the same time a clear statement of new-age horror! I gave the first one a 9, and since I'll place this a little below, an 8 is the least I could give it! 7 is simply too low, which is good! As a hardcore fan, I love this! Very important for the series!! The ending:",Scream 4
335,jz61,Scream 4 is a step in the right direction!,8,30 April 2011,"This article contains minor spoilers such as the plot line of scream 4.So I saw scream 4 on the 14.4.2011. I was really excited that they were doing another Scream movie. I've seen 1,2 and 3 a couple of times and I really enjoyed those movies. Scream 4 was no exception, I have to say that it is one of the best movies that I've ever seen.Neve Campbell returns as Sidney Prescott. The murders start happening again when she(Sidney) returns for her book tour on the anniversary of the original Woodsboro murders. Courtney Cox returns as Gale Weathers- Arquette and David Arquette returns as Sheriff Dewey Riley. I won't give anything important away about the movie because I know that some people haven't seen it yet so all I'll say is that the movie was action-packed, it was fast paced and the opening was pretty good along with the killer/s motive/s and the ending was fantastic. The movie was funny in parts and there were some very good one liners from several characters along with some interesting horror trivia. The only negative comment about this film is that it was lacking the scare factor from the previous three films but overall it was an enjoyable.Highly Recommended. A blistering 8/10!",Scream 4
336,spotlessmind03,The Better Sequel to Scream,7,17 April 2011,"Scream 4 proves to be a wholly unnecessary and surprisingly intriguing sequel to the original trilogy. It is a nostalgic blast to see the re-teaming of Sidney (Neve Campbell) Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale (Courteney Cox) back in their roles as the main trio that has managed to outlive three elaborate killing sprees over the years. It's been eleven years since the original murders began in Woodsboro, California and now a psychotic slasher in a familiar mask is on the loose wreaking havoc again. Sidney Prescott, played brilliantly by Campbell in this installment, returns home to Woodsboro to promote her new autobiography. Along with a snooty publicist assistant (Alison Brie), Sidney, Gale and Dewey come back together for a happy hello, but it's not long before Ghostface begins slashing his way through a new host of teen victims and Sidney is forced to relive her own nightmare all over again.The interesting thing about Scream 4 is how long the gap is between the last installment in 2000 and now. The film wisely draws upon character development to create a sense of familiarity with the main trio, and also throws in a talented mix of new kids to balance out the proceedings. I particularly enjoyed the appearance of Hayden Panettiere, and Emma Roberts is also impressive as Sidney's younger cousin Jill. There's a lot going on story-wise in Scream 4, as we are introduced to a whole new group of teenagers associated with Jill. As well, there are also suspects in the form of the local wisecracking cops, including Anthony Anderson, who is seriously misplaced along this kind of material, not to mention Mary McDonnell makes an appearance as Jill's mother.Anybody who has seen the first 3 knows Sidney's background well. These bloodbaths have always been centered around her, and the killer (s) always reveal some motivation that ties in with the death of Sidney's mother. Another thing that is apparent in Scream 4's strive to be fresh is that the killer has a whole new agenda, leaving the mystery wide open and well concealed. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before too many people spoil the identity of the killer, but rest assured, you should try to steer clear of this information and see the movie with an open mind. It makes this kind of film much more enjoyable. Wes Craven has always been very successful with this genre, and this latest endeavor is no exception. Scream 4 is a graphically violent, side-splitting and well performed slasher movie with a brain, a heart, and a surprisingly decent amount of shocks and surprises that doesn't condescend to its audience... in short, it's another humorous, relevant and thrilling retread of the original that may not tread much new ground but makes up for it in laughs and scares.",Scream 4
337,briny7777,Not even Close to good!,1,12 September 2011,"I didn't like this movie at all! there was nothing clever about this movie. Every scream movie after part 1 obviously whenever they introduce a new character it turns out to be the killer. Part 4 was so offline and Unbelievable it was sickening. You have 2 scrawny kids but you have a 6 foot killer. The whole family thing is played out and the creepy film student (ie: Mickey from part 2) was done before. If they wanted shock and awe they would have made one of the originals the killer. This movie is seriously flawed. Blame Dimension films? Blame Wes? Blame Kevin Williamson? I say Blame all of the above. People wanted to see another scream because it was a slasher movie and missed hearing the killer's voice, PLAIN AND SIMPLE! Scream 4 was not as bad as 3 was.but it was not better than 2 or 1 at all. If there is a Scream 5 which I hope there isn't. Wes should put this one to rest. Or if there is one? make a whole new cast up start it fresh. Have Sydney and all the regulars die at the beginning to give it a fresh start. Until then SCREAM 5 doesn't need to happen and I'm hoping it doesn't happen.",Scream 4
338,scott10101,Brilliant!,8,20 April 2011,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS OR INFORMATION YOU DO NOT WISH TO HEAR UNTIL YOU HAVE SEEN THIS TITLE, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!I really liked this film, it's still connected to all the others in a really clever way, especially the first one, and the film is also very suspenseful and it really delivers! Wes Craven can really direct a movie! he has created yet another film that is not so dependant on gore and violence, sure this one is more violent than the others (Despite it being a 15) but it also still has a really good AND reasonable story, it's not like some fool going on a killing spree it adds real emotion to the film and it's all really in depth, and the funny twists are a great way to make the film even better! so in conclusion I'd say this is one of the best Scream films - My favourites being 2 & 4 - defiantly deserves recognition by everybody, and considering it has got a %1000 popularity on IMDb I think that has already happened, so I'd say this film was a definite 10/10 because it's impacting, emotional and violent ( <--- something that the scream films could not be without!)",Scream 4

Jill Roberts is one of the crazy killers in this film! Emma Roberts was amazing in this film, definitely in keying her crazy side. another person i have recognize is Kristen bell when she has the cameo part and stabs Anna paquin, i was so shocked and not even thinking that was going to happen. i loved how they had the new generation of kids and had it all played out in the style of the first film. the one thing that i didn't really care for was how it droned on in the hospital scene, just be done already. i loved that Sydney fought against ghost face and not just ran away. i really didn't like how much gore was in it, it just seemed like too much. i really liked the new cast, especially Hayden panittiere. Wes craven definitely succeed again in making a horror movie, i definitely didn't waste money on this movie, it was that great.for this film i give it a 8. hope you enjoy it too.",Scream 4

Great job, Emma.Lastly, I was a little upset because there wasn't many super gory scenes and scenes that can make you jump off your seat, shout and pee your pants. Plus the 10 minutes intro before the title was given was pretty much annoying. It's like you watch the first ten minuted of the movie and then you are disappointed knowing that that was just the intro and it wasn't in the real plot.But to round it all up, Scre4m or Scream 4 is a movie you just can't miss.",Scream 4
341,FilmPhreeks,Scream 4 Review *NO SPOILERS*,8,21 December 2011,"Okay, let me give you a little history about the Scream series. Going back to 1996 was the year that director Wes Craven (the director of the first Nightmare On Elm Street and the original Hills Have Eyes) had given us a new generation of scary movies where in this case, the characters in the movie are self-aware and know the outcome on how to survive a horror movie, as quoted by Randy from the first movie. This idea was a very great concept on adding humor to the Scream franchise and basically satirizing all the clichés in slasher films. To me, that was really great because at the time Scream came out, all the slasher movies in the past including the Friday The 13th and Halloween series were using the standard horror movie clichés including hiding in the shadows, high body count, ignorant characters, and teenagers always having sex and drinking and then getting killed by a killer. Each Scream movie had a recurring theme present on what it was doing with it's satirical horror. The first film was about knowing how to survive in a horror movie establishing rules for the characters and getting out of tight situations. Scream 2 was about trying to survive in sequels. And Scream 3 was about surviving in a trilogy as the final chapter, (which at the time Scream 3 came out, Wes Craven originally ended the franchise with the door closed). And now with Scream 4, 11 years after the 3rd one, it's at this point where the audience knows the outcome of the situation going on with the characters. Anyway, the movie Scream 4 has actually done a lot of improvements to its predecessors. As the tagline suggests, there are new rules present in this one for a new generation of characters. The most notable being that this movie's theme is trying to survive in a horror remake. Because the referential humor present in the film establishes that there have been a number of sequels to the film-within-film called Stab over the past ten years and it's becoming stale with it's audience within the movie who know the predictable outcomes of the killer's presence. What I like the most about the referential jokes that are in this one is that it really does try to be clever with the characters who come across the Ghost-Face Killer (who still has a pretty bad-ass voice by Roger L. Jackson who's played him in every movie as the voice). Once again there's a killer in a ghost-face costume who goes around killing people that are connected to Sydney Prescott, the main survivor from all 4 movies. And this time, Sydney has moved back to her old town Woodsboro and she's written a book about her life. Now, I've always been a really great fan of Neve Campbell, ever since she starred in that movie Wild Things, and here she's back with David Arquette and Courtney Cox again after 10 years and they've still got their characters right. And it's kind of ironic cause David and Courtney got married in real life after Scream 2 and in Scream 4, their characters are married. And in the movie, David's character Dewey is the sheriff now and he's married to Courtney's character Gail. Anyway, back to Scream 4. Now, I can imagine that there's people out there that are divided with the whole scream franchise, whether they don't like the self-reference jokes or they just don't find it scary enough, me, I've always seen them as great fun slasher films that try to be original (and I use that term very loosely) with its premise present and the idea of keeping the killer's identity a secret. I really enjoyed this film. I felt that it was just as good as the original Scream and I think it's up there with Scream 2, better than 3. Now, there are some flaws present with the movie though. I'm not going to spoil anything because I hate when people always tell who the killer is, so, all I'm gonna say is that I kind of wish this one had some more original deaths. Don't get me wrong, it's always cool seeing different ways the killer uses a knife, I just thought that the killer would do something that wasn't seen before. But other than that, I liked the principal cast including David Arquette, Courtney, and Neve are charming as ever. And I even liked Marley Shelton who plays David's deputy in the movie. And I'm also really glad Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson teamed back up again after Scream 2 cause the last one didn't have Williamson's script. Craven still has the talent in the horror genre. I didn't like his last movie My Soul To Take, but I must say he still has it in there with his movies though. I mean, the opening scene is really clever and I'm glad they still had some suspense for the franchise cause you wouldn't ever guess who the killer is. According to Craven, the cast weren't allowed to read past page 70 in the script because Wes didn't want them to know how the killer is. So, in my opinion, this one really holds up a lot. I had a really fun time watching it in a large crowded theater and the people that were there they laughed at a lot of stuff happening and I did too. So, I really recommend this movie and say check it out.",Scream 4
342,beaulieu-sam,Are you serious?,4,16 August 2012,"First of all, let's get something straight. If you love movies with little to no character development, terrible plots, bad acting, cast, and overall horrible film making, then this is the movie for you.I did not have very high expectations for scream 4, and even with the bar set so low, the movie did not deliver. The entire film i was kept wondering why they did not do anything as simple as to investigate bodies or evidence at all. It was basically a wild goose chase the entire time, and even when they are near catching ghostface, he simply slips away as if he/she was a ghost or something. There were multiple times watching this movie where i found myself yelling at the screen ""just shoot him already!"" And did you not find it funny how the police were virtually non-existent the entire movie? Along with Sidney? The cops always arrived at the scene too late, or were picked of by ghostface one by one. The film was so predictable. Honestly, you could tell who the killers were or if you did not, you at least had a good idea towards who it was.My personal opinion towards this film is that if you are looking for a spoof, or if you are in the mood for a movie you will not take seriously, watch this. I really just cannot believe Wes Craven was the director of this disaster.",Scream 4

The script is clever and you won't miss the horror , the mystery , the sarcasm , the sense of humour , the tension and the great acting that the previous films had , including some new interesting characters , one of them being portrayed by gorgeous Emma Roberts..However , even though ""Scream 4"" almost touches the perfection of the previous three films , I think the franchise has shown all it could show and that ""Scream 4"" was a strong finale for ""Scream"".",Scream 4

346,nino-keskilammi,Very good in its own way,9,16 April 2011,"What can i say. I was always a huge fan of the ""Scream"" series. This one was easily better than the 3rd and it beats the 2nd film too. Just like the line said in the film: ""Don't f*** with the original"". They knew it wont be better than the original. It's not and i respect that. It is the 2nd best from all of them though.About the plot. First of all, opening sequence was amazing, just like other people agree with it. I liked the way how killer(s) stabbed their victims. It was something different and was actually enjoyable see people dying for once. Some scares and laughs were epic and the audience were very into it.About the characters. Most likely all of the characters acted very well and were very interesting. Too bad most of the died after short scenes from them, but this is actually a good thing for once in a slasher movie. Most of the times, characters that are ""interesting"" and carry the whole movie, won't die until at the end. This time no one is safe. So that was something different. I was SO much impressed with Emma Roberts. Her acting was amazing, especially at the end. She deserves an Oscar nomination at least and is close to Billy's & Stu's performance... If not even better.Overral, it's a great entry into ""Scream"" series, and wont disappoint Scream fans or even horror fans. Somehow i wish it was a bit more longer. Very entertaining and hilarious. You can compare it to the original. Slasher movies won't get better than this these days! Recommended!",Scream 4
347,KevLysaght,Things can only get worse!,1,23 April 2011,"I was bitterly disappointed with the announcement of Scre4m to begin with. So what happened to ""The Scariest scream is always the last""- tag line of Scream 3? Wes Craven has just exposed himself as a massive lying money-grabber by even attempting to continue this series. Despite my reservations I did pay good money to go and watch this abomination.With due respect, the opening sequence was intelligent and humorous, however it went rapidly downhill from there. The film tried extremely hard to make fun at itself, to a point that it became quite uncomfortable to watch. For example, (SPOILER!) the scene where the young film-maker boy gets killed off, he decided to pretend that he was gay in a failed attempt to bargain for his life. This was weak and made it unbelievable. It felt more like a scene straight out of Scary Movie 0.5! Other than the poor humour, the film's plot and motive of the killer was the weakest of all four films. I mean the other three were far-fetched, with possibly the most believable of them all being a vengeful mother, but this was absolutely ridiculous. A girl who is so fed up of hearing people talk about her infamous estranged cousin that she feels compelled to kill a bunch of people, including her own mother is a stretch of even the most impressionable of imaginations. One of the strong points of the film had to be the likability of Hayden Penitieirieire's character, who she portrayed quite well and it was also good to see Ms Campbell back on the screen again. Overall I feel that if, as has been suggested, this film is continued into a Saw-like polygy, that things can only get worse.",Scream 4
348,jergasmic,Worth the 11 year wait!,10,15 April 2011,"When the first scream came out in 1996, my grandma took me opening night. I was ten at the time, but I fell in love with scream, then the next two installments came out and I watched each one opening night in the theater and fell in love with the franchise even more. I wasn't old enough to actually see the movies in the theater so I had to sneak in, but it was worth the risk. Wes Craven is a genius when it comes to his 'Scream' movies. 'Scream' is known for it's wit, humor and tongue is cheek way of parodying itself and other slasher movies. 'Scream 4' brings back the magic of the first movie in all it's glory. Many of the characters and scenes are reminiscent of the first movie. Emma Roberts is the Neve Campbell, Hayden Panetierre is this movie's Rose McGowan and so forth. It's almost like they're trying to remake the first movie, but with all the original players still in it. You'll sit in the theater and be brought back to 1996, when the magic first happened. Maybe whisper to your friend next to you, 'I remember that from the first movie.' The opening sequence in 'Scream 4' will have you cowering in your seat and rolling on the floor with laughter. 'Scream' movies are known for it's horror, suspense and humor. And 'Scream 4' is no different. The kills in this film are fast and some are hard to watch, one kill early on in the movie, was the most intense and uneasy killing in 'Scream' history in my opinion. The three original characters, Never Campbell, David Arquette and Courtney Cox hold a special place in any fan's heart, much like the toys in 'Toy Story 3'. Since 'Scream 4' has rewritten the rules of horror, you actually fear for their lives in this movie, my heart was racing any time one of these three were alone, I was afraid for them. I was a little iffy about the new actors coming into play, mainly Emma and Hayden. Emma blew me away, she shed her 'Nancy Drew' image and gave a surprise performance I wasn't expecting from her. Hayden Panetierre is one of my least favorite actresses, but quickly became one of my favorite characters in this movie, and she also gave a performance I wasn't expecting. 'Scream 4' is perfect for anyone who is a fan of the franchise. (I used to say trilogy, but now I guess I can't.) It revitalizes the slasher genre, and brings us back to that faithful night in 1996 when we watched the first movie. I do however suggest you familiarize yourself with the past movies if you don't really know them. There are a lot of references to the past movies, that you may not catch. If you already saw the past films, watch them again so it's fresh in your mind when you watch this movie. You won't be disappointed. I waited eleven years for 'Scream 4', ever since the end credits of the third movie started rolling. And I was not disappointed. There was one line towards the end of the movie that will have any fan screaming and cheering. I can't say what it is without spoiling the movie. You'll just have to see for yourself.",Scream 4
349,christian-mcleer,On par with the original,9,15 April 2011,"Something I wish film critics would learn is that not all movies are out to win Oscar's or meant to be watched in any mood. Scream 4 is a movie that the only way to fully enjoy it is to walk in the theater expecting to see a fun, bloody, slasher flick with a simple goal: To subject the audience to an awesome time.Scream 4 delivers on so many levels that I would go so far to say it is just as good if not better than the original. What made the first film so innovative was the fact that it was self-aware and the clichés were known yet fatally repeated. 4 acts accordingly but takes it to a whole other step. Here, the film is twice as aware of how ridiculous it is and keeps up with the times and merges our current world in the classic slasher formula.Something I thought I was going to realize from the beginning was who the killer was. The first three films trained me to notice the little things about each suspect and eventually narrow it down. I couldn't of been more caught off guard. I had my suspicions throughout the entire movie but never saw the end revelation coming. You won't either, trust me.If I were to complain about this near perfect slasher, my only gripes would be a few scenes of dragging dialogue and an ending that while I thought was going to be bitter sweet and totally mind-blowing, was taken in a more formulaic direction. That being said, the ending will definitely leave you satisfied and give you a few more jabs of slick humor.The characters are spot on, the kills gruesome, and the setting is (as all the others were) perfect, but what makes this film truly great was its ability to take a ten year break from the series and come back with a modernized, very cool Friday night slasher that will definitely satisfy fans and moderates alike and give you, if nothing else, a really fun time. And honestly, isn't that what horror is all about?",Scream 4

As expected of course. One thing i will say, is the ending was a twist, i mean, i thought in the last film the person who killed was to change relations with Syd, to something less noticeable but actually it worked because i had an idea who it could have been, but i never expected ....And the beginning kills..... well so not expected LOL.With more characters, more blood, more scares and more motives than anything i could imagine, scream really hit the spot and gave me some great viewing. If they continue with the series, i just hope its better than i could ever ever imagine and not turn into a joke, because i would like to see REAL closure with Sydney and the many years of killers, deaths and screams.I suggest you watch it! I promise you wont miss out or be disappointed.",Scream 4

This movie was the most exciting, scary and witty and it was great because when Wittyness kicks in it always kicks in at the write time also it was funny when Kirby said Bambi(To Robbie) So great. The Horror was so bloody and not that kind of cheesy horror from the terrible prequel SCREAM 3 not written by the boss Kevin Williamson. This was a movie waiting to be made. I'm that kind of person who doesn't regret something before seen it i waited years for it and i waited for a great movie like this.

When i first heard about the film (back when it was in production) i was interested to see it but it flew so far under the radar when it was released and just seemed to disappear. Out of curiosity i decided to watch it. Now that was my first mistake. This movie is just awful, i felt like i was watching the newest entry in the Scary Movie franchise, having Anthony Anderson cast in it also made it feel that way a little bit more. Don't get me wrong, amusing and likable actor but not in this film. The casting was atrocious, the plot was pathetic, acting from the new teenage characters was poor, even David Arquette seemed to be lacking in his acting. It was so corny, predictable and cheesy that i honestly could not believe i was watching Scream 4, they bagged themselves that much that it may as well have been Scary Movie 5. You can't help but ask at the end, Are you serious Wes Craven?Poor, Poor film.",Scream 4
355,stevewhite88,Best Scream since the Original,8,22 April 2011,"It would be a fair assumption to make that the Scream franchise rejuvenated the 'Slasher' genre, with the first release of Scream in 1996, followed by the 2nd Scream movie in 1998 and finally Scream 3 in 2000. The Scream films are notorious for their horror movie clichés, and in many ways making a mockery of the very genre the films themselves fall into. The Scream films were probably one of the first in a long time to normalise a killer, and make them seem truly normal – essentially just an everyday person donning a black cape and a plastic mask.Unfortunately, and as perhaps expected, Scream 2 and 3 lost their way slightly upon their individual release. Whilst Scream 2 was still enjoyable, it nowhere near lived up to its predecessor, and Scream 3 was quite frankly a disaster comparatively speaking. That is not to say that Scream 3 was an awful movie, but in comparison to the original Scream it simply did not live up to the reputation that preceded it.Thankfully, and after an eleven year absence, Scream 4 most definitely does not lose it's way. Thankfully all of the principal original cast members agreed to take on the roles of the much loved characters from the franchise, all the favourites return in a modern day setting. Wes Craven directs his fourth movie of the franchise, and we can proudly welcome back Kevin Williamson who was shunned as a writer from Scream 3.Joining the original cast are a host of new characters, teenagers around the age of the main cast members in the original film. This provides an essential and effective link back to the original movie, whilst remaining as suttle as possible. The other obvious link to the original Scream film is the setting, Scream 4 is the first movie in the franchise to revisit the fictional town of Woodsboro. In this reviewers opinion this was a clever and sensible move by the film makers. After all we have seen two pretty average sequels set outside of the fictional town – proof that trying to move the franchise away from it's roots too much was not really working.Going back to the new characters, their performances are pulled off to perfection and they fill the boots set before them well. Jill Roberts, played by Emma Roberts in the movie, provides the link back to Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and such this allows for easy interaction between the two sets of cast members. Emma Roberts in particular continues to be revelation as young actress and really exceeds herself in Scream 4. One must foresee great things for this young actress, whom incidentally is the niece of Julia Roberts. My only criticism at this stage comes for Hayden Panettiere who plays newcomer Kirby Reed in the film. I felt as though I could not connect with this character and also felt the performance was slightly wooden. I am a huge fan of Hayden's, particularly impressed by her recent role as the lead in Amanda Knox: Murder on Trial in Italy, and so was slightly disappointed.For gore fans, there is plenty of it still in Scream 4 and as expected the killings continue to get more inventive. Do not be put off by the 15 certificate given to the film by the BBFC, it would appear they have just come more lenient when awarding certificates than in the past. Again sticking to the premise of the original, there are plenty of twists, turns and shocks along the way, just as you think you have figured out who the killer is you have changed your mind along the way. I don't want to give too much away with this review, but let me assure you, you will not be able to figure out who is behind the ghostface mask before the end of the film. Speaking of the end of the film, I felt this was fairly and unnecessarily drawn up, the film would have been better to end ten minutes earlier – it would have been slightly more effective.Scream 4 breaths life back into a franchise, and perhaps genre, that many believed to be dead and buried. There are a few criticisms to be made, particularly surrounding the end of the film, but nevertheless this is the best Scream film since the original. The movie will keep die-hard Scream fans busy, and will also bring a whole new audience to the Scream franchise. Bring on Scream 5.Visit my blog at StevieNight.com for more of my reviews.",Scream 4
356,canadianb_tch,Unique Kill scenes.,5,3 June 2011,"Not bad but I noticed a few things ,as other people have previously mentioned , that where not carried over from the previous scream movies. Also as you get into the movie you start seeing plot holes, more as you go along through the story. I think they needed to spend more time on the script. Also combining data from previous Scream movies might of made this a pretty solid movie. Alas the movie was rushed through production and now we have a sloppy story to follow. They definitely tried to make it more unique of slasher movie; with more gore, a ""twist"" and a few unique death scenes. All in all it's a regular slasher movie with a poor, rushed script. 5 out of 10",Scream 4
357,nathan-atkinson-46-523438,"Average movie, average actors, not worth the $15 admission fee.",5,5 May 2011,"Scream 4 is another hack and slash movie based on the previous movies that happened 10 years earlier; with a killer copying Ghostface's murders. The killer wants to improve on the murders that happened 10 years ago and like the previous movies base it on the books that author Gail Weathers wrote.Scream 4 in my opinion isn't worth the admission fee. I found myself dozing off during the movie and only awoke in the last 20 minutes when the movie actually became good. The ending was OK; I didn't guess it, but was a bit far fetched. Was going to rate this movie a 3 until the ending which pushed it up to a 5. In my opinion; wait for a DVD release.",Scream 4
358,lestedu29800,One of the best horror sequels ever made.,9,23 August 2012,"With this fourth installment, Wes Craven proves how incredible the Scream saga is. The Screams are all worth-seeing movies, even though the third one is a bit disappointing, and Scream 4 has everything to satisfy both fans and newcomers ! It is simply one of the best horror sequels ever made in my opinion, 2 hours of pure awesomeness. Thanks to its solid and clever script, the movie leads us into a cynical and suspenseful voyage that tries to show that in horror franchises, the original is always better than the remake. After seeing this sequel, I couldn't disagree more : if we consider Scream 4 as some kind of a remake, it is in every bit as savvy as the original.",Scream 4

360,JamesCanz,"Better than Scream 3, but that's not saying a lot",6,16 April 2011,"Being a huge fan of the Scream series, I came into Scream 4 with very high expectations, but was that my mistake, or did Scream 4 just not produce? In this review I will be talking about everything from the deaths to the reveal of the killer(s) so reader beware, the following review contains major spoilers.The introduction was a creative new way to start off Scream 4. It was something I had never seen before and in a way, there were ""three introductions."" Before I saw this movie I read many spoiler-free reviews about how funny yet gruesome the beginning was. Unfortunately I had to disagree. The first ""two introductions"" were actually scenes being played from watching two different Stab movies. These two scenes set a tone for the rest of the movie. It also had me wondering if this entire movie was just going to be based on making fun of itself and other movies. I had a hard time giving credit to the real introduction because I just couldn't take it seriously. Nothing great happens, the killer gets to his victims, and right before he can finally stab the last victim, the Scream 4 title appears (Just like the Cotton scene in Scream 3). What I was most disappointed about in the introduction was that many scenes that were showed in the trailer were cut from the movie. Marnie was never attacked, chased, or forced to watch the killer perform his kills, as shown in various trailers and TV spots. This might not seem like a very big deal, but this clips portrayed the killer as a different type of killer compared to the other films. It was more disturbing and sadistic, giving you a chance to actually feel bad for the victims. So after the beginning, Scream 4 was off to a unacceptable start.With a big cast in Scream 4, there was almost guaranteed to be a bigger body count. The amount of deaths in this movie should be big enough to satisfy the average horror fan. To go hand in the hand with the high body count was the numerous gallons of blood used to highlight the killer's vengeance towards the victims. The movie could have done without a couple of characters such as the two deputies. They both die in the same scene, and the death of Deputy Perkins was one of the most idiotic deaths I have ever seen on film. He gets stabbed in the forehead then proceeds to get out of his car, stand up, make an idiotic statement about Bruce Willis, then finally fall forward to his death. There was no way Scream 4 could have redeemed itself after this scene. I don't think anyone cared for the fact the two deputies were killed, and the movie went way too far by trying to make their murder scene into a big joke. Setting that horrendous scene aside, the other killings in the movie weren't anything new. Lots of stabbings, a couple shootings, and of course the ""hilarious"" self mutilation at the end of the film. The death of Olivia in the movie was by far the most graphic, but besides that, there wasn't anything else no one hasn't seen before in the previous movies.Scream 4 was lacking a focus on the main characters that made the original such an astonishing movie. Sidney, Dewey, Gale, and of course ghostface. There was plenty of Sidney in the movie and in fact, she played her role very well. On the other hand, Dewey and Gale saw very limited screen time which was a big blow to the movie. Without those two stars shining in the spotlight, the film had to focus on many newcomers to take over and judging by their performances, they didn't do so well. Ghostface wasn't as intimidating as he usually was in the previous Scream movies. You always knew when he/she was going to strike, and even when they revealed the first killer, it was way too obvious.The grand finale of this movie came out of no where. Scream 4 never prepared you for the twists they were going to throw at you. Even before they introduced Charlie as the killer, I had already figured it out. Right before the first revealing, it was obvious that Charlie was the killer because ghostface never spares anyone's life. Instead of ghostface killing Charlie, he tied him up to a chair (just like Steve in Scream) and asks Kirby a series of questions to Kirby. By Kirby answering the second question ""correctly"" she runs outside to untie Charlie. This is where Charlie pulls a knife out and kills Kirby. Charlie then meets up to find Sidney where she fleas from him only to be stabbed by the other killer. Without any further ado, the mask is taken off to reveal Jill (Sidney's cousin) as the other killer. I was actually caught way off guard by this. For once in the movie I was impressed but with the poor execution and follow through, the finale caused the film to finish with anything but a bang. In fact, the finale dragged on so long that I was hoping for another twist to happen. The fact that Sidney, Dewey, and Gale survived means that there could be a Scream 5...Overall Scream 4 is definitely a movie you will love or hate. Although there was much to be fixed in the movie, it was enjoyable to watch. I recommend any Scream or horror fan to check it out. Don't get your hopes up like I did, and pray that this is where the series ends.",Scream 4
361,Rjdogboy18,Classical Scream gets mixed with a fresh taste of technology,10,16 April 2011,"As a huge Wes Craven fan, I loved The Nightmare on Elm Street series. I however, was born in 1989 so it was really Scream that I grew up with. The Scream series is a marvelous series. These movies are kind of slasher and somewhat horror but by no means are they scary. I do not believe that they were ever really intended to be scary. Scream 1, 2 & 3 are psychological thrill rides that give the viewer the feeling of being in a murder mystery. Somwtimes the killer is obvious but somehow it always pulled through to be interesting.Scream 4 is a masterpiece by the master of horror. Scream 4 has your three amigos, Dewey (Now the Sheriff), his wife Gail and Ghostface's favorite victim Sideny. Wes Craven clearly wanted to bring a modern taste to Scream and he did but he also stuck true to Scream. As always in Scream and in most Wes Craven films, this was a pure feminist film. Strong character like Sid and Gail always seem to kick ass and this no no exception. There were many red herrings in the film to take you all over the place as to who was behind the mask and it did not fail to be quite a delight. I read that a lot of critics were giving this film bad reviews for it humor, for poking fun at horror & slasher films and this confused me. HELLO! :) All Scream movies did this, its what makes these movies fun, Wes used Scream to poke fun at himself and at other horror directors/writers. If you are going to be critical of this, then have you ever watched Scream 1, 2 and 3. I can't wait for 5 & 6 as long as they are as good as Scream 4.",Scream 4
362,polarcola,"""The first rule of remakes: don't f*** with the original""",8,13 April 2011,"I literally just came back from a midnight screening of this and I had an amazing time. Craven's managed to reclaim the franchise with a worthy instalment that's a fantastic sequel as well as a quality slasher film in its own right. Honestly speaking, there aren't too many surprises to be had in Scream 4. No matter how mordantly self-aware the movies are (and believe me, Scream 4 gets a little tediously indulgent in its postmodern cleverness), there's an inevitable predictability to some of the proceedings but anybody who's a genre-savvy horror fan will appreciate how brilliantly everything is executed. The opening sequences, for example, are one of the best parts of the movie and are a perfect reintroduction to the franchise and while the bulk of the story lags a little, it's redeemed by the ballsy ending.The acting is great with the core trio (Campbell, Arquette and Cox) delivering their usual, strong performances and the rest of the cast, however limited their respective roles, are just as entertaining. All you TV buffs there will get a kick out of seeing actors from Heroes, Veronica Mars, True Blood, Mad Men and Community share the silver screen and camp it up. More importantly, the film is hilarious and just a whole lot of ridiculous fun. Craven isn't afraid to take the story to some beautifully insane places and the ending was, to me, perfect. All in all, it's a great, irreverent slice of horror that's hilarious and true to the franchise. Highly recommended.",Scream 4

365,cool_man-5,A Worthy Reboot..... And Hopefully A Taste of More To Come!,8,16 April 2011,"Let's just get this out in the open. I loved Scream 4. I am a huge fan of the original trilogy, and when I heard that they were making the fourth, I had mixed emotions. I jumped for joy because I get to see my favourite characters again (Neve and Courtney! David is meh.) but I was worried that they may ruin the series like they almost did with Scream 3. With that, let me mention my scores for the previous movies. Scream - 10/10. The best. Everything was original. Clever, humorous, and scary.Scream 2 - 7/10. A worthy sequel. It was really long, which I found that took away from the story. Also, I didn't find it as scary.Scream 3 - 4/10. Just couldn't get into it. This just proves how valuable Kevin Williamson is.After seeing Scream 4, I was glad that it met my expectations, but that doesn't mean that it didn't have its share of flaws. Anywho, here is a break down of the good and bad.*****MASSIVE SPOILERS*****GOOD:-Plot: On par with the original. I guess that goes hand in hand with spoofing of the remakes. -Opening: I did NOT see that coming. The first ""spoof"" was a little more obvious than the second, but I really enjoyed it as a whole.-Ending: It was quite long, but I think I enjoyed it more than any of the other 3. I liked how it went from Kirby's house to the hospital, and, in the end, Jill got what was coming to her.-Original 3: None of them died!! YES! I was nervous throughout the whole movie that one of them was going to die! Thank GOD! -New Characters: Some of the characters, like Robbie and Kirby, were some of my favourites. I love Hayden, I think she always does well, and whoever played Robbie was super cute. When he said he was gay, my heart leapt up. lol, even though he is just a character. -Twist: I did not expect Jill or Charlie to be the killers. In the most recent horror movies, I could always guess who the killer was, so I was happy that it tricked me.BAD:-Pacing: I felt that the movie was sprinting the whole time. It was too short, compared to Scream 2, which was too long. -Not enough Gale: I know it was because she was filming Cougar Town at the same time as well, but she was like Sidney in Scream 3. Not there enough. -New Characters: Some of them were awesome, while some of them sucked. I didn't like Charlie, sorry Rory! Anthony Anderson and Adam Brody just felt like last minute additions, and the two girls/publicist were just horrible.So, in the end, I really enjoyed this movie, and I think you will too. I am SO ready for Scream 5!!!!",Scream 4
366,basketball_star758,scream again,8,24 April 2011,"I was really excited to see this movie- I was a huge fan of the first three- i enjoyed the characters- back story and plot. Much like its predecessors the movie followed the regular format and had some predictability to what was going to happen. The cast provided their audience with an amazing performance- and it was great to see Sydney Prescott back in action. The movie came with the regular horror movie character stupidity, you know- when the screaming girl goes running up the stairs instead of outside or when the guy says ""i will be right back"" - which is where the fun is- in the knowing that something is going to happen.For those who don't like blood: This movie has a little more gore than the last three movies but it is done in a typical wes craven fashion.I think a very important thing to remember when watching this movie is the mock humor that it is purposely trying to get across to the audience. Wes Craven is purposely digging at his past movies and this 4th instalment is meant to be fun- while still managing to make you jump. Don't take it too seriously.The movie hit the underlying issues of teens loosing touch with reality and the digital world.",Scream 4
367,Lights_Camera_Reaction,Enjoyable and keeps you entertained throughout with enough gory kills and humour.,7,21 April 2011,"Fiveteen years ago, Wes Craven directed the film that changed slasher horror films all together, and it instantly became a classic. In 1997, we found out that sequels can actually work, and Scream 2 worked fantastically well. Unfortunately the threequal proved to be rather weak and ended the Scream series all together, or so we thought.Having survived three films with barely any scratches. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) returns to Woodsboro to promote her bestseller book only to find her hometown being terrorised again by the famous Ghostface. When Scream 4 was announced, horror fans were probably jumping up and down in delight. The fourth film brings back its three main characters. Sidney (Neve Campbell) who we notice is a more tougher character than the previous films. Gale (Courtney Cox) who once again doesn't disappoint and delivers humorous one liners, even though she looks like she should cut down on the botox. Dewey (David Arquette) who we also see as more of a stronger character, but is still his likable self. But in this new generation also brings some new fresh faces (Emma Roberts, Hayden Panettiere) who instead of deciding what's hot and what's not, have to deal with numerous bloody murders. The film's opening has a different take from the previous Scream's, although it doesn't come close to the perfection of the first film's opening. Fortunately, the opening makes itself stand out with plenty of humour and scares with celebrity cameos (Shanae Grimes, Lucy Hale, Anna Paquin, Kristen Bell, ???, ???).The film has a good balance between the scares and the humour, but we see it falling into self parody, which was the main problem in Scream 3. Apart from a gruesome scene where two characters watch another get brutally savaged from an opposite window, and a suspenseful car parking lot scene, the film is rarely horrifying. Fans will also be pleased that the film has many references to the first film, a noticeable one involves Hayden Panettiere's horror loving character Kirby in a live or die movie quiz situation. When comparing the film to other slasher horrors, Scream 4 does a good job showing them how its supposed to be done. But when comparing it to the previous Scream films, well, at least it was a huge improvement on the third installment.What we can always count on with the Scream films is that they never disappoint in the twists, and we find one which highlights in the third act. In conclusion, hardcore fans MAY find themselves disappointed, but the film is throughally enjoyable and keeps you entertained throughout with enough gory kills and humour.",Scream 4
368,sdogcds,Same sh$$t,3,20 October 2021,Same sh$$t it is like 1 and 2 but worst scream 1 2 and 3 are great films but scream 4 is like the same thing as 1 and 2 like why I really like scream 3 because it did something new in a good way but scream 4 end up being a cash grab because it like did not really did anything at all it was too much like scream 1 and 2 not good only washed it if you want to watch the whole screen movies.,Scream 4
369,boydigital,"roaring good fun, but hollow in the head",6,15 April 2011,"Scream 4 is like a reverse Oreo cookie: the beginning and the end are decently good but the middle is just there because it isn't a proper sandwich without it.The good idea that is the first Scream film has been brought out and dusted off again for the fourth installment. It's a bit like a great joke that has been told a few too many times; you're enamored by it the first time you hear it but it's hard, if not impossible, to feel the same way about the same joke again. And after a while, the joke becomes a nuisance. You already know the punch line. The cutting-edge newness just isn't applicable any longer. The film that broke the formulaic mold of what a slasher film should entail now has its own formula. You know what to expect; and in a suspense film that's not a good thing.There's a certain amount of nostalgia attached to a sequel of a great film. The fuel in the tank of Scream 4 is mainly the sentimentality that fans and viewers will bring from their past experiences with the series. (I effectively grew up on it.) That, mixed with the occasional witty lines and pleasantly gruesome death scenes, helps make number 4 a fairly enjoyable piece of entertainment. But unlike its series-opening predecessor, this film brings little to the table in terms of intrigue or surprise (most of that happens during the first 10 minutes, after which we settle into a formula as tried and true as Baking Soda). As a result, Scream 4 is only ever occasionally engaging and seldom ever innovative. Yet, to its credit, it manages to keep one's superficial consciousness at play, if not one's intellect. It's like watching Bette Davis in a not-so-good Bette Davis film: she brings a lot of presence and baggage to the film that transcends its poorness. Scream 4's great ""joke"" (it's core idea) and its bloody good killings hold our interest despite the film not being all that swell.What is most lacking here is an emotional connection between the characters and the audience. This, of course, is asking too much of a film in this genre, which makes it difficult to judge among most other films which often do nothing if not strive for such a connection. In fact, the viewer will be hard pressed to care much at all about the many victims here; most of them are relatively unpleasant characters to begin with, so any sympathy we might have formed for them during their short (life) spans on screen are in no danger of being developed. Still, the beauty of a slasher film is that it sustains itself not on emotional connections per se, but with action, suspense, and gore -- truly junk-food elements in lieu of a healthier main-course of something lasting and cerebral. Scream 4 fits these shallow requirements well.The sheer number of deaths in this film -- if one can effectively complain about such things -- is abundant. The abundant loss of life makes the loss of life seem somewhat plodding and oddly non-climactic in too many cases. After the first 6 or 7 stabbing deaths, stabbing deaths begin to resemble the nonchalant innocuousness of carving up a pumpkin. The adrenalin ceases to pump quite so heavily and the suspense that usually accompanies watching a gruesome murder is traded for a duller sense of deja vu.They're not actual humans being killed after all, they're characters in a film, which the film continually reminds us of with its ubiquitous self-referential dialogue. The characters never actually look into the camera and speak directly to us, but the dialogue does. This ""meta""-language is the same territory that the original Scream forged 15 years ago. In the sequels, this self-awareness has increasingly been used as a pass to create the kind of film that it would critique: a silly slasher flick with dim-witted characters that meet their demise in bloody and (sometimes) enthralling ways.Still, there is the opening sequence and the pleasantly demented ending that uplifts the sag in the center. The twists and turns are familiar but not altogether too stale for consumption. There's a fleeting psychological heft to the climax of this film that almost elevates it to a radical new place, but it ultimately degenerates (almost satisfyingly so) into an eye-rolling ending that, too, feels familiar, does nothing to push it past its own formula, but works somehow.Good performances throughout also set this film apart from innumerable other genre flicks that have been produced in recent memory. The core cast of familiar faces are rather like a warm blanket (albeit one soaked in blood). That sense of nostalgia is potent when one sees Sidney, Dewey, and Gale back at it again and in near-top form. Not bad. Not great. Mainly just okay -- and for a film cut from the cloth of the horror genre, that's quite good.",Scream 4
370,bloodeyes,Welcome back Ghostface!!!!,9,6 June 2011,"I'm a fan of the Scream films and I was really excited to see this (What Scream fan wasn't) and it was worth the wait! I went to see this with a mate and we liked almost every minute of it. It was good to see the original cast again and they haven't lost their touch to the franchise. Wes Craven hasn't lost it either, he on top of his game like he was in the previous films. The new cast members are great as well! Kevin Williamson's script is nearly as clever as the first. There are however some weak points and it seems a bit rushed half-way through, but we might have Ehren Kruger's rewrites to thank for that.Some critics have criticised it for using the old fashion slasher genre, but to be fair it's what makes it far better then most of the crap remakes I've seen. So I think it's a good thing.Overall the best Scream since the original! Not as great, but it beats the living daylights out of the third. Can't wait for it to come out on Blu-ray!! Don't Mess with the original!! :)",Scream 4

It could have gone either way with the forth one, even though I had high expectations. But I am really glad to announce that the forth one was really good! Of course not as good as the original, but it easily kicks 2 and 3's butts! It stayed true to the concept and feel of the first movies, and you still jump in your seat when ghostface shows up, even when you know it's coming. Two things though, 1. Sidney had a surprisingly small role, and 2. why has the woman not yet super-glued a gun to her hand?? But I guess that would take the fun out of it, so I'll let that one pass. It was fun to see the three from the original cast, in addition to the young new actors. Scream 4 delivers what it promises – new decade, new rules! I wish it were a little longer with more dept to the characters, but since it's action- packed from the very beginning, I'm not at all disappointed. Also, I thought the beginning was really fun. If you are a die hard scream fan like me, this is a must-see movie of 2011, but I think others will enjoy it also.",Scream 4
374,Kiiskinen-Osku,Rule #1 of sequels: Two is enough,4,19 April 2011,"This review is spoiler free, for the smart folk out there (keep reading and you'll understand).7.6? Really? I mean REALLY? I'm a fan of Seagal movies, and brainless action flicks in general. I also don't see movies as art per se. Which means a movie like Scream should be perfect for me, yes? No.The only way to describe Scream 4, or Scre4m (really? Substituting letters with numbers? I thought we were past that) was WAY too predictable. And in the wrong way.When you watch Seagal movies you KNOW Seagal is going to win in the end, but it doesn't spoil the fun because it's not about that. This movie was supposed to be clever (I think), but instead it was just painful to watch. The ""I'm in the closet"" -bit being the most painful of all examples.Every plot 'twist', every jump scare, every victim.. Everything could be seen from miles away. Except the perpetrator, but that surprise too was for the wrong reasons. They gave us a ton of potential suspects, made them all look guilty, and then, out of nowhere, just gave the real suspect to us when the movie was about to end. They built the suspension up, but then it all came crashing down in the end when it was just a 'clever' fake to direct our attention to elsewhere, when the real stuff was happening away from the cameras.Which was clever I guess, but not exactly fair for the viewer. And not exactly entertaining either. I think the only real emotion the movie got out of me was horror when a guy was shot in the man jewels. You just don't show that kind of stuff in movies, Jesus.If you're a fan of brainless action flicks you can do much better. If you're a fan of 'proper' movies you can do MUCH better. If you're a fan of Scream movies you can do much better. If you're just looking to kill an evening you can do much better. Much worse too of course, but that shouldn't be the only reason to watch a movie.Mediocre at best.",Scream 4

Gostface killer, was awesome, as always, but the most times, so predictable.. It would be an awesome movie, if I could just change a little thing the ending, but it really worths a look.

I was only keeping the original scream in my thoughts as a great slasher flick and thats how i felt for a while. When i heard that scream 4 was coming out, naturally my expectations were sceptical to say the least. I had never been so glad to be wrong, this film is such a breath of fresh air into the modern day horror flicks. Its like scream 1 on steroids, on average a person dies about every 5 minutes, and you can tell their is some creation put into some of these kills too. There are more twists than a hurricane, and a good balance of the old cast mixed in with the new generation. The new actors they picked do a great job in helping this reboot/sequel work.As i'm sure many of you are aware that the opening scene has received a lot of positive hype, and i am another person to back this up, because it is rare to see a perfect combination of horror mixed with comedy crammed into such a short time frame. Throughout the rest of the film this element is quite similar, with a toned down version through most of the film and then a very entertaining ending.The final act is the cherry on top, extremely entertaining with hilarious references from the original and decent twists of them, which also is fairly consistent throughout the whole film. I'm not writing about plot or story because i don't want to give anything away, but you can expect a fairly decent plot. This is of course overshadowed by the entertainment factor. Certainly the best horror flick i have seen in a while. The only thing that stops it getting a 10 is the story, which i forgive them for because you can tell the focus was on entertainment factor. Good job guys, 9/10",Scream 4
377,awall008,Very enjoyable,7,17 April 2011,"Wes Craven's latest trip to Woodsboro is another fun one. Genuine scares and (mostly) clever dialogue prevent Scre4m from being a typical third sequel. Almost everyone is good, especially David Arquette as the lovable Dewey. However, Emma Roberts is rather hit and miss as Sidney's niece. The end also drags a bit but hey. It's all good fun if you don't take it too seriously. Just as with the previous three, Scream 4 is packed with horror film references that clearly demonstrate Williamson's love of the genre. Now if he could only write something of quality outside this franchise... The music choices are again rather hip and loud, sometimes bordering on annoying. However, the few gripes I have with this fourth Scream going around are easily ignored. The rest of the movie is just too fun. Disappointing to see how poorly this performed opening weekend; we need more horror films like this.",Scream 4
378,IAmMothership,Welcome return to form,7,7 May 2011,"Ghostface returns for a belated killing spree in Scream 4. But has time been kind to Wes Craven's postmodern Scream franchise?10 years have passed since Ghostface last Sidney and company, and much has changed since. We're now in an age of Facebook, twitter, iPhone's and Blackberries.The Scream reinvented slasher horror in the late 90's, so it's unsurprising that this latter-day entry tackles all these technological and social changes head-on, while simultaneously poking fun at its own patchy lineage.In its opening sequence – which, I found the most fun and surprising since the original movie way back in 1996 – a character mocks the Stab franchise, the fictional film series inspired by the earlier killings in Woodsboro. Now on its sixth sequel, the Stab series is creatively bankrupt, yet constantly revived thanks to the allure of the mighty dollar.By Scream 3, the franchise that made its name by confounding the conventions of its genre appeared to be finally done in by them, and it's that film's descent into bloated self-parody that writer Kevin Williamson is perhaps referencing here, along with the countless other horror series that have suffered a similar fate by their third or fourth sequel (see Saw, Halloween and Wes Craven's own Nightmare On Elm Street, Friday the 13th).It's quite remarkable, then, that given how simplistic the Scream template is once you take away the knowing dialogue and in-references, Williamson has managed to summon up a story worth telling.The basic materials for a typical horror sequel are all here – collection of middle-class teenagers, a quiet suburban backdrop, and a crazed killer in a mask – but Williamson has come up with a belated Scream entry that's almost the equal of the first two. You could almost forget that the third movie was ever made, in fact, do that. As enjoyable as I found Scream 3, it would be better served if it was Stab 3 as it had none of the wit and ingenuity of the first 2. . Eleven years older but looking broadly the same, series heroine Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is now a best-selling self-help author, and is back in her home town to promote her latest book, Out Of Darkness; a story of putting the past behind her. But before she can even sign her first autograph, a series of bloody murders begin to take place, with Sidney apparently the ultimate target.Sheriff Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and ex-journalist wife Gale (Courteney Cox) are also back to catch the killer, but the main focus of Scream 4 is its cast of high-school students, among them Sidney's cousin and the face behind the mask Jill (Emma Roberts), her friend Kirby (Hayden Panettiere), and a couple of horror movie geeks, Robbie and Charlie – the 2nd killer and ultimately the final victim (Erik Knudsen and Rory Culkin respectively).Wes Craven has opted to up the gore in comparison to the previous instalments in the series. While it's hardly Hostel, this is by far the bloodiest Scream movie yet. There are a couple of quite startling killings and one of particularly bloody death appears to have been trimmed to gain a 15 certificate.For me, though, the Scream movies' killings always took second place to whodunit mystery, and it's this aspect of Scream 4 that I found most enjoyable. As I was mentally being Poirot or Holmes, I repeatedly accused the wrong people and not once accused the guilty party.And even if you do guess the ending before the characters in the movie, there's some great dialogue - ""Your lemon squares taste like ass"", and great last lines – ""Clear"", the usual collection of horror movie references to enjoy.It's great to see that, while much has changed since the last series instalment in the late-90s, one of the smartest slasher franchises is still as sharp as ever.Scream 4 isn't perfect, by any means, but it's well written, well directed, and has a conclusion that somehow manages to remain true to the spirit of the franchise, tap into contemporary obsessions with fame and celebrity, confound expectations (mine at least), and thumb its nose playfully at the modern conventions of remakes and reboots all at the same time.No mean feat for a franchise that should have long since run out of ideas. Better than the third and on par with the 2nd, this is a worthy conclusion (please let it be a conclusion) to the franchise that re-invented a dying genre.",Scream 4

The mix of characters is interesting as it features new, modern characters as well as the familiar 3, David Arquette, Courtney Cox and Neve Campbell.I felt that the character reactions to horrific situations were unrealistic as they reacted almost normally.The blood and gore were the highpoint for the film as more detail and thought went into the murders.It was definitely an improvement to the previous 2 Scream movies, and the blood and gore are improvements.",Scream 4

Furthermore, it felt very much like a 90's nostalgia film. Many moments made me think of this as the closest sequel to the original. Moreover, this film also does a great job at keeping you guessing, and by the end you won't know what hit you. The whole film was like a maze cleverly written by Kevin Williamson. Craven has definitely delivered his best film in years. Both of them should be very proud of themselves! It also had an amazing message to Hollywood to stop this foolish remaking trend!I'm not going to give away anything, but I will just say go see this film because it is definitely a worthy addition to the franchise!",Scream 4

The movie-within-a-movie opening is sure to get a few chuckles, but after that smooth start it doesn't pan out.I enjoyed the first two Scream movies, but I was disturbed by just how brutal the killings have gotten this time. Or perhaps gratuitous violence and unprovoked hatred just doesn't seem like as much fun in these times when campus shootings are a reality.Like the previous films, the identity of the killer is meant to be the big payoff in 'Scream 4'.

384,jleonard31,"The best Scream since the first, which is more impressive than it may seem.",8,15 April 2011,"In December of 1996, a smart and edgy slasher flick called Scream was introduced to the world. Panned by critics and opening with a measly $6 million at the box office, word of mouth quickly spread from the few who did see it. Flash forward 4 years, Scream had gone on to generate over $100 million in box office receipts by itself and spawned a cult phenomenon that led to two sequels, the fun yet underrated Scream 2 (1997) and the lackluster, adequately low rated Scream 3 (2000). Now, flash forward to present day, 11 years since the most recent and disappointing entry in the franchise, Wes Craven (director) and Kevin Williamson (writer) have teamed up once again with Dimension Films to bring audiences Scream 4. And they nailed it.Scream 4 revolves around the return of franchise heroin Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) to her hometown, and original murder scene, of Woodsboro, California as the last stop on her book tour promoting her memoirs. The only other two survivors from all three series of murders also reside in Woodsboro, the now sheriff Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and his now wife, former hot shot reporter turned author with writer's-block Gale Weathers-Riley (Courtney Cox). The citizens of the macabre city of Woodsboro seem to revel in the notoriety the town has gained from it's grizzly history, decorating light poles with Ghostface masks and holding an underground film festival showing all seven Stab films, the movies within the movie that originally were inspired by the events of Sydney Prescott's life. Oh, by the way, Sydney just happens to be returning on the anniversary of those original murders. It is almost as if she is begging for the inevitable to happen. And happen it does.Upon Sydney's arrival, a new Ghostface makes his presence known as well. And a whole new cycle of terrorized teenagers emerge. Sydney is staying in town with her aunt Kate and cousin Jill (Mary McDonnell and Emma Roberts), and Jill's familial relationship with Sydney automatically makes her a target for the new killer. This of course also means that none of Jill's friends are safe from the new Ghostface.A lot of the strength of Scream 4 comes from the parallels it runs with the original. It is really a return to the roots of the franchise. The familiar setting mixed with all the teen angst and fresh takes on the movie's own genre and where the ""rules"" have gone over the last decade are all very refreshing. There are film geeks from Woodsboro High more than willing to help figure out the new killer's pattern based on current trends in horror movies. They are no Randy substitute by any means, but they get the job done. Cousin Jill even has a shady boyfriend who always happens to be in the right place at the wrong time, very reminiscent of Billy Loomis from the original Scream. This movie really manages to pay homage to itself while still keeping its own identity. It goes back all the way to square one, but it recognizes and acknowledges this fact without just trying to copy itself. In short, it is lots and lots of fun to reminisce about the past and still not know who or what is going to jump around the next corner.The violence in Scream 4 is just the right style for this type of movie. The body count seems up from the more recent installments, and the amount of blood used may set a franchise record. But this is not the ""torture porn"" that audiences have grown accustomed to. There are certainly some grizzly images in the movie, but the thrill of the chase and the kill itself seem to motivate Ghostface a lot more than finding inventive ways to separate body parts. There are lots of scares in Scream movies, but they've never been about the gore, and the fourth installment stays true to that style.Fans of the franchise should rejoice. Hearing that a fourth movie was coming 11 years after the disappointing third installment was as frightening as it was exciting. But the cast and crew really seem to have a firm understanding on why the first Scream worked so well and why the third Scream didn't. And they use that knowledge to craft a fun, scary, exciting, bloodbath of a homecoming for the franchise. No sequel could ever surpass the original in a franchise like this, it is simply impossible to recreate that freshness especially when carrying around so much built-in hype. But Scream 4 comes as close to recreating it as one can reasonably hope for. And it provides a lot of fun while doing so.Jonathan Leonard www.popculturenetwork.com",Scream 4
385,cuyescalona,The unexpected is the new cliché... so don't expect too much.,6,17 April 2011,"This review contains spoilers, like the identity of the killer.I have read a lot of positive things about this movie but I maintain skeptic about them. A ten year waiting for a Scream movie, with the original cast, and with new rules seemed promising. The results were... Average. This is not a bad movie. The ending is surprisingly good, but the movie has lots of ridiculous, moments. Like a cliché review I will say ""It is better than than Scream 3"" but that doesn't mean ""good"". A good movie is not just because of the ending, we are not watching a low budget movie like Sleepaway Camp!!!First the opening sequence: The beginning of Stab 6 with Shenae and Lucy was yet funny and scary, then we get the twist that it was a scene inside Stab 7 and we see Anna and Kristen; a crazy and even more funny scene. Then we get to the ""real world"" with Aimee and Brittany. Starts pretty good with them talking about the Stab sequels and then they receive a call from the killer. Things start to get into tension. Then it comes when they die very disappointing. We don't get to see ""any mouse and cat chasing"" or any gore.The death scenes: The scene where Olivia dies, with Jill and Kirby watching from the house at front, is great and gory. So now you get the feel that this movie will be good wrong!!! The death scene of Sidney's assistant, is absurd and not even gory. She just gets stabbed one time and then thrown from the building (like Sarah Michelle Gellar in Scream 2). Then 2 cops die (Adam Brody and Anthony Anderson). Adam gets quickly stabbed and then Anthony gets stabbed in the head. That scene was gory, good but then he says that line about Bruce Willis that really ruined the scene!!! Kirby's death was OK, with the ""dejà vu Drew Barrymore scene"". The other killings are not that relevant. The positive thing is that we have the highest and goriest body count in a Scream movie.Then we have the original cast. Neve Campbell had a lot of screening time and her character seemed more strong and mature. Courtney Cox and David Arquette don't have many good scenes in the movie, but they manage to do a good job.Then the ending, revealing the 2 killers. Rory Culkin, as a mix of Stu and Randy from the original Scream, and Emma Roberts, (Jill, Sidney's cousin). I didn't see it coming, it was a good twist in a reference of nowadays horror movies (such as Saw 2 movie –spoiler- with the character of Amanda) I didn't really liked Emma Roberts, but she really surprised me in this movie. Her last scenes, going all crazy were great. She is beautiful and a great actress. And the motives of her character where disturbing and insane, really cool for a horror movie of these days. That last scenes with her and then the reporters calling her the ""new heroine"", making you guess what will they say later, made me feel that I was really watching a good Scream movie. Sadly it was only for the last minutes of the movie. There were only some absurd moments with Emma's scenes at the end, when she was throwing herself to the painting and to the glass table so that she could ""look hurt by the killers""; I remember that when I was at the theater all the people laughed a lot. For a moment I thought I was watching Scary Movie with Anna Farris!!!It seems that the new rule of the horror movies is that there are not rules, just expect the unexpected. Now anyone can die and anything can happen. So maybe you should watch this movie with that point of view, not expecting anything.This movie is not bad. It will not change your life. If you liked previews Scream movies you will like it, it but don't expect ""the reboot of the franchise you were waiting for"". It has it moments, but it has lots of problems with some killing scenes and really absurd moments and dialogues that make the movie lose it strength.",Scream 4
386,fionainns,Just another Scream movie,5,29 April 2011,"After reports that this harked back to the original Scream movie I think I was expecting more from this than just another slasher flick. For me it was too many deaths and gore, having said that it did keep me guessing until the end 'whodunnit' and as usual the Arquettes were on top form, along with Neve Campbell and the younger supporting cast. In places it was funny and a couple made me jump but parts were over the top and drawn out - about 20 minutes longer than it needed to be in the middle. If you love the Scream films then no doubt this will float your boat and it passes a couple of hours but if you're looking for something more sophisticated than your basic slasher flick updated for 2011 then you might be disappointed.",Scream 4
387,arzakem,Left me Wes-Craving,8,28 October 2011,"The Slasher Genre of movies is all the while getting boring and sadly predictable and linear. Mindful of these, Wes has taken his lessons in time as he is a Hitchcock of screenplays. Satirically detailing the history of slasher movies with an intro of several scenes showing intros of every Stab movie, he successfully has shown you a glimpse of what ""you are never gonna expect"" from this newest Scre4m movie. At least he successfully did revolved the theme around Sydney's winner line ""don't f*** with the original!"" and this movie is indeed a first in the Slashbox genre of the MTV era.The movie had in itself a dozen of characters to bring about comedy, spoofs, spooks, drama, hatred to the audience who like me, find myself at times sparing the suspense and wondering whether this and that character gets to survive. But I love mainstay characters, it's like a TV episode where you get to see almost everyone mainstay survive. You get to know a deeper understanding about each character. Like Dewey and Gale for example, I would really hate a Scre4m movie killing them off in favor of new characters. Sydney precisely stood it with pride. But the movie isn't really meant to be predictable. And that's the best part of Wes' creation. There was no way I found every scene in the movie too linear, although I get to see dumb characters who would prefer to go out of the room or car or any secure area after seeing the killer disappear for almost a while! Only thing I see too loose is that some stabs look not fatal at all. You can still see the knife as if it's just sticking into the clothing and not really slicing like the real thing. Or maybe it would lose the entertainment side if it becomes like a documentary type of realism so then I would not ask for more.",Scream 4

390,sammyrockstar,I was able to walk home in the dark after the movie.,4,17 April 2011,"I voted 4, but really I thought it was a 3.5!It was great to see many of the actors from the other movies back on the big screen. They look just like they did eleven years ago! The movie wasn't deathly dull, or really boring. However, it made me think - how self-referential can a movie get before it starts to look like Frankenstein's Monster - just many parts of other works stapled together, but now looking slightly rotten and green?Nothing felt natural. I could imagine Kevin Williamson et al. sitting round a table thinking 'how can we subvert the audience's expectations next?' ... while suffocating any believability the characters or plot may have had.It tried so hard. Even though it certainly knew about movies and their cliché's, it embraced far too many of them. All of the ladies look like models - I wish it would've had the balls to cast some overweight women.I understood that it's a 'new decade - new rules' - one of those rules would be the further development of social networking etc - but too many of the references to our modern culture felt like gratuitous product placement. Occasionally, when Courtney Cox screamed down the phone, I did not believe there was anyone on the other end of the line. The last thought I had was why did Wes bother?",Scream 4
391,canceled,A new beginning...,10,15 April 2011,"Or is it the beginning of the end? That's what went through my mind when I left the theater opening night. I'd been anticipating the release of ""Scream 4"" since I learned it was going to happen. Courteney Cox, Neve Campbell and David Arquette had all chosen to reprise their respective roles. Wes Craven in the director's seat and original screenwriter Kevin Williamson writing the script? What wasn't there to love? Quick plot run down: Sidney (Neve Campbell) is now the author of a self-help book and has returned to Woodsboro for a book signing on the last date of her book tour. Her arrival in town also gives her the chance to reconnect with her estranged Aunt Kate (Mary McDonnell) and cousin Jill (Emma Roberts). It just so happens that two teenage girls were murdered the night before--the eve of the anniversary of the original Woodsboro Massacre. This, of course, unnerves Sidney as she realizes that after 10 years--since the murders in ""Scream 3""--it's happening AGAIN. So much for a peaceful homecoming.Not much more can be revealed without spoiling the film for those who have yet to see it. What I will say, is if you haven't seen ""Scream,"" ""Scream 2"" or ""Scream 3"" in a long time, you don't have to in order to understand or follow the events of ""Scream 4."" If you want to view all the predecessors before hand, that's fine, but in a way ""Scream 4"" feels like a separate film altogether. The surviving characters from the three previous films have changed: Dewey (David Arquette) has since become the town Sheriff whereas Gale (Courteney Cox) has hung up her microphone and is now an embittered housewife with writer's block.The new cast fits in perfectly. None of them felt like the typical, cliché, cookie-cutter throw-away caricatures that often litter the lineup of a horror film. The standouts, to me, were: Nico Tortorella as Trevor and Hayden Panettiere as Kirby. The ending was a complete surprise. What a twist! I did not see it coming at all. I kept thinking: ""It CANNOT end like this."" Another twist shortly thereafter allowed the film to end on a very high, more satisfying note.Could it be a set up to a fifth or sixth film, possibly making this a new trilogy? I certainly wouldn't mind it. Perhaps in ""Scream 5"" we'll get to meet Sidney's relatives from her father's side of the family. Who knows? All I know is, I'll be there opening night.",Scream 4
392,audiodave_82,On par with the first film,9,23 April 2011,"What made the first Scream film so good was that it picked apart the horror genre and rewrote the rules. The film spawned a whole generation of horror films that set out to be different than those classics. Now 15 years after the first film was released and over 10 years since the last those films are now classics. The sequels were true to the first but none had the same impact as the first.The whole point of Scream 4 is how life and the genre has changed as have our expectations. It starts off by letting you know that they know this, the same way the first film let you know they knew the rules. Scream 4 is not perfect but it far better than Scream 2 and 3 and delivers the same refreshing excitement and cleverness that was in the Original.If you enjoyed the original Scream then you should enjoy this one just as much. I highly recommend seeing it in theatres as this is one of those films that does benefit from watching it with an audience. Will make you scream, laugh and keep guessing till the end.",Scream 4
393,wjc722,Snore 4,4,29 April 2011,"Here's the thing...I really wanted to like Scream 4, honestly, I did. I love horror movies, I loved Scream 1, and I understand the humor behind the franchise. At the end of the day however, I just couldn't get into the movie, and I was utterly disappointed.Scream 4 begins well enough, mocking itself as well as countless other horror movies that dish out the same thing, time and time again... With all the satire and focus on how lame the recycled plot lines have become, I started to think that Scream 4 might mix things up. Maybe this time they'll break away from the re-hashed structure they've used for all the previous films. Maybe, just maybe, things might be different... Sadly, they weren't.Talk is cheap Wes Craven, and I respect that you called yourself out while making this movie (not just other films that have copied you) but that wasn't enough. After calling yourself out you had the chance to reinvent yourself and the franchise. You had the chance to be different, but you weren't. Instead you fell back on literally the same formula you've used over, and over, and over. The same formula you had just so cleverly mocked in the beginning of the film.It's like saying ""here is what horror movies have been doing wrong for the last ten years and this is what has made the horror genre suck."" But the hell with it, we exposed the truth behind these weak story lines and that's good enough. We pointed out all the flaws, let someone else make a better movie. Those rules don't apply to us, because we exposed them.What we're left with is the same movie we've already seen.Scream 4 did have a few surprises, I guess, but for any true fan of horror, you know that new thing is to expect the unexpected. Of course we're supposed to believe the boyfriend and female cop could be the killers, that's what Craven wants us to believe...But Nowadays any time a director attempts to hint towards a killer, we know that person is not going to be the killer. In an attempt to become uncliche, ""unliche"" has become the new cliché. My guess from the beginning, was that either Sidney or her cousin would be a killer. It's the only thing that was unpredictable and in being unpredictable, things have again, become predictable. I'm sure I'm not the only person who feels this way.Looking at the performances, Arquette and Cox play shadows of their former interesting and fun characters. In the first films, these charters were the ones whom truly carried the film and added the comedy aspect that made Scream 1 so good. In Scream 4, Arqutte does nothing but run around town like a chicken with his head cut off, helping the investigation in literally no way whatsoever. But unlike the original, where Arquette's clumsiness was fun and likable, this time he just came off as kind of annoying, which sucked.We're supposed to believe that Cox adds something to the story, but she really doesn't. I might be wrong, but for a character so crucial to the plot, it didn't seem like she really had all that much screen time. Maybe that's just me? As for Campbell, What can I say? She still goes through the entire movie with the same look on her face, like shes constantly getting dust blown into her eyes or something, and there's nothing new here. Cue the corny remake lines: ""rule 1 of remakes, never mess the original!"" or something like that...All in all I am becoming wary of ""reboots."" Reboot has come to mean ""lets do the same thing we did in our first movie"" which is good and all but now it appears as if most reboots, need a reboot.",Scream 4
394,ubu507,Super SCREAM,10,15 April 2011,"O.K., I admit it – I'm a big time Scream fan. When I first heard that Craven, Williamson and company were going to reboot the franchise, I was both excited and apprehensive, but by the time I got up from the midnight screening last night I was merely exhilarated. Scream 4 is fast, funny, furious and, quite simply, kicks ass. Starting off with a bravura opening sequence, the movie never lags, succeeding both as a sharp, ironic commentary on our serial killer besotted society and a brutally clever slasher film. What is often overlooked about the Scream movies by the critics who dismiss them as hackneyed horror with a thin patina of self-consciousness, is that, unlike most of their ilk, they are at the core traditional whodunits, with suspects, clues, red herrings, and, despite the blood and guts, no higher body counts than many Agatha Christie books. But to me what really distinguishes them is, gasp, the character development that most such flicks ignore, the effect of these crimes on Sydney, who has to somehow deal with the fact that she's a bug light for maniacs with knives, or Dewey and Gail who have to manage a relationship forged by horrific crimes, the kind that, as another character says, could only happen in the movies. Although nothing will ever match the unique kick of the first Scream, 4 is the best effort since, and, as such, one of my favorite movies of the year.",Scream 4
395,poki007,No router ? Then how is there wireless Internet?,8,24 April 2011,Awesome film Spoiler and Goof! This should go in the goof section! During the end Kirby tells Sidney the LAN line is down and the router was smashed but if you look at the top of Kirby's Iphone in the basement she is clearly using a wireless internet connection and the signal is at full strength. Overall I thought it was a great film and it really had me guessing. It had enough laughs and scares to keep me entertained. Too bad Craven didn't revamp Freddy. That reboot would of been a hell of a lot better I would highly advise to see this film with no expectations and see it with a fresh outlook and forget the past films. It will make it much more enjoyable.,Scream 4
396,bryc_phillips,Definitely a remarkable addition. One of the best Ghostface kills this far.,8,25 May 2021,"Not a incredibly scary but rather intense & suspenseful ride. As my title stated, one of the best and most realistic Ghostface kills. Neve have some phenomenal scenes that any Scream or even horror fan will appreciate. The recording the murders & technology aspect isn't my cup of tea but I do get the concept as in actual life a psychopath mass shooter streamed his horrendous & cowardly attack on Facebook. The original opening they filmed was scarier imo, Jill's actress never won me over til this performance as she definitely portrayed the selfish sociopath or psychopath well.

It's just a guy with a knife and a phone! Even the worst slasher movies I've seen gave the killer a slight edge to make their killings a little more realistic. Everyone runs away...from a guy with a knife. Even when the hero manages to kick him in the face and he rolls down some stairs (no spoiler; it happens in every movie), everybody runs like it's Satan himself. I have never understood why movie audiences still feed this industry that has not done any effort for them, but exploit cheesy, made in china, rubber masks.",Scream 4
399,dfan46,"Ghostface is back, but will this long awaited sequel make you screamish?",7,24 April 2011,"A lot has been said about whether or not Scream 4 should exist. After all, director Wes Craven always envisioned the series as a trilogy and when the lackluster Scream 3 hit theaters over a decade ago the spark of the series had diminished considerably. Fast forward to 2011, where original ideas in Hollywood are so few and far between that every comic book is being adapted to film or rebooted if it already has been. So while it may be difficult to view Scream 4 as anything more than a cash grab, Craven and writer Kevin Williamson pack enough scares and laughs into the proceedings to make it an enjoyable (if superfluous) romp.So dust off the Ghostface mask you pranked your sister's friend with, prepare to yell, ""B*tch, hang the phone up and Star-69 his a**!"", and enjoy the preview of coming eventsSydney Prescott (the ageless Neve Campbell) has returned to her home town of Woodsboro - the final stop in the book tour for her self-help book. She reunites with old pals Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale (Courtney Cox) but it's not long before a body count begins to form and it's discovered Ghostface is at large once again.New faces appear and this time a younger generation fills out most of the main cast. Among the killer's possible targets are Sydney's cousin, Jill (Emma Roberts), her best friend and horror guru Kirby (Hayden Paneteirre, sporting quite possibly the worst hairstyle since Felicity, circa 1999), film geeks/Randy stand-ins Charlie and Robbie (Rory Culkin & Erik Knudsen), Jill's ex-boyfriend Trevor (Nico Tortorella), and the Woodsboro town deputies (Marley Shelton, Anthony Anderson, & Adam Brody).As with all the Screams, there's plenty of poking fun at the genre it subsists in. The film doesn't shy away from winking at the audience – the term ""meta"" is said enough times to warrant a drinking game. There's several fun call backs to the original trilogy (the off screen relationship between Cox and Arquette is utilized best). These moments help make up for some of the self-referential overkill but at the same time partly contribute to it.The stalk-and-slash premise is starting to show it's age, too, and, as a result, the kills don't feel all that inventive (the opening's use of a garage door, for example, comes off more as a slapdash way to end the scene than it did an homage to the first film). Fittingly enough, Anthony Anderson's death looks like an outtake from one of the Scary Movie parodies he's appeared in. The gore level declines for the most part as the movie progresses but suffice it to say there's enough blood in the film to warrant it's R rating. The deaths leading up to all the corn syrup, though, don't quite measure up to the ones found in the movies that came before it.What's also worth nothing is the movie lacks the noticeable character development found within the first two films. Characters such as Olivia (Marielle Jaffe) and Kate Roberts (Mary McDonnell), Jill's respective friend and mother, aren't given enough time to make an impression and are instead sidelined to make room for two dimensional caricatures including Judy Hicks (Marley Shelton), a deputy who's infatuated with Dewey and Rebecca (Allison Brie), Sydney's snide publicist. This inequality in screen time is the film's biggest detriment and probably a result of the many rewrites/reshoots done during production (there was a revolving number of producers involved, including Ehren Kruger, the auteur behind the dreary Scream 3). Hopefully we'll get some kind of extended cut or several deleted scenes when the film is released to DVD that will shed a better light on the underwritten players.The cast is certainly game, however, and almost everyone is able to roll with the punches (or daggers if you will). Neve Campbell is still as appealing as she was from the onset of the series while Cox's serpent like demeanor helps sell Gale's venom – though it's noticeably less biting this time around. I've always felt Arquette is a lousy actor and my opinion of him didn't change the fourth time I saw him portray the clueless Dewey. As for the newcomers, Emma Roberts does a capable job in her role and Hayden Paneteirre, despite her atrocious hairdon't, manages to be endearing enough to garner empathy when her untimely death comes. There are some weak links (the aforementioned Arquette, Shelton, and surprisingly Anna Paquinn & Kristin Bell in their brief cameos) but otherwise it's a fairly well-acted movie – something that's not always easy to come by in the horror genre.Despite an overlong ending and some hiccups in the writing and editing, Scream 4 vaults above its predecessor and maybe, just maybe, is equal to the second installment of the series. And while there may be more to come – Wes Craven is already considering another trilogy – Scream 4 undoubtedly redeems the franchise's reputation and functions as a worthy conclusion that goes out with a shout.",Scream 4
400,Tyler_ED,What a waste of time,3,6 August 2011,"A completely waste of my time and your time. This movie was so annoying that after like 40 minutes I simply fast forwarded, only regret not doing that since the beginning. I would have made a 1:30h boring nightmare last 20 minutes, which would be great. The end is stupid, absurd and makes no sense at all. The original actors look tired and are completely misplaced in the middle of the new brainless teenagers. Btw what cast agency was used in this movie? Were we supposed to get any sympathy for the young cast, because honestly, they were completely expandable and horrible.By the end is just another old Hollywood formula to catch your money with an old dated story that had its glory in the past. It is a pity, there are so many good original stories out there. My advice is if you miss the old characters, good old Sidney and the rest of the gang, do yourself a favor and watch the first movie ONLY, which is near perfect, don't ruin watching the sequels.",Scream 4

Please, I guessed the killer so fast and I never can do that in most movies. I am actually sad because I was expecting better and I was so excited to see it. I am sure I will have people commenting and telling me otherwise but the 20 or so people that were in the theatre with us all just laughed at the end and wished they had not spent $9 for a ticket.

402,PeachSlice,Could have been better in the circumstances,7,28 April 2011,"There was no imagination when the characters died. But most importantly, THERE WAS NO HUMOUR!!!! The first Scream film was genuinely funny but there was no slap-stick in Scre4m :( I mean count how many characters are there that could have been eliminated from the story but still make sense, for example, the blonde police women that liked Dewy. If she hadnt been in the film like many other characters it would have still been a good film, now what does that say about.....well the characters in general? They were poorly put together and had no impact on the film or storyline. The movie was a disappointment, surprised? Yes i was, because it had the original cast and the original director to the first film and i thought it could be just as good. Then i remembered that its another Hollywood horror film that has watered down horrors so much that most horrors that are released are 15's rather than 18's. I wish we could go back to the time when a 'horror' meant a badass script rather than one that is acceptable to younger viewers. When 'horrors' sold themselves by their story lines rather than sex, blood and gore. To sum this film up, it was a poor sequel taking into account of numerous factors inc. original cast and director. But it was a good horror compared to the weak horrors that are released in todays cinema. Scre4m was a good start in making a slightly decent horror movies, but a lonnnggggg way off from what they used to be like 20 years ago. 7.5/10",Scream 4

As a fan of the past films, I wanted that mystery going around ""who are the killers? Or is it just one?"" However, big expectations sank low. Although at the beginning I was quite excited and curious, when I started laughing I noticed that I wouldn't enjoy the film the way I wanted to. I was looking for a horror film, something that would make me jump and the only thing that made me move was a lady sitting next to us that kept getting scared and my sit would shake too. I cannot say that I hated the film because well, I have seen way worse but to be truly honest. Scream 4 was a massive disappointment! I found the film very predictable. Unlike most reviews I have read so far, the ""final twist"" wasn't anything new, both my boyfriend and I halfway through pointed out to each other who the killers were and that ruled out all the excitement of the film. Although it was funny with certain things that happened, the whole film was a waste of money.I am therefore giving 5 out of 10 because although I did giggle now and then, the entire film was too predictable for me.",Scream 4

What a complete waste of my time.""Scream 4"" is an embarrassment to the cast and crew, particularly Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven. It steps far beyond the line between ""clever"" and ""cringeworthy, dumb and pointless"" in the direction of the latter. It attempted to mock the majority of horror movies, including its own predecessors, far too hard, making it difficult to take seriously or even watch at all.The character development of ""the new generation"" was poor, meaning that it was hard to feel sorry for any of them given the circumstances that surrounded them. Most of the new characters were easily unlikeable. It felt as though their inclusion was purely filler, in order to provide a good number of potential victims for Ghostface. The direction was horrific at times - characters showed little (if any) remorse for their perished peers. No suspense was created toward or during Ghostface's appearances. It was as though even the writers were unsure what they were trying to achieve. They failed miserably in finding the perfect balance of humour and horror, instead meshing the two together as one big, annoying mess.The music was used at inappropriate moments and was confusing, in that it didn't really provide a specific feel for the movie. It was even goofy at times, spoiling the atmosphere completely.The film was terribly structured. The last half an hour (concluding the film) was clumsy and laughable, and the choice of killer(s)(just to throw you off) and the motive(s) was ridiculous and unbelievable.Poor pacing, no tension, non-existent scare factor, some bad casting, awkward jokes, overly self-referential and a very big anti-climax.

It was so boring I wanted to leave after 30 mins but there was no way I could leave because movies are like 10 bucks now.

From books by Gail Weathers, and the subsequent spin-off movies 'Stab 1-7', Woodsboro is a different town that is once again plunged into controversy as Sidney Prescott comes to town to promote the launch of her book.Craven and Williamson do a great job at revisiting the themes and story that made the original Scream film a HIT!

It is nearly essential to have the prior films under your belt to enjoy this one!",Scream 4
407,dabartman1138,"A worthwhile watch for any fans of horror, or the Scream franchise.",6,22 April 2011,"I only semi-recently started to familiarize myself with the Scream franchise, but I loved it instantly. Creating genuine scares by avoiding all the clichés of horror movies, and turning the genre on its head with its self-mocking humor, and also by turning the killer not into a born psychopath with an elaborate back story or a supernatural, but someone dressed in a mask and robe, who uses his love of horror movies as his weapon against his victims. This helped create the mystery factor for the films, leaving you guessing til the end.Unfortunately, as great as the franchise as a whole is, the sequels that followed the superb original did not live up to the same revelation in the end. The killer(s) was/were, if not predictable, then just the opposite to the point where you realize they didn't build up to it at all, leaving it to be a bit anti-climactic.I'm happy to report that this is not the case with Scream 4. Even after an eleven year absence, Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson prove that they are still at the top of their game, and intelligent and original horror can still exist, even in these dark times full of repetitive sequels and remakes, something that the film comments on heavily.The basic premise of the film is that Sidney Prescott returns to Woodsboro after ten years to publicize her new book on her experience with the killer. As soon as she returns, the killings begin again, and her cousin Jill begins to step into Sidney's shoes.Where Scream 2 and 3 fail, this one succeeds. While I appreciated how they tried to put the premise of the first film in a different environment, it mostly felt like they were trying to live off the original, rather than build off it. While Scream 4 is constantly aware that it is repeating aspects from the original, making this impossible to be seen as a standalone, it does what any good sequel should do. It manages to take the premise of the original, and up the ante. Speaking of which, another thing that is upped besides the stakes is the body count and gore level. While the deaths for the most part are not nearly as elaborate as the original, they don't feel like the repetitive stab cycles in the 2 and 3. They are more brutal, and certainly show that violence in horror films has certainly gone up.If there was any one weak aspect in this film, it would be the character development, or lack thereof. The three veteran actors from the trilogy, Neve Campbell, David Arquette, and Courtney Cox reprising their roles as Sidney, Dewey, and Gale Weathers respectively, play their roles very well, even amongst all the younger stars who more often then not, are in the spotlight, and it feels like they've definitely changed since the events in Scream 3. However, in this film itself, it felt as if they were just there as devices to the plot, and given no real character arcs. However at the same time, there wasn't much they could really do, since a lot of the focus had to be on the younger cast members, who actually put up some pretty good performances, though cannot be compared the cast of the original, but still fare a mile better than the characters introduced in the previous sequels.I really liked how the actors from the two generations interacted, adding to the commentary on how not just horror movies have changed over the years, but our culture as well. With all that said, I suppose this is more of a character based movie than a character development one. Interesting how that works.I felt this was the only one of the sequels to truly stay with the spirit of the original, while still making it work for today's audiences. The best example of it having the impact of the original has got to be the ending, which I will not elaborate on. All I'll say is that this is the only one since the original where the revelation of the killer(s) surprised me, as opposed to the ""it was I, the butler!"" conclusions of 2 and 3.To sum it up, no fans of Scream or horror films could be disappointed.",Scream 4
408,kugergo,Is this a joke...?????,1,17 April 2011,"First of all i have to tell , i was afraid to watch this movie ,cause these days many low quality & week horror movies are around the globe. But i saw the ratings and the reviews were good ,also many people recommended this as a ""great"" horror movie , so i gave it a chance.I was wrong...really wrong. The story is so lame it has nothing' original , the script and the conversations are crap and unreal, and it's even not scary at all.I was watching my clock every ten minutes in the theater and waiting' for the redemption till the movie ended.... What happened with the great horror movies like Psycho ,The Shining ,The Silence of the Lambs , Rosemary's Baby ????? This is not quality , just don't get what the film makers thought when they made this terrible movie... i would say and write don't watch this movie , but as u see many people know nothing' about quality , that's why the movie has 7.7 score....(unbelievable and sad , so sad!!)",Scream 4
409,Horrormovie_buff,Brilliant! ****CAUTION! SPOILERS AHEAD!!*****,4,15 April 2011,"This movie was fantastic! Plain and simple. It had me on edge from beginning to end! The suspense was great, the humor was perfect, and Ghostface is more brutal that ever! He's very violent with every single one of his victims in this one. First off, the opening scene. Fifteen years ago, Scream shocked us with the brutal demise of Drew Barrymoore's Casey Becker after she is attacked and murdered. Although the opening scene in this one is comedic at first, it wastes no more time being funny as soon as the real stuff starts happening. Marnie and Jenny are attacked and brutally killed by Ghostface who is on a new killing spree. I for one felt sympathy towards both of the girls because of their sweet innocent faces when they interact with each other. Once you see this movie, you will definitely like one of the new, cunning characters. Whether it be sweet, innocent Jill, feisty Olivia, geeky Charlie, or the edgy Kirby, all of the characters have great personalities supported by fantastic acting. One of the characters were so likable, the entire audience in my theater simultaneously cried,""NOOOOO!"" when he/she died! So like Casey Becker in the first Scream, you feel a lot of sympathy towards the characters when they die. Although there was one scene that could've ruined the movie for some, it is quickly covered up after the final scenes of the movie. For any horror movie fan, I'm sure Kirby and Charlie will be your favorites. You should definitely see this movie, trust me, you WILL NOT regret it!",Scream 4
410,brayden457,Okay,6,29 April 2011,"It was a lot better than I expected. I was told it was bad and predictable. The other Screams, I hate to say I was never impressed with. Scream is gone, suddenly he jumps out and slits their throat. I could predict every kill.This Scream wasn't as bad as I came in expecting to see. I'm not good but not bad at predicting who the murderer is, but I guessed only one right.Most of the kills you could guess. They generally had the traditional setting, And I wish a new rule for the movie would be ""No phone call"". I understand that kind of wrecks the whole Scream persona, but when they get a phone call, I was already braced for Ghostface to jump up.They did a better job of characterization, in my opinion. This was one thing they improved on. They also made the plot more complex, and honestly better. It wasn't just a bunch of random kills thrown together by the one girl surviving again.They added better kills too, but I prefer not to specify because I don't want to add a spoiler alert. But I will say that I don't mean they just made them way gorier, they did an improved job of getting a little bit of an emotional reaction from the crowd. Not just a bunch of faces dropping dead.As much as I thought they bettered the Scream series, I hope they're done with it. My question, is how many people can be physically capable of multiple murders as gory as that, and up close, with a knife. In a town of not too many people.A classic horror film error is present in the movie though; lack of realism. Assuming you can guess their is police involvement, the police were rather incompetent. They reacted to incidents slowly, and seemed to always have the shorter end of the stick. They would lose fights with the killer where they outnumbered the killer, and Ghostface was armed with a knife, and they had both had pistols.Victim reactions were also slightly not realistic. People were not near enough cautious. And most (at least a good deal of people) carry guns in the glove compartment of their vehicles. But I haven't seen anyone pull one out. And people seem very delayed to call 911. They refuse to call 911 right after the killer calls them, and instead wait until they're trapped or already almost dead.They're is several instances even when victims had the option to call 911 and wait it out.Police should be able to respond to a home within a city in a town or small city within two-three minutes. Four or five minutes at the most. Six minutes or more, unless their were traffic or other delays, would be a bad response.So, short story long, it was okay, better than the previous ones and worth renting for sure. But for gods sake Scream producers and director, no more.",Scream 4
411,pandinha66,Amazing!,10,17 April 2011,"This was truly one of the best movies I've ever seen! I haven't watched the previous ones, and I actually just went to see Emma Roberts, but this movie surprised me (in the good way). All the actors and actresses were good, which is pretty hard these days and they ending was anything but predictable. Also, the lines were funny and original, which usually can't be said about continuations (specially the ones made 10 years after). Is nice how they make fun about their own movies and stuff that happened in the other movies. I screamed and laughed in the same movie, which I found amazing, and I have no bad things to say about it. I'm a teenage girl, which I find interesting to say, as you may be a lot different than me.",Scream 4
412,patrick303,Horrible,1,21 April 2011,"This was the cheesiest movie I have ever laid my eyes upon. I felt raped of my money when I left the theaters. I wanted to cry because it was so bad. I gave it a chance. I did! I swear! But it just didn't work out in the end. I will let you see it for yourself but I recommend waiting for it to come out on HBO or better yet, something like TNT. Ghost face must not go on anymore! For the sake of this country's cinematic reputation. We need to start producing real horror movies. Not children's play things. These sequels do nothing further the actual franchise. I teach high school seniors and all of the students who saw this movie felt the exact same way. They voiced that they wanted their money back. It was not scary, I was not on the edge of my seat, there were no jumpy moments, it was all very predictable and sadly so. I wanted it to be so good because there is a lack of good horror movies out and WES CRAVEN produced the damn movie. Is he going senile? I mean that is the guy who created Nightmare on Elm Street (the original) isn't it? Then he turns around and churns this out. Wake up Craven! WE NEED YOU!",Scream 4
413,aaronebrown,Something to SCREAM 4,10,19 April 2011,"Having not been old enough to see the original SCREAM trilogy I was over the moon to hear about the release of the fourth instalment in the series. I was initially worried after the disappointing end to the trilogy however, after hearing Kevin Williamson was going to write the script my hopes soared ... and I was not disappointed.SCRE4M - Movie ReviewSCRE4M is a fast-paced thriller which criticises the wealth of rubbish Horror Films that have been released in the last Ten Years and the seemingly endless re-makes that Hollywood has indulged on - all the elements of the first Scream's self-parodying fun is back and Movie Buffs will be swamped with the numerous movie references. This is a film made by people who genuinely love films for people who know what a good quality film should be. There are also plenty of references to the previous films in the SCREAM Series, some of which are painfully obvious, others which are more subtle and will not be picked up on by all viewers this occurs in settings, plot and even in characters (which is picked up on during the film and should not be mistaken for laziness)SCRE4M is a fun film and enjoyable to watch, however, the ending does drag in a little as there are numerous anti-climaxes which take up time and can appear unnecessary, however the twist at the end is strong ... but I will not spoil anything.This is definitely a new start for the SCREAM series, it is familiar but at the same time feels refreshing and original and any more additions to this series would not be shameless cash-cows as they are presented in the STAB series but worthy sequels that deserve to be told. It is a cue to the Movie Industry to reinvent horror at the start of this new decade and one that hopefully will be picked up on.I would recommend SCRE4M to anyone who enjoyed the original Trilogy. Please do not avoid this due to thinking that this fourth instalment is anything like SCREAM 3, think of it as SCREAM 1.5. Even if you have yet to see the previous films this is an enjoyable experience and recommended to people who enjoy films such as FINAL DESTINATION, this is after all not your average horror/thriller, it is smart, clever, funny and scary. It's a Scream.",Scream 4
414,risto-uukkivi,Very nice surprise for me as a horror movie fan!,8,17 April 2011,"When I went to the cinema I expected a typical slasher movie and did not expect anything good from this sequel, but I was really surprised. There was much excitement from the beginning till the end on the movie and at the end it was really good, unexpected situations, very good acting and quite good storyline to. Wes Craven did very good work. The movie was a little bit funny to, because of the scary movie sequels that are made, and a few times the crowd in the cinema laughed and it seemed that they are watching a comedy movie, not a horror movie. There were some nice twists at the end also, which I did not see coming at all. In conclusion I recommend highly for horror fans, I liked it a lot!",Scream 4

Shut the fck up. I just watched the Scream Trilogy ruined in front of me. 10 years of waiting...for that? What the hel was that? The final scenes that people previously reviewed as being ""great"" and all this nonsense. Stop.THIS MOVIE IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.So cheesy, as we were watching the ""Climax"", people were LAUGHING in the crowd it was so dumb. Wish i had my 10 bucks back.Thanks Wes , fck you",Scream 4

As a little kid I wasn't the best type to watch those...I cried during Monsters Inc. if that will tell you anything. So my mom and I rented all three so we could go see the fourth one...I really loved the first one, the second one was interesting, third one not so much....so I was unsure that the fourth would just be a dumb money maker. But Wes and Kevin totally reinvented it. They made it just like brand new and for a whole new generation of audience such as me and my peers. We went to go see the fourth at the movie theatre today...and we loved it almost as much as the amazing first which started it all!! It was so unpredictable, the killings were more fresh and original, the actors who had, had roles before acted as if nothing had ever changed. 11 years?!? Not a chance! They acted as if it was just like 2000 and then 2001! It was amazing...the new actors were just as great...overall a great movie that brings pride to the horror genre. It was awesome!

417,mark-mckee94,As good as the original,10,20 April 2011,"What can I say? After scream 1 I never thought that there would be a scream film as good as the original, given the nature of scream 2 and 3.Sure, there were some minor flaws in the characters, and not all acting was superb, yet Scream 4 managed to keep me on the edge of my seat at all times. Sometimes satirical, others just terrifying, Scream 4 stands out as the benchmark for a new age of horror. To any horror fans, I highly recommend this movie, not only as a good slasher, but a good piece of film overall. It was also very warming to see the links back to the original film, and watch the plot unfold, packed with twists and unexpected turns. Craven and Williamson return to their best, with extremely witty dialogue, and an immersing script throughout.Great film, even greater slasher. A must for die-hard horror fans. Couldn't fault this movie one bit, especially in comparison to the horror films that embarrass the genre these days.10/10",Scream 4
418,ivex07,I cried...,9,18 April 2011,"Let me start by saying that I literally cried at the end of the movie. This is the 4th time I watch the movie since the opening. I've wasted most of my paycheck to go see it and the reason why is because I waited 4,091 days to see this movie and after countless of times I've spent reading IMDb to hear some updates about if they were going to make scream 4 or not. (Neve even said once she refused to do it)The reason why I cried is because at the end of the movie, I realized that the franchise was over once again, and that I have to go back to my life where stupid non-sense cliché horror movies would fill up movie theaters all around the world.I also cried because this is a wonderful and amazing movie. This movie actually brought me back to the 90's. This movie actually gave me the feeling that I was a little kid again, waiting for those ''moments'' so that I could jump from my seat. Everything in this movie is superb, from the characters to the storyline, everything flow's easily. One thing I didn't like is the choice of the killer. I felt like if it was scream 3 all over again but it's one heck of a movie anyways.I will go see this movie again. I will buy the DVD, collectors edition, special edition, limited edition. I will buy bumper stickers, books, posters, domain names just so I can always feel close to scream.I'd give this movie a 8.5/10 seeing how 9/10 would make me a fanatic.",Scream 4
419,xb132,I had ridiculously high expectations.. and definitely wasn't disappointed.,10,15 April 2011,"Just as the title says, I had ridiculously high expectations going into this movie for two reasons. 1) it was another scream and 2) it's from wes craven. so i was really anxious for this to come out. **NO SPOILERS HERE** all you need to know basically is who Sidney, Dewey, and Gale are but the thing here that separates Scream 4 from Scream 1 is that yes, it's a remake but no, you don't really have to see the other Scream movies. What it comes down is all that Craven did was take his first Scream, added a slightly different twist with the same setup as the first one and called it a sequel. so essentially, it's a remake thats the exact same, but different and still a sequel.Craven pretty much redefines here what he already did 15 years ago with Scream 1.

So I was totally excited to when I HEARD they were making a fourth. After probably about a year of waiting, Scream 4 was finally here. My friends and I knew we had to see it right away. Got there early to get god seats and just sat back and waited to be scared. As soon as the production credits showed up and that creep music they use every time kicked in, I knew it was starting all over again. I was quiet surprised at who turned out to be the killer. Overall I was very happy with the turn out of the movie. Lots of funny parts in it to which surprised me. There was actually a scene were I actually laughed out loud, hard! A few scenes made me jump.

Everything about it looks old, recycled and just plain silly. I know a fun silly movie, this actually is not. I felt like the movie was suffocating my movies taste, because it's just that old, the bad kind of old. The kind that does not challenge you, does not give you more, does not provide you with new ideas. Why would anyone be involved in such a production in the 1st place? Has Hollywood seriously ran out of ideas this quick? I don't think so, there are many good movies out there with fresh ideas, fresh look and fresh atmosphere. I absolutely did not have fun during the movie, and I regret going there. I prefer seeing Twilight instead of this so called ""2011 movie"", and this says a lot considering the fact that twilight had only a good thing related to it which was its soundtrack. To whomever loves true cinema, to whoever loves a decent cinematic experience, DO NOT go and see this movie! It's a TRAP!! If you are a fan of the franchise, go see the older movies of it, and save yourself the money to buy a sandwich that actually provides you with a good taste.",Scream 4

JIll stabs Sidney and herself and jumps on the glass table to make it look like she was dead. While Jill awakes in the hospital she thinks Sidney and all her friends are died but Dewey tells her Sidney's touch and go. Jill goes into Sidney's room to try and murder her but Dewey and Gale come in to save Sidney.Gale distracts Jill enough to give Sidney the chance to shock her with a defibrillator.Jill tries to get back up and kill but Sidney manages to fatally shoot her.

The stabs were incredibly tense and real looking as the blood doesn't spray like a fountain but squirts,splashes and oozes. The film left me at the edge of my seat, but did have some funny bits in it too.

Not worth it please wait to watch it and save ur money. I the opening scene with its false starts will do nothing but annoy you.

The original 3 actors (Dewey, Gail and Sydney) all feel out of place surrounded by a bunch of teenagers. Every time Sydney is attacked she seems to kick ghostface and knocks him back. My biggest issue is I never felt any of the original 3 characters were in any real danger. Even when Sydney is stabbed in the stomach I don't believe for a minute she's going to die. Dewey has nothing to do but drive around and Gail has a near pointless roll just trying to resurrect her career again. And she feels out of place just hanging with a group of teenagers. There are some good things though too. There is decent pacing but some more action would have also been nice. I hope the next one does it better though.",Scream 4

Scream was new and brought back the slasher film genre. With the two other sequels not so much. It soon to become a parody of itself and became predictable. Now with the 4th installment while impressed, the film did have a lot of flaws.Pros: The main 3 cast members of the first 3 films are back. The film satirizes different genres of horror. Some of the new characters are refreshing. The ghost face killer is a well kept mystery until the end. There is no possible way you can find out who the killer is.Cons: The killings were meh. The ending went on too long for me. The cops were useless. David (Dewey) can't act. The over analyzing of the plot gets annoying at times and contradicts itself very often. The opening sequence was also annoying (we get the joke and start the movie). Most of the jokes fall flat.Overall it was a good 4th installment in this series and I hope it is the last.",Scream 4

At first I thought they made him look like a serial killer and spoil it out in first scene with him, but this is the fourth movie, right? So they made Trevor look as suspicious as possible, and that's just dumb. Thumbs up for the effort...Some parts of this movie were better than other, but it wasn't very enjoyable.

First, I'm going to go out and say this movie would have been fifty times better if Jill Roberts, played by the annoying Emma Roberts, who gives off the impression that she's as self absorbed as Julia Roberts, a relative, but I digress. If Emma Robert's performance wasn't so annoying and over the top, I would actually like this movie a little more. The redeeming quality is that she isn't in the film all that much,and when she is, she isn't that bad. But when she reveals herself to be one of the Ghostface killers, and all of her dialog turns from believable teenage dialog to lines that just consist of her screaming and acting like her mother or whatever she is does in real life. The redeeming qualities are of course, the original cast. Arquette made a strong performance, and so did Campbell. But to be fair, stay with the trilogy. This one isn't great, but it's something to see if you haven't seen it.",Scream 4

It's 2011, Wes Craven...Also I thought the movie wasn't clever like the first or parts of the second. They lost me when ---Spoiler Alarm Start!--- the killer makes a call from Trevor's phone but it's never questioned how or who made the call, Trevor just reappears and nothing about the phone is said... I'm not stupid, so please give me some intelligence. ---Spoiler Alarm End---I would have loved this one to come out better, it's been 10 yrs and it seemed like they might just have had some great new takes on the series. But they didn't deliver that. More of the same old, which was great, even brilliant in part one, but doesn't drag out well in a forth installment.I rank this one as not as bad as the 3rd, but not as good as the 2nd film.",Scream 4
432,beerstrike07-451-649995,A review read in 2 minutes,7,16 August 2012,Well honestly I think this is the best scream movie. It changes the whole scream franchise how Sidney's cousin is the killer.Basically this film has a different vibe then the others. Yet none of them are scary they just follow the same person Sidney Prescott. But this one does it in a different way its clever about the way it does it. I do recommend this film to people who don't mind a bit of gore But don't like scary films because this film is not scary if your someone who loves to be scared this isn't the movie for you. The only reason i rated this film a 7 is because I enjoyed it made me giggle and I'm a person who loves to be scared. not many films give me the scared feeling so it doesn't bother me with all the gore. There is a lot of blood in a couple of scenes so be warned if you don't like blood shut your eyes when it comes up.Jake Beer,Scream 4
433,JediNinja,I really liked Scream 4,9,13 April 2011,"I recently saw the movie Scream 4. I really liked it. Coming in to the movie, I was like ""Well, how many sequels have been any good?"" But I really liked this movie. The movie had great suspense with intense twists and turns. This movie will take you through all kinds of emotions. You'll laugh. You'll cringe. You'll jump out of your seat. Everything. There is one scene in particular that will probably give you nightmares for a while. The cast was awesome. A great blend of young future stars and seasoned veterans. Kudos to Wes Craven and everybody involved with this movie for doing such a good job. I really liked this movie and I think that you'll like it too. I highly recommend this movie.",Scream 4
434,vinny7715,Ehhh,3,23 November 2012,"Well, I can probably say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I had seen the other three and came into the theaters with high expectations. Those expectations were immediately lowered within the first hour of the movie. Things like the Stab movies were very confusing at the beginning. Then there were all those twists that seemed to have no thought whatsoever. The movie did have its good moments and its good scares, but overall it wasn't very good.I sat through the entire movie thinking it would get better but it didn't. All of the new characters were OK and the other returning characters were just as OK. This movie was actually an alright and I could have given it a rating of at least a 6, but in a way, I was rating on how I felt about it when I first saw it in theaters.",Scream 4
435,CanyonHunter,Essential if you call yourself a real horror buff...,10,23 April 2011,"For all of the horror fans, sick of the genre's current state: torture porn, unnecessary sequels, overly predictable killing scenes, over-serious non-believable films, over-the-top gore, THIS is the gasp of fresh air we have been waiting for.If you have been loyal to your genre, seeing every cheesy Hollywood horror coming out, this is the cream of the crop.Scream 4 is absolutely, 100 percent undoubtedly the horror movie faithfuls' movie.In this fourth installment, the original Scream concept is still here but on CRACK. Wes Craven does not disappoint fans of the first series, taking bolder risks and cranking the meta into overdrive.The genre take-offs and scares are mixed well. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, jabbing at every cliché in the book to great delight. Strangely, in asking us not to take all of it too seriously, we get sucked in to the movie more, helping the scares become... ...scarier. The laughs let the tension dissipate, yet the film, with remarkable acting and writing (for the genre) manages to create some jump-out-of-your-seat moments, as well as what I'm willing to declare the genre's funniest 'false scare' ever.Not to mention there's a great cast, especially the lovely trio of David Arquette, Courteney Cox and Neve Campbell from the original, as well as Alison Brie, Annie from Community, Kristen Bell of Veronica Mars fame and Hayden Panettiere, Claire from Heroes, to name a few.There's a new set of rules in this horror, and for every horror fan the almost overload of horror-parodying gags/quips is a goldmine. Not to mention the self-parodying is amazing.Not to say this film is flawless by any means, but for any horror buff, this is a great, gutsy, clever piece of film that will absolutely satisfy your craving for Hollywood horror quality.If you love horror, see this. And see it again. Because it might be the best thing from this genre you'll see in a while.",Scream 4
436,cdawg4444,"Not as good as the first, but better than 2 and 3.",8,11 January 2014,"the scream movies are classics and always will be. The first one set the bar high for scary movies and is still very popular today. However the 2nd and the 3rd movie disappointed me very much as they were not needed at all. the 4th movie was WAY better that the 2nd and 3rd. of course this movie was made 11 years after number 3,so this introduced Facebook and smart phones to the blend. the ending was a shock to me personally, but everyone has their own opinion. the acting (as with all the others) was pretty good, but expect so exaggerated moments. The characters look...well ten years older. If you are a fan or enjoyed the other three, you will enjoy this one as well.",Scream 4
437,adamtox31,Really Impressed,10,16 April 2011,"I definitely had my hesitations when I heard that Scream 4 had gone into production last year. At first, it seems like it wouldn't make sense to do a fourth film as the series was meant to be a trilogy. Well, I just got back from watching it and had to come on here to write a review (I've never done this on IMDb.com before) because I was simply blown away. I'm not gonna lie...I went into the theatre with very low expectations of this film. I was proved wrong.With the hot thing in Hollywood these days being remakes, Scream 4 takes full advantage of that and isn't afraid to make fun of the genre. They also exploit everybody's obsession with some more recent horror films, such as Saw, with seemingly more blood in this film than the previous three. If there was ever going to be a remake of the original Scream (DON'T DO IT!), Scream 4 would be it.I don't want to give anything more away because I really recommend any fan of the Scream series to give this one a chance. Even if you aren't a fan but have seen the first three, this one is a must-see. With the original being touted as reinventing horror films, this one has once again taken it one step further.I know a lot of people are saying that this is the start of a new trilogy and while I hope that isn't true, I have learned my lesson and won't underestimate Wes Craven & Co. if the series shall continue.",Scream 4
438,andycantona7,"Very, very bad.",2,28 July 2011,"Unbelievably disappointed after watching this.I'm a huge fan of the first movie and Scream 2 wasn't all that bad.Scream 3 was woeful but, after reading plenty of positive reviews (and ignoring the negatives!), I though Scream 4 would be a Tour De Force.A real return to form and a fitting end to the Scream movies.I couldn't have been more wrong. Boring characters, a boring, 'samey' plot, poor acting and a predictable ending (which was so poor in so many ways). Even Dewey becomes a 'so what?' character.In Scream 1, you cared about the characters and were on the edge of your seat hoping that they wouldn't die.In 4, you simply don't care.What an awful movie.The fans deserved so much better.",Scream 4
439,amk2f,They Have Managed to Make a Decent Movie After All!,7,6 August 2012,"I was a huge Scream fan in the 90ies, so when Scream 4 was released I didn't even go to the movie-theater to see it, since I was 100% sure it was bad. Bought it on DVD out of curiosity recently & was pleasantly surprised. Wes Craven & Kevin Williamson have managed to make a very decent sequel after all! Although I'm still convinced they should have left Scream a trilogy, the idea of playing with the ""remake"" theme seems to be the best possible solution for Scream 4. Not only the idea was quite good the execution is great either given the circumstances. Not only the film evokes nostalgic feelings it presents a nice satire on the modern youth and the internet culture. Although Scream 4 is possibly the best thriller I've seen since My Bloody Valentine 3D, I'm still not able to suppress the feeling of how much worse it is than the original movies from the trilogy, compared even to Scream 3. Scream 4 actually has lots of advantages compared to various other sequels: smart idea, original cast from the previous movies, the new cast is not bad either, good acting, suspense, some good jokes... What it lacks though is the atmosphere of the first 3 movies, though some vibe is still there, it is not the same anymore. Well, maybe that was one of the director's ideas, I don't know. But the movie has left me somewhat sad with the feeling that nothing stay the same anymore, even my favorite franchise of my youth. Only after watching Scream 4 I've come to realize how much do I really miss the 90ies, when everything was a little bit more honest & real.",Scream 4
440,austinmoore-61392,If The Movie Could Be A HypeBeast,6,30 June 2018,"For all die-hard Scream fans this was a blessing from above. Just about every horror movie had their remake in the mid to late 2000's and Scream jumped onto the hype train in release Scream 4 in 2011. After the success of the original trilogy 10 years prior this film it was able to attain just about every actor that was hot at the time (and they still are). This in my opinion made the movie not as good as it could have been. Grabbing people from other film genres that don't fit into horror (in my opinion; they are still very talented) ie; Kristen Bell and Anthony Anderson. Glad that they more than likely brought a different audience to see the movie and made the movie more successful. Other that that this film is full of the perfect cliches that the Scream franchise is known for, and something I feel like they did really well in this movie was Kirby Reed (Hayden Panttiere) who was the Cinephile in the movie. In the fourth installment they showed off Kirby towards the end of the movie answering questions from ghostface on the phone and rattling off answers incredibly fast and showing off that she is the movie buff she is supposed to be. Which you really got to see from Randy Meeks in the original trilogy and the TV series hosted by MTV's Noah Foster. Just like a lot of horrors today the film was genuinely fun to watch. There are not many horror movies I can watch two times in a row and not get bored easily. Great movie.",Scream 4
441,nickmister182,Great addition to the franchise!!,7,23 April 2020,"Scream 4 the latest addition to the classic 90s horror slasher,by the legendary Wes Craven that changed the horror genre. I've always been fan of the scream franchise, I mean when the first scream came out I must of watched it 100 times. The whole ghostface costume and the phone call pranking and toying with the victims, and using horror movies for trivia was just brilliant and something completely new to horror movies..The original cast of scream returns in this movie which I'm glad they did I cant picture a scream without them, no doubt there probably will be a reboot maybe somewhere down the line as it seems to becoming more popular trend now.The events of scream 4 takes place 10 years after scream 3, 15 years after the original woodsboro murders. Sidney prescott now a writer of a book out of darkness a book about her survival of the first 3 events. On her book tour her last stop is none other than woodsboro very pleased they bring is back to woodsboro. The night before Sidney arrives in woodsboro two teenage girls are murdered by ghost face, like the original opening of all screams with the killer calling and toying with the victims. The next morning dooey now the sheriff of woodsboro gets the call about the murders of the teenage girls. Sidney arrives in woodsboro for her book signing, dooey tracies a location of one of the victims phones
back to where Sidney is having her book signing. Finding a ghost mask, a knife, cell phone, and blood all over Sidneys books in the trunk of her rented vehicle.. Sidney releasing that it's about to happen all over again the movie pretty much unfolds from here..I thought scream 4 was good defently stronger than scream 3.. if your a scream fan you will enjoy the movie there's a strong cast (Emma Robertson) who plays Jill Prescott sidneys cousin gives a good performance.. there are few similarities to the original scream in this movie which I think fans will like. Theres some humour as well and the story near the end is interesting. So if you're a scream fan give it a go.",Scream 4

I'm glad the movie contained the original cast, and the regulars were still their normal old selves.(Won't go further into that one) Honestly, even though I was a fan I really hope they don't make a fifth. This specific type of horror movie is in the past, and just doesn't keep up to pace with the genre anymore. I wish that the fourth movie hadn't been made at all, just in that the third gave a plausible ending and a motion that the characters themselves were ready to move on.

The general consensus seems to be that it's not only one of the better Scream sequels, but a good movie in general? It literally baffles me! This movie feels like it was straight-to-video, aside from the casting. The dialogue is bad, the acting is uninspired, the story itself is really flat. The kills are pretty boring, the motive of the killer is super lame. I actually get kind of sad watching it.

451,loski101010,Scream 4 will not disappoint fans of the series!,9,16 April 2011,"I don't give anything away, just thoughts on a few scenes in the movie without mentioning any names.This is my first review on here and I just had to talk about this movie. I saw it opening night and want to go see it again! The original three were spot on, and I must say, their characters now and how they have evolved, I love their characters much more than I have in the last three. Sidney is as strong as ever, along with Dewey being a Sheriff now with his same quirkiness and Gale being the same amount of nosy. It was great to see them and I loved them the best in this movie.A lot of Scream fans go into this movie thinking that it is going to try and follow suit what the last three movies did. You have to realize this is known as a ""re-boot"", meaning this is going to be based on the series but not a direct sequel of any movie. It's been ten years, its hardly a sequel. It's a new generation, like the movie states there are also new rules. I think that is where people are let down, because they expect it to follow the formula of what made the trilogy so great. This is 10 years later, and it does have similarities of the first three, but it needed to be different to keep it fresh and to invite a new generation into this wonderful world. Yo(u will be let down if you think this is going to be exactly like the first three...because it really is not. Kills are quicker and bring no mercy, new rules, and in my opinion, a little darker ending than the last three. Its going to change the aspect of the direction of the Scream movies, and while the 3 original are the same, there is a new generation and the movie has to adapt and evolve.It might sound like I was pretty excited and pleasantly surprised with how this movie went, but that doesn't go without saying that it does have it's minor flaws. I have to believe that any good reviews you read are simply big fans of the series, because I don't see how a big fan of this series could hate or even dislike this movie. The acting, especially by the new cast, is great. Any remake or ""reboot"" to horror movies within the last 10 years have been lame and the casting of young actors/actresses who are no names. The new cast in Scream 4, while still virtually unknown to most, definitely add some credibility to their names with this movie. Emma Roberts and Hayden Panetierre definitely surprised me. I usually do not like Panetierre, but after seeing this makes me like her and excited to see where her career goes after this movie. I really enjoyed Dewey's new Deputy, Deputy Judy her name is. It adds a nice addition to the police force, and she acts as kind of the woman version of Dewey when he was in the first movie. She's quirky and tries her hardest, but at the same time, she is a little creepy at some parts.Anyone who sees this, especially a fan, wants to give their own predictions and try to guess who the killers are. Myself, and the friends I went with, we kept whispering to each other who it might be. I found myself guessing people who would be the least expected to be the killer, because the whole movie keeps going on and on about how the rules have changed. Seeing this movie as a reboot as well, it makes all the rules and the feel to the prior Scream movies irrelevant. The ending DOES surprise indeed when it finally happens, but when the reveal happens, it's almost like you know who it is five or ten minutes before. Especially towards the end, I felt they made it obvious. I do watch a lot of movies, and I tried picking it out though. Maybe if one went into the movie without reading anything about this movie, without reading reviews or general questions, then maybe the surprise of the killer(s) reveal might be surprising, but I was almost let down in that aspect.There are a lot of kills in this movie, and the only thing I have to gripe about with that is I feel each kill was too quick. Not saying they needed to torture the victim, but especially the people to die, went very quickly, compared to the first three movies in the Scream franchise (thinking especially back to Drew Barrymore's scenes). The beginning was too short and not nearly as epic or gory as any other opening scene in any of the three movies. Definitely too quick for an opening scene.One more thing that might be kind of a let down is the fact that half of the scenes from the trailers are not in the movie! There was one scene I was definitely looking forward to, and I'm sure if you have watched the trailers a few times, you will notice a few that are not in there.Okay now all of my good thoughts! The ending was surprising with how it happened. It doesn't end how you think it will end. A lot of people complain about how it might go on too long but I think for how the movie is paced (which it is quickly paced), I think the ending has to be different as well.As a Scream fan, I was definitely not let down and all the waiting paid off. I was so happy when this ended and I think that if you are a Scream fan, you will love it too. Definitely a lot better than 2 and 3.",Scream 4
452,sindriskadi,"Pretty good, but has a lot of issues",7,8 November 2021,"-SPOLIERS-
This is much better than Scream 3. Scream 3 is a complete and utter disaster compared to Scream 4. In Scream 4, the kills are gory, unsettling and scary. There are a lot of parts that I would consider pretty cringey, but the overall premise of the film is good. Jill, Sidney's cousin is a really cool character that they made pretty well. The other killer, the film geek called Charlie, is not that good. I find him pretty boring and repetitive, considering that all characters like this in Scream movies are direct copycats of Randy. Overall a good Scream sequel, a lot better than Scream 3.",Scream 4
453,nightwish39,Perfect revitalization of the series,7,13 April 2011,"When I first saw Scream I was eight years old, it was my first scary movie. When I heard that first ringing in the opening sequence I was enchanted: I was watching a rated R movie, and it was Scream, the most talked about movie in the playground. By the age of eleven, I had seen all the Screams, but never did I retrieve that initial emotion. I had to wait eight years for that, because today - as I sat threw Scream 4 - I did. I don't think there was ever such a good opening sequence in the series, or maybe even in the horror genre. Wes Craven cleverly takes his self-awareness leitmotiv to its pinnacle here. I believe he understood that after Scary Movie, gore porn and movies like Paranormal Activity or Rec, the Scream series were not considered that horrific anymore, so he really accentuated that aspect. This is the funniest of them all by the way, and also the goriest (we can even see some girl's bowels at one point). There was no moments where I got bored, if you have seen all the previous one, you will love to try detecting all the references made. But Craven is not stuck in the past, he perfectly mixes the old and the new generation, incorporating social networking, 3G phones and live Internet streaming to the plot. The old generation, or the ""three survivors"" as you could call them is clearly outdated in all these new technologies, like their 1996 audience may be. Like I said, when I first saw Scream, I was a child, and I was not aware of things like sex or alcohol. Today the characters shown in this new generation of kids have my age and I can fully understand their lifestyle and preoccupations, and it feels fantastic. While on the subject, there is much more alcohol and sex shown or mentioned in Scream 4 than there ever was in the previous three - combined. For example, you only see the characters drink beer in the first movie, here you have one of the mains say she will ""drink for two"" at a party. This shows us either how much our generation's behavior towards it has changed or how much censorship has decreased in eleven years (or maybe both).To finish, I went to see it with two friends who had never seen any Screams and they enjoyed it (almost) as much as I did, so I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for great entertainment (because it may be self-aware entertainment, it is still entertainment after all). And to ""die hard fans"" like me, you will not be disappointed, but reassured at worst.",Scream 4
454,nolimit093,My short but sweet movie review,10,15 April 2011,"I am going to ""try"" and keep this short and sweet. Also, I will contain absolutely no spoilers, soo everyone who reads can just get one persons view of the movie.Like many ppl on here we have been counting down the days until the movie was released. My 14 yr old sister has been just as excited as me, and it was great to go see this movie with her, knowing she was excited as I was.I have been reading a lot of people who have been critical of Scream 4, saying why even do it, blah blah blah. Listen, if you don't like it don't watch it, a lot of ppl enjoy these movies and have been looking forward to it, no reason to make fun of us or make us seem like we are crazy. Also the ppl who have been giving this movie bad reviews they are obviously not Scream fans, it gives you everything you could want in a horror movie, and on top of that its funny.Now onto the movie. I said I would give no spoilers so please bare with me as I try to explain without giving anything away. The opening scene was great, it was different, it made fun of itself, it was just all around fun. Scream has always been known for its opening scene. Now, this isn't a bad thing, it wasn't as good as the first movies opening scene, but I thought it was better than the 2nd and 3rd(I was not a huge fan of the opening of the 2nd).I think they do a good job of re-introducing the old characters, and do a decent job introducing the new generation. You don't necessarily need to see the first 3 movies, but obviously it would help.The kill scene's were also really good. Lot's of blood, and thats really all I want to say soo I don't ruin it for everyone.On who lives and who dies.. Just kidding, I wouldn't do that to anyone haha.If you are a Scream fan you will really really enjoy this movie, its everything you want in a Scream film. For the ppl who have been very critical of this movie, why?? That's what I would like to know. It does everything it should have done. It makes you laugh, plenty of kill scene's, really smart story line which will throw a lot of ppl off. Soo for the ppl who have been critical of this movie, get a life and stop trying to put down a movie that quenches scream fans thirst.One last thing without giving anything away. Going into the movie they advertised the movie as a reboot, a ""new generation"", but think about what Scream has stood for and also consider what Scream is all about when trying to figure everything out before the climax... Thats all I will say, I wish I could indulge more, but want everyone to go see if for themselves and maybe in a couple wks after we have all scene it we can all share some thoughts we had.Sooo go out today/tonight, take a loved one or a good friend and enjoy, and if you are a Scream fan you will appreciate what Kevin and Wes have given us.",Scream 4
455,darko_d,I've always had a thing for you Sid,8,20 April 2011,"I classed Scream as one of the movies that defined my generation of moviegoers. It inspired me to want to make movies myself, alongside the other notable films from my years as a teenager; Jurassic Park and The Blair Witch project which really had an impact on me. I came out of the cinema feeling genuinely nourished by the fact that I had never seen anything like them before.Scream has that rare quality in that it still feels fresh today and you want to watch it over again. It has believable characters, a funny and gripping screenplay, the direction and suspense never lets up and the pacing and cinematography perfectly compliment this film. I now work as an editor myself and can appreciate the technical skill that went into Scream that serves to compliment all of the creative work. The film has atmosphere and that is something that cant be quantified, it just happens on rare occasions due to a random gathering of the perfect cast and crew.Yeah, I know I'm not here to review Scream, but thought it would give a little bit of context in that it really had a lot to play in my anticipation and expectations for 4. I can briefly surmise that I enjoyed 2 but the ending let it down for me, when the killers were revealed it kind of undid the whole film for me. I'm a believer that endings can make or break a film, just look at Fight Club, who's ending perfectly captures the essence of the entire film, or alternatively, A.I. in which the third act does everything to undo the feeling of Kubricks original vision.Scream 2 was more of an A.I. Solid film, with a let down ending. Scream 3 was a complete disappointment, a great opening scene was undone by really flaky characters and acting and bad writing...you could tell it was a mish-mash and thrown together at the last minute, they should have waited and done it properly to give it the ending it deserved.This is why I think Scream 4 was warranted even in concept form...it gives it the ending it so deserves, and much as I'm about to say I loved it but I want it to be the last in the series. This movie does what I said and wraps it all up with a great ending and makes it feel complete. A lot of reviewers have said they are not sure where the series can go from here. I say that's a good thing! I think/hope that was Kevin Williamson's intention. They know the series was something special and don't want some hack director/writer to come in and carry on making crap sequels, cashing in on the Scream name.Scream 4 was everything it should have been to me. It was completely aware of the fact it was a continuation of a long running film series and even played on the fact it is a the fourth film; how some movie series are dragged out so much they become jokes in themselves.It managed to comment on all of this while still having the whodunnit plot. No it wasn't particularly scary, but if it's going to be clever and subvert the critics, it cant be. It was suspenseful where it should be as well as nostalgic, atmospheric, clever in all the correct proportions and above all very entertaining.They made this for the fans, not to please new crowds. I loved the fact that it was so self aware about becoming predictable that it turned everything on its head... again. The very fact that they made us believe this was a reboot was clever, in that it turned out to be an anti-reboot. You believed Jill would become the new Sidney, that Charlie was the new Randy. This was a comment on how reboots and remakes don't work, and'don't f*** with the original'. You also believed because of this that Sid could die, something that by 2 and 3 you just didn't believe would happen, she was no longer invincible and I was on the edge of my seat thinking at the least that one of the remaining trio wouldn't make it to the final reel.It had atmosphere; set back in Woodsboro, an ode to Halloween with its ominous small town feel, the time it took for character moments, Sid's moment with 'creepy' Hicks on the stairwell, the reminiscence of the bedroom scene in which Sidney laments to Jill 'you remind me of..me'. I usually hate the interference of Studio execs which I have witnessed first hand but I really think the Weinstiens understand the creative process and helped protect this film from becoming very mainstream and predictable.I love the fact that it commented on the Saw franchise which ruined modern 'horror' for me...they had no intelligence and suspense, just all out gore. Scream 4 had gore, but the guts to go with it so where I was truly shocked at the horror it then had moments where the characters were aware of the situation and made it believable. The characters acted how they should, Sidney looked tired and haunted that it was happening again, she was a fighter which made you root for her even more than ever. She wasn't just a screaming girl running up the stairs when she should be going out the front door, she ran up the stairs in an attempt to save someone, knowingly running into the very present danger.I don't want to ruin the surprise for anyone who hasn't seen it and wont tell you who lives and who dies...but it's a Scream baby, enjoy it for what it is, a thriller that holds you to your seat, a pantomime of 'he's behind you' moments and jumps you expect from a Scream movie, it's just when and where they occur that are the surprise.",Scream 4
456,mlola9202,Tied with the original! *SPOILERS*,10,19 April 2011,"After waiting three years for this movie, I can honestly say that the action lived up to the hype. Even though there were a variety of scenes cut out due to time constraints the movie delivered on ALL levels. The opening scene was very well thought of. Kudos to Kevin Williamson for coming up with something of that nature. The way he satirizes the numerous and unnecessary sequels that the horror genre has was brilliant. The only complaint in this sequence was that while I sympathized with all five of the girls to die in the opening, I connected the most with Lucy Hale and Shenae Grimes. Not exactly what I expected but whatever. The reintroduction of the main trio along with Sidney's publicist, Rebecca, was very well executed. The intro to Kirby, Olivia, and Jill was all right. It could have been a bit better in my opinion. Robbie being introduced as a nerd with his camera explanation was awesome and the way that Charlie flows in this scene was terrific. After the intros, the movie slowly builds up to Olivia's death scene which I consider to be one of the most brutal death scenes in the Scream franchise. You could tell that the killer (who shall remain nameless for now) had fun with this kill. The rest of the movie develops on the death of Rebecca during a press conference, the Stab-A-Thon where Gale gets stabbed, and the deaths of Hoss, Perkins, and Kate. After the Stab-A- Thon is shut down, the party continues at Kirby's house with Jill, Robbie, Charlie, and Trevor. After a little bit of nothing, Robbie gets attacked and delivers one of the funniest lines of the franchise before being killed: ""You can't kill me! I'm gay!"" This is in reference to the rules which were explained by himself and Charlie earlier in the movie. Kirby notices people missing and goes to look for them when she runs into Jill and we are given the arrival of Sidney along with the killer. Jill hides upstairs while Kirby and Sidney are able to find refuge downstairs. Charlie gets attacked and is tied to a chair while Kirby has to answer movie trivia to the killer on the phone. Very reminiscent of the first movie. Great job by Kevin Williamson here. Now we get the most anticipated part of the movie: the reveal. Kirby goes out to save Charlie after thinking she's won. She unties him only to be stabbed in the stomach twice by Charlie and left for dead. Sidney is on the inside looking for Kirby when she gets attacked by Charlie. She escapes only to be attacked by the second killer who is revealed to be none other than JILL! Jill and Charlie worked together in order to recreate the original Woodsboro massacre and frame Trevor, to become the new ""Sidney"" and ""Randy Meeks"". Jill executes Trevor but also betrays and murders Charlie before stabbing Sidney, apparently to death. Jill then intentionally harms herself to appear the ""lone survivor"" of the new massacre. This was a great part of the movie which led many people to believe that it was the end of the movie until we arrive to the hospital scene. Pretty cliché, but it achieves the goal of the Scream movies: to poke fun at the clichés of the horror franchise! Here Dewey informs Jill that Sid made it and Jill is inclined to make a flub and inadvertently makes a comment about Gale's wound, revealing herself as a killer. She proceeds to get to Sidney's room where there is a scuffle between Sidney, Jill, and Dewey. In the end, Deputy Hicks ends up saving them and Jill ends up being electrocuted by Sidney and then shot at after ""coming back to life for one last scare."" All in all, Scream 4 was not a disappointment and delivered exactly what it needed to. It might be strong enough to revive the slasher genre. Emma Roberts' performance as Jill was amazing and her brilliance showed in the final act of the movie. The new generation was perfect in their roles and the originals were there to show that while they may be ""old,"" they still got it. If there is a Scream 5, I would love it but this movie really served in my opinion to close off the franchise and show that there is no need to keep going with a franchise that has closure and had it. 10/10 stars",Scream 4
457,nicole18,Entertaining,10,9 May 2011,"Scream franchise has a simple formula. Lots of fast paced ""victim vs the killer"" scenes until its trademark ""No way?!"" moment, which you find out who is the killer, and it's always the one you least expect. That's what we love about Scream movies, and Scream 4 does it best since the original movie. Even though some ""new generation"" characters are forgettable, it's still a good movie, and an entertaining ride that you can enjoy with your friends or alone. Saying/Writing anything more about Scream 4 would be a waste, since the movie itself knows its purpose and audience so, it's a refresher to the horror genre, which went awkward and weird since couple of years. And that's it... :)",Scream 4
458,c-avinger,A worthy addition to the series,7,20 April 2011,"I had seen the first three Scream movies and enjoyed them all, even, heretic-ally, the much- maligned Scream 3. So I was looking forward to Scream 4, and I was not disappointed. It was great to see Neve, Courtney, and David back together again, though a little weird knowing David and Courtney are separated in real life, while their on screen characters are now married. Anyway, I thought the opening sequence was very clever, the murders were the most gruesome/gory of the series (after the Saw and Hostel movies, the MPAA has obviously eased up after censoring the original so heavily), there were some genuinely scary/shocking moments, and the killer's reveal was easily the most shocking yet in the series. I felt the hip young cast had well-defined roles and played them very well. On the negative side, *Spoiler alert* I thought some of the humor was overdone -- the death of the cop who gets stabbed in the head comes to mind -- but overall I think Wes Craven -- can he really be 71 years old now? -- delivered an enjoyable movie and a worthy entry in the Scream series -- not an all-time classic, but definitely worth your time & $$.",Scream 4

Wes Craven out did himself this time and had me smiling out of sheer delight than jumping like those around me. It had more of everything that the original had and I left the midnight showing with a theater's worth of people who you could hear buzzing about the theories they had on who did it. I was shocked at how great the movie I'd been waiting years to see really was. There was always the voice in my head telling me not to get my hopes up and even though I did, I was still blown away. Scream 4 is a must see for anyone who's seen Scream or for anyone looking for a fun, scary movie.",Scream 4

461,angrypete3,Very disappointing.....,1,7 October 2011,"The original ""Scream"" has always been one of my favorite slasher flicks, although I found parts 2 & 3 pretty lackluster.I was however, still excited about part 4. As a devoted fan of the genre, I am always optimistic about the next big horror flick, even with all the crappy remakes that Hollywood's been churning out lately. Needless to say I was very disappointed with ""Scream 4""...A boring, predictable, and totally uninspired film. As with the first 3, it all leads up to the big unmasking of the killer. Throw in some bad acting,a few annoying 20 somethings, and stupid dialogue and you've got ""Scream 4"" in a nutshell. My advice,skip this movie. I know not to expect Oscar worthy performances and a riveting script, but I expected more than this",Scream 4
462,KingSchultzsrighthandman,sickest film.,7,16 April 2011,"I loved this movie, really held up to 1 and 2 and a much more decent ending to the Scream series if the fourth and fifth movie. Thought the pacing was great and the screen time for old and new cast was spot on not enough of either. The opening act was brilliant. I feel they made him seem a lot more vicious in this movie which I think worked a lot for the movie, I thought the mix of comedy and slasher was great too. If I had to say I didn't like anything it'd be Jill being the killer, well I liked it but I felt the motive was a little weak and the actress was awful. Hated her instant change to a potty mouth when she first appeared to have a knife in her hand. As for Charlie being the second killer, I also felt his motives weren't that great either.Scream 4 = awesome movie.",Scream 4
463,tezbryant,Scream 4 shows it's old age... but still pretty kick ass,8,29 May 2011,"I must say that this is definitely recommended to all horror fanatics out there that is looking for fresh blood to be spilled/splattered. It's a really big improvement since is processor ""Scream 3"", It's just fun as hell to watch. Beautifully shot, plot is decent but a little repetitive with the plot of ""who-did-it"" but I can deal, nice casting including the original cast and a really shocking ending like ""Scream 3"" had. And if I must recall during it's release date in theaters when I saw it there wasn't a single moment that didn't amuse me... I even had to visit the restroom but I never moved a muscle because I didn't want to miss a single second of this marvelous horror movie. Basically and to the point ""Scream 4"" lives up to it's successful franchise and I'm not saying that everyone will enjoy this movie, but I will say is give it a chance if you're a horror fanatic like I am.Sincerely,A horror fanatic since the age 7",Scream 4
464,codyrochester,Totally redeems for Scream 3...and then some.,10,15 April 2011,"Well, let's just say fans of the original will LOVE this this fourth installment. Totally redeems for the...(to be nice)...Sub-par Scream 3. This movie is not entirely predicable, a few parts maybe, but for the most part original and unpredictable. The old cast is as amazing as ever, as good as they were in the original. However, the new cast also shines as well; Emma Roberts giving a stellar performance, which was really surprising...to me any way. However, unlike the other 3 movies, Craven upped the gore factor for this movie. Usually, when gore dominates a horror movie, it takes away from the story. With this movie, however, that is not the cast. Craven develops the characters really well; further developing old ones and mapping out all new characters well, especially Roberts (I thought Roberts was going to kill this movie but boy was I wrong). Also, as with Scream franchise, there were loads of comedic moments. Even in times of terror, no shortage of comedy, especially Anthony Anderson's part. But, I shouldn't have to mention this to Scream fans. I have always loved Wes Craven, the master of horror, and he does not disappoint. This all new Scream has totally renewed my faith in the franchise, from Scream 3 to this is an amazing jump-start (Scream fans know what I mean). This movie is now in my top 5 horror favs, along with Scream 1. This movie is dead-even with the greatness that is Scream 1. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. Ghostface is back and as bloodthirsty as ever; be ready for gore and a lot of laughs (again...I don't have to tell Scream fans this).",Scream 4
465,Scene68,Scream 4 is a surprisingly good sequel!,9,15 April 2011,"After 15 years since I was bedazzled by the first Scream I must say it felt extremely strange seeing this film as soon as the Dimension Films logo appeared on the screen and right into the opening act. But the opening was very intriguing and reminiscent to the movie-within-a-movie format that appeared in the beginning of Scream 2. Re-emerging back into the world of rules, mystery and terror and catching up with trio Sidney, Gale and Dewey put a big smile on my face as it would with other long time fans of the series.I would say this is a kill feel happy movie indeed. The brutality of its own creation in every death felt more like a Friday the 13th sequel (minus Jason Voorhees) than a Scream film. So much blood that would satisfy any person that relishes it and isn't squeamish. However many scenes parodying after the genre and remakes is within itself what Scream has been acknowledged for and it doesn't miss at any moment with that wit and one liners from Courteney Cox's Gale Weathers.Overall this still is a great movie and a thrill ride and not one scene you would ever get bored. You will laugh, jump and scream all throughout until the end. This film for is up to par with Scream 2 as being a better sequel than Scream 3 in its entirety.",Scream 4
466,dadagepeng,A great roller-coaster ride!,8,10 November 2011,"I came to the theaters with anxiety and excitement. I saw the ratings is as good as the first. So, i watched it. All the peoples in the theater were screaming and laughing, and i was having a jolly good time. It's not exactly what i expected yet it's so much entertaining than the previous one.While a new ghostface is on the loose, Sidney Prescott returns to Woodsboro for her book tour and as usual, meets her old friends Dewey and Gale (who's already married of course). She lives with her cousin she never knew, Jill (Played by Emma Roberts) and her Aunt (played by Mary McDonell). Things get worse when the person close to her is dying one by one. Now, Sidney must face a new horror that is not going to stop.As always, the cast is still returning, with a newcomers like Emma Roberts, Hayden Panettiere, Rory Culkin. I really love the script. It makes the characters really convincing.I love the opening sequence when it started as a movie-within-a-movie. It proofs that after 10 years it's still continuing the so-called legacy ""Stab"". The killings were much brutal.The ending... i'm not going to spoil it. But, i'll give you a hint. It's much longer than the proceeder. Some may say it's a drag. But, i think it's ingenious.The weak link of this movie is the police. they didn't do anything much when the situation are dangerous. Except Deputy Judy (Played by Marley Shelton). She is not what i expected, actually.If you want to enjoy this movie, don't take it too seriously. Just think it as an entertaining movie and you'll find yourself enjoyed by this movie.Overall, the movie was a great comeback with full of jolts and thrills. At first, i want to give it a 7.

467,alexinkadean,Scream 4: A New Hope,7,17 April 2011,"Not everyone probably left the movie theater wanting to see another Scream flick after the disastrous third installment eleven years ago, but this seems to have motivated the horror masters in creating something a bit different this time around. This is one of the hardest sequences as it has to fight to win the younger crowd which had probably haven't even seen the original trilogy or attract the nearly (or completely) disappointed fan base of the ""so- called now"" older generation.In any rate, Scream 4 is brave attempt to achieve the level of horror and whit and appeal to today's audience. Kevin Williamson (screenwriter) touches on the newly introduced technological advancements that change the social lives of today's teen audience within the first few lines with a sharp and to-the point dialogue. We have an opening sequence which can only compete with the first Scream and can clearly see everyone's attempt to take it a step further by commenting on the topic of voyeurism and self reflecting thirst of bloody violence.The irony is so strong that sometimes overshadows the suspense and makes the film look like another Scary Movie installment than a Scream sequel. The new characters, no matter how cool and hip looking surrounded by their latest tech gadgets are replacing the good old Arquette-Campbell-Cox bunch that seem more plain this time and present just for the sake of it.If you want to see a smart teen horror movie, this is definitely for you. If you really missed the good old Woodsboro and its original characters, this is long gone.Scream 4 sets a new hope for a second trilogy that will certainly have a new flair based on the old ingredients that made the original trilogy successful.http://diariesofacinephile.blogspot.com/",Scream 4
468,masedrocha,"More laughs, more brutality",8,13 April 2011,"I was not sure what to expect of this movie, and I walked out of the theater very satisfied with the fourth part of the Scream franchise.The acting in the movie is mostly good. Hayden Panettiere was a nice surprise, I would have liked more sequences with her. Emma Roberts has her ups and downs. The other new kids were not specially good. The old characters were the best. Neve Campbell drove her character to a new direction, very different and very likable. Courteney Cox shines as she did with the first and the second installments, I almost forgot the mix between Monica Geller and Gale Weathers that I saw in Scream 3. David Arquette was funnier than he was in the other three because he did not play as dumb as before.It's hard to talk about the plot without revealing spoilers. Let's just say Scream 4 hits a turn in the story, that at the end could have been better. A few lines were cheesy and also a few scenes may produce unintended laughs, but in general it is a smart script.The whole Scream 4 story pays tribute to the other parts, specially to the first one. So if you did not watch Scream 1, 2 and 3, you may not understand the reason for many sequences. However you will still enjoy this horror movie in which laughs and gore find a very good mix.",Scream 4
469,SushiRolls,"If You Liked The Others, You'll Like Scream 4",5,2 May 2011,"Scream 4 - 7/10WARNING: While there are no spoilers to Scream 4 in this review, there are spoilers to the original three.Patience, as clichéd as the saying goes, is a virtue. And incidentally, the word patience has a lot to do with Scream 4. Firstly, fans of the original franchise had to wait 11 years for a follow up. But secondly and more important to the immediate viewer, Scream 4 requires a bit of patience to watch. Now, if you are a strong fan of the original trilogy, there is no need to fear; you have a 95% chance of liking this film. To the rest of you already an hour into the film having doubts: hang on, it gets better.Scream 4 begins ten years after the events of the original Scream, in the first film's setting of Woodsboro, California. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell, still looking young) is now apparently a successful writer with a new book on the way, Deputy Dewy (David Arquette) has become the Sheriff and his wife, Gale Weathers (an older, but looking better than she did in Scream 3 Courtney Cox) is retired from her days of tabloid journalism. But naturally, grisly murders begin to occur once again in the town of Woodsboro and one by one, good looking youngsters are prayed on and picked off in bloody fashion. If you think it has been done before, you're right. Scream 4, despite featuring a tag line exclaiming ""New Decade, New Rules"", is not all that 'new'. And yet, Scream 4 is still half a leap above the rest of the horror movie sludge that is now produced. For a four-quel, the fourth Scream is surprisingly strong and for sure an improvement over it's immediate predecessor. To a Scream fan like me, the film is pretty much what I had been expecting: a bloody, fun romp that doesn't outdo the original but does not disappoint. It's all there: self- aware meta humor, bloody killings, Ghost-face and his instantly recognizable voice, phone harassment; I could continue but, you, as the rabid Scream fan get the point.The cast, both old and new, works. The originals are still here: Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courtney Cox all do great jobs in there now tenured characters. Newcomers Emma Roberts (Sidney's cousin), Hayden Panettiere (Roberts' ditzy but lovable friend) and Nico Tortorella (Roberts' jock type ex-boyfriend) all do fairly well, too. Film geeks Robbie and Charlie (played by Erik Knudsen and Rory Culkin, respectively) don't quite live up to Jamie Kennedy's Randy from Scream and Scream 2, but they do well enough, and their inspiration is welcomed. There has been some mixed reviews of this film and nothing has split the reviewers more than the ending, which is the one big thing that differentiates Scream 4 from it's predecessors. I like the ending, though. And as far as the killer/killers goes/go, I can tell you that he/she/they does/do not match up to Billy and Stu from the original film. But other than that, he/she/they at least equal or even beats/beat Scream 2's combo of Mickey and Mrs. Loomis and Scream 3's director/killer Roman Bridger. The criticism in the ending comes from its so called 'over-extension'. Yet it was that 'over-extended' climax which stuck with me walking out of the theater the most (in a good way). Truth be told, the climax may be the only thing truly differentiating this Scream from the others, and for that it earns some major last minute points. Sitting in the theater, I felt myself concerned about an hour or so into the film, as I noticed this fourth installment start to go through the motions in a workmanlike manner. There were jump scares, and dark scary corridors sure, but apart from a psyche out opening, Scream 4 was becoming a 'just enough' affair. Yet it is the small spin on the standard 'Scream' ending that makes Scream the fourth better than just another slasher.Not to mention, as far as four-quels go in horror franchises, Scream 4 could be the best. It conquers horror fourth parters such as Friday the 13th Part 4: The Final Chapter, Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, Saw IV, Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, Psycho IV: The Beginning (Damn right there were sequels to Psycho, look them up), Leprechaun 4: In Space (No, that is not made up), Hellraiser IV: Bloodline, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation, The Bride of Chucky (The 4th installment in the Child's Play series), Land of the Dead (The fourth film in George Romero's Night of the Living Dead franchise), National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation and Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol. It's incredible that where most horror film franchises have completely given up, Scream 4 manages to stay...wait for it...one cut above the rest....anyone? Anyone?So, in these last 11 years that have been devoid of a new Scream film, was the public craving a Scream 4? Not to my knowledge. Did they really need to do another Scream? Eh. But they did it, and the result is a fun slasher that will only disappoint those expecting Scream 4 to be as good and as fresh as the first film. And Neve Campbell's character of Sidney puts it best in Scream 4 when she mutters words that should be obeyed by Hollywood executives everywhere: ""Don't f*** with the original.""",Scream 4

I know that many of the more mature reviewers would claim that it can't live up to the originals, but I am not a mature person I am only a teenager. I have seen the previous films. With out a doubt the first film is the best one. People seem to be reviewing this film as if were a remake. It is not, so it is not really comparable to the first three. This installment is not as scary as the first three, it has more fun in it. I didn't get many scary moments but my girlfriend did, she even screamed at the top of her lungs once. I like the way they added a modern twist to it by using the cameras. However they could have developed on that much more by incorporating the footage into the movie, of for it to be shown on the internet and people can actually see it all happening (the other characters)I am very happy that all of the survivors of the original films were in this one, but Sydney seemed to be pushed to the sidelines. The new characters were not developed enough. I still have it a 9 because even with its flaws I really enjoyed the movie. I would definitely recommend that you go and see it now.

The story takes place ten years later in the same town that it all began in. My main beef with the movie is the ending.. Sidnee beat the hell out of gostface thrughout the movie until it is revealed that ghostface is her 90 pound little cousin and a frail geek...at that point, the girl talks in circles completely ignoring every opportunity to finish sidnee for good. Oh and once again, officer dewey fails to figure anything out, spends 90% of the movie going the wrong direction in his police truck and gets pummeled at the end by a frail teenage girl. Another scene that bothered me is the scene in which Gail placed cmeras at the stab party. Gail is checking her surveillance when she notices someone intentionally covering her cameras. Even though she has been in this situation numerous times, she goes to check it out. Once inside, she loes all sense of awareness because she goes to the most secluded camera she placed first. She notices a webcam watcing her and checks it out (how dumb can you be) I thought she deserved t be stabbedat that point. But of course she survived, which brings me to another point: I did not care about any of the characters that were killed...I could go n but I don't wanna rant so ill just end it here.",Scream 4
472,Inferno76,Some Thoughts For Those Of You Who Have Already Seen It - *Contains Spoilers*,6,18 April 2011,"While Wes Craven has occasionally made some lousy movies throughout his career, you can certainly tell when he's inspired about a given project as well - as with the Scream series, which made me look forward to this installment.Scream 4 was a mixed bag for me. The opening was largely predictable in lieu of the first 3 films and one of the weakest in my opinion. I found myself just waiting for them to get it over with and start the actual movie.However the end of the film really rebounds with one of the strongest endings since the original - perhaps better in some ways, with a mix of nods to Warhol's 15 minutes of fame philosophy and the cultural folklore of snuff films as motivations behind the murder spree.The film seems to over emphasize the changes in technology since the last film. Cell phones and social media are a way of life these days, we get it, we're not cavemen discovering the wheel. I wish these were incorporated into the storyline more organically, because it came off as more of a desperate effort to re-assert the franchises relevancy to modern day culture.With all the talk about the series being re-booted, I went into this film with the expectation of at least some of the veterans being taken out in transition to a new cast. Strangely enough, every new character was knocked off. I almost felt like Hayden's character was being positioned to become the new Sydney.I wouldn't say the film effectively incorporates references to slashers into the storyline as much as it just simply name drops them throughout the course of the movie. I'm also surprised that all 4 of these movies haven't yet mentioned Return To Horror High, which arguably predated Scream in concept by nearly 10 years.I look forward to future installments of Scream and enjoy it's way of making us laugh, cautiously.",Scream 4
473,fragile-5,New Decade. New Rules. Fantastic Sequel,10,19 April 2011,"This is one of the cleverest, funniest, scariest horror films to come out since the original movie in 1996!This isn't a reboot, it is a direct sequel but with a very modern and current feel to it that makes it accessible to a new audience while also delighting the fans of the original.We have a fantastic returning cast of Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette and also the re-teaming of Craven and Williamson who made the originals (let's forget Scooby Doo Scream 3)! The new cast are fantastic- Hayden Panieteirre a stand out brilliant new addition as the wise-cracking movie geek Kirby.This film is full of all the things that made Scream great. It's incredibly post-modern (or 'meta' if you're going by the new post modern term for post modernism) referencing how sequels and reboots never quite live up to the original and how you can get so caught up with being clever that the final reveal can be incoherent. It also has a great comment on society- a world that has changed dramatically since the original movie. The critics who say this film is just another awful part 4 are not seeing the genius of Williamson's writing and have missed the point entirely. The way that Scream 4 is constructed is so smart- they subvert expectations but also satisfy and play with structure so you really don't know what's going to happen next.The killer/or ers reveal is masterly done- Craven throwing red herrings at the audience right from the get go, so when you do learn who has been donning the Ghostface mask and hacking and slashing there is a genuine gasp of surprise.What makes this film possibly the best sequel since the original is that where the first film benefited from the teens being aware of the classic slashers of the 70s and 80s, these teens are completely aware of the 'Stab' series and live in the same world that we do- we know who Ghostface is and so do they and the fact that they have become flippant about it just adds to the realism.I am a massive fan of the original and was very prepared to be disappointed with this instalment but I have to say I loved every minute- from the clever (and very funny) opening right until the end credits- this is a must see for anyone who enjoyed the original and just wants a roller-coaster ride of a film.Try and see it in the cinema with a packed audience - that's how these films should be seen and prepare to cheer at the end- cos it's a SCREAM BABY!",Scream 4
474,haku23,"Sidney Campbell returns to her hometown after 10 years for a book signing. And so does her killer. New game, new rules.",9,15 April 2011,"My ONLY problem with this movie was the ending. I thought of it afterward, of course. In the second AND third movies they emphasize the shot to the head as the best way to kill the killer, and I think that Sidney should have shot her cousin in the head instead of the chest, which seems to hardly ever prove to be fatal in the classic scream movies. Overall, a well done movie. Entertaining and thrilling, though still as predictable as the first. However, in some way, it manages to surpass ALL of it's predecessors. That being said, it'll be interesting to see what'll happen in the next two Screams, which Wes Craven has already said are going to happen whether he directs them or not. I just hope that instead of the near total suck factor of the original two sequels, they'll be able to make these two movies as thrilling as the managed to make Scream 4.",Scream 4

In fact, it was the exact opposite. Scream 4 was horrible. It wasn't even funny.it was just BAD. They overused the F word. it was so PREDICTABLE. and I think the only time I was really excited, was when the credits came on. Honestly, I don't see how this movie could have received six out of ten stars. It wasn't funny. And it def. wasn't scary. Waste of money and time. The actors were bad as well. They couldn't even do a decent job at acting. I was highly disappointed. This movie is horrible, don't even waste your time watching it.",Scream 4
476,clo1956,"Kept me scared throughout the movie, I was totally surprised.",10,16 April 2011,"This movie was done very well, I jumped many times and my whole body actually tingled in one scene. The way the movie turned out was so not expected, and it was done very well. I enjoyed seeing the original characters, and they included some other known actors which always helps make these types of movies seem more authentic to me. It's still set in Woodsboro and the high school students are still the main victims. The only thing I did not like about this movie is the constant use of a certain cuss word. It is okay maybe a few times in places, but who really needs to hear it that much. Anyway, I did love the movie. I will be hoping for a Scream 5. If they keep the same director and any living characters it should still be a movie worth seeing.",Scream 4
477,naterfour85,One of the best horror movies in the past 10 yrs,9,16 April 2011,"*****NO SPOILERS******I have been a die-hard fan of this series since it's release is '96. I was eleven, and it was the first rated ""R"" movie I rented at the local video store. 15 years and COUNTLESS horrible horror movies later, comes a movie that is comparable to the original. The movie knew what to, and what not to, shine a light on. It embodies everything the original had. Laughs that quickly turned to scares. A body count that piled up VERY QUICK. And true genuine suspense. There wasn't really any ""down"" time in the movie, in means of suspense (killings). From the moment they announced this fourth installment was being made, I knew I would be there opening day, first show. April 15, 2011, I was there at the first showing. I wasn't let down, in fact, I was actually impressed by how well the movie was put together....I agree with another viewers review, Krugher (?) and he tiny re-writes were noticeable but it was so minor you could overlook it without being bogged down by it. I'm going back to see it again tomorrow. I have and will continue to tell people I know, and people I don't know, to go see this movie. You'll Laugh, You'll Scream, You'll be guessing up until the very end, and by the time the credits roll, You'll be Impressed. -nater",Scream 4
478,goliath22,"Fun, but....lacking",5,18 April 2011,"Do not read this if you haven't already seen the film.I am a Scream fan by all means, I've been looking forward to this since it was confirmed. I made the mistake of knowing a little too much before watching it... but I honestly don't think it would have helped if i didn't know. Every other review talks about how referential and self- referential this film is... I don't think this could be emphasised enough. It was done to death.. (pun not intended).So the films opens up with a bunch of references and an incredibly obvious ghostface call. Two girls are taken out, but it turns out to be a film within a film. Several minutes later... same thing happens. This could be funny... but Jesus... TOO MUCH DECONSTRUCTION... to be fair it is fun to watch... but then... the actual opener happens. This is a goddamn Tatum Riley copy, down to the core. I don't like this. It's a sequel, not a remake. Intentional obviously... but I personally think this is a bad call. And the title card... I really don't think it should have been the same as the poster.So anyway... a fairly obvious play out from here.... totally lacking in the quality vibe of the initial aftermath of Scream 1 and 2's opener. Here we have a bunch of students all 'oh my god, it's all happening!' They are pretty much excited. They also pretty much all die. Which makes me wonder about a 'new generation for a new trilogy' - there aren't many survivors here?!There is one death scene that is quite intense, and heavily graphic... that was probably the strongest part of the film for me.To jump on towards the end.... Rory Culkin's Charlie is put in the EXACT position of Steve Orth. What happens? Hayden's character Kirby knows so much about horror films that she appears to save him, only for him to kill her. There was actually enough redirection in this film to make me wonder if he really was a killer.. but yeah, he is. Why? Because he wants to be the new Randy... except that he is really just the new Stu. Except not as amusing ('peer pressure, i'm far too sensitive' - gold). That's pretty much his only reason.The other killer...... my god Sidney's cousin is stupid. She has a cry about how Sidney was the centre of attention. As if Sidney wanted this. Sid might be all tough now (she was actually, that was fun to watch), but if she could go back in time, perhaps stop her mum from sleeping around... I think she would. Anyway... Won't go through the whole film.. but essentially... I felt it was lacking. Stuff happens... but really just another ghostface going around killing every new character there is. The calls are just too plainly placed. I don't think the 'Hello Sidney' calls from 1 and 2 can ever be topped off. 'Poor Billy boyfriend', 'I want you, it's showtime'... those calls were good. Everything here is just 'what's your favourite scary move?'I wanna give it a 6, but I think that'd be too generous. I'm a Scream fanatic.. but this just wasn't up to scratch. If there's a number 5.. I'll go see it, but they better have improved.",Scream 4

480,alberts_guitar,You think it should have remained a trilogy.... GUESS AGAIN!,8,2 November 2011,"Since the beginning, the Scream series has pushed the envelope in the Horror/Suspense genre(s). I thoroughly enjoyed the Trilogy, but when I heard the rumor of a 4th I didn't know what to think. As the release was postponed a few times, I realized that it is going to be worth watching. I was right. The main thing I praise Wes Craven for, is that the studios decided to make another sequel and not another damn remake, that leaves a sour taste in the mouths of many horror fans. Scream 4, or SCRE4M, is as clever as the first; dark, witty and gut-wrenching. Just like the others, the killer's revelation will leave you shocked. Here's to another trilogy for a well-loved franchise!",Scream 4
481,iSaAcD182,Scre4m Terrible Donation,5,20 June 2011,"The movie is far worse then the original obviously. The Movie had its fare share of sexy babes as these newer horrors do... most things are the same, The Voice, The actors, The ghost face outfit. The Movie starts off a bit confusing and slow but it picks up. Also what would a Wes Craven film be without the cheesy lines and comedy... I had to shake my head at the ""fk Bruce Willis line"" and yes my theater went dead silent :P and it confuses me how that guy got out of the car and walked 7 steps before he died after being stabbed through the head I don't know. As With all the scream movies there are no sex scenes... so its OK to watch around your parents, we all know how embarrassing it is when your watching a movie with your parents and a sex scene comes on :/ The kills are not over the top Rob Zombie style kills, All we see is intestines hanging out of a victim which isn't as bad as it sounds... As I mentioned earlier the movie is modern, so the film is full of phones, pods, and Mac computers, rather then a cruddy non wireless brick phone like in scream 1 - 3. The film lacks suspense and goes with the modern scare scenes instead... so its more seat jumping with the first 3. There are lots of stiff scenes in the movie... like at the end of the movie when the female killer (forgot her name) stabs Sidney once in the gut. Surely she cant think that's enough to kill someone!. Everyone walked out of the cinema a bit confused, Even though I had mixing thoughts about the movie I'm still glad I got to view it in the theater, Brilliant memory for the future seeing an original scream movie, before they start remaking them. 5.5/10",Scream 4

It adds as much suspense and humor as the other films. It is better than the third in my opinion, and is just as good as the first two. I promise you that you will love this movie and the ending will really surprise you. The characters were all very interesting, and a good amount of them where treated as if they could be the killer, which was great, because you don't you who it will be until the end. The character Sydney is still as powerful and brave as she was in the other films. It was a very good film with good acting. Highly recommended!",Scream 4
483,dallascowboy1-786-740969,Why I Hate Wes Craven & Scream 4,10,25 April 2011,"I'm jk everyone I don not hate this film, however for all the true scream fans maybe you will understand why I disliked who the killer's idintity was. To begin, In many articles Wes Craven had stated that their would be a new protagonist ""Jill"" sidneys cousin. Like in the trailer "" A new generation"" a fresh story about jill. Not to mention the false advertisement that Wes Craven added to his trailers that was not seen in theaters. Remember ""Go ahead if you have the guts?""? I bet you don't remember that line in th movie. Unfortunately Gale didn't die and Jill and Charlie were the actual killers. Meaning Sidneys story will still continue for Scream 5 and 6. I believe Sidneys story was successfully done and told in the trilogy, this move should have been about Jill and her new friends but it wasn't. So much for the new generation who all ended up dieing.

SCRE4M was.. how to put it.. was a MIND-BLOWING ride. From the famous opening sequence of the movie, you kinda guess that this isn't your average Scream movie that we all knew. The storyline went along perfectly, filled with MANY plot twists and turns, especially towards the ending when the viewer reached the climax of the movie.. that was one hell of a twist right there. Moreover, I liked how this movie was gushing with blood wherever you looked and the deaths WERE extreme. The acting from the new cast was far more than superb especially Emma Roberts who gave an excellent performance right in the movie. I've never enjoyed a Scream more than I enjoyed this one. Go watch it. It surpasses the original... Sorry Sid.",Scream 4
487,willrogers2000,"In 2011, we deserve better than Scream 4",6,15 April 2011,"I can't believe just how bad this movie turned out to be, but more than that, I can't believe all the appropriately negative reviews I'm seeing that are missing the reason why this movie fails. Forget all the claims of ""the series is starting to show it's age."" If that's true, it's only because the writer can't seem to get his crap together. At it's core, this series is about a masked killer with a knife. He's watching you, and no one knows who he is. Evidence suggest it's someone you know. That should be able to work. It worked in the first two (mostly). Here's a good reason to give for why this movie sucks: No one in this movie cares. About anything. Not each other and not the circumstances they find themselves in. I can buy that this series is set in a world where everyone is obsessed with horror movies, that's fine with me. But I can't understand why it is that in a group of friends, when one person gets murdered, the others go to a party just after they're done screaming. I should say, though, that I'm being a bit unfair to Neve Campbell (Sidney), Courtney Cox (Gail), and David Arquette (Dewey), whose characters remain fairly consistent with the earlier movies. You do get the idea that these characters truly exist for one another. When one of them is in trouble, the other two come running. The supplemental (they never really take hold) cast, however, are the worst example of expendable 2D nameless victims as I've ever seen. They're all young and pretty (with the exception of Raury Culkin... What's up with his eyelids and lips?), but they're all too clever for their own good and lack charisma. It's a goofy thing to say, but it's true. They're not interesting or captivating! There are only two new characters in the whole movie (which is PACKED with new faces), who come across as reasonable and interesting in any way, and they aren't given enough to do. The film is also suffering horribly from what used to be the series' defining factor: it's wit. All of a sudden, every damn character that walks onto the screen has some quip to make about horror movie clichés. It's no longer clever to make fun of yourself if that's ALL you do. Too much is too much! And not only that, but we're subjected again to the movie-within-a-movie Stab, which was once used by the film makers to show why they're good at making horror movies. In the Stab series, characters are attractive and dull and the writing is unrealistic and goofy. Scream 4 suffers from every stupid b-movie hiccups that the Stab movie wanted to point out as being a mistake. So here we have a ""real world"" horror movie where, for some reason, characters are quipping as they're bleeding out. Far too many characters have a quick little insult or joke they'd like Ghostface to hear just before they die. It's gruesome to watch, especially one absolutely cringe-worthy moment about midway through the film where a boring character whose hardly been used dies from what might be a physically impossible stab, but not before blurting out a great little reminder of a previous joke. Barf. The wit of the series is gone, replaced with characters who faint with perfect comic timing, and who just won't shut the hell up. Everyone is a horror movie expert, and everyone knows all about Sidney, Dewey, and Gail. There's no mystery here. People are dying on screen, but they don't seem to mind, and possibly worse, the world around them doesn't seem to either. So why should I? I got lost in the plot. I've been a very dorky fan of the series for years, watching Scream 3 without hesitation (if you know the series at all, you know how significant that is). I don't watch these movies to watch people die in funny clever ways. The humor isn't supposed to be at the fore front, it's not meant to intrude on the human life-or-death situations these kids find themselves in. It's meant to be human and natural, establishing who these people are and why I should care. For these reasons, the reveal to the whodunit falls flat. I will say, though, that moments after falling flat, it blows up into one of the most embarrassingly overacted sequences I've seen of any movie. I read a lot of reviewers talking about how the ending to the movie is very modern. They're right, to be sure, but modern doesn't mean clever or creative. I do think there's some merit to the general idea, but ultimately, it comes across as corny and contrived. I'm a big fan of this series, and if you are as well, then I say without hesitation go see it, but if you're just in the mood for a good movie, you won't find it in Scream 4. You deserve better.TL;DR Scream 4 sucks. Don't see it unless you want to spend the following hour picking apart how the mistakes could have been avoided",Scream 4
488,pink_girl120,New to the franchise,8,16 April 2011,"My friend and I were late to the screening we went for and so we ended up seeing this one instead. As someone who had not seen the previous films I went in having no idea what to expect. I had a vague idea of the story, was familiar with the (usually overdone) slasher genre but that was it. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting to jump out of my seat ever two or three scenes but let's just say you know what's coming when it's coming. It wasn't half as gore as I thought it would be either. The beginning of the movie is fun and surprising and sets the tone for the rest of the film. I was afraid the young cast would kill the movie and get on my nerves but they handled everything pretty well and the only one I really couldn't stand was just the female cop. The movie avoids most horror clichés in a way that'll make you smile. I expect I would have loved Scream 4 even more if I had seen the first ones, but it is definitely great either way. I recommend it to anyone who's looking for thrills and laughs. This movie will bring you both.",Scream 4

Don't go into the cinema with high expectation or you will be disappointed! As far as Scream films go, this is def not the worst out the bunch, Although Mr Craven has tried to bring the franchise back to the original way (Killer, death, twist)...you couldn't help but wish for something different in this movie..Lets all wait for Scream 5 in 3D effects to make a difference....NOT!",Scream 4

I was SO wrong! This movie has regenerated the slasher horror genre in my opinion, the plot is superb, the actors are fantastic and Wes Craven doesn't hold any barriers with the script. The twist at the end is most definitely not predictable.Neve is fantastic... looking brilliant all the way through she portrays Sidney just as well - if not better.David plays the Dewey once again reprising the geeky character.Cortney is back as Gale... What can I say... Gale is back on top form with her classic bitchy one liners that do not fail to make the audience laugh.The opening sequence is fantastic contains lots of gore! Scram fans are in for a treat. The film isn't only for old fans, the script is clever and generates a new audience.I was disappointed to find out the film was rated 15 in the UK.... however my doubts about there being not enough killing scenes and gore was proved wrong....I have to admit that after the opening sequence it does take a while to get into the nitty gritty scenes, however the tension and story is built up superbly and once the ghost face appears in Woodsboro... its all go from there...The whole cinema laughed from start to end and there are enough scares and shocks in the film to keep you on the edge of your seat....if you haven't yet seen SCRE4M.... get to the cinema before its released!",Scream 4

With a rumoured 3 more scream movies on the way I feel Wes Craven really knows where he is going with this movie series and is in complete control. The basic premise of the film is that Sidney Cambell (from the original 3) returns to her home town after touring the country to publicise her new book. Only problem is Ghostface is back to terrorise the towns folk once more. A running theme in the Scream series is the self awareness of horror movie clichés. This movie is no different and cleverly uses it to create humour and surprises. Throughout the most part of the movie the atmospheric shots and music score definitely created a classic horror movie feel to Scre4am making it scary and enjoyable to watch All in all I felt Wes craven did a great job on this movie and it really has given a new lease of life into the slasher genre.",Scream 4

Even thought the ""real"" opening kill, and ending were kind of underwhelming, the film really picks up right after the Scream 4 credit. When we see Sidney step out of the car, it's such an epic moment that I just sat in ""awe"". The film was quick, clever, and for the majority, tense. However, I think that the over the top comedy was an overkill. I was alright with most of the jokes, and even some of the comedic hitting and punching, but when Perkins gets stabbed in the head, it was literally insulting. I had to look away. The ending wasn't anything spectacular, but it was entertaining, and the reveal was shocking; for me anyway. I was thinking the whole time, ""No way Jill is the killer.."" but I was proved wrong. One thing I did, that I won't do if there is a Scream 5, is watch the leaked clips and things like that. It kind of ruined some great moments in Scream 4, and I found myself quoting the movie on my first viewing, literally.Also, even though it was a very good movie, it just didn't feel like a ""scream"" movie. It didn't have that 90's touch I was hoping Kevin/Ehren somehow laced in the holes of this modern horror film. I give this film an 8/10.",Scream 4
495,afnant,"I was totally pumped to watch it, but felt a bit disappointed afterwards",7,22 April 2011,"OK, so i'm a huge fan of the scream series i absolutely love it, especially the first one which i thought was pure genius. Even though the 2nd and 3rd did not live up to the first one in my opinion, they were still extremely entertaining, and thats what counts right? So when i looked at scream 4 on IMDb i saw it had 7.6 rating, and i thought to myself thats pretty awesome for a slasher movie. So i get my buddies and we all go to watch this film, it starts off pretty well and it wasn't boring but really, it did not end up being what i expected.I honestly thought Wes craven was going to do something amazing that was as good or even better than the first one, but this was probably the worst one so far. Even with the original cast this did not really feel like a scream movie. The part that really bothered me was that the pace of the movie felt really fast compared to the others. Like in the others there are so many different places they go so many twists and turns. Like by the time it got to the part where you find out who the killer is, i was like...is it really time already? It didn't even feel like that much happened. And i'm obviously not going to tell you the ending, but what i can say is this was the least creative reasoning for the killings and it honestly made no sense. There was a fair amount of comedy and i guess it was like thrilling at times but not as much as the other ones. And there were a lot on new characters that were not developed properly and even the characters from the other movies that survived had very toned down parts... They didn't seem very important like they did in the other movies, especially Sidney, and that was probably the worst thing for me. I want to give this movie a 6/10 but hey i'm a big scream fan so i give i 7 anyways.

497,mtrevino619,What a rebirth of Scream!!!,10,17 April 2011,"Now after reading the reviews on here and on other various websites about this film, I was getting a little skeptical about going to go see this movie. Adding that the box office numbers aren't looking too good either really had me worried. I honestly thought that I wouldn't enjoy it. Well guess what.......I was wrong. I am a HUGE fan of the original Scream. Just the simple concept of the movie is pure genius. So when I heard that Wes and the original crew were back to make this film, I knew I had to see it. I even remember Wes Craven saying that he would not direct this film unless the script was as good as the original. So this REALLY had me pumped up to see it. I can honestly say that this is the most entertaining movie I've seen since Black Swan. PROS: 1. The plot is very well thought-out and executed.2. The murders are more gruesome than all of the other screams.3. Some parts of this were really funny. 4. The intro to this Scream movie is right up there with the original Scream in 1996. It is that good folks. And while others are saying the ending is too long, I beg to differ. Scream is about finding out who the killer is and that's just what this ending is about. Yes there are A lot of twist and turns on who the killer is but that is what makes this movie so freaking great.5. There are A lot of stars in this one and most of them deliver some outstanding performances. Emma Roberts, Rory Culkin, Hayden Panettiere, Anthony Anderson, Alison Brie, and the original 3 are the standouts in this movie with AMAZING performances especially from the first two names.CONS: 1. This is a FAST paced movie meaning the scenes are going by so fast that sometimes you get lost. Being a sequel and having to introduce new characters AND re-introduce the old characters means there are a lot of scenes that need to be in the movie for it to make sense. So I understand, just which some scenes were added to slow the pace down at times.2. At times the dialogue is too dramatic and not *real life* talk. 3. The soundtrack is not as good as the previous screams lol4. Too many sub-plots involving the original 3 characters. I would have loved to see the new kids have a bigger storyline than being overshadowed by the big 3.5. No sex scene.Overall, this is a fantastic movie once again being overshadowed by a cartoon, just like the original. For true movie fans, this is one hell of a movie and Wes Craven, I cannot wait for Scream 5! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",Scream 4
498,hpredwood,I REALLY wanted to love this film...,7,25 April 2011,"SPOILERS: As a die-hard fan of the Scream franchise, I couldn't wait to see what Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven had in store for the fourth installment. But after watching, the film left me disappointed in a quite a few areas. Although the Scream films have always been a semi-parody of themselves and of all horror films, the first three also managed to be ""real"" in their own world (i.e. the characters are not only upset when people die, they also actually fear for their own lives). A few of the death scenes in this film seem like they're coming straight out of a ""Scary Movie"" sequel (particularly the character played by Anthony Anderson, who ironically starred in Scary Movie 3 and 4). And when people start to die in this film, no one seems particularly upset about it. If they aren't upset, why should we be?Also, the ""whodunnit"" aspect of all the other Scream films seems to be mostly absent in this installment. Gale halfway attempts an investigation but it quickly goes nowhere, and most of the film seems to be either teenagers sitting around waiting to be killed, or teenagers actually being killed. The reveal of the killer is pretty shocking, but it's mostly shocking because we haven't seen anyone really trying to find out who the killer is at any point in the movie, and the characters haven't been developed enough for anyone to gain many clues either way. Dewey pretty much just hops around from one crime scene to the next and, until the last five minutes, is pretty useless (as is Gale). The film sort of taints the closure that we received in Scream 3: Sidney has finally been set free from her demons and can move on (and even Randy's video message in Scream 3 states that this was a trilogy, not just the second of an endless number of sequels). Although this film is much more respectful to its predecessors than, say, Halloween Resurrection (which essentially takes the finality of H20 and pisses all over it), I found myself wondering, when will it end for this group (now that we know the characters survive)? Can they really handle any more sequels (or more importantly, can we)?Having said that, there were some very positive aspects to the film. The opening scene was quite clever (although by the time you get to the ""real"" scene, the characters are so paper thin that you're pretty much rooting for the killer to just do his thing already). I also really enjoyed the idea behind the killer's motives, and what it says about modern day fame. All in all, it's a fun ride; and, of course, Sidney's ""Gotcha, suckas!"" line at the end (pardon the Bowfinger reference) is epic.I suppose no sequel will live up to the suspense and originality of the first film, but this is definitely worth watching.",Scream 4
499,Niek_verbiest,World Premiere,8,12 April 2011,"If you liked the first 3 movies you will like this one too. It has the same feel as the other Scream movies, but i don't want to spoil any story so i won't say anything about that.I am a fan of the scream movies but not a HUGE fan that is why i would rate it an 8. Story wise (like every horror movie) it could sometimes be a bit better, but I found this story better then the typical horror movie. The kills were more realistic and the gore levels were appropriate in the scenes in my opinion.If your a fan of horror movies i would really recommend it though. And if your a fan of Scream movies go see it!",Scream 4
500,klotzzach,A Great 4th Installment to the Franchise of Fear!,10,15 April 2011,"I loved this movie from the very first ring of the telephone. The opening kill(s) were hilariously brutal and completely shocking. The movie then rolls out slowly to develop the characters, that we already know, once again and to introduce the new generation. The new generation is full of acting talent up to par with the original cast. This movies killings were more brutal and bloody then any other ""SCREAM"" and this movie sure brought the fun. The ending was a complete surprise and I loved every single second of the insanity!! Overall this movie was a well-scripted, well-acted (especially by Emma Roberts, who I thought was way too talentedly convincing and Hayden Panetierre.) This movie is sure to make a great box office number and I'm hoping we get another trilogy we've been waiting for!!",Scream 4

None of that gore porn from the Saw and Hostel type movies. I watched Scream 4 last night and in my opinion this movie was equally good if not better then the first Scream. Suspenseful, gory and hilarious! It definitely made up for the train wreck that was Scream 3. Throughout the movie the entire full packed cinema was screaming, laughing and at the end everyone was applauding. I need to go back to the cinema and watch this again! It most definitely exceeded my expectations. If you are a horror fan then movie will not disappoint you. I would recommend it to all. I rate SCRE4M 10/10.",Scream 4
502,liddleperson101,May Contain Minor Spoilers!!!,9,16 April 2011,"I feel as though audiences are so contradictory when it comes to film. When there is too much story, you want more action. When there is too much action, you want more story. Make up your mind, people. I feel as though Craven, Williamson, Kruger, and Weinstein all are geniuses at their craft - they know exactly what they're doing. The film may not be perfect, but you have to think about today's generation - teenagers aren't the same as they were back in '96 with Billy and Stu. So, the entire film makes perfect sense to me. ""New Decade. New Rules."" Teenagers today are murdering one another in the streets for bullshit reasons everyday, so to expect there to be a perfect motive or to expect there to be more hang-time is silly, to me. The killer(s) is/are intense and straight to the point. No time for games, no time to waste. Overall, I plan to see ""SCRE4M"" several more times before it leaves theaters. **SIDENOTE** I cannot wait to see the Director's Cut DVD, and there'd better be one, because half of the scenes in the trailer aren't even in the movie. And many were re-shot, like when Gale says, ""It's all over the internet"", it was way different in the movie. And what the hell happened to ""Go ahead, if you have the guts.""?! I love that line. ):",Scream 4
503,euanconley,Reboot? Remake? Sequel? All of the above!,8,16 April 2011,"- - - - - - - - - - - - - - NO SPOILERS - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Simply unbelievable. I went in with mixed expectations. I wasn't sure if this film was going to be a complete cash-in on the previous titles and thus tragically flawed, or whether it was going to be a worthy sequel and one of the more decent horror movies of recent years. Fortunately, it leant more to the latter than the former.The plot is simple: 10 years have passed since the original and not much has changed for our original 3. Dewey and Gale, now married, are stuck in a rut. Deputy Dewey has now become Sheriff Dewey and Gale's career as a writer and reporter has all but dried up. Sidney has taken her traumatic experiences and forged herself as a successful career as a self-help author, much to Gail's chagrin.We are also introduced to an array of newcomers, Sid's distant cousin Jill Prescott (excellently portrayed by Emma Roberts) and her friends including the sassy, streetwise Kirby (Panettiere), athletic bombshell Olivia (Jaffe), film geeks Robbie and Charlie (played by Erik Knudsen and Rory Culkin respectively) and Trevor (Tortorella), Jill's shady ex-boyfriend. Also new to the Scream fold is Marley Shelton as the awestruck deputy of Dewey.The best parts of this film are the beginning and end, though that is not to write off the bulk of the middle. The beginning is achingly fresh and manages to have you laughing and afraid almost in tandem. The end is completely jaw-dropping. The reveal is absolutely perfect and the events that unfold bring back the kind of raw emotional intensity that made us fall for the first movie. The film as a whole is very slick, and loaded with excellent dialogue. These new teenagers are even more self-aware than Sidney's gang in the first Scream. They're aware how tired the horror genre has become with clever references to the Ring and Saw, and are also acutely aware of the magnitude of the events that surround them but not entirely appreciative of it (a party in the midst of a murder spree? Why are their parents letting them attend this kind of event?). The characterisation is hit-and-miss. Little is needed to flesh out Sid, Gail and Dewey but the new characters require a lot more work. Panettiere gives a fantastic turn as Kirby, contrasting her gritty tenacity with a sad vulnerability. Marley Shelton is memorable as Deputy Hicks, an old classmate of Sidney's and their brief exchange is both touching and hilariously creepy. However, in terms of character development, the star turn here is undoubtedly Emma Roberts who gives a career-defining performance as Jill. Her acting skills are simply superb and she adds subtle layers of depth to her character. Other characters like Robbie and Trevor feel underused and underdeveloped, and their character's backstories are never fully explored.The film's ending is nothing short of a masterpiece. The reveal is the biggest surprise in the entire franchise and the subsequent events revitalise the entire concept of Scream. The only wonder is how this film will be followed, as it's a tough act to beat.",Scream 4
504,westfalls_2000,Scream 4 = AMAZING!!!!,10,16 April 2011,"I just got back from watching it on the premiere night and it was everything i expected and more. Funny and scary throughout the entire film, amazingly witty and an all around joy ride. I recommend this to any scream fan or anyone who loves a good slasher film. I promise if you watch this film, you will NOT regret it. Im gonna go back and watch it again soon. I was afraid at first that the new cast would overshadow the returning cast but they blended so well together. I was so blown away at the end, and I can guarantee that you will be too. Go and watch this film, it really is AMAZING. Well done Wes, you have done it again, you are truly one of the GREAT Horror movie MASTERS!!!!",Scream 4

Mary Shelton provided an excellent performance as well. The opening sequence was shorter than i expected. The trailer contained scenes not present in the film but those scenes will make their debut when it comes out to DVD.The movie was exhilarating. The ending seemed slow at first but it makes up for a spine-tingling finale. The only thing i had a problem with is the characters. I think their was a small amount of development for some characters and this definitely was gory than the rest.What are you all doing still reading, get up and go see it, you'll dieto see it more than once",Scream 4
506,cfarrokhy,SCREAM 4 Better Than SCREAM 3,4,17 April 2011,"SCREAM 4 starts out in lackluster fashion... or so we are meant to think. All the same elements from the first film's are there, which plays out as cliché now. But then it pulls the rug out from under us. What seems like a serious, albeit lazy, attempt from director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson turns into a parody of itself. It's not our film's opening sequence. It's STAB 6's opening sequence. It turns out two young women are watching STAB 6, complaining about it's staleness. Then, in a fresh turn of events, then reviles itself as STAB 7. The filmmakers set the tone with self- parody and witty conversations. Quick and cleaver. Totally appropriate and very much expected from Craven and Williamson.Then things get sloppy. The following scenes don't seem to abide by any type of structure. They have a death in a house, then in another house, then in a squad car. And although we are told the Ghostface Killer is recreating the events of the first STAB movie, all we are shown is random killings of various young girls. It doesn't seem to happen to anyone of any significance. Especially since we are talking about a fictional movie no one has ever seen.The end takes too long to get to the point, and then it keeps going to the point the characters are laughing at the story's reluctance to end. Had it gave us a plausible or somewhat believable conclusion it would've been worth it, but it ends up being better sold on it's interesting characters and their mostly cleaver dialog, but not on the ""whodunit"" aspect.",Scream 4
507,mattismii,Scre4m = A good time,10,17 April 2011,"Scream 4 was next in the franchise as we all know. The opening sequence was funny and somewhat brutal. This movie was like a roller-coaster ride it had many twists and turns. The acting was spot on and totally believable. I like the Scream franchise because its not like Friday The 13th or A Nightmare On Elm Street. Once the killer is killed in this they are done! It is more realistic because the killer is different people every time and this time the killer(s) were very VERY shocking. I say if You are looking for a good slasher film you should go see Scre4m. I loved this movie because of its comedic dialog, witty comedy, and violence. It is a comedy but a horror film at the same time. See Scream 4 and be prepared to be shocked and be prepared to SCREAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Scream 4
508,fayefaye_luv_hiei,"Good, but somewhat disappointing",7,17 April 2011,"I'll start off by saying that I am a BIG SCREAM fan. I love all three films so much that the series became my favorite horror franchise. I've been waiting for this film since late last year, when the internet kindly provided me with the news of it's impending release. I was so excited that I saw it at the first showing in my little Georgia town, which was at 10 AM the first day it was released. I was squealing in my seat from pure joy and anticipation upon seeing the opening title, but I left the theater sort of...disappointed.As you know from the summaries many others have given on here, Sidney Prescott returns to Woodsboro for a book signing she's going to give on the anniversary of the first Woodsboro killings while she stays with her aunt (her mother's sister) and her cousin. Of course, Ghostface gives Sidney a warm welcome by slaughtering two teenagers the night she arrives home, and the bodies continue to pile up as Sidney, Gale and Sheriff Dewey try to catch Ghostface. Naturally, the town's teenagers, led by the two Randy-like movie geeks, ignore the familiar-looking deaths and throw a STAB movie-marathon party. But since this is a new decade, thus new rules, it's really the after-party that gets things going...Now don't get me wrong, THIS MOVIE IS NOT A BAD FILM. Alone, this makes a very decent slasher and a good tongue-in-cheek parody. But for some reason, I feel it doesn't fit in with the other three SCREAM films. I can't understand why so many people hate SCREAM 3 on here, when I thought that while the killer's identity was a cliché, it worked perfectly with the story. Right now, I don't get why so many hardcore SCREAM fans are giving SCRE4M 9 and 10 star ratings. Yeah, it deserves a good rating, but not that high! Like I said before, SCRE4M is a good movie. The story is decent, Wes' directing is good, Ghostface's phone calls and threats are still creepy, and the beginning of the movie (which makes fun of the seemingly-endless SAW franchise) is funny before it turns scary. There's also some good jokes throughout the film, and I really liked the way they incorporated new technology to fit in the story, such as webcams and new cell phones. The ending is also pretty well done, although I felt it dragged on just a tiny bit. Still, there's something that doesn't feel quite right...ARE YOU READY FOR SOME SERIOUS SPOILERS? IF NOT, SKIP THIS.My biggest issue with this movie is with the killer's identities. Yes, there's 2, just like SCREAM and SCREAM 2. Why? Because SCRE4M is making fun of remakes by imitating SCREAM! Which is a-okay by me, since that's almost all we get nowadays (not that I have anything against them in general) and it IS pretty funny that remakes are dissed throughout the film. But the fact that they decided to make one of the killers another relative of Sidney's, a la SCREAM 3 and made her the ""Billy"" of the duo, made me roll my eyes. But okay, it's acceptable and it still works, so let's move on. The other killer is one of the two movie geeks, who fills the ""Stu"" role. Also acceptable. Maybe it seems silly, but the reason I don't like them is because of their reasons behind further tormenting Sidney through various murders of those she knows. In SCREAM, Billy wanted revenge against Sidney and her mother for breaking apart his family (and he felt that Sidney was ""like mother, like daughter""), and Stu, aside from just being insane, was there as backup in case Billy got caught. In SCREAM 2, Mrs. Loomis wanted revenge for Sidney killing her only son, and Mickey wanted to be the star in a trial blaming horror films for his actions while fitting the ""Stu"" role. And in SCREAM 3, Roman wanted revenge against Sidney (and her mother) for taking away his potential family and felt that Sidney didn't deserve her fame. All of those sort of make sense as a crazy person's reasons for killing Sidney and her friends. SCRE4M's killer's motives aren't for revenge AT ALL. Sid's relative only wanted to be rich and famous for surviving the horrific ordeals of her friends being slaughtered, just like Sidney, so she wouldn't have to go to college, work, etc., and the film geek only tagged along so he could get laid because the girl he liked for four years never made a move on him until earlier that night....(sarcasm) What a great twist! (/sarcasm) Really, Wes? Fame and sex? That's it? Not ""You ruined my life!"" or even ""You should've died in the first ""STAB"" so I'm here to finish the job!""? Boy, was I surprised. And rather peeved. Here's a great psycho/revenge-esque motif that goes on through the series, and BAM!, it's gone, replaced by a fame-seeking attention whore. Thanks for the thrills, Wes, but I'm afraid SCRE4M doesn't deserve a place on my DVD rack. As Sidney puts it, ""don't f*ck with the original."" Now, I appreciated the ""new"" twist for being new and unexpected, but it doesn't mean I have to like it. Overall, though, it's still a fun film, and I would recommend that SCREAM fans see it. I'm just advising you to wait until it hits your local dollar theater. But just like everyone else, my word ain't gospel or nothing', so you can make up your own mind about seeing it whenever or however you want.",Scream 4

I am a big fan of the Scream series and this movie is by far the best movie out of them all. If you are someone who did not really like the first three movies, you will definitely like this one guaranteed so at least give it a chance. The plot and characters are developed way more than the other movies, making you connect more with the characters and making the movie more enjoyable. There are also plenty of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. Also, the incorporation of the old characters with the new ones is brilliant.

510,mvillarin,Scream 4 Movie Review,8,17 April 2011,"Successfully reboots the self-aware franchise, but is that due to having almost ten years to think it up? Welcome back to Woodsboro on the anniversary of the real-life murders that inspired the Stab movie series! Just back into town is Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) with a new book about rising above being a victim, but faster than you can ask ""What's your favorite scary movie?"" a new murderer wearing the infamous ""Ghostface"" mask begins killing his way through the high school population. Dewey Riley (David Arquette) is now the sheriff charged with solving the new case while his wife of ten years, Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), sees it as an opportunity to write a new book herself. What does this new Ghostface want and how many bodies will it take to achieve it? The creators of the original Scream trilogy have been busy. Director Wes Craven recently released the interestingly conceptualized but poorly executed My Soul to Keep while writer Kevin Williamson has been cranking out ""The Vampire Diaries"" for the CW network. Whether it was the collaboration, the time between films, or just the seed of the right idea, Scream 4 does what Scream 3 failed to do: further the franchise while keeping it fresh (like any good horror sequel should.) The killings are brutal, the body count significant, and the resolution satisfying. The opening scene is fun for fans while a bit bizarre for newcomers, but the ending does stretch on for a bit playing up to fans old and (hopefully) new. Too bad the new victims weren't as interesting as the familiar returning characters, but someone has to die, right? Speaking of the new kids, Hayden Panettiere (fresh off of ""Heroes"") easily stands out from the group with a butch look and loads of confidence that make her seem unlikely to be a victim (and being a closet horror fan never hurts.) Many characters (including Mary McDonnell) barely have any screen time at all; some appear just long enough to say ""I know Sydney Prescott!"" just before suffering a horrible death. Fortunately, the central themes stem from a society obsessed with their fifteen minutes of fame in the YouTube generation, celebrities who've had fame grabbing for it again, or claiming fame by riding the coattails of others. Could the narcissism inherit to the acting community in a film full of fame-seeking characters be yet another intended level of meta (""a concept which is an abstraction from another concept,"" for anyone about to look it up.) Scream 4 accomplishes everything a sequel is supposed to as well as everything a reboot is supposed to, far better than, say, the Superman Returns reboot. Part of that credit must goes toward the fact that good horror films from the mainstream studios are getting to be scarce. Whether Ghostface (along with any of the film's survivors) will return is, as always, in the hands of viewers willing to pony up for tickets. If not, however, this is certainly a better conclusion than where the previous installment left off.",Scream 4

I mean 2 killers again? and i seen one of the killers a mile away,Jill was the exception.She did well but i thought roman in scream 3 had a better twist than Jill Sidney cousin being the killer here.My big gripe about this film is letting the original 3 from scream all survive again,I thought at least gale should have died,and stabbed more than once,waited 11 years, i was waiting for something huge like that 2 happen just never did.but 8 out of 10,could been 9 out of 10 if one of the main cast was killed.I guess the twist at the end of 3,not scream 3 the movie itself is the best twist of them all because remember roman was the one who started it all.",Scream 4

As a die-hard horror fan, I felt as if this movie was insulting my intelligence. I knew after the opening movie-within-a-movie scenes that this would be a terrible waste of time, yet I stayed and watched the entire thing. The acting was terrible, the characters were hard to connect with, and the deaths were subpar. Not to mention the fact that the returning cast members looked like hell. David Arquette looked like he's been partying since Scream 3 wrapped, Neve Campbell looked...bloated, and Courtney Cox looked like she hasn't seen food in years. It was nearly impossible to reconnect to them and feel any emotion whatsoever. It's almost like Wes just got sick of being asked to makes this movie and he made this sucky on purpose so nobody would ever ask him to make another. I fully expected him to show up at the end and laugh that he had just taken $16 from me along with 2 hours of my life. He should have taken his own advice and not ""f*ck(ed) with the original"".

Hayden was the only younger generation who could act (and it's killing me to say that - she's annoying).The only good part was the beginning (and line about Jeffrey Dahmer). You know how to tell when a director made a bad movie? When you need to blast the music full volume to make up for a lack of plot or suspense.

517,Heather6277,I wanted it to be as good as the original,1,20 April 2011,"Sce4mAs a huge fan of the 'Scream' franchise I wanted this movie to be just as good as the original trilogy but it really wasn't. The movie lacked the togetherness of the other films. The characters were all split up and frankly completely unoriginal and uninteresting making it hard audience to connect to them and ultimately not caring who lived and died and that included Sydney. There was zero character development through the whole film so you felt exactly the same about the characters when the end credits rolled as you did when they first appeared on screen.Now if you're a fan of the original 'Scream' you know that it had just the right balance of comedy and horror. 'Scre4m' however felt more like another ridiculously stupid 'Scary Movie' with desperate, awful actors trying to be funny and failing. Everyone seems to be praising 'Scre4m' for using new up and coming actors but the great thing about the older Scream movies were that they used practically unknown actors and when they used well known ones they killed them off (exception being Patrick Dempsey but don't tell me you didn't think he was dead first time you watched Scream 3).Now I don't know about anyone else but did you find Ghostface scary, because I thought he was comical. The phone conversations just didn't have the fear factor and originality of the previous films and that really disappointed me because my favourite scene in 'Scream 2' was when Ghostface and Randy were on the phone there was a menacing nature to the humour. When it was finally revealed that Sydney's niece (I can't remember her name even though I only watched it four days ago. How many characters can you name not including the originals without looking it up?) was the killer it was a great twist but was completely ruined by the fact that her motive was completely pathetic. She wanted fame like seriously what does Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson think about the youth of today? She put me in mind of a Justin Beiber fan on homicidal rampage (yes I know that is kind of scary) I was waiting on her saying 'I'm killing you so that Justin will know me'.I really thought that there was too much emphasis on technology and the amount of product placement was really distracting. The teens were going on about how the next big thing was the killer needed to be filming the murders. 'Scream 2' anyone? It's already been done who cares if the killers streaming live which to be fair has been in hundreds horror movies in the past 3 years so it's been done this again showing the complete lack of originality of 'Scre4m'. Now saying all that there were things that did in fact make 'Scre4m' semi watchable. I like everyone else had no clue who the killer was in 'Scre4m'. I personally thought it was Trevor and/or the blonde cop. I also liked when during the 'Stabathon' when the teens were watching the first 'Stab' movie and they were saying the words at the same time as the characters because how many time have you sat in a room with friends or family watching 'Scream' doing exactly the same thing I know I do it every time I watch it. I also liked Trevor even though I thought he was the killer. The scene when he walked in on Kerby and Charlie was hilarious. So overall I hated 'Scre4m' for it's complete lack of originality and it's overemphasis on comedy rather than horror. On another note did anyone else think the music completely sucked?",Scream 4
518,skynet8722,mmmm where do i start,3,20 April 2011,"after being entertained by scream 1 even tho it was pretty awful i decided to give scream one more chance after the truly dreadful scream 2 and 3. when the film started i was confused as i thought i was watching a terrible episode of the hills. with the typically annoying plastic chiselled jaw actors that America seems to persist on giving these roles. why these horror films have to always start with dreadful actors who always seem to play high school teens who drink and smoke weed. horror genre is dead in fact there have been very few good horror films at all. the classics like the shining, the thing and Rosemary's baby etc seem along time ago. please please Wes craven stop making terrible movies. if you actually like this film you obviously don't understand what a good film is. AVOID THIS FILM a generous 3 out of 10",Scream 4
519,amber-vanderslice,Terrible Movie,1,20 April 2011,"I was in high school when the original Scream debuted and it was excellent. The original had character development, gripping plot, believable storyline and the gore and language were not over-the-top...This sequel, however, is not worth even a ZERO on a scale of 1-10. My husband and I have seen all three of the other Scream movies and while 1 was excellent, 2 was good, 3 was sub-par, 4 was absolutely HORRIBLE. The character development was non-existent, the storyline lacked any real conviction, the gore looked fake and was overused, and the language was littered with F-Bombs because the writers had to fill empty space...Courteney Cox and Neve Campbell are great actresses, but this was nothing more than a glorified B flick. Anyone who rates this movie above a 4 is not a true critic, and is either lying or being paid to give it good ratings. DISAPPOINTED.",Scream 4
520,shabzii,Scream 4: All that we wanted... and more!,10,21 April 2011,"Since watching the latest instalment of the popular satirical horror franchise Scream, I've been interested to see whether other fans felt the same as I did. It is good to see that some agree, but surprisingly, many don't. I admit, 11 years after the release of the last film, I had mixed feelings about the idea of rebooting this series. I've grown up with the Scream movies, had nightmares as a child, and through my teenage years grew to love them. Now, at the age of 21, I still like to go back and re-watch the original films. I definitely wasn't completely supportive of the idea of bringing them back. There have been many sequels or remakes of old horror franchises in attempt of making money off a pre-existing idea. (Friday the 13th, Halloween Resurrection, Halloween H20, and my least favourite, a film that should never have been made, I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer). I was impressed when I read that Wes Craven and John Williamson would be returning, then the news that Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette would each reprise their original roles did cause me to get a little excited. Still, I was slightly skeptical, but excited nonetheless. I went to the cinema, as people do, and watched the latest instalment of one of my favourite film series ever. Through the entire film I found myself on the edge of my seat, with my jaw open. I could not have hoped for a better sequel. Reading reviews, I've seen a lot of complaints which leads me to ask.. what the hell did people expect? Will we never be happy? There would have been exceptionally high expectations by audiences, no doubt. I definitely held high expectations myself. But I felt that Craven and Williamson tackled these expectations admirably, delivering what just may be the greatest instalment yet! An interesting story line, introducing new characters, intertwining their stories with that of the original cast (Campbell, Cox and Arquette), while taking an obvious humoured satirical stab at the horror genre - This one is definitely a winner.Any true fan of the franchise would have walked out of the cinema with a grin on their face. The film paid great homage to the originals, leaving us fans satisfied. The opening sequence left the audience laughing at the clichés we find in films of this genre, while the twist (which I maintain, anybody that claims they saw it coming - IS LYING!) was creative, and unlike any other Scream film to date. As much as I love the first three films, if any new character that seems to hate Sidney Prescott's mother Maureen that much that they go on a random killing spree, targeting Sidney herself for her mother's whorish ways would have been over the top. Williamson and Craven got creative, and gave the killer a fresh and modern motivation... but still kept it close to home.Overall, I'm obviously a great fan of the film. Anybody who suggests it was no good... I ask you to go back, watch the initial three films then re-watch this. You will love it.",Scream 4
521,berkana-lynx,Pleasantly Surprised....,9,23 April 2011,"I loved the original trilogy. My brother used to call me back then and give me a ""Hello, Sydney.."" occasionally just for funsies because we are huge horror fans and especially loved these movies. After so many years, when I saw that this film was being made, I was immediately excited - and then a bit worried. My fear was that I would go to see it and be hugely disappointed to the point that it would tarnish my love for the original films. Tonight my brother and I went to see the film, and it delivered.I'm not going to discuss the plot to avoid spoilers, but I will say that we loved this movie - it came through with all of the things we loved about the original and it was like seeing an old friend again. Our hope is that this is the beginning of a second trilogy - but only if they can continue to deliver the goods like they did this time.",Scream 4
522,rsv1992,"Could have been way better, but was still fun to watch.",7,22 April 2011,"First of all I love the original Trilogy of Scream and when I heard that they were making a fourth one and perhaps even a new trilogy I got extremely excited! I literally came on IMDb everyday to check up on news reports and clips for the move and was ecstatic when the first trailer appeared! I ran to the theater once I was able to go and see it and was all jittery with excitement and disbelief that I was actually FINALLY going to see the new movie. I know what you're thinking is he 5 or something? No I'm just a big fan of scream... I was like 4 when the first scream came out though... But anyways once the credits hit I felt very disappointed by how everything turned out. So I made a list as to what I didn't like about the movie - The worst opener in the scream series. The original trilogy was so tragic how the characters died, Casey Becker gets killed by ghost face and her parents were so close to saving her, Maureen gets killed in a movie theater filled with people who could have helped her but they all thought it was a publicity stunt, and Cotton Weary tried desperately to save his girlfriend who attacks him because she was manipulated into thinking he was trying to kill her and eventually they both get killed. This beginning was more comedic and tried to have lots of twists unfortunately it was not surprising since when the girls were killed there acting suddenly became really fake and the killer moved at super speed... I knew it was going to end up being a stab movie and it was stab 6; I remember craven said they're on stab 7 so I knew the next sequence was also a stab movie. then finally we came to the real world and we see these two girls (jenny and Marnie) talking about the stab movies and then jenny decides to play a prank by pretending she's ghost face on the phone but then Marnie gets killed (which you don't see happen) and jenny suddenly gets the call and eventually she gets killed herself. -Another thing I had a problem with was how the story developed, everything was happening really fast and there were no real character development or mystery to it. It was more like ""hmm I wonder who's killing everyone"" and BAM people dropping like flies everywhere. One thing that seemed awkward to me was that NONE of the new cast members, besides Deputy Judy, lived. Which you didn't really care about since none of the characters was developed besides Kirby who I loved but saw her death coming from a mile away (which also led to the reveal of the first killer). The other characters I liked were Rebecca who was really fun to watch but she was really stupid (why didn't she call the cops while she was locked in the car?), and Robbie because he could have easily become Randy 2.0. I also liked detective Hoss but only because he was played by Adam Brody. -Another problem was the deaths, they weren't creative AT ALL!! The only death I liked watching was Olivia's death because it was the longest and most violent which really made the film appear like it was trying to show how horror is now a days with all the super violence. All the other deaths were basically just a stab to the back or torso and one really dumb stab to the forehead (he should have died automatically) I mean seriously Hoss gets stabbed in the back and dies instantly but Perkins gets stabbed in the forehead and still manages to say a one-liner!?? Also where is all the cat-mouse chase scene? There was like one that was sort of a chase scene involving Rebecca in a parking garage. oh BTW when people died in this movie the characters literally reacted for 2 seconds then moved on like nothing happened! Are these people heartless? -My last complaint was the killers and their motives. It was pretty obvious that Charlie was one of the killers because he was the only one that wasn't automatically killed by ghost face. He was tied up so that Kirby had to answer some horror movie questions and, for the first time ever, got the last question right only for her to untie him and get stabbed. Then Jill was the other killer, obviously since she was the only character who was still alive and who never got a red herring on her, and she kills Charlie and reveals that she wants to be Sidney 2.0 because she wants to be famous LAME! Eventually the dumb bitch gets it and Emma Roberts overacted the ENTIRE scene! She wasn't scary or convincing as a psycho like the previous killers in the trilogy. Also when the movie ended we never got to see an after math, it just ends when they finally kill Jill.",Scream 4

524,Sofeashaniz,Excellent!,8,27 April 2011,Scream 4 was excellent! I really enjoyed watching the film! It was scary but the deaths were funny (some of them at least!) and the ending was spectacular! Neve Campbell was superb as usual and David A and Courteney were great! I loved the new characters a lot as well!! My favourite out of the new cast must have been Hayden Patienierre(Kirby). She was really good! So to sum it up...... I would say Scream 4(Scre4m) was overall very fun to watch! I would definitely recommend you to watch this film because as I mentioned before... it's great!! Thanks for reading my review!,Scream 4

But it is still not anywhere near as good as the amazing first Scream movie was. I would say if you are a fan it is worth seeing in the theater, anyone else it is worth skipping all together or just catch it for free when it comes on TV or borrow the DVD from someone. The actors all seems like they are just doing it because they have nothing else to do any more, they are all way too old now to be doing these same roles.

This movie has nothing new to it, the actors were even way worse than they were in the movies before it.... 0.0 ... not impressed. I think this will be the last scream made ever, and honestly after wasting my time watching this one, I'm definitely not going to miss it. There was very little action, and definitely no passion in the script. I extremely surprised it even got produced. Sydney gained weight, and even the reporter is starting to look old. I couldn't even bring myself to laugh at the mild humor in some places, it was just that bad. So ya, fair warning. If you waste your money on it and find yourself complaining about it afterward then it's your own fault for not taking heed to this review. booooooooooooooo! and double boooooooooooo!

528,elutel,Better than most but still not cutting it.,7,4 May 2011,"Final went to see Scream 4....... to fast in scene use, progression, and not enough smart dialogue. The killer would never attack so many people in a night. It is always about a statement not a body count. Technical issues all around with the actual physics and biology. Neither Character that played the killer role could in fact do some of what was done. Adrenaline or not. The characters died to easy, and bleed out to fast. Not enough dirty, and grit! Emma Roberts role was only made less believable by her physiology. It was laughable to even consider her as physically capable as she was. The survivor characters were not used well in their roles, not only would they be more armed but more capable than a couple of teenagers. Directors need to get it through their head that characters do not always equal cannon fodder. The use of introducing new characters seemed rather fruitless. One would think the reason to use new blood is to introduce new element to play off. The comedy should have been more subtle. I remember Scream the original trilogy being moody. Set the mood! The other real element missing was the: who can you trust instinct. The whole Stab movie thing should be played out from now on.Entertaining? Yes! Better than most horror movies that have come back specially with the crap-tasm of todays horror. Here's to Scream 5 making use of it's characters. Also a garage door could not do that!! I would have to say the best kill for me, or at least the more believable would be Olivia. That was physical and brutal. The actual events although did happen kind of quick, should be looked at as smart and a practical use of methods for the killer. The writing was also quite funny in comparison to the earlier movies. Good? Bad? You decide!",Scream 4

Like scary movie, only able to control itself and actually slightly amusing. It wasn't till the first murder that I even questioned this. I just thought it was a bit bloody for a comedy. Nonetheless, it was a pretty nice movie. It was very meta. In the first scream movie you had those guys describing what happens in a horror movie while they themselves were in a horror movie. Scream 4 gave those guys a pen and the script and told them to go wild. The ending was certainly a twist. Parts of it anyway. Is it still a twist when you expect a crazy twist? I've been asking that myself since the first sequel to scream. If you are looking for something that scares you, you are really in the wrong place. But if you're looking for an entertaining mind trip with the occasional stabbing then this will certainly do.",Scream 4

There was also more gore in this one and it felt like you were in a saw film. Very happy with the movie and was shock about the ending but there is some possibility that there could be Scream 5 and I believe there will be.

With great cast and awesome direction the movie is very well paced with lots of wow scenes. From starting till the end, the movie will make you guessing the man behind the mask. This is the best movie of 2011 (of it's genre). Somewhere i was leaning front and then pushed back at the same instant. If you even are not a scream fan.....you should still watch it.

Granted, they do seem to spoof themselves a lot (though I think that Scary Movie left many people unable to take Scream seriously at all), the latest instalment in the slasher series seems to focus more on darker comedy and less slapstick 'killer-tripping-over- couches'. Some people weren't too impressed with the big reveal of the killers *SPOILERS* but I think Jill did a great job at being completely unhinged, and to me the storyline made sense, they've never been too in depth after all, it is a teen slasher movie. I was however surprised that this film was rated a 15 as it to me was the goriest of the series, particularly Olivia's death. I liked that the film did tribute the original Scream in some memorable scenes that any fans of the series would enjoy. The only thing that sticks in my mind that annoys me was Anthony Anderson's death, too drawn out and over the top. This film definitely regained some dignity for the series after Scream 3 was very hit and miss, and finally Courtney Cox isn't wearing awful power suits or sporting a dodgy fringe! Favourite death: Kirby (though some argue she may not technically be dead). Will be interesting if Kevin Williamson is still looking to do a 5th instalment considering they killed off every new member in the cast! Enjoy the film everyone",Scream 4

Jill is a relative to Sidney and Gale and Dewey are married.Jill is a teenager and her aunt Sidney has come home which is the last stop on her book tour and thats when people start to get scared and one by one people die and through out the whole movie you are thinking whose going to get it next.The opening scene was the highlight of the movie although it was a bit of a shame how Kevin and Craven make it look to great but overall you will be shocked by who the killer is and that you will want a scream 5.",Scream 4

I liked the twists in this one better than the other 3, the twists the writers made shocked the heck out of me, lol. straight down to who the killer was. who they revealed as the killer shocked the heck out of me! The one person i thought it was throughout the whole film it wasn't it at all, but i think you will be shocked when you find out. very intense.What I thought was kind of interesting about this film was the ""film facts"" they were talking about this time were about film reboots and remakes, lol. of course, - in an era when a lot of movies coming out are reboots and remakes, lol. And when it first came out I heard the plan was to reboot the series with this one also, so no wonder they focused on reboots and remakes in the plot, lol.

However if i had to be honest I would never choose to watch this film again, certain scenes and sections of the film flowed fairly well and the gore was well balanced but the story seemed to thicken a few steps too far and became almost like a joke towards the end of the film. I can say I almost found myself laughing towards the very end as it seemed like it might never actually end.

Although it wasn't as gripping as the first, I feel as if I enjoyed it more than the first, as it had characters that related more to the times of today. The comedy incorporated was a lot more natural than the 2nd and 3rd films. It was dark enough to make you bite your fingernails, but not so terrifying that you couldn't sleep when you got home. Many people complained about the involvement of the ""Stab"" movies. I quite enjoyed it, as it created a fan base of people in the movie just like the fans of Scream in real life.

539,desperaterevenger,Scream 4: Sometimes sequels are better than original.,9,11 February 2012,"Let me start off by saying this: Scream 4 was amazing! out of all the saga this was my favorite! For simple reasons I find it the best. It did what many movie sequels have failed to do, it was still scary, still funny, and still amazing! Neve Cambell as Sidney Prescott was amazing, and now she isn't the victim, she's the hero! she's tougher and better than ever before! Couteney Cox as Gale was amazing as usual. She was like the character from the original but now caring too! David Arquette as Dewey was funny and great! The new characters were also amazing! Emma Robets and Hayden Pannetiee were great and I loved Marley Shelton's creepy Deputy Judy HIcks.Now I'm going to talk about the plot. Sidney Prescott has written a self-help book and is back, stronger than ever. Dewey and Gale are married and hitting a rocky bump. But when a new set of murders happen everyones a suspect and Sidney included. With Sidney forced to stay i town she stays with he cousin Jill and Aunt Kate. We also meet Jill's friends Olivia and Kirby and film-geeks Charlie and Robbie. But when bodies start to drop everyone is a suspect and everyone can die this time around.The killer this time around was my favorite by far. Suspenseful and un-predictable Scream 4 proves that a sequel can be just as good or even better than the original. The only bad part was that after 10 years the opening scene just wasn't as amazing as I'd hoped. But aside that the film had an amazing twist ending and deserves to be watched and given a chance! 9/10.",Scream 4

I do not get why people give this movie a low rating. maybe its because its so predictable hey is that such a bad thing the others are and its kinda the fun of it. maybe its because it may not have the best acting or not realistic enough hey its a slasher and the acting may not be the best but its not really that bad and for the not realistic part its a SLASHER!! well whatever i enjoyed this movie even if the motive of the villain is a bit silly its still a good and funny movie that is underrated shame on some people. I hope they make more of scream.,Scream 4
541,thorshammer19,SCRE4M: Too self aware?,7,20 April 2011,"Some movies are so original, so enduring, and so groundbreaking that they change the face of their genre, or even cinema in general, forever. These are the hardest films to remake, reboot, or reinvent, because of the very nature of the original. It came during a different time. The original Scream trilogy thrived on a very simple but very effective idea: The characters have seen horror films. This allows them to discuss openly the very things the audience would be discussing. It was clever, engaging, and very real. The problem is, it changed horror films forever, and any film made after it has to make films in this new time. Enter Scream 4(SCRE4M), the movie planned to bring the same experience of the original Screams, to a new generation, whilst still trying to continue the story of the characters the old audience has grown to know and love. However, this new generation is already used to self- aware films, because they come from a time after Scream. So as with all horror movies, they decided that whatever worked before should be done again, only bigger. Friday the 13th had gruesome kills, lets make them more gruesome. Nightmare on Elm Street had unnerving and strange dream sequences, let's make them stranger. Scream has self aware character, let's see how far we can take that. So we open with the obvious, with teenagers discussing the tendencies of modern horror films, and even discussing the the idea of ""self aware"" horror films. The opening is handled cleverly and manages to address the elephant sized question in the room: If it's been done before, why should we care? That question is not fully answered leaving it to the rest of the film and eventually the audience to puzzle out. But it accomplished it's goal. Why should we care? Watch the rest and maybe you'll see.Obligatory murder scene now out of the way, we start the plot. With the return of ""Victim Royalty"" Sydney Prescott to Woodsboro at the end of her book tour. It always surprises me how much thought gets put into Sydney's character, she is constantly evolving, becoming ever stronger, but remaining true to the girl we met in the original Scream. Sydney is the most believable portrayal of what someone's life might actually be like if she was forced to live her entire life in a scary movie. Gale and Dewey are remarkable and fun characters as well, but Sydney is the star of slasher victims (as one character points out).The new characters function very well within the script, but that is it, they function. They provide humor, support, a list of suspects, and host of potential victims. The most interesting and note-worthy of course being, Jill, Sid's cousin. Now the victim much like Sydney was when she was her age. The Sydney/Jill interactions are my favorite bits of the film, they are handle with a skill still mostly absent from horror films. They provide unique insights into the characters, and are surprisingly effective emotionally . But then this is a horror movie, so then to answer the question: Is it scary? Well since that is a very difficult, very subjective question to try and answer, I will say only that it is sufficiently gory, suspenseful, and intense in pacing. However, for me the horror element operates a little to much like a Friday the 13th movie, and less like the original three. Although there are a couple of darkly scary scenes I appreciated, especially with they were played in homage to the originals. So to begin to rap up my ramblings on the subject. I believe the film tries a little to hard to be self-aware. They don't realize they are in a situation that is like that of horror film, they REALIZE they ARE in a horror film. This plays to the films advantage when their beloved horror films turn all to real. But at times it makes the characters seem inhuman and resigned to their fate. This could be an intended comment on the film makers part, and if it is, it's a far more frightening concept than a serial killer. The film also tries to be a little to surprising. With twists coming so fast that they forsake telling a good story at times. I realize this is to keep the seasoned audience members still guessing, but eventually you need to tell the story.Finally, I think they forgot the number one rule of horror. What truly scares is remarkably simple. Whether its the unknown, the unseen, or the very concept of death. Fear is not flashy, not showy, it is plain, simple, truth. Overall the movie walks the fine line that it created for itself as well as any film could. It tried for the impossible and obtained the passable. It is a very funny, very clever, very entertaining film. And a worthy entrance to the series. It manages to be part-sequel, part re-boot/remake. It uses the old characters well, and reminds us why we love them in the first place.",Scream 4
542,walkthroughman2,very cool,10,12 September 2012,"I liked this movie because it's cool like the first the second and the third.i think that they can make 5th part, but i am not sure.i liked the end.it was very shocking.i will not say who is the killer.in all scream movies there is an atmosphere that is scaring you but not so much.if you love movies with knifes or stabbing, scream, scream 2,3 and 4 are the perfect.i like the idea.i don't like movies with so many blood, like in the cabin in the woods or inside.i like movies with atmosphere like this and storyline like this.i can't just describe how i like that movie.just watch all the parts and feel what i feld when i watched these movies for the first time.",Scream 4
543,Joshualee417,Such a great movie! One of my all time favorites,10,7 August 2012,"I grew up with the scream series. I loved every minute of it. The comedy, the gore, the twists, the ending. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of story line. This movie could have went deeper into the main characters. Sidney should of had more of a kick ass role. I loved Hayden panetierre's character. I hope somehow she comes back for scream 5 It has been ten years for gosh sake. As a die hard scream fan, they can revamp themselves and win back the scream fans! Get some well known actors and actresses and make it better than the rest! I recommend this movie to everyone. If your new to scream, go back and watch the originals. You can't fully appreciate it until you do!",Scream 4
544,joshcisneros,Movie sequels usually stink and this is no exception,4,21 August 2012,"I only give a rating of 4 because I simply loved the first Screams and I needed to see what happened to Sidny after Scream 3.And maybe the ending was decent. Not great, but decent. Now onto the review; from my extensive movie experience I had a strong feeling this new installment of Scream would pale in comparison to the classic 3 I loved so much. But I had no idea it would be this bad. First thing you should know and will notice about the movie is the appalling lighting. Some scenes are so dark you can't see the characters faces. There is even one scene where you are squinting basically at a black screen trying to make out a flicker of light. Now if you loved Screams 1-3, you should brace yourself for the plot: modern teen Facebook drama, probably the worst kind of drama there is. The only real points I give for this movie is the nostalgia of seeing Sidny Prescott and Dewey working together again. If I wasn't such a big fan of the first 3 I'd probably give the movie a 1 or a 2.",Scream 4
545,kylemckinnon143,Buckets of fun,10,16 July 2013,"I absolutely love this movie, it is one of my all time favourite horrors and I had so much fun watching it. I would highly recommend it to anyone and its just such a great series. The acting is great and it is really suspenseful and had a great twist that Id never have guessed.The film starts off with a smart scene that features two girls talking about watching a scary movie and eventually being attacked by ghost face. Then we find out that what we just saw was from another stab movie that another two girls are watching, then one of them stabs the other for talking while she is trying to watch it and then we see that all of THAT was from another stab movie and another two girls are watching that. And the whole scene is full of surprises and yet another amazing opening scene from scream. The rest of the movie is just awesome as well and it had a really great twist at the end (like all the scream movies) and I just had a really good time watching this movie. see it!!",Scream 4
546,lestatdarkprince,Welcome Back to Woodsboro,7,21 April 2011,"This is a hybrid film that is a sequel and a pseudo remake(which the actor's dialogue plays with throughout the film). That is fitting as the franchise is a hybrid fit between horror and comedy genres a chomordy if you will. One of the reasons I found the franchise so refreshing was the strong script of Williamson that had just enough suspense and death to fit into the horror/thriller category, yet also maintained enough wit and tongue in cheek pokes at the slasher genre to ensure laughs and amusement from horror fans. Right out of the opening sequence this movie made a promise to viewers that it was a reboot And continuation of the Scream franchise delivering much of the action and dialogue fans have come to expect yet keeping it fresh enough we don't nod off, and this trend continues throughout the movie. As one reviewer(at least) already commented some of the ""suspense and twists"" are foreshadowed and one can maybe figure it out in the main but I found enough plot turns to the end that I would not dare call this movie predictable. Overall I really enjoyed a new entry into the franchise even though when I first learned this movie was being released my initial reaction was ""sellout"" after all part of the beauty of the Scream franchise was an actual horror franchise that disciplined itself enough to be a true horror trilogy.So I began watching with a mixture of excitement and preparedness to totally dislike the film on prinicple alone. Bottom line though the collaboration of Williamson and Craven reminded me why I was so enamoured with the original trilogy in the first place. I think one of the reasons I liked this movie so much had to do with timing as well, it was released just long enough after the Trilogy to make one not think OMG a remake ALREADY?!? and not so long after the fact the the original appeal had been forgotten. I definitelty recommend this movie to Scream fans and even new fans although with warning one should really watch the original trilogy to fully appreciate Scream4.",Scream 4
547,andrefelipe-barbosa,"The ""Scream"" franchise returns: the fourth chapter",9,24 March 2013,"A cool movie from the 1990's is back with a ""new"" story and characters. ""Scream 4"" returns to present to the new public Sidney Prescott and the Ghostface. The first film came with a thrilling storyline and a lot of references to the horror genre. The classic movie with a crazy killer and an innocent lady, in Wes Craven's version, have gained an air of tragedy with a little bit of humor. In this chapter, Sidney Prescott - the biggest survivor - returns to her hometown Woodsboro to release her new book. It was written to help people with traumatic problems. Her forthcoming started it all: the mysterious voice calls to a blond girl and starts a little game about horror movies and the famous killers. The open scene impresses with the highest level of cruelty. Then, a lot of people die in different ways during the film. The classic reference to the old movies is back with the original cast: Neve Campbell, David Arquette and his ex-wife Courteney Cox. They are role- playing with a new generation of actors, like Emma Roberts, Lucy Hale and Anna Paquin. Instead of it deceptions the Scream fans, it proves that the fourth chapter is amazing!I wrote ""new"" story in the beginning because this is not something new: it is a classic thriller about a person who calls to his victims and starts asking questions about the horror films using the psychological way to scare people to the death. So, the mixing between the new group and the veterans is nice....Just that. There is a moment with a little discussion between the xerif Dewey Rile and her wife, Gale Weathers, ex- journalist. This doesn't make any sense to the whole story....by the way, it involves the Cox and Arquette characters's during the movie. She tries to catch the killer with the help from a group of nerds who know everything about the horror genre and present to the new public the 'rules' inside a scary movie. The famous question, ""What is your favorite scary movie"" returns in this time through the messages on the cell phone, apps (there is one that shows the Ghostface's voice) and Iphones. The technology intends to show what is the most different in the fourth chapter in comparison to others.Neve Campbell acts brilliantly, demonstrating a maturing of her character. Prescott struggles with the killer in a scene worthy of a professional fight. She is more independent and she has a high self- esteem that she uses in trying to help the young gang against the villain. David Arquette is the same silly from the previous movies....He doesn't change! Shame on him. Anyway....Courteney Cox returns with a crazy- sensationalist reporter Gale Weathers. She is really boring on this time and she tries to acquire her career back. She intends to write a new book, in this time, about real facts instead of fiction. Her character is so funny and she has a important paper inside the movie. I'm a Cox's fan....She is amazing! It was so good review her on the theaters again. I just want to tell something about the new group who is acting with them: I'm very impressed with Hayden Panettiere, principally in the final moments....Go, watch it... I've been reading a lot of opinions about Craven's direction. He is the master of the suspense! Only this, OK? He knows how to make people jump and laugh at the same time. ""Scream"" returns to the fans bringing brutal killings, a lot of blood, a violent killer and some funny moments. The killer identity was a big surprise for me. i just do not agree with the reasons for the crimes, but....If you want to see a good movie with a great cast and an experienced director, watch ""Scream 4""!",Scream 4
548,catmac-677-793449,Scream Should Stop,4,9 March 2014,"The first Scream movie is one of my all time favorite movies. I loved seeing it and I wish that I had been around and old enough to see it back when it first came out in the theaters because I bet it was a ton of fun and all kinds of people probably screamed their heads off watching it. It was very original and tons of fun and Sidney and the killer were both awesome.The sequels were not very good though and actually take away from how good the first movie was. Part 4 is actually the first one I watched of the series and I saw it in the theater and I liked it but not as much as most movies, it was a below average slasher-horror movie. Then I watched the first one and was blown away. But then when we watched parts two and three I could see that part one is the only one that is really worth seeing.Do yourself a favor and watch only part one, or if you want to see them all watch them in order!",Scream 4
549,alex-zeppelin,The worst of the scream movies. By far.,1,17 June 2018,"It's overall a decent movie throughout, but the stupid killer Jill ends up being portrayed as a goddamn hero because she set up a bunch of murders she committed to look like she was a victim too. And even by the end of the movie she's sfill viewed as a hero. The last 5 minutes of this flick ruined the entire thing for me. Stick to good horror.",Scream 4
