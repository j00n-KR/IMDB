0,SnoopyStyle,not what's expected,5,21 July 2021,Rob (Nicolas Cage) is a reclusive mountain man living with his truffle-hunting pig. Amir (Alex Wolff) is a truffle buyer from the city.I was expecting a revenge murder spree from Nick Cage. It doesn't happen. It doesn't happen. And it doesn't happen. It never happens. It's something else... but I kept expecting it to turn back. I think Nick Cage has gone too far in his career to do this type of movie. Expectations are clashing too harshly. This is not the film that I've come for.,Pig
1,boblipton,The Auteur Hogs The Information,3,17 July 2021,"Nicholas Cage and his pig live on the Cascades Mountains. Cage looks like he hasn't had a bath, a haircut, or a wash of clothes in ten years. Together they hunt truffles, which they sell on Thursdays to Alex Wolff, who drives a Maserati. Then one evening people invade Cage's shack, beat him senseless and take his pig. When he wakes, he contacts Wolff and the two of them go on a journey of discovery about who Cage was and the meaning of loss among the frouffy super-rich while Cage tries to get his pig back.A movie like this should not yield its secrets easily, but the manner in which Michael Sarnoski hides them is by no one saying anything for a long time, and then dropping information ker-plop. Truth should be hidden in a welter of interesting facts, not husbanded like a miser, until after a long time, some one announces ""Here's what I should have told you."" Which one character or another says on more than once. Nor are the characters the only ones like that. The movie behaves that way towards the audience, with an air of suspenseful mystery in which Great Truths are revealed, only of course, the audience should have figured them out long ago: Cage's past, why he's that way, why he's stopping at that nice middle-class house, who's behind the the pig-napping, all of these are apparent to anyone who doesn't have to be spoon-fed small doses of information by Nicholas Cage. Who lets us know. What he says. Is. Very. Important.By SpeakingVerySlowly.Is this the state that serious cinema has arrived at? If one picture is worth a thousand words, then a 92-minute movie like this is an immense undertaking of information, of character and story, and all the things that have to be communicated, and really, it's all idiot plotting that could be cleared up in about forty seconds of exposition.",Pig
2,nogodnomasters,I'm looking for a pig,7,25 July 2021,"Robin Feld (Nicolas Cage) lives in a shack, lacks hygiene, and literally lives with a pig. He makes a modest living hunting truffles, or at least the pig does. His pig is pig-napped and Robin returns to Portland in an attempt to get it back. His side kick is Amir (Alex Wolff) the young man who buys his truffles. In Portland, the unkempt Robin commands attention. It reminded me of the Bugs Bunny cartoon Long-Haired Hare where he plays ""Leopold"" the conductor. As it turns out Robin was a well known chef and punching bag.I enjoyed watching the film. I thought they could of had better ending instead of one that was so anti-climatic.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Pig
3,kosmasp,Cages best friend,8,19 October 2021,"Can Pigs be Pets? Or are they more a ""workforce"" of sorts? On the other hand, one may argue here it is more the role of a friend that the pig inhabits. Which makes the relationship between Cage and his quite furry four legged friend interesting to say the least.If you've read a sort of summary of what this is going to be ... I imagine there are things that are not covered. Things that may feel weird while you watch it. You may expect certain things to happen in this movie ... but the movie will not satisfy those needs or even wants. It will follow its own route/road and its own pace ... which is quite slow. A movie called something with Joe that Cage starred in, is one that reminds me mood and pace wise of this. Still way different overall - so I'm not comparing the movies. But Cages performance is as subtle and low maintance as it can be ... something that we may not be used to, especially lately. Curious to see how the Prisoners of Ghostland will compare to this ...",Pig
4,Quinoa1984,An astonishing and assured debut with a stunner of a Cage turn,10,16 July 2021,"An astonishing and assured debut; Pig may get you into the theater with the veneer of a darker/darker hued John Wick (by way of, hmm, how's about Leave No Trace, that works for me), but it's much more than that suggests. This is a rather devastating and deeply emotional film about loss, of self and others and the toll that takes, and how it shows ultimately much more courage to reach into someone else's soul, especially if it's a person who wronged you, than to go about the usual revenge narrative. I won't say how this happens, but it's a film that earns its tragic countenance and the look of the film itself (as I told my wife on the way home, the color choice almost looks like a truffle).On that level the filmmaker is also rigorous into exploring forgiveness and how painful opening those wounds can be. I don't want to give too much of the experience away, it's a true character piece in a vein we so rarely get with this actor - I'll go ahead and say it, this is on the level with a Leaving Las Vegas or Joe - but what turned this from very good to one of the year's best was the scene where Rob talks to the chef at the restaurant. What a character. And Cage only brings big displays of this person's grief and anger a handful of times; he's now at that stage where he can come into a room and say little and command attention. And the supporting work from Wolff and Arkin et al is also excellent and matches him.In sum: That'll do, Nicolas. That'll do.",Pig

6,CinemaSerf,Interesting and entertaining search for more than just a pig...,7,6 October 2021,"We have waited quite a log time for this, but finally we have a film from Nicolas Cage (""Rob"") into which he appears to have put some effort - and it works. He lives in the wilderness with his truffle hunting pig. Remote and isolated, his only contact with the outside world is when he meets his dealer ""Amir"" (Alex Wolff) who swaps the fungi for essential supplies. When his pig goes missing, ""Rob"" proves determined and inventive as he tries to track down its whereabouts. As the sub-plots develop, we discover there is substantially more to the character than that of just a porcine detective, and as the relationship between himself and the younger man develops, we learn more about what drove this man to seek his life of solitude. At times poignant, violent, pathetic and entertaining this film is a good showcase for an actor going back to basics - quite literally, and the handsome Wolff proves a decent enough conduit for him to tell us his story. I wasn't mad on the ending, but it is not really what I expected either.",Pig
7,deloudelouvain,"Decent acting, dumb story.",5,30 July 2021,"What the heck are these reviewers calling this movie a brilliant masterpiece? Please don't pay any attention to the reviews rating this movie with the maximum possible rating. Nicholas Cage isn't a bad actor but I think he came to a point where he doesn't care anymore about the script. I wonder if he even reads it? I think if the pay is sufficient enough he'll just do it. So the acting wasn't bad in Pig. Let that be clear. The story on the other hand... a recluse and his foraging truffle pig live far from society, the pig gets stolen and the man wants his pig back. Everybody seems to be afraid of the man, not because he's an expert in martial arts, or because he's a real badass. No, none of that, they're afraid because he's a chef, a very good cook... Do I need to say more? It's so ridiculous you wonder who writes this kind of garbage. But the acting was okay... What wasn't okay were the minute long silent passages where absolutely nothing happens besides the viewer getting bored and/or annoyed. The director wanted to play this smart but to be honest it just backfired as there was nothing smart about that. Nicholas Cage has some really good movies on his palmares, some real bad stinkers too, Pig is between those two categories. In other words not really worth watching.",Pig
8,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Pig (2021) 7.2/10,7,4 October 2021,"""Rob is in the long line of American cinema's taciturn, world-weary, aged men who forgo modern, gregarious life in favor of anonymity and solitude provided by nature, often in the wake of inconsolable bereavement, only to be grudgingly driven out of their habitat under unfortunate circumstances and then the past starts to catch up. Moreover, a requisite is that the man shouldn't be a nobody, he must be a made man, whose glorious past makes his perverse choice more heroic for our appreciation, Rob is a museum piece, but his name still means something in Portland, a distant legend whose legacy hasn't completely fallen into oblivion.""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.",Pig
9,MOscarbradley,One of the best films of the year.,9,24 July 2021,"""Pig"" is a movie that wrong-foots you at every juncture; even the opening moments hint at a totally different film than the one that follows. Is this a period piece, a western like ""First Cow"" or will it be a thriller with a 'Die Hard' hero, (and in recent years Nicolas Cage has played his fair share of those)? Actually, it's neither although there are elements of both in first-time writer/director Michael Sarnoski's sublime scenario which is an original screenplay of the utmost originality.We first meet Cage living in a kind of forest wilderness, totally cut off from the outside world, except for his one visitor, (he doesn't even have a mobile phone). His 'business' is finding truffles and to this end he has a pig and that one viistor seems to be his only customer, a young hot-shot with a fancy car and a bit of an attitude. And then one night his pig is stolen.Fundamentally, this extraordinary film is about Cage's search for the pig, aided by that young hot-shot but despite an early sequence that might have come from ""Fight Club"", don't expect a thriller or even an action flic. Slowly we get to know who Cage is or was and our preconceptions fall away. Yes, it's a character piece but it's also a 'foodie' film as well as a film about isolation, loneliness and friendship and neither it nor its superb cast ever puts a foot wrong.Cage has always been a superb actor but with a sometimes unfortunate tendency towards mania. Occasionally this has served him well, (""Raising Arizona"", ""Peggy Sue Got Married"", winning an Oscar in ""Leaving Las Vegas""), but this is an entirely insular performance and it's the best thing he's done in years. As the boy who goes along with him, without even knowing who he is, Alex Wolff is also excellent, (he was the son in ""Hereditary""). Not a great deal actually happens but Sarnoski holds you in a vice-like grip throughout aided, not just by his cast, but by the beautiful images of cinematographer Patrick Scola and Alexis Grapas and Philip Klein's score. Come Awards Season I have a feeling ""Pig"" will do very nicely indeed.",Pig
10,gbill-74877,"Great setup, but fell a little short",6,4 September 2021,"The setup to this film has Nicolas Cage playing a broken soul living in the woods outside Portland with his truffle-hunting pig. After the pig is stolen in the night, he goes on a mission to find him, and we gradually come to understand his backstory. While I loved the premise, I'm not sure I ever completely bought into the shadowy world of gourmet food sourcing that Cage's character traipses through using his connections from 15 years before. The bizarre subterranean fight/punishment scene he endures didn't help with that. At its best, he points out deep truths to other characters, like the devastation the next earthquake will bring, or how a chef isn't cooking the pub food he's passionate about, but instead pretentious fare for the upper crust. Unfortunately, the film itself gets a little ponderous and pretentious as it plays out in an unlikely way. At its core there something touching about seeking authenticity amidst pain and loss, and I wish it had explored this a little more, instead of following the mystery.",Pig
11,851222,Amazing movie gem,10,2 November 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Pig"" (2021) is without a doubt one of my favorite if not the most favorite movie I've seen this whole year. It was amazing in every possible way and did something rare movies these days does - it made me feel something towards it.The plot of this movie is simple on the surface. The pig is stolen from a man who is living in a forest near town and he goes on a quest to find it. It sounds simple yet during his quest we understand what the man was before. We get the glimpses and understanding of what made him move to forest. We find out the part of industry he was before, his role in it and meet some people from his past.Without getting into details important thing is that there is an idea behind every conversation in this movie. Some of people we meet start to see things different after they speak with a man searching for his pig. And you can't think of a better ending of this story. Yet this is not a happy story and there are no happy endings to it. But the soundtrack at the end was perfect.Performance by Nicolas Cage was the best he did since probably ""Adaptation."" back in 2002. I loved him in Joe (2013) and i like Nicolas Cage in everything he does - he is a terrific performer no matter the quality of material he is in. ""Pig"" is a proof that in a right role and given amazing script, Nicolas Cage is one of the best actors in a world and why he is a superstar.Directing, writing by Michael Sarnoski were essential to this movie. This is his first feature and its amazing to see someone pulling something like ""Pig"" off in his debut. Will definitely look forward to see more from him.Overall, ""Pig"" is one of the very best movies of 2021. And its probably my favorite one so far. Its a simple story that combines so many things and does them all right. This is also a superb character study movie. I can't recommend this gem any higher.",Pig
12,UniqueParticle,"I saw on 7-15-21 for some reason IMDB didn't allow reviews yet, probably one of the first to see the film.",10,17 July 2021,"Nicolas Cage (Robin) is electrifying in Pig much better than a lot of his oddball roles! I don't think it's much of a thriller except a few parts, more of a drama that is quite impactful on emotions and crystal smooth writing. I'm offended a couple people I talked to thought Pig was a name for someone no it's actually about the animal which was so well filmed in every aspect! I wasn't sure why people were so mean to Robin but he handled it all superbly. I absolutely loved this movie, I highly recommend it to anyone.",Pig
13,eddie_baggins,One of 2021's great movie surprises,9,16 September 2021,"Most surprises in life aren't often of the pleasant variety but if there was a 2021 surprise for all of us to take stock in its Pig, a truly unlikely high-quality film that is absolutely not the movie you expect it to be, as it becomes both a touching drama and a timely reminder that when given the opportunity, the oft-maligned Nicolas Cage is still right up there with the very best working in the industry today.What on paper may appear to be yet another tax necessity direct to video d-grader starring the one time Oscar winner, Pig is not Taken with hooves and is far removed from the type of mindless fare you'd expect from first time feature film director Michael Sarnoski, as we get a meditative, slowly-paced and effective examination of life, what we find purposes in and love as Sarnoski's 90 minute drama slowly begins to show it's hand on it's way too what is likely too remain one of 2021's most emotional poignant final stretches.Appearing in almost every scene of the film, Nicolas Cage is award worthy here as reclusive truffle hunter Rob, a man who has eschewed society (and showers!) and only has one remaining contact in the form of Alex Wolff's (delivering a performance that is too worthy of award recognition) budding entrepreneur Amir and finds peace and meaning in his friendship with his beloved foraging pig that is taken from him by a bunch of strangers Rob is determined to track down.Saying too much more about where Pig goes and how it goes about it would be a disservice to the carefully considered way in which Sarnoski and his leading man tell their tale but more often than not the story of Rob and his quest to discover who has his hooved friend takes us to unexpected places and deals with instances in unexpected ways and in a day and age where many films simply follow a path trodden out before them previously, Pig is a breath of fresh air in the most surprising of ways imaginable.Also helping its case to becoming 2021's most unpredictably great drama and one of the best films of the year period is the films haunting and minimalistic score by Alexis Grapsas and Philip Klein, the moody cinematography by Patrick Scola and the pitch perfect script by Sarnoski, who has well and truly announced himself to the industry with this uniquely beautiful effort.Final Say -Put your prejudices aside and forget what type of film you think Pig is going to be on face value, this is one of 2021's best film's and a resounding reminder of the talents of Nicolas Cage.4 1/2 bike owners out of 5.",Pig
14,Tweetienator,The Good and Bad,6,26 July 2021,"Pig is no bad movie and the performance of Nicolas Cage is the true star here, but, well, the story didn't work too well for me. Mandy, the greatest piece Mr. Cage did in ages (my opinion of course), is unchallenged by this little flick. Pig is a dark and melancholic tale and got its merits in acting and cinematography, but for sure is not meant for everyone: at least this time I don't belong to the chosen (few?) ones who are able to spot a genius masterpiece in this work. Still, if you are heavily interested in the works of Nicolas Cage and you like unusual movies, you may give this one a try.",Pig
15,imseeg,Nicholas Cage is looking for his lost pig....yawn...,5,31 July 2021,"Beware: former Nicholas Cage ACTION fans should avoid this movie. Definitely. Infinitely.The story: Nicholas Cage is a recluse who lives in the forrest with his dearest pig. The pig gets stolen. Now he is looking for his pig.The bad: this movie looks the part with commercial like photography, with many slow motion scenes and beautifully filmed nature scenery.

Perhaps only suited for artsy fartsy arthouse movie fans?",Pig
16,paul-allaer,"Starts out strong, then loses the plot",5,27 July 2021,"As ""Pig"" (2021 release; 92 min.) opens, we are introduced to a guy (later revealed as ""Rob"") who lives in a remote cabin, along with his truffle-finding pig. Once a week, one of Rob's friends stop by with supplies and to pick up the truffes, to be sold to restaurants in Portland, OR. Then one night, two guys break into the cabin and viciously attack Rob and steal the pig... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the debut feature length of writer-director Michael Samoski. And what a debut it is! The movie's initial third is very strong indeed, and helped tremendously by the lead performance of Nicolas Cage. To be honest, I can't recall the last movie that I've seen him in. Cage has become a bit of of a joke in recent (and even not so recent) years, with the days of his towering performances like ""Leaving Las Vegas"" long behind him. But here, for whatever reason, Cage is fully ""on"". Alas, the film loses much of its personality when ""the search for the pig"" becomes a long and strange criss-crossing of Portland, OR scenes. Along the way, I also lost track of who really was who. So in the end, the film starts strong, very strong, and then fizzles out and loses the plot. This film has gotten extensive critical acclaim and that is the main reason why I decided to check it out. I can't quite follow the critics here, to be honest.""Pig"" was filmed over 2 years ago, but of course its original release date in 202 0was shelved due to COVID-19. The film recently opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Monday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (3 people, including myself). If you are a fan of Nicolas Cage or simply are in the mood for an indie film that is miles away from mainstream fare like F9, etc., I'd readily suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Pig
17,jtindahouse,"Mostly grounded, but sometimes bouncing off the walls",8,25 July 2021,"What a bizarre career Nicholas Cage has had. You never know what the man is going to come out with next. He could do a massive blockbuster, or he could do the most ridiculous film a human mind could possibly think up, and somehow make it even more insane than it was initially intended. 'Pig' is probably somewhere in the middle. It's certainly no blockbuster, but it is also about as grounded as you'll ever see a Cage character.'Pig' possesses a very unique style. For a while it will trot along in a very conventional manner, and then out of nowhere a character will be introduced and the film will just go to bizarro-land for a little while. Not in a bad way, just in a ""what is happening?"" way. Those scenes actually do well to break the film up though, otherwise the tone could easily be a little monotonous.I wasn't quite sure exactly what I was expecting going into 'Pig', all I know is that it wasn't what I got. I think I like what I got more though. It's a surprisingly deep and moving film that has more layers than first meet the eye. I enjoyed this film and would recommend people check it out. 8/10.",Pig
18,stevendbeard,You Know You Are In For A Ride,7,18 July 2021,"I saw ""Pig"", starring Nicholas Cage-Snowden, the Ghost Rider movies; Alex Wolff-the Jumanji movies, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 and Adam Arkin-Rebel_tv, How to Get Away With Murder_tv.This is a Nicholas Cage movie-so you know you are in for a ride-where he plays a truffle supplier. He has a truffle hunting pig and lives out in the Oregon wilderness-by himself, of course-and sells his truffles to Alex, who stops by every so often, and turns around and sells them to restaurants in Portland. One night, some people break into Nick's house and steals his pig. From there, he has to get his pig back, and before we go any further, this is not a John Wick action flick. Nick does have one fight scene but it is to get information on the whereabouts of his pig. He does have a few scenes where he does his wigging out thang. Adam plays a rich entrepreneur that may or may not know about Nick's pig.It's rated ""R"" for language and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 32 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you are a fan of Nicholas' work, you might enjoy renting it.",Pig

24,Agent10,Slow yet moving look into the mind of a culinary savant,7,8 August 2021,"Pig is not what I was expecting it to be. Frankly I had no clue what Pig would ultimately shape into. It's a recipe so to speak. Equal parts character study of a man living away from society, with a smidgen of a mystery story on top. Add some additional ingredients like an underground fight club and a truffle buying underworld and you have an interesting hodge podge of film making.While some might have been hoping for a zesty helping of ""full Cage"" by Nicolas Cage, we instead got the restrained and pensive brutality of Robin Feld. He is Gordon Ramsay sans the outbursts, for his words in the scene with one of his former employees is all we needed to know about his limited back story. He is dedicated, precise and has an impeccable palate. He believes in dreams and desires, not what will gain the shrill favor of fickle investors and foodie elitists.The story to Pig is very simple and straight forward. Even the so called twist at the end is not really a twist but a revelation. Nicolas Cage transforms seamlessly into his dirty and grimy role, never washing himself off and never once looking like someone who cares about social mores. It's a good vehicle for him to play in, and I highly recommend the curt simplicity of Pig.",Pig
25,aidanratesmovies,Shockingly Brilliant,10,16 July 2021,"There are very few times I have watched a film and feel like a complete emotional mess, and even fewer where I have been left speechless- but somehow Pig manages to accomplish both. It may seem a bit average at first, mediocre even, but as Pig paces itself to tell its fantastic story- you are soon treated to a film full of wonderment and surprise- that is as simple as it is brilliant. It will probably be overshadowed, as the film is a small release and wasn't released for awards season, but Cage deserves an Oscar for his performance in this film- in easily one of the best performances i've ever seen from him. First time director Michael Sarnoski makes his debut in this film, and also wrote the film, which I have to admit is one h*** of an achievement. The film is so well crafted under Sarnoski care, that it feels incredibly personal, and most importantly- incredibly grounded- which is a total breath of fresh air from many of the blockbuster films today. The cinematography is subtle and somber, and the music is excellent. The whole film feels like something that shouldn't work, that shouldn't have even been made, but it does, and its easily one of the years best.My Rating: 10/10.",Pig
26,I_Ailurophile,Unexpected - beautiful - exquisite,10,16 July 2021,"I've had admittedly high expectations. The premise is intriguing, and the casting of Nicolas Cage had me sold. He's made some great career decisions in the past several years, and some fantastic movies. I've wanted to see 'Pig' so much that, for the first time since the onset of COVID-19, I ventured to a movie theater to see it.'Pig' is the first full-length feature of writer-director Michael Sarnoski, and of co-writer Vanessa Block. It's a quiet, subdued tale, punctuated by scarce moments of outburst. And, much to my amazement, in my opinion it's told with the expertise of a seasoned veteran.This might well be one of the best movies I've ever seen.The movie is about a man looking for his kidnapped pig, but it is just as much a movie about a man revisiting a past that torments him, and it's utterly fascinating. Sarnoski reveals protagonist Rob's history ever so slyly, with understated suggestions woven into dialogue, shared looks, or even just a simple shot from the camera. Rob is a deceptively complex character, realized with phenomenal contributions from wardrobe, makeup, and hair - and with a lead performance that may possibly be one of the very best of Nicolas Cage's career.Like other notable roles of recent times - 'Mandy,' 'Color out of space,' 'Willy's Wonderland' - 'Pig' marks a feature rather off the beaten path for Cage. Like those other notable roles, Cage gives an outstanding performance contravening the long period where he starred in many less celebrated films. Unlike those other notable roles, 'Pig' demands of Cage not the exuberant, bombastic vigor of a man going wild - but the reserved, hollowing sorrow of a man out of reach. And he excels. For all the less than stellar parts Cage has taken on in the past, they belie an exceptional talent that comes out at the most unexpected times. This is masterful.Co-star Alex Wolff is entirely unknown to me heretofore, but he demonstrates a range and capability I never could have anticipated. His supporting role as Amir requires considerable underhanded nuance, and he pulls it off very convincingly. I'll be keeping my eye on him from now on.'Pig' opens peacefully in the deep, lush, gorgeous forests of Oregon, and immediately conveys a mood at once muted, soft, and sullen. That tone persists throughout the feature, nearly uninterrupted. The most vivid scenes, rife with tension and simmering emotion, are filled not with action or suspense but with swell dialogue - generally revealing still greater truths about Rob's history and character. One of the most captivating scenes of all is the wordless preparation of a meal. Through it all, the attention to detail is considerable, but natural, never feeling pointedly deliberate. Every individual in the story has unseen depths, and no matter how small the part, the cast inhabits them all very well, and believably. Everything in 'Pig' feels very wonderfully real.The original score composed by Alexis Grapsas and Philip Klein is marvelous. It never overwhelms the rest of the film, yet complements every mood, in every scene, perfectly. This goes as well for the classical pieces, and select popular songs, that dot the soundtrack at psychological moments. If there is any one place where the music feels dominant, it's in the final scene, where Grapsas and Klein's stirring chords reap the emotional seeds Sarnoski has been sowing - and where a final simple song, with one acoustic guitar and one voice, fades into the credits with a deeply affecting yet serene melody.There's a shakiness to the camerawork that is unwelcome, but it never is so severe as to disrupt our viewing experience. At all times we're so entranced by the story being told, the visuals on hand, and the fantastic dialogue, that all other thoughts all but drop away. Set design and decoration is impeccable. Sound is perfect. For as hushed in tone as 'Pig' is overall, the emotional ambience is forceful in its tangibility: We keenly feel the grief, melancholy, and pain, portrayed most substantially in Rob's countenance yet still otherwise pervasive. At the same time, there is a lingering, haunting beauty to it all - a tumultuous mixture of sentiments as complicated as life itself.I anticipated enjoying 'Pig,' but never in my wildest dreams would I have thought the first movie I've seen in theaters in almost 1.5 years would be this astoundingly good. It's so carefully, lovingly written, and directed, and acted, that I cried more than once. I've seen other debut features from film-makers and been impressed, but Michael Sarnoski has totally blown me away with his craft, just as Nicolas Cage has with his.This is the opposite of a blockbuster, with a low-key tenor that will be off-putting for general audiences. Yet for anyone who is receptive to more restrained, unobtrusive pictures - movies that are thoughtful, focused on emotional weight, reliant on dialogue - this is essential. This is a must-see. 'Pig' is a treasure beyond almost all comparison, and I absolutely cannot wait to see it again.",Pig
27,masonsaul,Phenomenal drama,10,31 August 2021,"Pig is a phenomenal drama that's extremely emotional and handsomely crafted with effective dry wit throughout. Nicolas Cage gives a perfect lead performance that's definitely one of his best. Alex Wolff and Adam Arkin are both great. Michael Sarnoski's direction is excellent, it's beautifully filmed and superbly paced with impressive sound design. The music by Alexis Grapsas and Philip Klein is amazing.",Pig
28,Abdulxoxo,Very introspective,7,4 August 2021,"The premise of the plot revolves around recluse Robin Feld who lives alone with this pet pig in the forest. Robin was assaulted in his home one night and his pig stolen from him. His search for his pig would take him back to the city where his past and the world he lived before would be unraveled.The film's title seemed so ordinary and not inspiring enough, though its simplicity would definitely garner curiosity among viewers. It was this particular approach that was perhaps the film's best factor. Along Robin's journey to finding his pig, bits of pieces of information about his past were revealed. This allowed the film to subtly do a world building. Who could have imagined that chefs and people from the food industry have their own underworld similar to those mafia and assassin's from John Wick? Only this time there were no guns and violent death matches. While the film is nowhere identical to John Wick, it still managed to keep its core story and development all throughout. The theme of human's need for personal connection was greatly presented by the writing. The story went beyond the simple premise of finding a pet pig just because it can help finding those valuable truffles. No, it was because the pig was personally important to the character played by Cage. It may be silly and cheesy to some, but it was undeniably relatable.Nicolas Cage carried the movie in an inspiring performance. Some of his past films seemed like they were made for TV, and despite his acting prowess he could not make the film interesting. But in Pig, Nicolas Cage did not do guns blazing action, but instead through his gruff old voice he delivered the most penetrating lines. Despite him looking old and beaten, his character's presence and reputation demands respect, and he managed to exude that same presence. Along with Nicolas Cage was Alex Wolff who portrayed Amir. Amir's role at first seemed dispensable and nothing too important. But as the film went by, Amir's role in the film was not just important but essential. He was the one who carried the audience through the story. Alex Wolff played the part complimenting Cage's.The scenes at the Eurydice restaurant and the climax were masterfully crafted. The exchange between Robin and Derek was too good to be dismissed. Robin's reaction to finding what happened to his pig was emphasized with the deafening lack of anything to hear. Those choices in the film were good and it solidified the emotions that the audiences should feel. Overall, Pig was both very straightforward yet ambiguous that the audience are allowed to interpret the film on their own.",Pig
29,Jeremy_Urquhart,Cage is amazing,8,17 October 2021,"Was both sort of what I expected but also not at all what I really expected, so it was a nice surprise to see this go in the various directions it did.This is certainly some of Nicolas Cage's best work as an actor, and also one of his most subdued and emotional performances. I thought he was fantastic for every second he was on the screen, and he for sure deserves some award recognition.The rest of the movie's no slouch, either. It's methodically paced without feeling dull, owing to its tight screenplay and purposeful editing, and the look of the film is also fantastic, looking equally great whether it's showing outdoor forests or cramped, dimly lit interiors.It's a great character study, and I feel like the premise is mainly just there to serve as a way of exploring Cage's character, as well as the other people he comes into contact with. Also: that final scene is perfect, and concludes the film on a great note.I know I'm late to this, so it's probably not something I can ""recommend"" if everyone else has already seen it, but for anyone else who's sleeping on it, I'd highly recommend it as one of 2021's best so far.",Pig

It's directorial debut and it's commendable. I particularly liked the scene where Nic wears down the person who now is a chef. Wow!Final Verdict: Well, like it's said love can be used to accomplish all. That's how the movie tries to conclude, but there is a sacrifice & the fact that it's just animal keeps you at ease.The character of Nic achieves everything in life but does he learn peace, If yes than at what cost?Becoming a GodFather might be a good idea after all the experience but the character of dealer's father is still under question.

35,kuarinofu,Good if a little pretentious in places,7,20 July 2021,"'Pig' is a relatively short and compelling film with interesting character dynamics.It gives you something to think over, although it's not that packed with ideas. Some of the dialogue is also pseudo-philosophically pretentious, but not in a way that ruins the whole film.The acting was fine. Cage was ok by Cage standards (the new-age Cage, not the 2000s insane Cage).This one is of those films where not that much happens, but it still leaves you with a new emotion or a thought. So I'd instead recommend one to watch it. It has some nice shots, references, ideas. It's 100% Cage's story, but seeing how he affects the lives of other people is engaging.I can go on and on. So I'll sum it up. If you're up for something somewhat flawed but still interesting and understandable - give it a watch.If you love Cage - you can also try this. It's a little different from his usual works, though.",Pig
36,Movi3DO,Weird and sad,8,23 July 2021,"John Wick in the Multiverse of MadnessGoing into this movie, I was aware of people comparing it to the first John Wick movie. In many ways that was true. Nicholas Cage as a reclusive man lost his beloved pig, so now he wanted to have his pig back. Although Cage's character looked very old and sad, there's also the look of a hardened and experienced man.The profession of Cage's character was quite shocking at first. When I learned about his past and also the people he had to deal with, I was in denial because of how bizarre it sounded. I thought maybe the words the characters used were analogies that had cryptic messages about something darker like drugs.There was a great scene at a restaurant where Cage's character talked to a chef. It showed how badass and respected Cage's character was. This scene was equivalent to the boss's son learning about John Wick's past.The progression of the movie was very similar to John Wick. This, along with the profession, made me feel like Pig was some kind of parody of John Wick. Instead of a man attacking with guns, this man attacked with foods. It sounds weird (it is). I was laughing at some scenes because of Nicholas Cage's great acting, and the bizarre concepts.However, in many ways this movie was different from John Wick. Don't expect any fun bloody action. Instead, be prepared for a slow and meditative drama about a man dealing with his past and preserving his old memory. What Cage's character did at the end reminded me of Remy in Ratatouille. With the ending, the more I thought about Cage's character, the more I felt sad and heartbroken for the character. It's pretty depressing.As for problems, the first 20 minutes were very confusing because I didn't know about truffles. There was also another scene after that made me felt even more confused. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be funny or serious.Overall, a weird but sad and great movie if you stick through until the end. 8.5/10.",Pig

He did nothing to revenge it. Just talked and talked. I didn't get enough explanation about why he runaway to the woods for 10-15 years.

39,msbreviews,"Despite anticipating several action scenes, the lack thereof didn't result in disappointment but instead in a pleasant surprise. Highly recommend checking this one.",8,16 July 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)Not watching trailers has infinite pros. From going into the theater without a visual clue about what's going to be seen on the big screen to the ability to avoid spoilery clips that ruin supposedly surprising moments, this is a methodology I've been strictly employing in my life. So far, I've had nothing but spectacular screenings. Watching a movie completely blind is an experience I recommend to every film lover. This intro serves to explain why I was so impressed by Pig's grounded, action-less, character-driven storytelling.Without watching any trailer, just by reading the synopsis, it's impossible not to expect an absurdly crazy revenge flick starring the one and only Nicolas Cage (Prisoners of the Ghostland). Well, Michael Sarnoski delivers a subversive directorial debut, focusing on the always heavy theme of grief. Cage's character is a retired chef who lost someone he truly loved, and the (adorable) pig is the only living being he can associate with his former lover. Instead of following an action-heavy, bloody path of murder to help deal with his emotional loss like John Wick, Pig draws attention to the protagonist's feelings.It's a wonderfully written character piece, featuring a beautiful score (Alexis Grapsas, Philip Klein), and incredibly captivating, unforgettable dialogues that replace the expected action sequences. Cage offers one of the most nuanced performances of his career, proving he's one of the most talented actors of his generation. It's a shame that most people only recognize him as Hollywood's main source of memes. Alex Wolff (Hereditary) is also outstanding as a young man with father issues, though his character's subplot isn't as interesting as the main narrative, slightly affecting the overall pacing.Despite anticipating several action scenes, the lack thereof didn't result in disappointment but instead in a pleasant surprise. Highly recommend checking this one if you have the chance.Rating: B+",Pig
40,SoumikBanerjee25,"Pig Exemplifies a Lot of Things, And Vengeance Isn't One.",7,19 August 2021,"""We don't get a lot of things to really care about""In the recent past, Nicolas Cage might have given few shocks in regards to his bizarre and undeterred script choices; but one couldn't repudiate the charm and fidelity he brings to the table every freaking time. Yet again, Mr. Cage flaunts instinctive competence and ingeniously consummated this entire execution on his lone shoulders. Needless to say, this was his time to shine, and Boy Oh Boy! Didn't he rose to the occasion!Storywise, Michael Sarnoski's 'Pig' exemplifies a lot of things, and Vengeance isn't on that list! Unlike some contemporary tales with comparable narrative setups; it rather advocates Humanism, Leniency, and the imperative resilience of mortal minds to dissociate oneself from emotional instability so that we, as human beings could finally embrace our peace of mind.A compendium of some thought-provoking connotations, that can be found deep underneath its core conception. Wherein the principle of 'less is more' becomes all the more prevalent. A righteous narration that solicits viewers' full attention and does everything in its power to hold on to the same.Whether it be the astonishing piece of Cinematography that signifies its artsy representation or the sumptuous Score that intuitively alleviates our hearts and souls; It is an indisputable fact, that it is indeed the technicalities that have immensely helped in terms of building up the much-needed ambiance as well as a certain sense of Isolation that remains resolute.There's a state of dejection in here that utters, or should I rather say; cries in deafening silence. As desolation and despair slowly take over; we end up with an inexplicable sensation that all boils down to individual interpretations and personal understandings.For me, 'Pig' is an existential, contemplative humane drama that plays with our hopes and anticipations only to subvert them in the latter stages. Aptly enunciating the ideology of Nonviolence through such guileful and deceptive stance from the Director, which to be honest, is going to be demoralizing to many but for some, it would be a great deal of pleasure.",Pig

43,ronakkotian,Could've gone down the obvious route but didn't,7,15 September 2021,"There's always something to look forward to in a Nicolas Cage film. Even though nowadays Cage does abysmal films, there's one or two great ones that come with it and Pig is one of them.Pig follows Rob, a truffle hunter who lives in the woods with his beloved pig. One day, his pig gets kidnapped and he returns to Portland to search for it.This film could've easily gone down the simple revenge route these stories tend to have but Pig decided to take a slower and deeper approach. In his directorial debut, Michael Sarnoski displays a lot of promise as a director and storyteller. He takes this simple premise and creates a lot of emotion in it. For his first film, it looks really good. The camerawork is fantastic and I liked a lot of the darkness and dim lighting that captured the devastated mood Rob was in the entire time. Despite its 90 minute runtime, the film does move at a slow pace and the lack of action may be bothersome to some people. I did start to feel the pacing at certain points and I definitely could've been more invested in what was going on but I wasn't.It was refreshing to see characters handle a situation like in a calm yet emotionally effective way rather than going down the typical action route and a lot of the emotion works due to the solid acting. Nicolas Cage is the best he's been in years. Beautifully understated and a man of very few words, Cage is able to channel the distressed nature of Rob in such a believable manner. As much as I would've loved to see Cage go ballistic, it was a nice change of pace to see him in a role he doesn't normally do. I was also surprised to see Alex Wolff in a film like this but he did a good job as well and played along nicely with Cage. Another great performer was Adam Arkin who had some great scenes with Cage and Wolff.Pig ended up being an experience I didn't expect. I didn't feel as emotionally invested as the film wanted me to but I admire Sarnoski's unique approach to this story and Nicolas Cage for providing one of the best performances of his career.",Pig
44,garethcrook,Expect the unexpected.,7,8 November 2021,"A film about Nick Cage and a Pig. Doesn't sound great does it. With Nick Cage, you can never quite tell what to expect though. I'm pleased to report that this isn't as bonkers it might sound or could be with Cage. Here he plays Rob, a frazzled looking outdoorsman living with his truffle hunting pig in the Oregon wilderness. Now let me say right at the start, this is one very cute pig. She's covered in sandy coloured fur and has bags of personality... for a pig. We're engineered to like her and Rob. We don't like Amir (Alex Wolff), at least I don't. He brings chaos, more than he realises, but he'll have chance to redeem himself. When Pig is stolen, it's genuinely gut wrenching and Rob finds himself back in Portland, facing his past to restore his future. Rob is slow, purposeful, methodical. The film matches his tempo and it's full of surprises. Without ever losing its authentic edge we skirt through the seedy underbelly of the city and a world that Rob needs to navigate in his zen-like way to restore his peaceful and tranquil existence. For all it's dark and dirt, it's beautifully shot. Appreciative of its location, it's colour, it's climate. Cage is brilliant. Impressively understated where required. Adam Arkin as the bad guy nemesis almost steals the show, but this is Cage's film and despite its twists the goal is simple, ""We're getting my pig back"". Bleak and dramatic, never really funny but oddly entertaining. It's full of heart, I mean full to the brim... and the pig is cute.",Pig

Yes, I get the whole (overly woke) emotional development part of the story, but there really wasn't much of a story, and the only great scene in the film was the one in the restaurant where Cage tells off the chef.There's not really much else going on, and there's just absolutely no climax and not much of a resolution to the film.

48,sweidman-28016,"An Unexpected, Intense Thriller",8,12 August 2021,"""We don't really get a lot of things to care about.""A truffle hunter who lives alone in the Oregonian wilderness must return to his past in Portland in search of his beloved foraging pig after she is kidnapped. Pig is an unexpected, intense thriller. With a plot this unique, it's hard to imagine how seriously it's taken. But with great direction, a compelling script, and an introspective central performance by none other than Nicolas Cage, Pig stands out this year. If we're going to talk about anything, it's going to be Nicolas Cage. Not only does he rank with some of the best performances of the year, but I believe it to be his best performance of his career. His acting is subtle to the point where he heard my even talks. If I'm correct, he doesn't even talk for a good 30-minutes. Most of the dialogue is given to Alex Wolff. And I will say Alex Wolff is really making a name out of himself within the past few years. One scene in particular is very emotional and Cage portrayed it with perfection. Throughout, we meet a few different characters in hopes that they either know some information or have his pig, and all are good performances even if they're short lived. The acting might just be the best aspect of the movie.Writer and director Michael Sarnoski does very well. Each scene captures the right amount of emotion to take the movie seriously. Not once did I ever think it was too absurd. One thing that I really liked was the moments with the pig. They're so heartfelt and it gets down to the core of the character and what this movie is about. As the story continues, it grows into something more gritty. The dimly lit cinematography fits incredibly well with it. I also like how somethings are kept with the characters. For example, Nicolas Cage has blood on him over the course of the few days they're looking for his pig, and nobody questions why he hasn't cleaned up. This might just be a me thing, but I liked how something as simple as blood is kept to remind us what's at stake. Anyway, I think the movie could've worked more on its pacing. It's fairly short and is a slow burn, but sometimes it dragged on a little too much and I felt like I wasn't as engaged as I could've been. That might take a second watch or so to get some getting used to. All in all, Pig is a solid thriller and I'm eager to revisit it in the future. Unfortunately, it's not in most theaters but it is available to rent on VOD so I'd suggest having a watch if you so desire.",Pig

55,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,"A touching, bittersweet experience",9,23 July 2021,"PIG is certainly not the schlocky, revenge-driven B-movie one would assume based off of the initial trailers. This is a very disciplined drama film, through and through. It's a truly bittersweet experience, beautiful in its raw melancholy. This movie released while I was visiting Portland and immediately began seeing the glowing reviews and commentary about how it's ""the most Portland movie ever"" - so naturally, I made it a point to see it IN Portland on my last night in town - it lived up to the hype!The sparkling music score by Alexsis Grapsas and Philip Klien play a huge part in elevating this film to a further emotional tier - and much to my joyful surprise, the music works just as well as a standalone album - it's some of the most pleasant music I've heard released this year. Cage plays the role perfectly, never with too much flash - just enough to make his estranged character Robin Feld a very believable, very human being. Alex Wolff (of Hereditary notoriety - he stole the show in that movie) at first feels like the weak point of the film, but it's more in the writing and the complete lack of subtlety with his character, however, by the time you get halfway through the film, that whole notion is pretty much flipped on it self and his character ends up feeling like exactly what it needs to be.I won't even say too much more other than reiterating the point that what feels like a film that would naturally turn into some sort of revenge movie becomes anything but - it's an extremely focused and effective character study of three troubled characters, and they all learn painful lessons through each other's struggles or faults. It's a sincerely emotional ride and a near flawless if not completely flawless film - the only reason why it's not my favorite movie of the year thus far is because I don't see it as having so much replay value, whereas my fave Zola is a movie I could watch over and over and over again.

None of it is Casablanca or From Here to Eternity, but he delivers solid entertainment. Nothing very memorable though. Until Pig.Pig is a memorable film. It's also not a film about a Pig.

...it's an emotional journey of a once prominent chef whose wife died sending him into depression (and perhaps a mental break), ultimately landing him homeless. At the absolute bottom, he acquired a pig and made his living finding and selling the expensive fugus to brokers who in turn sell them to fancy restaurants where they sell shavings for outrageous prices to customers.It's one of Cage's best. It's not light-hearted entertainment. It's a serious film that deals with depression.Speaking personally, I'd like to see a part 2. Having made peace with the death of his soul mate, I'd like to seem him showered, shaved and slowly climb back into society. I think there is more to the character. Since Nic does 7 films a year...heck, my man - take a weekend and finish Rob(in)'s story.Fare thee well, it's hoecakes and Madeira time.",Pig
57,DeBBss,"It may seem strange, but it's certainly worth watching",7,26 July 2021,"Nicolas Cage is known for being in some pretty wacky movies, so when I learnt about the plot of Pig, I immediately assumed it'd be some crazy film to laugh at. I'm actually pleasantly surprised by this film; it isn't a 9/10 or a 10/10 film, it certainly is good, but it's not a masterpiece as some may say. It's an emotional story and it achieves that, especially by the end of the film.What makes it so good is Nicolas Cage's acting. So many people underrate Cage's acting skills, but the guy literally won an Oscar. His performance here is legendary, and I don't care what anyone else says, it's Oscar-worthy. The acting in general is also very impressive.I found this film to also be very well paced. It's extremely consistent and I feel like the runtime is perfect. The cinematography and mood of the film really work well together here: creating a sad and somewhat hopeless atmosphere. The makeup and costume design is also great.This is a simple film, it achieves what it has to achieve. It's not supposed to give you this mind-blowing experience. This movie was very well made and it took itself seriously, so don't be turned off thinking that this is going to be some weird Nic Cage flick. Everyone should give this film a shot; it's more than just Nicolas Cage trying to find his pig.",Pig

The PIG is kidnapped and here is where the story really begins. Cage's ROB says so much while saying very little. Great performance Nic !

61,flicklover,Best film and performancefrom Nichalas Cage in years!!!,9,1 August 2021,"I had not seen even a trailer of Pig before I saw it today. I was looking at what to see and read a couple of short reviews and summaries of this film. Every review I read stated how it was Nicholas Cage's best performance in years and even though he has done some good work most of tge films he does these days is B direct to VOD stuff.The description if the story is really unusual. Cahe plays Rob, a truffle forager that lives a hermit life in the woods in Oregon with his pig that assists him in finding truffles which he sells to a hightruffle supplier named Amir played by Alex Wolff. The one thing about this performance in that Nicholas Cage speak very little for alot of the film. Nothing is revealed about his character except that he seems to have alot of emotional pain. Normally, Cage is very broad and over the top in his performances. Here he is very subtle but you can see that his character has experienced loss and is disconnected from the world except for his pig. One night a couple of guys break into his cabin, beat him up and steal the pig. Rob contacts Amir and demands that he help find his pig. It is revealed that Amir's father is an important figure in the high end restaurant business. He is trying to prove himself to his father but has issues with him from their past. Amir and Rob go to town to search for tge pig. Rob goes to see an old acquaintance to get clues. Little by little it is revealed that Rob was a respected Chef in the city. Rob visits what appears to be where he used to live with his wife. There is a scene in a restaurant that Amir and Rob go to. Rob asks for the chef and it turns out that the chef was an employee under Rob years ago. In trying to find out from the chef named Derrik where his pig is Cage takes him apart telling him what a bad employee he was and asking him why he opened a high end, trendy restaurant. Rob is empathetic but the criticism is devastating to Derrick. He finally confesses that Amir's father is the one responsible for the taking of the pig. Rob goes to see Amir's father Darius played by Adam Arkin. Darius offers Rob $25,000 for yhe pig and tells him to leave him alone. Rob asks Amir to help him get the pig back. He give him a list of things to buy. Later, Rob and Amir go back to Darius house but sneak into the kitchen and prepare a meal that Rob had served Darius and his wife years earlier. Amir asks his father to come to and all three men have dinner together. Being that its the exact meal that Rob prepared for him and his wife years ago brings Darius to tears. Rob pleads with Darius to tell him where hus pig is but Darius confesses that the guys who took her mishandled the pig and she died. Amir takes Rob back home and he listens to a cassette that his wife Lori made for him that he couldn't listen too before out of grief.The only expecation I had about this film was the performance by Nicholas Cage due to the accolades he's getting. I hadn't seen even a trailer so when I read the plot summary it seemed like the typical Nicholas Cage B grade revenge films he's been doing alot of for years now. This film is nothing like those. It is a film about dealing with grief and loss and how to start healing. Every performance is good here but this is Nicholas Cage's best performance since Leaving Las Vegas. It is a different performance from him in that it's quieter, much more more mature and mrmorable.Grade: B+",Pig
62,Brooklynsmagicmike,Everything was great except for the direction.,6,19 July 2021,"First I want to start off this review by saying this movie is most definitely not for everyone. Some of the genres this movie is listed under are highly inaccurate. This isn't a mystery or a thriller at all. This is a slow-burn emotional drama film. So please note that before going into this film that this isn't John Wick esque type of movie. Without giving to much away this movie follows a World Class chef who gave up the high life and instead decided to go into reclusion in the forrest with a pig, who is then stolen from him.The movie does alot of things well like the visuals which are really stunning, the acting which is excellent, and the plot was good to. Where this movie failed to me is that it is entirely to slow. Also it doesn't have enough exciting or thrilling moments as well as viewer could careless about any of the characters in this film. I understand what the director was trying to convey but it was done poorly. On top of it there were lot of things left unexplained that if explained, could of honestly helped the story along.Overall it isn't bad watch, I thought the movie was decent. But its most definitely not rewatchable or something memorable. I also personally wouldn't recommemd it unless you're looking to kill some time.",Pig

64,Darkjak007,Where's my pig?,7,20 August 2021,"When people think of Nicolas Cage they usually think insane over the top acting, but he is also a serious actor. Pig is one of those examples of taking a trip back to that other perspective of the cage man. Nicolas Cage plays a truffle hunter who lives out in the woods of Oregon with his pet pig,far away from the troubles of the city. He sells truffles to a local city dealer on the side. One night his pig is stolen by mysterious folk and now he must travel to the city to find her. Nicolas Cage gives one of his best films in recent years as this very dry serious mountain man. Who at the same time he does deliver humor still the same although it's quite more subtle. One of the examples being is that he doesn't change his clothes this entire film he's just going to all these places looking like this. However from the description of the film and how it's portrayed in the trailers many assume this is more of a John Wick style film only with a pig instead of a dog. It's worth noting that's really not the case. It's not an action film it's a drama of a man determined to go through all these step and personal hurtles regardless of what others might think. It's more of a man coming to terms with his past and chases want little disillusion he has left.",Pig

I'm a big cage fan and I also really like Alex Wolff too. Together they are good. There is one really touching scene towards the end when they cook together. Other than some decent acting, nice cage plays the same role as always where he speaks very little through out the film and for whatever reason the movie sleeve says ""the best work of nicolas cage's career"". Ummmm, definitely not. Lol. This movie is very reminiscent of Mandy which also stars cage seeking revenge. However, there is not much to chew on here. Too little information is given to the audience so the movie comes across as very confusing and plot less until a certain point but even then the secrets are underwhelming. It's things that should have been obvious to us to begin with. There is basically no violence which is kind of ok but then it at least needed a nice dramatic story, which this movie hides too well in a bad way.

No, these movies have nothing else in common, except maybe for the portrayal of loss.But ""Pig"" is not only about loss, it is a movie about love, loss, life. Nicolas Cage delivers a great performance, inhabiting this unusual character masterfully, and its journey is not to find solace in revenge.The whole movie is a very well accomplished balancing act that is weird enough to be intriguing and enticing, still managing to have a foot (or at least its toes) on the ground just enough to allow that previous suspension of disbelief. Again, this is accomplished only thanks to great performances from Cage and the rest of the cast, but it is also because the whole thing comes together as whole.Definitely one worth a re-watch.",Pig
76,sirwillisiv,Among 2021's best...,10,9 August 2021,"Pig is a film that completely defies expectations ... and for the better. If you saw the trailer thinking it was going to be some offbeat John Wick knock-off, you're wrong. It's not an action film by any means, it's a drama that tackles love, loss, moving on and forgiveness. These are common themes but told in a refreshingly odd, pensive and even devastating light. Starring Nicolas Cage, Pig follows a reclusive man living in the Oregon wilderness whose beloved pig is stolen from him. He returns to Portland - where he was once a renowned chef - to find it.This is perhaps Nicolas Cage's best performance in years. Raw emotion and riveting monologues, this film is a solid reminder that he can be a brilliant performer if given the right material. He's not acting goofy, he's not screaming like a maniac and he's not apathetically claiming he's going to steal the Declaration of Independence. He's being sincere, channeling a tender solemnity throughout and I found it surprisingly disarming. His character's motivation is identifiable and the complex history beneath his unassuming demeanor creates a lot of emotional baggage, humanly so.I really like films that on the surface seem simple and focus on one thing but have a deep and subtle mythos under the hood that leaves it to the audience to gradually piece together. Pig is one of those pictures and I didn't expect it to be so. It's never in your face with exposition. Brilliantly paced, powerfully acted and supported by crisp cinematography, Pig is purely genuine. A short and sweet emotional powerhouse and one of the best films of the year. Like The Green Knight, just know what you're about to see.",Pig

78,Otkon,Another successful surprise from the Brooding King.,8,28 July 2021,"He has never been accused of range in his acting. But when he has the script and the backing talent to do his one thing right, he nails it.This starts off as a Wick Cage revenge knock-off. It quickly turns in a modern Bicycle Thieves with a weird but brief post-modern excursion into Food Fight Club land.While it seems like a throw-away line, Cage's character Robin Feld explains fully why he left the culinary scene. It seems he has an enhanced memory condition. That is how he can recall the exact dish to trigger Darius. Feld isn't just a chef but a savant with a passion for food that made him a superstar. But it being Portland, pretentious and fleeting trends took over. No one cares about holding on to these memories. Not only does he remember Finway, he forces him to recall what his true desire was - not the ephemeral nonsense of molecular gastronomy that he sells to gourmands. And it reduces Finway to tears.That is why Feld leaves most of it behind. All those recollections of people having transcendent experiences of lasting joy, now ruined by hipsters slurping up flavored air. And the truffle business is his way to stay grounded, literally. Mushrooms grow on decay. And it is the culinary scene in Portland that is rotten.As we found out later, it was never truly about the truffles. And to whom or what the title exactly refers is left up to the viewer. The once-renowned chef living like a transient in the woods. The beloved animal that would have normally been on his menu but that he found unconditional companionship with. The customers swilling hoity-toity victuals from domed troughs in overpriced bistros.The ending is a heart-breaking. And Cage's standard dull-eyed poise hits so hard that the movie leaves you stunned. It wasn't just a pig, it was something ""to really care about.""",Pig

I also like the mystery created around Cage's character, who gives a solid performance making this movie better than it would be without.I like the pace, it's a slow burner drama, but maybe because I was expecting something else, it was a bit disappointing.The ending was quite anticlimactic to me, it didn't live up to the tension created to the point.Still, I enjoyed the movie, I found it entertaining and the chemistry between the main characters was interesting.Good movie, Cage can act in a movie without doing crazy stuff, that's undeniable.",Pig
80,jdring2007,"definition of slow burn, but it does burn, with sullen emotion and character, and a confused sense of realism",8,16 August 2021,"The headline says it all. This movie is, through and through, a drama. There is no suspense, no thrills, no action. But it isn't necessarily boring. Just slow, and nonetheless powerful. The acting is great, from Nicholas Cage to Alex Wolff and a small (but notable) appearance by Adam Arkin. The script is excellent and the production raw and crisp. Music is mostly on point, too. Some scenes drag unnecessarily, and even at 92min the movie feels like it could've been 80 without the loss of anything. Nonetheless an especially powerful ending, my only major critique beyond the slowness is the confused concept of realism. The grittiness portrays a tangible realism that holds your senses captive, and even the story itself, while a little on the exaggerated side of artistic, or dare I say poetic, feels plausible. Then there's the main character and his absence of cleanliness: for 2 or 3 days steady, as the movie progresses, he wears the same blood on his face and in his beard, the same exposed cuts and dirt. He goes into top tier restaurants with white walls and pristine dining (no, he wouldn't be allowed to enter), nobody bats an eye at his appearance and it takes eons for anyone to ask about his condition. He talks to a child by an open door for five minutes and never is noticed (unrealistic or just bad parenting?). That whole aspect felt so absurd and silly, just to cater to the grimy and painful aesthetic of the main character. Aside from that, great slow paced drama.",Pig
81,js-66130,CAGE CLOSED,9,16 July 2021,"Is this the movie year of the pig, or the year of the fungi? Yes, yes it is.Nic Cage never looked worse. Hair is long and matted. Scruffy beard hiding his face. Collecting scrapes and bruises and cuts that map his mug as the movie trudges on. He's never looked worse, and he's never been better.After years in B-movie wilderness, much of it quite grand in the manic, out of control demonic thespian sense, Nicolas Cage returns in perhaps his most restrained performance. It is all glances, silent pauses, old man groans and whispery words. And even when crap happens, the only fist clenched rage comes from the viewing audience.There's a lovely, comedic foodie aspect to this weirdo film noire tale, presented as a three course menu. So, very cool. A Baroque cinematic experience, full of deep reddish browns, shadowy portraits, exquisite detail, cartoonish characters, and scenes that beg for a scratch and sniff card (for better or worse).A dishevelled hermit in a wooden shack even his pig knows a wolf could blow down, Rob survives by collecting expensive, hip resto delicacy fungi with the guidance of his clever companion: The Truffle Pig! The backstory of this existence is murky, with only a few clues pointing to some kind of personal trauma. ""Pig"" slowly unravels a past Rob is uneasy to reveal, let alone revisit. His forced return to civilization is full of quirky tangents and story lines, altercations that surprise as well as incrementally clarify.As Amir, the truffle go-between dealer kid with a flashy yellow Camaro, a cocky attitude and wild-eyed disbelief, Rob's reluctant conduit to city life, Alex Wolf concocts some wonderful, odd-ball buddy-buddy chemistry, and a semblance of nervous, neurotic normalcy when matters grow out of hand.This is a small film (yes), with small ideas (maybe not), that flows in unexpected and startling directions (most welcome). Full of emotional angst and suffocating confrontations, it doesn't shy away from brutal violence, but save for one shattering scene, never allows the main character to stray from his messianic, martyr demeanour.Temper biased expectations, this is not recent Cage film bombast. It is something completely different, and quite special. Delicious.hipCRANK.",Pig

83,arabnikita,Nicolas Cage is positively outstanding,8,24 July 2021,"Pig (2021)I think we have reached a point where there should be a separate movie subgenre called Nicolas Cage Films. This man has been taking inexplicably bizarre projects about the most random topics and in the majority of the times, they end up being disastrous. When I heard about Pig, it sounded very unusual but strangely, I felt a mysterious energy drawing me towards this movie and when I saw that awesome poster, I simply couldn't resist. I didn't read the synopsis or any details and all I knew was that the movie is about a man trying to find his kidnapped Pig. Yes, you read that right, a kidnapped Pig.Rob is a seeming nobody who lives in the forest and spends his days looking for truffles with the help of his Pig. One day, that Pig gets stolen which greatly devastates our protagonist and forces him to go into the city and look for it. Soon enough, we discover that Rob has a mysterious past because the mere mention of his name, sends chills down people's spines. On the surface, this might seem like a John Wick film gone wrong but the neat aesthetics, the unusual narrative and the gravitas of the main character turn into an enjoyable piece of filmmaking and an outstanding character study.This movie exists and works solely because of Nicolas Cage and a somewhat mythical aura that he exudes with his presence. He is a man on a mission and his every word, glance and movement is focused on the final goal. It is not often that I see bizarre ideas executed so well in terms of both style and substance. It comes down to the first 10 minutes which portray the bond between Rob and his Pig, and if you manage to put aside your scepticism and genuinely feel that moment, you will certainly be able to enjoy this movie.

85,deadbull-95171,Nick cage brings his poetry back and makes something beautiful,10,12 August 2021,"The decades spent with his angry revenge thing must have have been a very bankable formula. In pig, when he's telling the chef at the fancy restaurant that he's not doing what he always really wanted, what he's really about, and when he meets the baker that still makes the salted baguette and he wants a second one......This is Nick's second one. I didn't know he still had it in him. With his moon shaped face and soul struck eyes he's taking it this time, the pain, not giving it. The layers keep getting pulled away, and we get to see who the guy really is, and what this is all about. There are constant small revelations about everyone. His best customer is his accidental betrayer.His last precious possession is his pig but it's really all about Laurie.He was moving in this direction with Joe, and there's always some violence involved, at least implied or extrinsic, but here his bad karma,
and you sense there were moments in the past, has been paid in full, but he's still taking not laying.Anyway, I'm not trying to be mystical, because the movie is pretty straightforward. It definitely foreshadows but in the main it's straightforward. The snippet of tape we heard is played in full at the end,
but we already knew what that meant to him.There's a lot going on here, and still Cage never loses that quality that combines deep involvement with a funny sense of him watching himself playing these roles with irony. Like how seriously is he taking what he's doing and how seriously are we meant to take it? That, even in the emotional extremity suggested here, the predominantly expressed detachment, would be confusing in any other actor but this one.The entire theme and the passion for the pig are metaphors, representations for much deeper issues that are not resolvable and are as permanent as his seclusion.It reminds me of Mickey Rourke's Wrestler, another favorite movie about
a similar sort of character. But whereas Mickey can go to the heart of teary eyed smaltz, Cage will be cool. But he breaks in this movie , and that is not something we see from this alpha guy.It's a special movie, especially if you like this actor's work, which I do a lot.It's a special movie if you never heard of him too.",Pig

87,PotassiumMan,A grand Nicolas Cage performance in an uneven film,7,30 August 2021,"Nicolas Cage gives a committed and painstakingly subtle performance (one of his best ever) in this quiet, offbeat drama about a truffle hunter whose peaceful existence is upended when his truffle pig is stolen by mysterious intruders. What follows is a journey into his past in which his story is slowly unpacked.A brooding aura is present throughout. The cinematography conveys Oregon to be a forlorn and unwelcoming place. Cage almost carries the film. Despite his brilliance, however, he cannot fully salvage a story that is underdeveloped. The underlying themes and metaphors are given a treatment so slight and vague that his protagonist remains something of an enigma in the end.The film's low-key, nuanced approach is a strength that ultimately turns into a liability. If a character is to be revealed to us slowly, the ultimate payoff cannot be spotty. I applaud the film's many strengths, but because it left me with some questions, I give it only a passing mark.

96,scottmannen1,Made into a Good Film Only Because Cage Did It!,8,18 July 2021,"Cage may be a bit of a disaster in his real life and personal life, but like most genius's they are quite different then the rest of us. Eccentric? Yes. Unorthodox? Yes. Destined to receive a lifetime award for some of the best acting performances ever to grace the silver screen? Undoubtedly!Cage is definitely eccentric but oh boy can he ever act when he gets a script written superbly!Cage can be hit or miss sometimes on his recent films, but when a well written script is presented to him, he most effectively can bring that film to another level with his acting chops! Mandy, Color Out of Space, Pig...his more recent jobs have all been made much better only because he chose to accept the roles in these films! Mandy most likely would have been a misunderstood disaster with anyone else in that leading role. With Nick that film transformed from a film that would have been a 4/10 with anyone else in the role was elevated to a 6.5/10.Color out of Space, a Lovecraftian horror flick would most likely have been a disaster around 4/10, and once again risen to a much better number only because Cage's portrayal not only made the show more interesting and a little crazy, but the viewer would think about the film and Cage in it for days after watching the film! It's no masterpiece, but Cage made it better.Pig, this movie falls right into the exact same position as those other films where this flick would have been written off as a total loss and simply not a good film with any other lead actor. Cage brings his charisma, his heavy step and his incredible aura into this role. You can feel this man's pain in the movie because one look at his exterior combined with the heavy heart you can see in his eyes and his next level acting chops once again leave the viewer thinking about this film and Cages portrayal for days after having finished this film! This film is a drama and a tragedy with heavy themes, complex personalities and is just a solid drama film. 8/10 on this one! If you don't watch drama films then you should avoid this one. If you enjoy this type, then it's worth your time just to see a master at work!",Pig

It again proves the actor's range and how a good director can make an actor.Unfortunately, that's where my praise ends, because everything else was severely mismatched... The script wasn't very cohesive, the pacing was inconsistent, the ""twists"" were what you could see coming from miles away, the characters had very little space to grow and the emotions of the movie are exhausted well within the first act. My biggest complaint is that I feel this movie wasn't sure of which path to take as it ends up being a mess of various genres leading nowhere.Overall, I didn't hate it, but couldn't love it either... and I know how much I wanted for me to love this the moment I heard of this movie.

But the thing is this for a movie like this I cant use bad words even now just because of Nicolas Cage,because I was in love with his character.

Nicolas Cage is back in his full dramatic form, however this boring movie did not do him any favors.

103,BijeshNagesh,Masterful Subtlety,10,7 August 2021,"This entire movie was amazing to watch - start to finish, no complaints.I never thought I'd live to see the day when Nicholas Cage would be acting in such a film. In my mind, the man has already won the Oscar for his role in the 2021 movie ""Pig"". His performance is the best I've seen in a long time - by Cage standards. It was subtle... It was brilliant... It was a gold-standard.I never knew Truffle Pigs were so important until I saw this film. Apparently, they're 'field stars' when it comes to truffle supply to the hotel and restaurant sector. The irony of those same industries eating pork and bacon was definitely not lost on me. Talk about eating the help.The film itself was quite different from the usual fare I've been seeing in 2021. It stood apart in its own light. Michael Sarnoski's direction was aces. Michael co-wrote the story with Vanessa Block, and the script turned out excellent. Patrick Scola's cinematography was clever and insightful. Editing was neat. Makeup was simple and good. Jayme Hansen's costume choices were great. Both Alexis Grapsas and Philip Klein did wonderful work on musical scoring. It was subtle perfection. And Whitney the Pig was a star in her own right.In all honesty, I couldn't really find any glaring flaw in this movie - as much as I wanted to do just that so I can bring some 'balance' to this review. I even 'un-biased' myself and visualized some random actor playing the role Nicholas Cage did, namely that of former big-wig chef Robin ""Rob"" Feld. Even then, I think the crew might have made this film work. It had all the professional elements and artistic talents needed for success. But Cage really brought his A-game to this one, let me be clear on that front.""Pig"" also reminded me of a fact that I have always been aware of... An emotional bond can and does form between people and animals - no matter the person, no matter the animal.This movie will make you cry. The filmmakers really outdid themselves in almost every category. ""Pig"" is cinema gold, and I hope as many people see it all over the world as soon as possible.

Nicholas Cage's career just keeps getting more interesting and I'm loving the projects he's involved with; some hits and misses but always inventive. Pig is absolutely not in keeping with Cage's recent more tongue in cheek work, this is 90% serious drama. It was sad and touching and looked absolutely beautiful on screen. The slowly building relationship between Cage's character and his unlikely sidekick is so well crafted and they are both easy to root for. What I loved most is how little exposition there was, just enough is said or shown for you to know the emotions that are driving the characters. All the way through I just found myself expecting one thing and getting something totally unexpected instead, in the best way.",Pig
106,brianjohnson-20043,Ok,6,17 July 2021,As of right now the score of this film is an 8.3/10. I don't think it deserves anywhere near that score. For me it was more of a 5.5-6-5. I enjoyed a few scenes and found the foundation of the story to be worth creating a movie around. I just didn't think there was enough meat to the story to keep me very interested during much of the ride. At only about a 90 minutes runtime. One would hope and expect for the movie to feel quick-paced and exciting. Instead it seemed like a slow burn sad independent movie(not saying sad or independent movies are all bad). I also found the filming to have more shaking camera-work than I prefer. I don't mind the usage of that type of shot for such a raw story as this one from time to time. But I felt it was used so much that it became distracting in a negative way. I also felt like they relied a bit too heavily on close-up shots. The acting seemed fine. I struggled to understand the dialogue a few times. But that might be a sound mixing and editing mistake more-so than an acting flaw. I left the film wishing that more of the movie had been like the scene when they talked to the chef at that high end restaurant in Portland. That was by far my favorite moment.,Pig

The elements of this film flows with a soothing vibe. The director has put together a presentation where you keep getting hyped for the next part as well as asking questions of what is about to unfold. Other actors have also delivered quite a performance. The story itself could have been more polished and intrigued and so does the screenplay. The ending leaves you with a thought that it could have been more emotion infused and impactful in some way. Overall, actor Nicolas Cage has starred in quite a feel good movie that you can definitely enjoy watching with your feet on the sofa.

Myself, I haven't since Nicolas in a movie for a long time and the ones I saw were forgettable with the exception of ""Leaving Las Vegas""And now what can I say, his performance in Pig is probably the best one I've seen from him, and if you had questions about his acting capabilities, if he was just a mediocre overacting individual or an actual talented actor who for whatever reason on a regular basis doesn't choose the best projects - your mind will be set once you see this movie.I have to say that I had different expectations as to what this movie would portray, but that shouldn't affect its execution.It's a slow paced movie yet it's interesting, the way they unveil the characters past and motivations, and while moving slowly it doesn't stop to be interesting.The main characters develop an interesting dynamic, and Cage's performance keeps you drawn as to what will he do next. Again by the end, the motivations and overall movie goal are made clear, it has more of a metaphorical lesson rather than being about a kidnapped pig and the adventure to bring it back, so don't expect a John Wick type of movie.I still believe it could have more depth and be more about the connection of man and nature, yet it's study about human feelings and how we can overcome the darkest tragedies in our life's.",Pig

If you haven't noticed lately, Cage seems to take any job given to him, Not what one would expect from what is still considered an A list celebrity. Yet here we are. And that truly is his genius, truly a thespian. Honing his craft for all time he has on this mortal plane and he should be applauded for it and probably honored more than he is for it.Ya know how Cage has been kinda crazy for the past couple decades and ya know how he wasn't before that.

They're simply not being fair.But PIG is so utterly empty and unrewarding -- and clearly has such airy, exalted pretensions -- that it deserves just one star.

There are plenty of beautiful, dialogue-free scenes, but by the end of the movie, I suspected they were just to pad the run time and give a facade of greater meaning.By the end, I felt completely let down by a rather shallow film.It's not one of those weird arthouse movies that's trying to be edgy or anything, but I felt like it was attempting to use artistry in place of a story, and that someone confused slice-of-life with depressing and nihilistic.Definitely not for someone looking for an actual story or a thriller, and definitely not any kind of action or suspense. I am actually weary after getting through 90 minutes and not having a payoff.Mostly I'm left with this aching question of why a rare foods vendor had a truffle pig stolen.

This is a character study and a film about love, loss, redemption and finding your place in the world based on your own circumstances.

More to the point is the last movie Nicholas Cage made before ""Pig (2021)"" Willy's Wonderland, a movie I would recommend far less than Pig; Pig is actually a great movie.It's a sad movie, a somber movie. A movie about loss, other people's expectations and being afraid to face your own pain. The movie is perfectly paced at 91 minutes and breaks the film down, literally, into 3 parts. It never lingers to long in a scene and keeps you guessing at the right moments. The actual pig in the movie is a metaphor but also a straight and narrow plot device moving the narrative along. I mentioned earlier that the movie is sad, but thanks to the exceptional pacing the movie is not miserable.Watching the trailer for Pig having it star Nicolas Cage coupled with the tagline ""I'm looking for a truffle pig"" with ominous music makes you think you are about to watch the Nicolas Cage version of John Wick, but instead of a dog being the revenge plot it's a pig!

After one such bite, Cage quipped: ""I've been set on fire, I've been in flipped cars but it'll be sepsis from a pig bite that kills me.""

The movie is quiet and dialogue is minimalist, and whatever is said therefore counts. We've been so used to crazy Nic Cage's antics over the past decade, one forgets that he is still an academy award winning actor. And so he proves in a magnetic performance, full of still pauses and slow burn deliberation. It's the story of a man who has left a stellar haute-cuisine career behind (perhaps due to the death of a loved one), to focus on what's important. Perhaps one can say the same for Nicholas Cage himself. Pic itself doesn't strive for effects and lets the story play out gently but inexorably to a devastating conclusion. A strong streak of indie style filmmaking is evident throughout, especially in a tender, wordless and pastoral coda. This is one of my favourite movies of the year. Don't miss it!",Pig

The acting all-around is great and is probably the high point of the film. As you slowly learn about these characters you find what ties them together is their miserably sad backstories. No one here in the truffle industry is normal, they are all somehow jaded or ""bent"". They are painted as apart from society, is this a real thing? Did the writer/director watch a Vice documentary on truffle hunters and this was the product?It's competently made (the scenes of grief and the brief moments of music stand out) but there isn't much in the story to latch on here. There needed to be more to the beginning, an intriguing start sort of repeats and folds in on itself before finally just concluding. A movie about cooking and loss and sadness and pigs... The scene at the first high-end restaurant is excellent and the final scenes finally tie everything together and make this one worth watching. Another bizarre one to add to Cage's repertoire.",Pig

The ending is even more rubbish. With the pig dead, Nic returned to his jungle home and turn on a mix tape given by his late wife.All in all, not a complete waste of time because TIL what truffle is.

159,thatfilmperson,The mere fact that it isn't canonical doesn't make it good.,5,26 September 2021,"If you liked:
You Were Never Really Here
First Cow
First Reformed""Pig"" is a 2021 extremely low-budget film with what looked like a peculiar and interesting idea for a plot. It was shot in only 20 days, and all actors had to get everything right from the first time as there was no budget for re-shoots or delays. It tells a story of Rob - a hermit truffle hunter (Nicholas Cage still acts??), whose truffle pig gets stolen during the first 10 minutes of the movie. It is then slowly revealed that Rob has some burdensome and shady past, as he and his buyer (Alex Wolff; ""Hereditary"") try to get the pig back. During this little adventure the film turns into a meditative philosophical tale about loss, humanity and human relationships, rather than merely about retrieving a pet pig. It has a strange, almost dream-like poetic-wannabe structure, and gives off a whiff of some global depression that is well-known to each and every human being on this planet.The film is far from cliché, but even further from groundbreaking or remarkable (reminded me a lot of ""Minari"" and ""First Cow"" in that regard). The mere fact that it isn't canonical unfortunately doesn't make it good; under the mask of deep philosophical questions lies an extremely simple idea that could have been expressed in a 10-minute short film. The only truly great things are the performances of both Cage and Wolff: Cage showing that he still can deliver an emotional performance; and Wolff once again proving that he has many great roles ahead of him.But aside from that - ""Pig"" is a very simple movie. Too simple.",Pig

There are some beautiful shots of the Oregon landscape that balance brilliantly against the city scenes and the editing feels very fluid, allowing the pace of the film to shift naturally.Pig has a lot more to say than the trailer and marketing suggested, and is well worth a watch if you're in a quiet and contemplative mood.",Pig
161,Aria_Athena,Beguiling and emotional film,9,17 July 2021,"It is Michael Sarnoski's debut feature length film and I am truly impressed. Beautiful movie, the more I think about it the more I like it. This is most certainly not a film without meaning.It's about loss and about the cutthroat business of fine dining. There are plenty of comedic and satirical elements, but they never take away from the drama. It's a film so packed with details and meaning, I had to go back afterwards, having seen the whole film, and pay closer attention to certain scenes.Nicolas Cage plays Rob, a man with eidetic memory who has completely turned his back to society after the death of a woman who we later learn was his wife. He lives in the forest, with a truffle pig being his only companion, and is gathering said fungi for a living for Amir, the second main character.The film starts with Rob being unable to listen through some tapes his wife left him. Soon after men come into his cabin and steal his pig, which he really cares about. His car breaks down, so he enlists Amir's help, being literally the only person he knows. The search for the pig takes them to the city, a place he hasn't visited for 15 years, but where he used to be a top chef and where his name still carries weight. This is information we fully get later on, but adds a lot of perspective to earlier scenesTheir first stop is an old acquaintance of his, who tells him his named used to mean something, but after all this time he doesn't exist anymore. Such is the nature of the business. But then they visit the same person's underground fighting arena, where chefs pay for the opportunity to take a shot at other chefs. There we see how much weight his name actually still carries. The moment he writes his name on the board everyone lines up for chance. Then the next scene is shot in a way that portrays how larger Rob's stature is compared to the highest bidder, as he tries so hard to bring him to his knees.So many great scenes take place during this movie. Rob visiting his old home and talking to a kid who now leaves there about a persimmon tree they used to have. The high end restaurant in which Rob talks to the chef he remembered from before. All the scenes where the radio is talking about classical music, drawing parallels between a composer and chef, classical music and the culinary arts. In particular I loved the second one, where while the camera shows a newspaper photo of Amir's father (who is also in the same business) with the tagline ""King of rare foods"", the radio host is saying we might listen to a musical tone, study it's quality, but it's the composer that brings it to life, saying essentially that no matter how good or rare the ingredients someone like Amir's father trades in, they are meaningless without Rob.Finally we learn that it was Amir's father that stole the pig, because of how successful his son's (technically a competitor) idea turned out to be. We also learn that his wife is in a coma and that she will never wake up, but he refuses to pull the plug because he can't let her go. Rob asks him for his pig back, but he starts being very hostile, says he will pay him 25k for the pig and threatens him while making a display of power. Rob assumes his wife's fate turned him into a cold man and proceeds to cook for him her favourite dish (Amir had previously commented about meeting the chef that cooked it) in an attempt to thaw out his heart. The moment he tastes it, he turns to tears and after a last attempt to kick Rob out of his house, he finally tells him the pig is dead. Turns out he was not insensitive and cold, but having known loss and also knowing about Rob's wife, he was only trying to protect him from the truth.Second to last scene is Rob and Amir, defeated, siting in a diner that doesn't even do pie. Rob says ""If I hadn't come looking her, in my head she (the pig) would still be alive"", to which Amir responds ""but she wouldn't be"". That's the conclusion of his character's arc. He has been running away from reality for 15 years, unable to come to terms with his wife's death. During this journey he started to get some closure, he goes back to his cabin and finally listens to his wife's tape.",Pig
162,Saoustou88,Surprisingly Brilliant,10,28 July 2021,"All I have to say is that this slow moving gem about dealing with your trauma and healing is a masterpiece.

163,thesuthernman,So much going on in such a short time.,9,21 July 2021,"Where do I begin? There were great performances (by everyone): Cage was powerful, but I felt Wolff stole the movie. Arkin, whom I normally don't care for, was perfect. It's not so much a movie about a pig and that was an interesting choice (or as I found out later probably because of budget issues--they could not afford a trained pig). It would have been nice to see the relationship between the pig and Cage's character developed more, they just gave a very brief taste (pardon the pun). Most movies of this nature would have manipulated the hell of that, animals can elicit easy sympathy. This movie didn't. They instead chose to actually rely on the relationships of the people in the film, and surprisingly, for a movie named after an animal, it worked.For me, this movie was more about a young man seeing his life through the circumstances of a lonely old man: his father, mother, past choices and future possibilities. All of which was made possible by him reluctantly taking the old man on a journey. But there was so much more, depending on where your sensibilities lie. There was an awesome subtle (perhaps not so subtle) criticism of societal obsessions and priorities, in this case--food. It was hilarious. But it also showed the beautiful part of food and how it is the sustenance of life in differing ways.Suffice it to say, I think there is something in this film for everyone. Even the supporting characters have a story to tell. This review is too long already, so I'll stop here--Bon Appétit!",Pig

It just leads up to a dinner scene with some guy who's supposed to be of importance somehow, but the whole plot and everything leading up to it just feels underwhelming and overly stretched out, like a singular truffle being scraped over the entire runtime.Admittedly there was some enjoyment throughout, but I did find myself checking the movie time around the 1 hour mark, then just waiting for it to end.Sure feels like a movie that could have been a whole lot more than it turned out to be. Felt like a missed opportunity to engagingly expand upon a fairly interesting concept.Worth a watch I guess, if you have 90 minutes to burn that will feel like a lot longer.",Pig

167,JoelAlexanderr,A meaningful yet difficult film about the demons of one's past,7,16 August 2021,"Nicolas Cage's newest project, PIG, sounds like a typical Cage B-movie with one look at the plot description. Cage plays a truffle hunter isolated in the Oregon wilderness who must return to his past in the city of Portland once his prized truffle pig is stolen from him. While the plot is admittedly ridiculous, this film has far more on its mind then just being a revenge movie similar to John Wick. It instead is focused on being a meditative drama about grief, confronting the demons of one's past, and attempting to move on with life. It doesn't necessarily succeed at being an emotional and engaging narrative, but in the end the meaning resonates enough to justify the short watch.While many people are raving about Cage's performance here, I felt that the highlight of this movie is Alex Wolff, who also has the most well-built character arc of the narrative. The core of the movie is clearly meant to revolve around Cage and the uncovering of his past, but I found myself attached to Wolff's character/performance and his struggles far more. Both characters are recovering from relationships in their past that haunt them, and they both find themselves staring the troubles in the face through the course of the search for the pig. The main reason this movie works is due to the meaning that is eventually uncovered regarding Cage's mysterious past and of the pig itself.What prevents this film from being the emotional masterpiece it wants to be is the pacing and presentation of plot elements. For most people, PIG will be just a series of weird culinary-related excursions that add up to a deeply unsatisfying ending. While the deeper meaning behind all of these odd events is the true message, I only processed the point once the movie finished. Because of this, it was impossible for me to truly feel the emotion behind the grief and heartbreak while I was viewing it.However, PIG could be successfully analyzed for its literary motifs for days on end, which may be what director/writer Michael Sarnoski was aiming for regardless. This is definitely not a film for everyone, but those who want a deep and thought-provoking experience that may not always make sense will find meaning here. The film definitely rewards multiple viewings and it cannot be said that a movie quite like it has been released this year so far.B.",Pig

On the one hand it's a drawn-out, low-budget movie that can at times be amateurish if not downright silly (chef's fight club? Really?), on the other hand this is an original story of grief, love and longing with a detective plot that outweighs the flaws.Nicholas Cage's screen presence pulls it all together, though talk of an Oscar is very optimistic. It's not like he needed a lot of range, or even lines, to play a taciturn, stone-faced, grief-crippled loner. But all credit to Cage, he does a fine job in a change-up role from the usual action schlock he does these days.The plot is an odd mix of backwoods pioneer/city foodie/gangster/detective/porcine romance but all in all, an interesting, quirky, indie movie with moody, wet Oregan and Portland backdrops.",Pig
189,danielnunez-81518,Don't call it a comeback,6,19 July 2021,"What about this is a comeback? Cage has been here and his last few well-known (keyword: well-known) movies have ranged from decent to great. I can't give this a higher score because it felt like the entire runtime was building up to something and then it just ended. The movie was great until it ended. ""John Wick with a pig"" people, hate to break it to ya. This is Tarkovsky with a pig kidnapping. Competently made character film with great development sprinkled beautifully throughout the minimalist plot, reminiscent of culinary art. This is a daring, bold turn here that will devastate all, but that devastation will hopefully turn into appreciation, similar to my experience.",Pig
190,aelthric,OK it isn't for everybody. But it is excellent cinema for those with and attention span greater than a goldfish.,10,19 July 2021,"This was a beautifully filmed movie and although the story was clearly too deep for some (Those who gave it really low ratings) for others it was deep enough to encompass a world of emotion and meaning and was shot in naturalistic colours bringing the story it told down to earth.The acting was absolutely a masterclass in character based acting utilising subtlelty and minimalism to convey powerful story telling instead of screeching smoking tire car chases and typical cliche revenge elements with bullets flying all over the place.If you want a non stop action movie with zero real storyline or plot but lots of gunfights, explosions, stunts, pretty colours, car chase scenes, choreographed impossible fights and more explosions go and watch one of the John Wick films or one of the Fart and Furriest, but if you do consider a film requires a storyline is more realistic and offers you the chance to exercise your brain then ""Pig"" is definitely worth a watch.Nevermind the Homer Simpsons giving this low ratings, they are clearly shills from an Oscars Rival movie company.",Pig

This should be serious Oscar bait, but probably won't be unfortunately. Not that I care about the Academy Awards.Perhaps my pleasant surprise in this movie was mainly due to my expectations going in. I expected/wanted a twisted revenge story for a man who was beaten up badly and had his truffle sniffing pig stolen from him by some crazed meth heads. What I ended up getting was a slow moving, emotionally engaging story about love, loss and greed. I suspect some of the negative reviews are due to others having expected the same things I did from ""Pig"", but they are not warranted.Acting was first rate as was direction, the score and cinematography. Run time was neither too short nor too long and while it ended on a bit of a cliff hanger (or at least no solid feel-good closure), there were no elements of the story left wanting.Solid 9/10 and I'll be watching again because it really is just a darn good flick.",Pig
197,jdowney-57-371157,Slow Moving But Engaging Story,7,16 August 2021,"There is a lot more good than bad in this movie. While it's true that it head feints at action to pull you into a metaphorical journey into grief and loss, it stays quiet and engaging for the duration. In that sense it seemed like an even more dialed down 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' styled movie, focused less on the crime itself, but on the crime as a pebble tossed onto a seemingly placid pond...creating ripples.The plot is simple...Cage is man who has given up on life, living alone in the woods with a Truffle Hunting Pig. The Pig gets stolen. Nick wants his pig back. So..the guy that he sells his truffles to helps him...and that leads back into the Town he has abandoned.There we learn who he was, why he left, the burnt bridges that he left behind. But we also learn that his young business partner has a similar story of loss and regret that parallels and intersects with Cage's.This is slight spoiler. They fool us with a really crappy plot device. The first place Nick goes when he hits town is to see an old friend who just happens to run some kind of secret fight club for the restaurant crowd of Portland. Talk about a WTF? All I can think is that they wanted us to think we were going to see a violent revenge drama. But considering what this story was about, the entire scenario is truly bizarre and out of place. The rest of the movie has us accept that Nick walks around for two days with serious injuries that he never bothers to clean up, as well as the idea that all of our waiters perhaps secretly go into dilapidated basement arenas to win prizes taking beatings for money.But after that we get back to this very quiet movie about this broken man who finally faces his demons, and then tries to repair some other people because he realizes what being human and losing what you love does to everyone. (As Hemmingway put it: The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places).Alex Wolff shares the most time with Cage, and he does a great job. My biggest criticism of the film is it could have done a little better job in getting us to relate to the conflict between his character and his father (played with dignity and strength by Adam Arkin). Wolff is the fulcrum that balances Cage's Rob character's tragic story against Arkin's Darius character's similar arc. Where Rob broke into retreat, Darius broke into ruthlessness. And both seem to know the other's back story and measure their pain against each other.In the end, neither man can be fixed. They just return to their lives more aware that they are damaged. The beginning of the healing process is where we leave them both. Amir (Wolff's character) sleeps alone in his beloved car. We don't know which way he will go.The acting in this movie alone makes it well worth watching. I recommend it.",Pig
198,chiefjournalist,Pig is a beautiful production.,10,10 August 2021,"Today I watched a movie called ""Pig"" and it starred Nicolas Cage. The very same Nicolas Cage whose spate of film choices over the last 10 years ... can best be described as spotty.Pig is a small film; about a man who hunts truffles with his pig in the wilds of Oregon's Forrest's. He's a hermit whose life is a self enforced solitude. He doesn't want to know you; he doesn't want to meet anyone he doesn't have to.But when someone kidnaps his prized porker (a truffle pig) an unexpected man of determination emerges from exile and begins the hunt for his ""truffle pig"" thru the gastronomic wilds of the ""Portland Restaurant Scene."" Slowly we begin to learn that Cage's character has depth.This isn't the typical Cage shoot'em up. His acting is subtle and genuine. His speech/dialogue is sparse and effective.In short ""PIG"" is a beautiful film and Nicolas Cage's performance is the stuff of legend.",Pig

With Sarnoski's story, screenplay, and directing, Cage shows all of his capacity as a fine elite tool in the hands of master craftsman Sarnoski.While this movie will be unappealing to the generation of viewers who need constant over-the-top stimulation and hyper sexuality or hyper violence, this retired industry professional is refreshed to see such an immensely well made piece of film in its traditional art form -- from precise framing to effectively sparse soundtrack, to consistent edit rythm -- few directors remain with such a skillset, which is embraced by Cage.

Movie is long enough that you get special details, makes you wonder and it doesn't just give you alllll the answers, people can have predictions. I'm not the biggest Nicholas Cage fan due to his usual crass movies. There are a few that are ok but this is finally a movie I appreciated! I wish they put in more for the ending!

211,orangehenryviii,Hokey Hogwash,4,17 July 2021,"This isn't the new edgy Nic Cage thriller it has been hyped as by a long shot, although his performance is great as always. The movie is rather a tepid foodie fairy tale centered around the Portland service industry, yet it is lacking the realism that might appeal to those in the industry or with a genuine love of cooking. Like the foodie phenomenon in general, it feels contrived, and also a little dated. There are no substantial characters here to become invested in, other than the pig, who is pretty damn cute admittedly, and no action to speak of. The basic story is a good idea but doesn't go the whole hog and the movie ends up being driven by the off-the-rack sad sack indie movie score, which ultimately became so wearisome I found the last half hour difficult to sit through. So in short, a good watch for Nic Cage fans who will enjoy his excellent turn as a somewhat more sedate yet also emotionally accessible character, but no ribbon for this pig.",Pig

229,trav123,Classic Film perfectly executed. Cage is Back!,9,19 September 2021,"This film was a complete wonderful shock of a surprise especially to see a great actor like Cage finally get a script and director that shows his unique talent again. It has been a long time yet this film starts off a little slow and strange but stick with it as the entire story comes together perfectly executed like a classical piece from Bach or Mozart from start to finish. It is not a thriller or an action film but a classic like Being There.Luckily I did not know anything about the film and advise to go into it with little reference as it is unique and strange in its own manner. Yet i would compare it to Manchester by the Sea, Adaptation, or Being There. It is beautiful done and is well written story that slowly develops about a down and out torn hero/chef from Portland and how losing his pig brings him closer to his past and along the way develops a wonderful journey with his side kick young Amir and many colorful characters.The cinematography is extremely well done almost looking like a John Wick film even in the look of Cage but that is about the only reference to that movie as it is less about violence and more about deeper issues of love, inner journey, restaurant life and eccentric chefs that remember every meal they made for each customer - and every detail to perfection. And the troubled past that makes the central character lose his path except for the love of a pig he ventures on a wonderful journey through Portland to find himself Again.The acting is superb and the minimalism works to perfection along with a unique score that makes this director bring together a classic film. A rarity these days yet it might not be everyone's truffle as fine gourmet cuisine is an art form.A solid 9 and looking forward to.

233,ddmcd-34250,A wonderful walk on the weird side,9,9 September 2021,"It's understandable to compare this movie with Nomadland. Both deal with outsiders who, for various reasons that are semi-revealed during the course of the movie, have turned their backs on ""normal"" society.In the case of Pig, Nicolas Cage plays a forest recluse who lives frugally and ekes out a living by finding and selling truffles to a young Camaro-driving middleman. His only companion is a pet pig who follows him everywhere and for which he cooks very nice meals. He loves the pig. Dog lovers will understand.One day his beloved pig is stolen. He goes to town to hunt down the perpetrators. He starts by hooking up with a community of itinerant truffle farmers. From there he re-enters - painfully -- the urban society he left 10 years before.Gradually, as is the case with Nomadland, past secrets are revealed as the details of the past unfold.While I found Nomadland to be sad and depressing (though well produced and acted) I found Pig to be simultaneously puzzling and entertaining. It is beautifully photographed. Both inside and outside scenes are carefully framed and shot and make excellent use of lighting conditions of all kinds. At least one scene reminded me of Edward Hopper's Nighthawks painting; I can't believe that was accidental.What carries the movie is Nicolas Cage's performance. This is not the chew-the-scenery Cage we've grown to love. Instead we have a toned down but tightly coiled loner who as he goes about his business transmits both strength and vulnerability. Cage does a great job with the part and deserves a lot of credit for carrying this movie on his shoulders. He's on-screen almost constantly.Pig will not be everyone's cup of tea. It's very weird at times but is never boring. If you're looking for something that is not run-of-the-mill, check it out.",Pig
234,FelixisaJerk,"John Wick, with a pig right? Taken, with a pig right? Wrong.",8,16 July 2021,"No hardcore spoilers but plot details are examined. Maybe you should read this after?There's your warning.Got to catch a premier of this at Cinema 21 in Portland. It's a little extra special being as though the movie was filmed in Portland and made even cooler that the writer/director and writer/producer were there in attendance.Pig opens in a forest, and a hermit looking man named Rob (Cage) is truffle hunting with his swine-companion merely named Pig. It feels old-world. It's beautifully shot. Then all of a sudden a bright yellow Camaro comes blaring up the path to Rob's hut. Wow, this takes place in 2021? It was surprising. Inside the Camaro is Amir (played by Alex Wolff of Hereditary fame). He buys the treasured truffles from Rob and sells them to high-end restaurateurs in Portland. One night thieves break into the hut, assault Rob and steal Pig. Rather than getting the blood-soaked rampage audiences could easily assume they're in store for, we get a quiet, slow burning story that painfully unfolds through Portland's underground foodie scene.Nic Cage gives a measured, contemplative performance fueled by grief and anger but rarely letting himself emote or explode. When he speaks it's thoughtful and heavy. This is a wonderful project for Cage, and I love seeing actors do great work. Especially aging actors. Cage still has plenty of mileage left as he doles out the performances that pay the bills but also undertakes the roles that are challenging from talented filmmakers who realize he isn't a dancing, screaming monkey. We slowly learn small snippets of information about Rob. He's been living in his hut in the woods for over a decade, but at one point he was a chef of legendary renown. Simply saying his name turned heads and raised brows from chefs and customers alike. One day he disappears. We never really learn why, but it likely has to do with the death of his wife and the jaded cynicism with modern cuisine.There is a good scene in which Rob explains to a higher end, five star chef that the pretentious food he is serving isn't real, the ""foodie"" customers aren't real, none of this modern malarkey means anything. It's bloated, it's fake, it's tasteless. This devastates the chef but there is a certain truth to what Rob says. Cage's delivery here is intense and dark but almost said with a note of self defeat. It's good stuff.Rob partners with Amir to find out where Pig is and how to get her back. Alex Wolff gives a strong performance. To act alongside Cage and not just be overshadowed requires good writing and great performing. The team they form is funny and at times tumultuous yet most importantly they're believable. It also helps Wolff has a great emotional range on the canvas of his face. There are close up shots of him processing what's going on and he says so much without ushering a word (reminiscent of Hereditary). It's powerful stuff. Amir is trying desperately to make a name for himself in the industry without using the credentials of his celebrity chef father who he has been overshadowed by his entire life. After the loss of his mother, he and his father have little reason to communicate.The reason this film is successful is because the duo is so good. Pig could've easily followed Rob the entire time but the fact that it doesn't gets us invested in both men and their plights for resolve by the end of the film.Pig takes the difficult approach to dealing with grief and loss, it demonstrates the power of difficult conversation compared to the standard issue shoot out. I respect that. I appreciate it used violence as a catalyst to the plot but never to solve itself. That is realistic. Much like real life, the characters we meet continue living without drastic change. It's an interesting film made with a lot of love and care. I was feeling a little melancholic at the end of the film. I felt robbed of the emotional payoff I was setting up in my mind. I didn't get that, and I respect Pig for that. I am curious to see what first time filmmaker Michael Sarnoski has in store for us next.",Pig

Along the way he ends up helping a young associate after taking him on a wild tour of Portland's underground, including a bizarre ""fight club"" of sorts among Portland's restaurant community.Weird at times, sad, and even touching, PIG is a real surprise and another fine notch in Cage's ever-growing arsenal.",Pig

248,gregorymannpress-74762,"""Pig"" written by Gregory Mann",6,16 July 2021,"""Pig""""Pig"" tells the story of Robin Feld (Nicholas Cage), a 'truffle' hunter, who lives alone in 'The Oregonian' wilderness. Rob is gifted at caring for animals. When his beloved foraging pig is kidnapped, he must return to his long-abandoned past in Portland in search of his pig, to recover her. He looks more bushy-bearded and hobo-like than usual. He returns to the city to track down the swine, so to speak, who stole his 'truffle' pig. In these dark and uncertain times, at least we can still worship at the church of Rob. In terms of oinktastic cinema the pig faces stiff competition in another film released this year about an even-toed ungulate, which was sow good; the amazing 'Gunda'.The film chronicles the life of a truffle hunter in crisis; after his pig is kidnapped. Set against the stunning backdrop of 'Oregonian' wilderness, ""Pig"" shows thé search of a small-scale truffle hunter for his beloved pig. Deeply immersive, the film is a poetic snapshot, a contemplation on compassion, ethics, and the changing landscape. In intimate detail, it captures the.hunter's personal upheaval as he questions his own morality and the value of life. 'Truffle' hunters will camp out on their porches at night, shotgun in hand, to fend off competing hunters trying to steal their valuable pigs and dogs. What? That's one of those facts that felt otherworldly yet immediately relatable to us, and that's where ""Pig"" starts. It get us imagining what sort of person would be so attached to their truffle pig that this would be a quest worth following. There's the image of this tattered old man, alone in the woods with only his pig. Where did he come from? Then his world and history starts to unfold around him, and ""Pig"" begins to take shape. And as the story grows, something from our own life inevitably creeped it's way in. It throws us into a state of feeling like the world is a dream.We're going to wake up from. Everything feels a little like we watching it from outside ourself, and it's hard to fully commit to the reality of the world and other people. We expect the feeling to go away one day, but as we get older, we find it doesn't naturally go away. You just get used to it and integrate it into your worldview. Different people integrate grief into their world in different ways, and it shapes how they see themselves and the people around them. We see this with our own immediate family; how the loss trickles into everyone's life in various ways, and how after many years those ways have just become our disparate realities. Not the immediate effects of grief, but the long-term, perception-defining aspects that weave into our lives and the bedrock of our consciousness. How that can make us build walls around ourselves that separate us from others, even others that are going through the same thing in their own ways. The hunter's' inner reflections share his struggle to align life with values, and through the story's simple intimacy, the hunter's moral quandary quietly becomes our own.""Pig"" is conceived as a meditation on life, death and personal values. The film is intended as an immersive experience where the viewer shares the character's daily life and growing anxiety. It unfolds unhurriedly, often in real time, immersing the viewer in the life of a truffle hunter. The pace of the film allows time and space to experience one's own thoughts. Quietly, the viewer embarks on an intimate journey of their own. We don't get a lot of things to really care about in this life. For much of our society, there's a huge disconnect between what we eat and the source of that food. The film moves deep into a hipster city's glamorous foodie culture. It's about kitchen staff in the city's fey, foodie-favored fine-dining eateries. Who better to help explore that disconnect, and inspire compassion for all beings, than a truffle hunter experiencing his own evolution of thought? Through it's intimacy, this story has the power to reach an audience that might not have contemplated these issues.Written by Gregory Mann.",Pig
249,reprisecompilation,Nic Cage acts in this movie. Really.,10,21 July 2021,"First of all: it is a good movie and different.Secondly: When Nic Cage is a cultural meme and most often than not ridiculed, this movie becomes just another example that he still has ""it"", he is a good actor when there is a story and an interesting way to tell it.""Mandy"" or ""Color Out of Space"" were similar endeavors.It's good to watch something where not everything is told but left for imagination, too. The movie does have a little artistic feel and an indie vibe - making it better.Sure, it's a Nicholas Cage movie, different level of subtle crazy, but with the layered portrayal of loss, sheltered pain, grief and brokenness.The film is probably not for the high profit, it's more about filmmaking and giving something to the cinema-goers/armchair watchers they can take with themselves.Absolutely worthy.",Pig
250,jameshome-90-686274,Excellent work by everyone except one,7,19 August 2021,"First, great work my Cage. It is SOOOO nice to see him when he is acting in a role that deserves his immense skill. The writing, directing, and acting are excellent. My only issue (as an actor and director myself) is with the director of photography. It is so very tiring to see yet another very good, possibly great, film use the ""Hand-held shaky camera effect"". Unfortunately, the effect, is based on pseudo-psychological science at best and is a complete lie at worst. The ""shaky camera"" DOES NOT simulate real life for viewers, AT ALL. Our brains are being fed a constant stream of information from all our senses and, therefore, out brains MUST edit the information so we can function. We, for the most part, are not aware of the motion of our heads/eyes each moment. Using the ""Shaky Camera"" effect FORCES an unnatural situation on our brains. It is NOT realistic and NOT clever. It is a short-cut used for cheap effect when the director of photography does not have faith in the other elements of the scene.",Pig
251,averylubocki,Absolutely Beautiful,10,17 July 2021,"""Pig"" is an excellent movie. Everything about it is excellent. Micheal Sarnoski directs an amazing looking movie. There were plenty of great visuals throughout the film that I'm not going to forget anytime soon. Nic cage is fantastic and better getting some awards thrown his way, as well as Alex Wolff. Both of their characters are lovable and the chemistry between the two of them is spot on. The movie explores themes of life, friendship, and loss perfectly, all in one of the best screenplay's of the year. The end of the film actually had me tearing up quite a bit.

It's so sad that marvelous movies like this get this kind of reception for being so original and well done.This movie is just fantastic. Obviously for a lot of people this seemed like ""Nicholas cage goes full John Wick in search for his pig!"". This couldn't be further from that. It's about so, so much more interesting themes. For anyone that potentially want to make movies in the future, this is one of the best examples of a simple premise executed flawlessly with a story that never, ever gets dull and keeps you engaged throughout the whole thing. Nicholas Cage is fantastic, so is Alex Wolff and amazing from a first time writer-director. Can't wait to see what Michael Sarnoski does next.

Pig (2021) gives an answer to that and at the same time defies all the expectations at every turn that it felt both weird and un-weird. It is rather an anti-revenge movie, a tender, meditative tale of coping with loss and emotionally affecting ever lasting feeling of grief. While the first time writer/ director Michael Sarnoski polished and nailed pretty much all the aspects (the way occasional outbursts of humor are handled is particularly excellent), the star of the movie unsuprising is Nicolas Cage who underneath long beard and swollen face shows the vulnerable and melancholy side of his that we have never seen before. He is undoubtedly at his best in years with understated, quiet, almost monk like performance. In his brief re-entering into a society Cage's character Rob took a swipe at the superficiality of modern restaurant-culture, faced with the past and gave love to those who needed, but the real potency lies in the way he delivers the most difficult task of forgiving when asked.",Pig

258,TruthTeller98765,Masterclass in filmmaking - the twist that makes it magical may leave you feeling duped,10,18 July 2021,"If you have watched the trailer for pig, then you probably were shocked at how much of a John Wick knock off it it looks like. What pig managers to pull off in an hour and a half is absolutely amazing. The phrase subverting expectations has a rough history of late after what happened in Game of Thrones during its final season. However, pig manages to subvert expectations magically. It manages to twist all of your expectations on their head. It is most certainly not a John Wick knock off. That's why so many reviewers are mad. They went in expecting John Wick, or Taken, or Nobody, and at the end of the day it is nothing like those films. In fact, it almost mocks the viewer in terms of them expecting an action film and for the movie to suddenly turn into John Wick, yet it never does. The entire movie you are certain that a big action scene is about to break out, but the film knows that, and it's really your own expectations that leave you feeling sad if you are disappointed that does not occur. The bottom line is if you walk in expecting John Wick, and all you want is John Wick, this movie will not please you.",Pig

It also has to be noted that our disheveled hero goes through the entire movie filthy dirty, bloodsoaked and battered in many public places without nary a raised eyebrow, which stretches all boundaries of credibility... and i'm not talking about the pig here!Regardless of its faults, this sombre thought=provoking tale of love, loss and loneliness is worth a watch if you want to check out something fresh and quirky, and it's certainly good to see the enigmatic Nic Cage putting in a such solid turn again in between his many recent howlers (take note Neeson, Madsen and Willis).

It was an excellent character study and Nicholas Cage's subdued performance was spot on.

268,jessefelt,"Strange at first, excellent by the end.",9,17 July 2021,"It starts out feeling weird as balls, with an almost cognitive dissonance invoked by the similar vibes to existing properties such as John Wick or Taken. At first I was not sure whether to take this movie seriously or to view it through a lens of tongue in cheek fun-poking at a film industry that all too often resolves to copy catting successful properties rather than bringing something new, interesting, and risky to the table.It would be too easy to see Nick Cage on the poster and assume the worst, that this is just some oddball little movie that made for an easy payday. Maybe that is what it was, maybe not. But I wholeheartedly feel that Pig has managed to be more than the sum of its parts. Nick Cage puts in a tremendous performance that feels like nothing I've seen from him before. His character feels legitimate, vulnerable, and grounded, even while surrounded by the sometimes surreal setting, such as the underground chef fight club.You could say that this film has all of the Nick Cage with none of the Nick Rage. By the end of the film I found myself completely empathetic to each of the characters despite there having been no drawn out exposition to inform me of their past or what brought them to where they are today.Don't let the trailer fool you, this is not your typical Nick Cage vehicle, filled with over the top ridiculousness. This film is definitely a character drama through and through. It's a sometimes slow burning journey into the soul of our main character and those around him. Fueled by what seems to be a true passion for food, almost akin to the level which we saw in John Favreau's Chef (2014). While I would place that film a step higher on the ""food lovers films"" list, I was constantly reminded of the care and attention given in that film and suspect that at some point in the production process someone who loves food was involved.",Pig

He drew me to this film, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.I had read that this wasn't a ""revenge"" film, which Cage has become associated with, mostly due to his participation in ""Mandy."" And it's true - this is not a movie about revenge, it is a film about love, and about loss.Paced very well, with good performances throughout, and some very nice cinematography (as well as some very amateurish, ugly hand-held camera work - so it is a little uneven), this is a finely made film. Especially if it is true that it was shot in 20 days!The premise, the characters, the whole world (a fight club for chefs?) requires a certain suspension of disbelief... but if you allow yourself to be immersed in this world, the performances will not let you down. The characters, their motivations, and their journeys, all hold true.I really look forward to seeing more from this director, and I am happy to see Cage appreciated for his talent.",Pig

295,cetibbitts-06052,Excellent...but misunderstood,9,2 November 2021,"I think this movie gets a bad rap. When you think 'Nick Cage: going after people who stole his truffle pig' You are probably expecting John Wick with some extra over the top hot...you aren't getting that here and I think that's expectation/presentation could ruin this movie.This movie has a lot more heart and a lot more warmth than I expected. Trying to write a synopsis for this film is difficult but essentially what it comes down to is: 'A recluse returns to the city to retrieve his stolen truffle pig and is reminded of his past and how he inspired others.' Really that's the movie; there is also some cooking involved.If you come to this movie knowing what it is, you will see how underappreciated it is. It's a simple story, but Nicholas Cage is in top form when it comes to acting. And the cinematography is excellent. So many people want an original film but overlook something because it gets a bad reputation since it was marketed incorrectly.Give it a chance if you want an original story that should have been presented as a character drama.",Pig

301,nowrozefarhan,"Tale of a broken individual, both in past and present",7,21 July 2021,"Michael Sarnoski's debut feature, Pig, is mostly a character study of an individual dealing with past and present loss. The film also touches the concept of road movies ,unlikely friendships, some existential themes and dissects anti-revenge motif. Nicolas Cage plays Robin,a desolated individual living in the Oregon woods, selling elusive truffles. One day his prized truffle pig is abducted by some people. Escaping death, Robin sets out to find his pig, with the help of his young dealer, Amir.Sarnoski delicately creates our protagonist character Robin,a man of mystery. The other character, Amir is also somewhat quirky. He knows a little of Robin, apart from the fact that he's a truffle hunter. But as the two set on a mission to find the pig, through Amir's eye, we slowly get to know Robin. Amir takes him in his car from place to place. They travel, form an unlikely bonding, considering their age and status. Scene by scene we see Robin's tragic past unfolding. He suffered some terrible losses in the past forcing him into isolation. But what will he do now as his only companion in the woods gets stolen? Will he take revenge? Or get into another phase of his self-exile?Nicolas Cage gives a powerful portrayal of grief stricken person suffering from immense pain and agony. Robin is also a stern example of an established figure turned into ruins. It could be a wild guess but I was thinking about the similarities between Robin and Cage himself, about how both of them went downhill from top in their respective careers. Who knows!There are lots of plot elements in the film. But what Pig suffers most is that it gives us glimpses ,but never really explores them. Robin's dilemma about his pig, his past life, his sorrows, Amir's own personal problems- all of these are touched but remained solely on the surface. As a result, I was left with a mixed feeling of wanting more. The film seemed to end just when it looked to be building for climax. It did have a potential to be a great film but fell short.That being said, Pig does make some strong points. It marked a strong directorial debut for Sarnoski. There were some serene wide angle shots of Oregon wilderness throughout. But most of the time the camera was close to Robin, capturing his brawls ,sweats and raw emotions. It's also great to see Nicolas Cage back with one hell of a performance. Surely we can expect there's more to come from him.",Pig
302,brendancrowl,Pig (2021),6,15 September 2021,"Pig is one of the more bizarre films that I have recently witnessed by far. And man believe me when I tell you that I didn't know what to make of this. In this film, Nicholas Cage plays Rob, a farmer who lives on a farm in the middle of nowhere with his pig. One day his pig gets taken away by an unknown bandit and now it's up to Rob to go and save his pig's life. He is then joined by Amir (played by Alex Wolff) who agrees to help Rob with his quest to go save his pig. Wolff and Cage's acting chemistry in this movie is decent but it just wasn't what I was hoping for. Now I'm not saying that Cage is a bad actor, he's done some great films in his career. This movie just isn't really his best and I didn't think it was that good at all. The plot was okay, the cast was halfway decent, and the acting was very bland. I give this film a 6.5/10 at best.",Pig

315,MouazHajBakri,When an active Volcano is utterly more beautiful than Seattle,8,1 August 2021,"Pig, directed by Michael Sarnoski, his first movie debut, along with a stunning performance by Nicolas Cage -undoubtedly one of the best performances in his career- is a remarkably powerful, deep, and multi-layered picture, that maintains the personal, embraces the simple and touches intimately. It's a story of a brilliant man whose grasp of the world had failed throughout a progressive realization that his attachment to the proud things of his life was nothing but an artificial sick joke, and all had led him to a life of escape and solitude. His abode is nature, and his profession is truffle hunting, and his only companion, the only other soul that he bonded with and ate with and smiled with, was his truffle pig. The setting is simple and is not the most original, yet what elevates and styles and polishes it, is everything around it; The melancholy of the dimmed lighting throughout the picture, the modest dialogue, the rawness of nature, the dry unwashed blood on Cage's bruised face, his dirty ragged hair, and all this honesty's and innocence's contrast with the heinous, senseless, soulless, noise of the city; Its evil, and all the ""civil"" things that march with it. This is a sad story of a man with a dying hope in a dying world, in a desperate pursuit of a brittle reality that he created at the corners of what is left alive; And this story with all its pieces, is relatable, empathetic, universal, and is unapologetically utterly nihilistic.The setting has a man in escape from civility. His profession as a truffle hunter is an emotional metaphor of the chase of the hidden gems in nature, rather than money or materials or the modern-day consumerism that ridiculed all values. His companion is sweet and smart and innocent, and despite the expected distance from the idea, this friendship with all its depths and tenderness, is very relatable and close to the universal human needs that we all share. His companion gets kidnapped by pitiful men to be sent to the big people of the truffle industry in the city. The movie is the journey to find the Pig, and the journey takes us to a beautiful and profound analysis of Cage's character and several others around him. The depth of his character is magnified by a secondary character of a naive teenager that is consumed by his modern car and its stereo with its constant nagging songs and the pretentious commentary in between. The journey takes us to Cage's past as a renowned legendary chef who trained many and left everything behind. And this journey embarks with the big man, the corporate man, the money king, the bureaucrat selfish monotonous villain who took the pig. The journey is relatable, not solely with me, but with all its characters, and the evil man was too in the hunt, as was Cage, for something that can truly feel real.The story is an illumination of the hopeless present and its absolute grim future, hence, finds solace only in the past, the nostalgic, and the defining old moments of our lives. For Cage, the warmth of his past was in a beautiful recorded voice of a partner; Amongst relationships of colleagues and students in the past; In the taste of a mushroom tart, a bottle of wine, and his old friend's salted baguette. For the villain, as he is as human as Cage, yet lost and angry, his Rosebud was an old magical meal in a magical restaurant of a magical night with his deceased wife. Most of the character traits, their struggles, and their choices, were stemming from an ultimate escape from the now, and a desperate need to recreate the past, reflecting a general sense that we too have little to be truly interested in and are more and more feeling the scarcity of what can be felt as real.Pig is an odyssey and a love story that ends in failure and deep loss, one of a magnitude of utter depression, complete hopelessness, and the death of meaning. It ends with characters realizing -maybe for the first time in decades- that all they had, all they consumed, all they chased, all they aspired to be, were all hogwash, unreal, and little but mere senseless stupid lies in prisons that they had forgotten, and are of their own making. Pig ends embracing remorse, as a sad poem written about the ends of all things. It's an experience that forces you to reflect and walk aimlessly, hoping for a calm breeze in search of quietness and silence. Yet the world is full of cars and screens and pretentious songs and is impossible to escape, but the deep beauty of the glimpses of realizations of the invisible bars around us and the shackles on our ankles, is perhaps the ultimate goal of existentialism, and the path to having a truly real destiny.",Pig
316,shamis-881-25789,I never bother leaving reviews but for this one I had to,10,19 July 2021,"An awkwardly beautiful masterpiece.

Thank you, to everyone behind the making of this fine art.",Pig
317,Johntechwriter,"Fans of Cage's ""sensitive"" movies are in for a treat",10,9 November 2021,"If the last five years haven't been enough to convince you of the terminal dumbing down of a large percentage of the American population, a reading of the majority of IMDB's reader reviews of the 2021 film ""Pig."" will leave you in no doubt. To most who commented, this magnificent film was as wasted on them as pearls before swine.I've seen ""Pig"" and won't spoil it for you if you're considering seeing it yourself. But it might be helpful if I informed Cage's two distinctly different audiences which of them would like it.If you are from the audience that enjoys a manic Cage bouncing off the furniture, as in films like ""Mandy,"" ""Trespass,"" and ""Bangkok Dangerous,"" you might want to give ""Pig"" a pass. But if ""Joe"" (except the last 10 minutes) or ""Leaving Las Vegas"" were enjoyable or at least fulfilling for you, what you saw in those films you will see even more of in ""Pig."" Which is to say, the spectrum of human feelings as experienced by characters you come to know.This is a film about loss. Cage's character experiences it most acutely, but the trauma of being deprived of something or someone vitally important in a person's life is felt by each of the main characters. As it goes along, the story makes clear that some things are worse than loss: among them, not being aware you are experiencing it; and worse, being too shallow to be capable of feeling it.The vacuous sentimentality of most of today's movies, contrived as they are to appeal to audiences whose souls have been numbed by social media and reality TV, is completely absent here. Probably that is the reason the film bombed in theaters and was quickly transferred to streaming media -- Prime and Apple at this writing.Today's audiences need to be spoon-fed from the standard menu of Hollywood corn about the nowhere lives of cardboard characters, because that is all they know. Here they have Cage reacting in super close-up as succeeding emotions wash over his features in barely detectable waves. Make that completely undetectable to most American audiences. But the ones who get this movie are in for a treat.I long suspected Cage was capable of a role like this and now I own the movie because I'll be watching it in the years to come. Not just for Cage's performance, but also for the fine work of the supporting cast; for the writing; for the restaurant racket back story (Anthony Bourdain would have loved this film); and for the camera work and the music. What makes all these elements cohere is the direction by first-timer Michael Sarnoski. That this is his directing debut is almost beyond comprehension. We can look forward to some very fine work from this guy.I hope he will once again direct Nic Cage. Sarnoski and Cage are locked into the same artistic laser beam, and the result of their collaboration is like oxygen to American film lovers who have been drowning in superheroes and Kardashians for what seems like forever.",Pig

Grief and loss are always worthwhile subjects for drama, but not when it's overwrought. Motivations for the other characters, especially for Amir, are absent or simplistic. The dramatic arc consisted of man loves pig, man loses pig, man returns home.

367,amiableshark,Oscar-winning Cage returns for a meditation on grief,8,27 September 2021,"This film is the drama version of John Wick, whereas instead of hitting people with bullets, he hits them with truth bombs! The often dimly lit, range of panning shots and slow cuts lead to a naturalistic feel as the film weaves between a divisions of parts from cottagecore to a shady, mafia-type underworld of the restaurant industry. Focused on loss, but also human connection and redemption, even the arrogant side-kick for this most unlikely of buddy-cops in the pursuit of a lost pig end up being fully fledged characters in a work that may be Cages best in recent history, with a somewhat restrained, morose performance. I found this surprisingly moving tail of personal tragedy compelling, intriguing and emotive as I got enwrapped in the communities portrayed within the narrative, with moments of understated humour providing much needed release. A sleeper hit if I ever saw one, an original film that builds tension well and makes it onto my top ten movies for 2021.",Pig

I plan to buy it next - if that tells you anything about how I feel about it.I loved this film and thought both Nicolas Cage and Alex Wolff did an exceptional job acting in it. It made me think of who/what I have in my life that mean the world to me and how I would feel if it was taken away from me. OR... how far i might go to get 'it' back. It really pulled at my heart-strings.I loved the story-line where Rob (Cage) made a huge impact in so many others lives, that after 15 years of not seeing him, people remembered him in a fond way, and wanted to help him out. Several folks didn't even know he was alive but when Amir mentioned his name.. and what Rob needed they cared enough to help him out, however they could. Some of these people thought he was dead... until he showed up looking like he needed a shower, his hair grown out wearing dirty, bloody old clothes... And his face not only dirty but bloody.I also loved Amir (Alex Wolff) and how he really cared about Rob, even though much of the time he wouldn't respond back to Amir, when Amir asked him question. And even after Rob, in his frustration, kicked the heck out of Amir's treasured Camaro. He was there for Rob, when Rob needed help, taking him wherever needed & doing whatever Rob asked him to do. You could see/feel he cared & respected Rob..And though the ending worked well for the story, & it could have been worse.. I wish it had a happier ending. I feel there are so many movies/shows out there that don't have a happy ending.. and right now with Covid, people losing loved ones, with the negatively and hatred out there.. having a happier ending with this movie, wouldn't have changed the ratings. Many of us have had a painful year. I lost my healthy beautiful Mom unexpectedly 10/15/20 and my sweet pet and companion Molly, a small Boston Terrier on 5/25/21.With that said, the movie did leave us knowing Rob was not going to hurt himself, Instead as he was heading back into the woods he said to Amir.. he'd see him on Thursday. (like he always). In the back of my mind.. I'm imagining Rob getting another pig, or dog, or ? To keep him company in the woods.OH... and I loved the writing and directing also. I loved all the sounds you hear when Rob was in the woods with PIG. I camped alot growing up in the woods of Montana and Oregon & the sounds brought back some wonderful memories (minus the sound of PIG)-lol.",Pig

Yet some directors seem to squeeze the real stuff out of him, performance wise. His performance in this film is phenomenal: he's subtle, restrained, nuanced, and other fancy words.

Still a unique story, but he plays the role much tighter; a quiet & more insular performance.Although an odd concept, he plays well against its other lead; young actor, Alex Wolf: excited to see what he can do next.The film is well shot; some really nice shooting: Good direction & cinematography.An unexpectedly sober performance from Cage where the opportunity to play it with the bombast of his younger self was there.I was impressed.

383,tanelson-91023,"Cascade of shallow emotional dives, fine to watch but offers little to reflect on",7,18 July 2021,"The film deals with grief, isolation, anger, mortality, forgiveness, success, reputation. It doesn't offer much depth or meaning at any turn though. You can argue that it is a strength, it is very grounded and real, the characters fumble to try and discover or create meaning rather than finding themselves at the center of a grand drama. The characters will wane poetic over symbols or metaphors or parallels that ultimately don't matter from the viewer's perspective. They are more like props the characters use to express themselves than symbols used to express something they analogize to. So you kind of have to watch from the perspective of ""What does the character pondering this mean about them,"" rather than, ""What does the character pondering this tell us about grief.""The film is emotional and not at all boring or unwatchable, but it also isn't great, there is little reason to think back on it or little reason to regret if you miss it.If all you are hoping for is to kill a few hours and maybe cry, consider it 8 stars, if you will only be happy with something wild or over the top it is 4 stars.",Pig

There is no unnecessary music playing to ""keep your attention"". Instead you can actually hear Nicolas Cage walking through the woods; you can hear the branches snapping, the wind, the birds and the pig snoring.This movie reminded me that it doesn't take tens of millions to make a great movie (budget was 3,5 million).

As for Cage's performance...most seem to forget, he has played this character many times before. He is as dull as in his most recent B movie characters. The dialogue is fractured and full of minimalistic ramblings. The whole movie he has blood all over his face. Seriously? No one can get him to wash his face? Or take a shower? And they try to make it seem like he is some sort of chef superhero. A legend...in his own mind. Maybe if you smoke something before watching this film, you won't fall asleep.",Pig

Just Cage walking round all sad and depressed. In the end, trust me it isn't worth watching so you will be glad I spoiled it...

His character is genuine and carries you through his emotional torment, genius and sadness with a believable performance. He reconciles the loss of his wife through the loss of a pet pig he loves. The pig representing the love he had for his deceased wife a decade ago. The line of the movie that tells the most of his character's message, ""We don't get a lot of things to really care about"", hones in on the theme of most people's lives, remember what is important in life, not the fame and fortune, but those you love.

423,mbleacherjtw,"I got it, but I didn't want to.",3,22 July 2021,"If you plan on seeing, ""Pig"" with Nicholas Cage, please skip this post because there are spoilers.*********************Spoiler Alert************************So when you go and look at the trailer, it appears to be a story about loss, humanity, and redemption. You clearly see the last shot in the trailer of Nick Cage feeding his pig who was lost at the beginning of the trailer.But no, that's not what happens. He goes to the city to find his favorite pig because he loves her. He's devastated obviously by losing his wife because he can't even bring himself to listen to the tape she made him at the beginning of the film, and losing the pig is just too much. The pig is his last connection with his emotion because losing his wife was just overwhelming.There's this bizarre scene about some kind of underground fight club that specializes in beating chefs? No apparent correlation here. It was not explained well at all. We find out that his connection to the truffle world is through the son of the jerk who had his pig stolen, and this kid only wants his evil father to let his mother (in a coma for 15 years) just die. So the father can't let go, and because of his anger, he keeps her on life support.We see that Cage makes the very meal for the father that he and his now comatose wife had as the highlight of their love. This brings the father to tell the truth that the pig was killed accidentally in the pignapping. Very sad of course and great acting, but all it does is allow Cage to play the tape of his wife singing ""I'm on Fire"" by Bruce Springsteen. Not even a meaningful song for a woman to sing.Missed opportunity BIG TIME for the son and father to reconcile and to pull the plug on mom or for the son to recognize why the father can't let her go. Missed opportunity for the kid (who now knows the pig wasn't needed to find the truffles) to help Cage work through his pain maybe by getting him a baby pig?I'm sick of these ""people are awful"" movies, even though I know that's true. I want to go to the movies to be entertained. To laugh, be challenged, learn something, or oh, I don't know.... Feel good? Instead, I'm paying $50 to watch Nick Cage and Adam Arkin (the father) suffer. I can suffer just fine in real life. Real life is suffering. Movies should suspend suffering and give hope.*Steps off soap box*",Pig

434,crime-24790,Belongs in a trough - best converted to bacon!,2,19 July 2021,"Absolutely meaningless story about a man seeking his stolen truffle pig. The opening scene shows promise, but goes downhill from there. Turns out our pig-seeker Cage was a legendary chef who is now compelled to utter such corny, saccharine, and embarrassing lines as - ""I remember every meal I've ever served; I remember ever person I've ever served."" It's enough to bring tears to your eyes - tears of laughter that is.Near the beginning of the story there is an absolutely ridiculous fight scene where Cage signs on to get pummeled by some waiter or dishwasher or whoever - some restaurant employee. The on-screen, fight-club audience actually gasp when they discover that Cage, who has gone incognito until now - is this legendary chef whose name - Robin Feld - they all recognize.. And the reason they gasp at the name recognition is because - the entire fight club audience is made up of line cooks, or chefs, or. Sous-chefs, or wiener roasters, who have formed some kind of underground fight club for restaurateurs. However, once their aprons come off, their true savagery is revealed., C'mon.Furthermore, the only point of this scene appears to be in getting Cage bloodier than he is already, so he can spend the rest of the movie doing his best Ted Kaczynski.Other scenes are as equally bad.Bottom line, it's a really silly movie successfully posing as something meaningful.",Pig

""We don't get a lot of things we care about"" This movie is a beautiful expression of what it means to love something, what you would do for that thing, and really highlights this wonderful aspect of being human. There was only one thing I had a problem with, some of the scenes in the movie had no reason being there. In particular the fight club or ""punching"" scene? I was confused on why the renowned chef ""Rob"" had clout in an underground fight club, and when he was beaten up, there was no explanation on why that would get him the information he needed.

There are random scenes that do nothing to advance the plot, and with the exception of a couple diatribes, characters pause for an average of 5 SECONDS between lines.

He was well appreciated among all citizens of the town,because he knew how to make them happy with his awesome served dishes. His life turned upside down when his wife has died,and he has retreated into the woods,and has chosen to live his life in solitude with that pig ,which he acquired to get him some truffles in exchange for some groceries for living. He could not reconcile with the fact that his wife died,and that we can see in the scene where he could not play that cassette to listen to his wife's voice. She was alive in his head. He could not let go of those feelings. The confirmation of that is when he told that guy that it would be better for him that he didn't go searching for lost pig,because the pig would be alive. (Even dead) :) He didn't go in town for over 10 years,so he kept his wife alive in his.memories and feelings :) He was running away from reality ,but in the end when he loses the pig,which was somewhat of replacement of his wife, he let all the pain of emotion come out,that scream,all that agony that he kept locked up inside for years. In the end he plays the cassette and listen to the voice and song that his wife intended for him. And we hope he was relieved. That he finally found peace with himself.

Very nuanced performances all around, dialogue was only what needed to be said, camera work and framing were excellent, and the film does a very good job at not trying to be a revenge story about a badass Nicholas Cage killing everybody that gets in the way of him finding his truffle pig, but rather the kidnapped pig is an amazing plot device that drives the character to re explore his past and peel back the layer of his isolation and loss for the audience.",Pig

His incredibly nuanced approach to complex emotional responses is fascinating to watch. I know everyone is touting an ""Oscar-worthy performance"" by Nic but for me, Alex stole the show.I think what's biting it in the ass is the marketing attempt to make it appear as a thriller. It's even categorized as such on IMDB. And while not official marketing, I heard in several word-of-mouth instances this being described as ""Mandy, but with a pig"" or ""a John Wick-style revenge film about fine dining"". It is definitely neither. Not in any way. If you're looking for action, you won't find it here. This is a uniquely vague tale of grief and healing. It's both solely about a pig and not about a pig at all.I actually found Amir and his father's grief experiences to be more compelling than the main character. There were a few instances where the story lost my interest, one of them being the pointless underground fight club scene. I think everyone was expecting something intense to happen (based on the marketing) but it didn't. Maybe that was the point? It just didn't work for me.Overall if you are a fan of Nic Cage or off-beat, unique takes on complex human emotions, this is definitely worth watching.",Pig

472,easymonet,A good pig is hard to find.,6,8 August 2021,"Nicholas Cage plays a laid back role, especially for him. I kept expecting him to go John Wick but instead he got more and more Zen, which was a pleasant surprise. He lives a hermit life in the forest with his truffle pig as his only companion. He loves his pig; no, not in that way, as he is forced to clarify at one point, but as a companion animal like a dog. Of course his happy life is interrupted when some tweakers steal the cute little porker, so he goes on a mission to rescue her. This is where I expected it go the way of one of his other movies, Mandy, but it doesn't. It becomes a fairly subtle and understated expansion of his character as we are given insight into his past and his path. I enjoyed the movie and thought Cage showed real skill as an actor, but felt a little dissatisfied at the conclusion, despite it's being consistent with the plot. I guess that's just me wanting an extra twist in the tail to make me really sit up and take notice. This movie seemed more French film noir style instead of the Hollywood we are used to from Nick.",Pig

Slow dialogue with great silence before slow choppy retorts. Let your heart understand the story and enjoy Nichols Cage. Par excellence!I think Mr Cage is about to make a broader statement in his film career. He has the gravity to carry silent anger right below the surface. Nichols cage knows how to act and he is showing his stuff in this movie. He is fully capable of a brooding soul part. I think he is more than sufficient to cary the this role!

490,jpwnz,Am I crazy or what?,4,25 July 2021,"I don't get all the praise this movie is getting. Coming from a pretty big Cage fan too. There is not much here to be amused by. The trailer was more than lackluster but I was still interested in giving it a watch anyways just because I had nothing better to do and like I said; I like Cage.Right off the bat you are thrown into this movie and it's dark as heck. If you can look past that then you may think you are in for a entertaining ride. Wrong. Rest assured the beginning of this movie is about as entertaining as it gets. From then on it really just gets duller and duller. A man trying to track down his pig going from one lead to the next until he finally discovers who took it and why. This is not your typical Cage action packed movie. In fact he doesn't even scream in this one. Sometimes it's nice to try something different but at least make it watchable.As the story progresses many things happen that don't have any rhyme or reason and it moves at a pretty slow pace. Sure not every movie has to be guns blazing and move quickly but you have to shake it up and the farthest this movie goes is in the relationship between the characters. There are a few scenes that stand out but unless you like watching paint dry and love melodramas then this movie is not for you.Then when you finally get to the ending which you could see coming from pretty far away, you are left feeling like really? That's it? There could have at least been some kind of payoff for spending all that time and there isn't. Sure the movie is shot well. Sure it can be seem as somewhat artistic. But there just isn't anything here to warrant the praise it is getting.This movie in my eyes is run of the mill. 4-5 at best on a good day. And anybody claiming Cage deserves an award for this one is cracked out of their minds. He doesn't even speak that much in here. Let alone plays a role that could even come close. I don't know if people are obsessed with pigs and love his relationship he had with his pet or what but that doesn't make this a good movie.",Pig

I'm really not quite sure how people came to the conclusion that it wasn't going to be an artsy type of film based on the trailer. I guess they just read the description and that Cage would be busting doors down and cracking some skulls?I agree with another reviewer here that the theme of forgiveness and doing good to those who wronged you has a powerful presence in this film. The only thing I felt was missing were flashbacks of some kind to add more context to Cage's character and further flesh out how much Apple meant to him. Perhaps the director had a good reason to not include those but I felt like it could have made the film better. Perhaps not, though. Perhaps the revelation that he didn't even need Apple to fetch the truffles was enough to know how much she meant to him.",Pig

Some reviews are making out like its a failed attempt at social commentary but that's not what its about. Not everyone is going to like it because it requires a deep understanding of the nuance of loss, isolation and family. The character development is there but not in your face as many movies have these days, its subtle but if you actually pay attention its beautiful. On a bonus both the cinematography and sound design are outstanding, world class. Some of the camera shots are incredible and really bring the script to a whole new level. Nicholas Cage and Alex Woolf have a surprising amount of chemistry especially in the slower scenes. It misses out on 10 because of a few weak performances from side characters, and occasional weak acting by Cage and Woolf. That's only knit picking though, an all-round must watch for genuine lovers of film as an art.",Pig

499,hkdn,A rare film.,8,14 August 2021,"""Pig"" can be misleading in its premise at first glance, yet Nicolas Cage manages to deliver a poetic film of a kind that has been rare and lacking in recent years. The characters of ""Pig"" are rich in depth and emotion, no doubt brilliantly evoked by Cage's riveting performance, and it would be impossible to have not formed a connection with them by the end of it. Dealing with themes of family, loss, coping, companionship, mentorship, and commerce, ""Pig"" is a timely treatise on appreciating the little things and lovingly devoting oneself to them with all one's heart. The film's namesake represents more than just the main character's commercial partner, but a lifelong partner and companion to a character whose life was shaken by one of the worst, if not the worst, kinds of loss.",Pig

510,scotty-boy4485,"Profoundly soulful, and likely not what you're expecting.",10,6 August 2021,"The best way I can describe this (surprisingly moving film) is like this:Imagine an episode of Chef's Table (Yes, the Netflix series). However, this episode is basically a remake of John Wick. But instead of an assassin who's a crack shot and seeking revenge for a dog, it's a chef who breaks down people's defenses by cooking sumptuous, life-altering dishes and is looking for a kidnapped pig... Oh, and this episode is directed by Paul Thomas Anderson's equally-talented, slightly less-cynical surrogate brother.If none of that sounds appetizing to you, then you might be best skipping this film altogether. If that does sound enticing, however, then you are in for an immaculately cooked meal, a film that gives just enough exposition to let you know what's happening, but refuses to cake in all the details with unnecessary plot butter. It will gratify your emotions, edify your mind and leave you full.No exaggeration, I would give this film a Michelin Star if I could.",Pig
511,rexivan,A contemplative drama with good performances,7,24 August 2021,"This movie is truly a vehicle for its star, Nicolas Cage. Though not his first serious role, it allows him to show off more of his talent that everyone kind of knows is there. The nuanced acting all around carries the movie through and is made more prominent by the calm pacing that values atmosphere and character above all else. The plot is really simple--in every way a compliment: just a man looking for his pig. While comparisons to John Wick are obvious, Wick is definitely more fast-paced and an action-based thriller whereas moments in Pig remind me of Kelly Reichardt's marvelous First Cow. I feel Pig does a good job of satisfying both Nick Cage fans and film fans, thanks to the no-nonsense charm and likability that Cage has built up throughout his career.The writing values character more than action and falls more into the ""drama"" category, though not without its funny moments. The tone is not as dark as one might expect, with the themes, of the movie being hopeful and grounded in humanity. There are a couple of good, grounded monologues from Cage while Wolf does a good job of reacting to him and showing character growth, as he seems to be picking a lot of interesting roles these days and is truly an up-and-coming star to watch out for.All in all, one of the better movies of 2021 and something to relax to, with perhaps another Oscar nod for Cage in the near future.",Pig

This is real art. Existential in scope, this story is about just how painful love can be and how it transcends any simple definition.

This movie is NOTHING like John Wick.On its own however this movie was a pleasant surprise for me. Nicolas Cage as Rob and Alex Wolff as Amir did really heartfelt and memorable performances.Having recently lost a pet I held dear to my heart this movie probably spoke more to my emotions that I'd care to admit. The character development and acting performances really stood out for me. You felt Rob's emotions as he searches for his loved one and you feel the anxiety and fears Amir has for his situation.I really enjoyed this movie and the emotions it stirred within and would like to thank the cast and crew for their hand in delivering it to us.,Pig

518,Ninlego,A profound movie centered around loss and loneliness.,10,20 July 2021,"The moniker ""John Wick with a Pig"" is probably the silliest way to get people intrigued to watch this movie. It's also misleading, which is why some people are left disappointed, wanting to see a merciless bloodbath on par with the Saw movies. In lieu of that, we can't forget about Nicolas Cage, whose movies such as Vampire's Kiss, Face/Off, The Wicker Man, Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans gives us an idea of what we are getting into, another movie where he acts a fool and a ridiculous premise that surrounds it. I went to the theater expecting that. Instead, I watched a film that had the profound ability to teach, not entertain. And that's the surprise that I got. And I loved it.Nicolas Cage portrays a former chef who became burnt out trying to please people, and decided to do what he wants to do. He forages truffles with help from his best friend, a cute sow who becomes the only thing he truly cares about in life. Now that one thing has been taken away from him is out in a place he really doesn't want to go back to. There's your premise. You really have to open your heart up throughout the movie. Yes there is violence. Yes there is dramatic irony. Yes it is gritty. These are the things that people expect from modern day movies. Except this movie took those expectations and subverted them into something people wouldn't expect. And it paid off. That's why this movie is great. Go see it.",Pig

This isnt a movie about healing, this is a movie about breaking your barriers and *beginning* to heal. Anyone notice how at the beginning of the movie he couldnt listen to the tape his wife made him, but at the end he sat and listened to the whole thing?To be clearer... the pig was, metaphorically, Lorelai Feld. Robin had attached the idea of his wife to an animal so that he could convince himself Lorrie was never really gone.

534,zaineee,Um...What?,2,16 August 2021,"I'm not entirely sure why there's so many raving reviews about such a dull and unrewarding film. The first 15 minutes felt promising. The premise seemed interesting enough, there's some nice shots in the opening... Then the pignapping happens and it's all downhill from there. Countless drawn out sequences of pointless and completely disengaging dialogue. There's nothing even remotely thrilling going on which is sort of the whole point of being in the ""thriller"" genre. Nic Cage is DECENT, but his character isn't really interesting at all, and doesn't seem to become any more interesting as you learn more about him. He spends the majority of the movie wandering around Portland with his face covered in blood, rambling about earthquakes, persimmon trees, and curtains until he remembers he's supposed to be finding his prized pig. It's...quite mind numbing.Anything this film tries to say about love and loss is completely overshadowed by boring dialogue, lack of purpose, and utter randomness. I don't know what I missed that seemed to wow so many other people but this was hard to get through and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",Pig

With that said, I saw Pig had great critic reviews and I like Nicolas Cage so I was eager to see it. I left the theater very disappointed and I had to wake my wife up before we left. Pig is a beautifully filmed cinematic delight. The musical score went excellent with the scenes and added a very nice feel to the movie. I even thought the acting of Nicolas Cage and Alex Wolff was good! However, the whole movie is just a long EXTREMELY DRAWN OUT story that you are waiting to take off and get interesting, but it unfortunately never does. It feels like nothing happens the whole movie which was the ultimate disappointment after reading many of the great reviews. Maybe I'm missing some deeper meaning, but overall Pig is slow and many scenes don't even make sense. I would not recommend this film if you want to save yourself 2 hours. 4.8/10.",Pig

It's also the perfect length, If it was two hours it would have lost a lot of people, but luckily it captures you and make you glide along with the story and characters for the right amount of time.

548,belmontwarrior,A search of lone man for the things he care about.,8,25 July 2021,"First thing first - It is not a John Wick with pig.I mean it could have gone that way and turned out to be a train wreck easily but instead it took a different route and became masterfully crafted ""anti-revenge"" story about a lone and battered and the things that he cares about.On certain points the film felt as if could turn into cheesy meodramatic fest but Michael Sarnoski tightly hold ther narration, plot and pace together and amalgamated it to make a fine whiskey which will get better as it gets old.Nicolas Cage gave one of the best performance after Mandy, the man is on a roll. Now, Nic Cage is usually associated with over the top, unhinged and extravagant characters but in this flick he was incredibly restrained (obviously there is Cage rage scene in a movie). He is in peace while living in forest with his pig, desperate when his pig gets kidnapped and tender when he visits his past to find the pig. Alex Wolff and Adam Arkin were also good, considering Arkin only had 10 minutes of screen time at most.Another thing that I liked about the movie is music. It mixes extremely well the scenes and scenary and gives a certain sense of mystic to the entire film atmosphere.All in all, it is one of the best movies of 2021 and definitely worth the watch.

Loaning the idea from the John Wick series was a brilliant move of artistry. So first off Nic Cage is an easy shoo-in for best actor at the Oscars for this, no debate. Gotta think my man Alex Wolff gets one for being able to put up with that acting genius for 90 mins jfc. The pig didn't do enough imo to merit any major award but maybe best supporting actor, best sound...definitely makeup and hairstyling down easy. The cinematography was to die for, literally the single best performance from a crew I've seen in my life. I really thought the lighting and directing was fantastic, and don't get me started on the visual effects. Absolutely positively brilliant work. Second to none, maybe Lamb but we gotta see how good that is ufm. Personally, I think they could've used more sound effects and music to go along with the scenes, as some lacked a certain intrinsic value of the auditory sort to match the setting and mood being portrayed.

His best role without a close second is ""Adaptation"". ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Raising Arizona"" I would put behind ""Adaptation"". He is great in anything he does and is good in ""Pig"" it is just that ""Pig"" is the kind of movie that you might make it to the end of if it is on a streaming service and you don't have anything else to watch.

586,michaelfarkas-74190,Oink! The only redeeming thing about this movie is off-screen for 98% of it,1,21 August 2021,"*Nothing but spoilers*I've seen both Inception and Night at the Roxbury in theatres and this is the worst movie I've ever paid to see. The movie starts out like Taken, but dressed down into an indie film with an incredible A/V budget. Adorable pig with a nearly unrecognizable, homeless Nicolas Cage roaming the forest for truffles. Cage never gets the chance to be over-the-top ""Nic Rage"" with the relatively few words he mumbles out, so he makes up for it by looking like he's been living on a garbage barge for the last ten years with a series of giant, constantly-open wounds all about his face and head.Cue the beginning of the dreadful performance turned in by Amir (Alex Wolff). A failed mock-up of a city slicker, while attempting the punchy commentary of Roman Roy from Succession. The writing does him no favors and he still finds enough screen time to undercut that. Amir buys truffles from the crotchety Robin ""Rob"" Feld (Cage) who lives in a unabomber-style shack in the woods - but yet the buyer is surprised that the obviously-pungent Feld doesn't want to make small talk (The ""good talk"" line after a slammed door, woo! Cutting edge stuff there...it's a shame the camera didn't pan out and have a bunch of birds fly away too).Anyway...random strangers break in, steal the pig - even though it's very clear that Feld sells these to the marketplace openly already. So, Feld hitches a ride in Amir's fancy car and, uh oh, mismatched buddy crime film! Look out for these guys, they're different and out of their element...but not really!Feld mutters ""I just want my pig back"" about six times in seven lines with slightly different backdrops. He creates a quick manic episode for a local highly-regarded chef - who somehow recognizes Feld, despite not being in the game for 15 years. Then Feld navigates his way into an underground fight club for restaurant workers (yeah...). I guess they're winking at the notion that being a high-end chef is really hard...but this is ground that Gordon Ramsay has long covered (I paid $16 to see this, I'm an idiot sandwich, chef Ramsay).Predictably, they end up at Amir's father - Darius (Adam Arkin) who has a ""final boss"" aura but with none of the exposition or context (or interest) that one normally has. Darius offers Feld a bunch of money to just leave him the pig and get on his way. Feld says his catch phrase. Bam. Stalemate. Feld then texts Amir a shopping list of things to get - including a specific wine...from a cemetery (why?) where Feld's wife is buried (why/how?).*Food cooking montage*The only three non-pig characters eat dinner together. Darius starts crying after - like - the third bite for some reason. Feld tells him that he remembers ever meal he's ever cooked for every person ever (so...Taken meets Rain Man...?). Then Darius tells Feld that the pig is dead due to injuries sustained in the pig-napping. Feld cries for a minute and then he's cool with it. He goes home and plays audio cassette tapes of dates he had with his wife (why/how?) and we never know what her role is or what happened to her or who she is really - at all. Amir sleeps in the driver's seat of his car at a diner in rural Oregon (why?) and then, uhh, that's it...tl;dr: Cage wants his pig back, makes dinner, and moves on.For the people that are straining and contorting themselves to make this obvious hoax of a movie into a thinkpiece - I assume you have bid on that ""Invisible Sculpture"" as well.

Solid cinematography work and excellent acting hold up the frame in what could otherwise be dismissed as a throwaway plot concocted on a truly Portlandesque acid trip.Of all the movies to bring his A-game to, Cage reminds us that he's not just a zany overacting crazy man with an Elvis obsession. Here he delivers a captivatingly understated performance that's overboiling with genuine heart. Not playing second fiddle either, Wolff continues to impress, going toe to toe with Cage in delivery and showing off his range.If you want action and suspense, you may want to give this a pass, but if you enjoy watching good actors being well-directed and making you care about what's on-screen, this is a must-see.",Pig

611,Phenomanan,Some very important things you may have missed (Spoilers below),10,27 July 2021,"I feel a few people here have really taken this movie completely at face value and come away thinking it is a boring movie about a dude trying to get his pig back. Let me try and share a few of the really outstanding storytelling bits I noticed upon initial viewing.Firstly, I think the whole reason Robin (Nic Cage) is actually so devastated about the pig is that he never properly dealt with the trauma of losing his wife. He stops playing that tape at the beginning as soon as you hear her voice because he doesn't want to deal with the memories it will bring back up. Throughout the quest to get his pig back he finally starts to properly grieve for his wife and get closure with old friends and acquaintances. When he says ""because I love her"" in response to Amir's ""why are we doing all this"" he was talking about both his wife and the pig.Now a scene that I did not fully understand at the time but thankfully a friend I watched with helped me understand - his old backyard and the persimmon tree. He's talking about Hachiya persimmons, which are absolutely gross and inedible until they are extremely overripe. The fact that the persimmon tree is no longer there represents his hope for a future being dashed even before it could bear fruit. So the scene with the kid and the tree was meant to represent that he had a dream to have a family, which got dashed when his wife passed away.At the end when Amir asks if he is alright he goes ""... yeah"" and actually seems to mean it - as he has finally properly dealt with his grief. In the final scene, he is able to sit and listen to the whole cassette.As far as the lack of action: his story was never meant to be a John Wick / Taken esque revenge story. Even after he finds out his pig is dead, he still doesn't harm the guy who did that to him. Same with the kids who hit him at the beginning and stole the pig in the first place. Where 99.9% of people would immediately think of revenge and hurting the person who wronged you - Robin chooses to try and reach his enemy on a human level. Something you scarcely ever see in movies or otherwise. Of course Amir's father is shown to be making the same mistake of trying to avoid dealing with grief - forcing his wife to stay on life support even with no hope of recovery, and burying himself in work to avoid thinking about her.I think perhaps if you came into the movie with certain expectations - you would be disappointed. But if you really give it a chance and try and chew on the dialogue and read between the lines, especially when a scene (like the persimmon tree) seems random, you will have a great experience.",Pig

She hated it - said it was so slow and boring that she would have exited the theater if it were not for me beside her.If ""Unforgiven'' was slow-paced, ""Pig"" is glacial in its rollout. There is little action and even less dialogue, but to me it captured an ethos that one can only appreciate if one has experienced a number of life's travails. The pacing is its genius. It insists that you feel what's on the screen.""Pig"" is about loss and profound disappointment - the loss of loved ones, the loss of one's dreams and ambitions, the loss of youth's shininess - even the loss of wanting to keep living among other people, so disappointing can they be. To certain audience members, it should strike home hard.Cage, of whom I've never been a fan - I hated Leaving Las Vegas - was terrific in this role. His physical moroseness as the movie moves forward, and the fact that nobody seems to notice it - indeed smell it - becomes wonderfully comical, though there are no overt laugh lines in the 90-minute film. Everything is dark, heavy, and delightfully dispiriting. (I thought the fight scene a bit too much, even contrived.)I can easily see why some people would hate this film, and I won't be bringing my old friend to see it. But I can also see why others think it brilliant. It's not about entertainment; it's about strained human existence. It captures that beautifully, if not extremely. And what a clever premise. Truffle pigs, go figure.""Pig"" really stuck with me. It's a movie I'll probably watch a half-dozen times. But I'll be watching it alone. To anyone who doesn't like this genre it will be excruciating.",Pig

While containing all the elements of your John Wick-esque revenge flick, Sarnoski subverts the standard genre tropes, providing a meditation on broken men coping with loss in unhealthy ways. Now, any critique of this film would be remiss without mentioning the sheer powerhouse performance delivered by Nicolas Cage. Reminiscent of Ryan Gosling's turn in Drive, Cage carries the story predominantly in silence; making those rare moments of dialogue all the more impactful. To call it one of if not the greatest performance of his career would be like calling grass green or the sky blue; it just is. I don't know if there wasn't enough bodies hitting the floor or ""crazy"" Cage moments to satisfy the masses, but what we were given is something far more pure.

Nicolas Cage is truly fantastic as the caring, but somewhat nihilistic truffle hermit and Alexander Wolff does very well in a supporting role.
