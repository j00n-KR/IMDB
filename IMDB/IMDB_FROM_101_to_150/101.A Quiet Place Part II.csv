0,SnoopyStyle,good sequel,8,1 August 2021,"The movie starts with the arrival of the monsters. Then it proceeds to immediately after the first movie and the death of Lee Abbott (John Krasinski). Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt) and her three children seek a new refuge. They stumble upon old friend Emmett (Cillian Murphy) but he doesn't believe that he has enough supplies for everyone. He wants them out.This is a good sequel and builds upon the first movie. It's filling in both sides of the story and the franchise could continue with more production. The girl continues to be a standout among some great veteran adult actors. I would double-down more with the silence concept. I would strip the foley work to a bare minimum and some of the movie background music. Let the silence haunt this movie. Let's go all natural. That would be my biggest change. The other change is when they find the new sanctuary. They need to locate the target right away. They wouldn't take too long of a break. I would have them wake up from exhaustion and rush around trying to find the target. They could stumble upon the boat while on the search and the movie would end the same way. All in all, this is a very solid sequel to a compelling and unique franchise. I would just steer into the uniqueness of the franchise and go even more quiet.",A Quiet Place Part II
1,Prismark10,A Quiet Place Part II,4,11 July 2021,The beginning of the movie starts out as a prequel. It also allows director John Krasinski to be on acting duty as Lee.The film then jumps forward after the events of the first movie. It also introduces a gruff survivalist Emmett (Cillian Murphy) someone who was a friend of Lee.Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt) and her three children need shelter from Emmett who is grieving from the lost of his family.Regan the hearing impaired daughter knows that loud noise makes the bretuares vulnerable. She also has a theory that the song Beyond the Sea played on the radio has an important clue. The creatures cannot swim. Small islands are a safe place for humans.The sequel was unnecessary. It's not as good as the first film which to me was average. A lot of characters place themselves in peril by doing dim things.I still found similarities with Mars Attacks! Just as I did with the first movie.,A Quiet Place Part II
2,claudio_carvalho,Beyond the Sea,6,26 September 2021,"Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt) recalls the first alien attack in her little town during a baseball game of her son. She decides to seek out a new place after the attack to her home. She stumbles upon the place where her former family friend Emmett (Cillian Murphy) lives. However her daughter Regan Abbott (Millicent Simmonds) overhears the American version of La Mer (Beyond the Sea) and believes it is a warning that there is life in an island nearby their location. She sneaks out from her mother to look for the island, but her brother tells her mother that convinces Emmet to seek out her.""A Quiet Place Part II"" is the sequel of the first film with a good story. There are moments of tension but this sequel is inferior to the first film. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Um Lugar Silencioso: Parte II"" (""A Silent Place Part II"")",A Quiet Place Part II
3,nogodnomasters,Be Very Quiet,6,16 June 2021,"We get a flashback to day 1 and then catch up with Mom (Emily Blunt) and two mute kids and baby Yoda walking barefoot which would make me scream. Maybe a few pair of socks? They spring some traps but manage to stumble upon Emmett (Cillian Murphy) in an abandoned steel mill who is not happy to see anyone. The game of quiet hide 'n' seek continues until Regan (Millicent Simmonds) gets the idea to go live on an island like they try to do in some zombie films. We discover (plot spoiler?) that the aliens can't swim too well and like Killer Tomatoes explode when they hear the song ""Puberty Love"" or something similar.Guide: No F-word, sex, or nudity.",A Quiet Place Part II
4,kosmasp,Suspend your (Horror)Disbelief,8,25 June 2021,"I remember the first one and how I was not entirely able to suspend my disbelief - and in some respect this still rings true here. The high pitch/tone concept is still in effect - and while we go back to day 1 for this - not just to see a (beloved) character which did not survive the first movie (yes it does make sense to watch the first one before seeing this then), but so we get a glimpse of a new very important character for the sequel.Yes this still has the issue with being convinient when it comes to the ""monsters"" showing up or when the characters will make noise or how many of the monsters show up and how effective they are when attacking/lunging/chasing ... again: suspend of disbelief.What this has more than the first one is action - one may even say that it is more an action movie rather than horror movie. That is not a bad thing - also when it does get horror/scary it really pulls out all the stops ... the jump scares may be few and in between, but they are quite effective - even when it is the ""cat jumping out of something"" - though in this case it isn't a cat but multiple other animals that really come after one of the quietest moment ... and should be able to make you jump out of your seat - well done John.So if you did enjoy the first one, it is almost guaranteed that you'll love this. It may come with a delay of over a year, but it is finally here for us to enjoy ...",A Quiet Place Part II
5,lee_eisenberg,things are about to get a lot more unpleasant,8,31 May 2021,"John Krasinski's sequel to his 2018 horror flick saw its release delayed due to a certain pandemic. It's finally here and it's to die for; in fact, it's the first movie that I've seen in the theater since you-know-what engulfed the world (the last one was the most recent Star Wars movie).""A Quiet Place Part II"" picks up where the first one left off - with an intro showing how the crisis started - and shows how the family has to press forward. With this movie and the first one, Emily Blunt shows her versatility; I mean, if you know her from the likes of ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""Mary Poppins Returns"", you're in for a pleasant surprise from her gritty performance.It's not a masterpiece, but it's a good one. You can cut the tension with a knife. Definitely see it.",A Quiet Place Part II
6,jboothmillard,A Quiet Place Part II,8,15 June 2021,"The original film was a brilliant scary movie, one of the best I've seen in the last few years, and I was most excited when the sequel was eventually released in cinemas. Basically, it opens with a flashback, to the beginning of the alien invasion. The Abbott family are attending a baseball game, with Marcus (Noah Jupe) playing. Mid-game, the spectators are bewildered to see a flaming object in the sky hurtling towards Earth. As people leave the park and try to drive away, the town is attacked by alien creatures with armoured skin, high speed, and extraordinary strength. Father and husband Lee (John Krasinski, also writing and directing) slowly realises that the creatures are blind but have hypersensitive hearing to hunt their victims. In present day, most of the population have been wiped out by the aliens, Lee was killed sacrificing himself to save his children. His remaining family are his wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt), now adolescent Marcus, deaf teenage daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds), and a new-born baby son. Regan, who discovered that high-frequency audio feedback is the weakness of the creatures, has found that transmitting the noise from her cochlear implant hearing aid through a microphone and speaker makes the creatures vulnerable, allowing Evelyn to shoot them dead. With their isolated home on the fame destroyed, and finding this method to kill the monsters, the family leave to find refuge and search for other survivors. They bring Regan's kit to fend off the creatures. They enter a fenced-off area, and trigger a booby-trap, and when they are forced to run, Marcus steps into a bear trap. His subsequent screams attract a creature, but Regan uses the kit to weaken it and Evelyn kills it. They free Marcus and flee into an abandoned steel foundry as another creature approaches. Inside, they stumble upon Emmett (Cillian Murphy), a former friend of Lee's, who has become a recluse. He takes them inside to hide from the creature, in a sound-proof area, and reluctantly allows them to stay in the bunker, seeing the baby. To protect the baby, and avoid his cries attracting the attention of the creatures, he is being kept inside a box, containing a breathing mask connected to an oxygen tank. Whilst hiding in the foundry, Marcus and Regan discover a radio station signal that continuously plays the song, ""Beyond the Sea"" by Bobby Darin. Regan determines it is a clue meant to lead survivors to the salvation of a group of nearby islands. She theorises that if she can reach the radio tower, the hearing aid's high-frequency noise can be transmitted for survivors to weaponize against the creatures. After telling Marcus her plan, she secretly ventures out alone to find the broadcast station. Discovering Regan is gone, Evelyn implores Emmett to bring her back. Emmett finds Regan exploring an abandoned train, containing only the corpses of victims to the monsters. After averting a creature attracted to sound made on the locomotive, Emmett wants them to return to the foundry. Emmett is initially sceptical about the plan to find the radio station, theorising that there may be no survivors at all, but he is convinced by Regan that they have a sense of duty to help others if they can. Meanwhile, Evelyn leaves Marcus and the baby at the foundry to gather needed medical supplies and equipment, including canisters of oxygen. During her absence, Marcus explores the foundry and discovers the corpse of Emmett's wife. He is startled and knocks something, creating sound that alerts a nearby creature. Marcus narrowly gets into the bunker, but accidentally locks himself and the baby inside, with breathable air and the oxygen remaining in a tank running out. At a marina, Emmett and Regan search for a boat. They are ambushed by feral people who begin to search Regan for supplies. Emmett shouts out to attract two creatures that slaughter the deranged inhabitants. Boarding a vessel, Emmett sees one creature drown and realises the aliens cannot swim. Regan secures a small boat and the two find the island where a small colony of survivors have settled, and they are living a relatively normal existence, with no need for silence. The colony leader (Djimon Hounsou) reveals that when the government discovered the creatures were unable to swim, the National Guard moved as many people as possible to the islands. Meanwhile, Marcus and the baby are still trapped in the air-tight bunker and are close to suffocating. Evelyn returns and distracts the creatures, using one of the two canisters she collected to ignite the monster, saving her children. The three continue hiding inside the bunker as the creature prowls the foundry. A creature that boarded a yacht at the marina has drifted to the island and immediately begins attacking the colonists. The colony leader, Emmett, and Regan jump into a car and lead the creature to the radio station. The creature kills the leader while Emmett and Regan make it inside. While Regan finds the source of the signal, a creature comes in to attack. The creature is about to kill Emmett, when Regan transmits the high frequency through the room's speakers, incapacitating the creature. She impales the alien's exposed head with a metal rod, killing it and saving Emmett. At the same time, the creature at the foundry has discovered the bunker. It attacks Evelyn, but before it can kill her, Regan's transmission plays through Marcus's portable radio, incapacitating the creature. Marcus shoots it dead with Evelyn's revolver. Regan leaves her hearing aid connected to the radio station's microphone, allowing anyone receiving the frequency to fight the creatures. Also starring Scoot McNairy as Marina Man, Dean Woodward as Beau Abbott, Okieriete Onaodowan as Police Officer, Zachary Golinger as Emmett's son, and Lauren Ashley Cristiano as Emmett's wife. The clever premise using the sense of sound is just about as tense as before, I was a little annoyed there was whispering in certain scenes, but the atmosphere remains eerie and immersive. The post-apocalyptic world is expanded, the survival element continues to be good, the monsters are still the stuff of nightmares, and the score by Marco Beltrami is terrific, overall, a satisfactory horror. Very good!",A Quiet Place Part II
7,paul_haakonsen,A fully unnecessary sequel...,4,8 August 2021,"Wait, didn't we just sit through this exact story once back in the 2018 release of ""A Quiet Place"", the first part?Sure, I wasn't particularly thrilled or entertained by the 2018 ""A Quiet Place"" movie, but since my wife wanted to watch part two, I ended up sitting down to watch it as well.And ""A Quiet Place Part II"" was essentially just a rehash of the first movie. Sure, it is set to follow the events of the first movie, but everything in the movie was essentially just following the very same formula as the first movie.Even down to the stupid flaws, such as the loud noise caused by the alien creatures when they stalk someone doesn't seem to attract the attention of other aliens and thus would lure more aliens about. No, for some reason they ignore the noise created by their brethren, oddly enough.Yeah, I will say that the first I don't know, 10-15 minutes of the movie, where we see the events of Day 1, that was the highlight of the movie. It was so action-packed that it made it worthwhile to watch. And yeah, you could essentially just watch the events of Day 1 and skip on the rest of the movie, because once the movie jumped from Day 1 to Day 474, the storyline just fell into the slump of copying the first movie.Visually then ""A Quiet Place Part II"" definitely is good, just as the 2018 predecessor was. I do really like the creature design of these alien beings. Lots of nice details here, and the distinct otherworldly creature-feel to them is just magnificent.""A Quiet Place Part II"" brings actor Cillian Murphy into the picture, and he definitely spices things up. Unfortunately then the script was just an anchor holding him back. A shame really, because he could do a lot for the movie if he had the opportunity.If you enjoyed the first movie, then you will like this sequel as well. However, there isn't much new material here to make it justifiable that you spend 1 hour and 37 minutes on this movie, truth be told.I was about as entertained as I was by the 2018 movie, so only mildly so. And just akin to the predecessor movie, then ""A Quiet Place Part II"" lands on a less than mediocre four out of ten stars. This sequel would have benefitted so much from having writer and director John Krasinski opt for a whole new storyline and direction in which to take the story, instead of just copy and pasting the contents from the first movie.",A Quiet Place Part II
8,tavm,A Quiet Place Part II is just as thrilling as its predecessor,10,18 June 2021,"After being delayed for a year because of the pandemic, this sequel to A Quiet Place finally came out. This marked the first time I went with my movie theatre-working friend to watch a movie in two years. Good thing we did because this was as thrilling and entertaining as the original one. John Krasinski is once again writer and director and appears in the beginning sequence which takes place before the first movie. And his wife Emily Blunt is also there and, along with the two players playing her teen children, make compelling performances throughout along with some other players that we haven't seen before in the original. I'll just now say we both highly recommend A Quiet Place Part II.",A Quiet Place Part II
9,BandSAboutMovies,An improvement,7,30 July 2021,"The first A Quiet Place left me kind of cold. Once you get past the conceit - aliens that attack based on sound attacking a mostly hearing impaired family - and the nail to the foot scene (repeated in the movie Haunt, which was also written and co-produced by Scott Beck and Bryan Wood), I came away feeling alright about what I watched. However, so many people absolutely adored the first movie, so when the second came out, I decided to give it an open-minded watch.I'm glad I did.Written, produced and directed by John Krasinski - who makes a cameo in the opening flashback - this film brings back the Abbott family (Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe) while adding Cillian Murphy and Djimon Hounsou as survivors.The beginning of the film is astounding, showing the initial invasion of the creatures which transforms a small-town American Main Street into carnage before slamming us into the events of a year later, as the family tries to navigate the hostile world that is left behind.As for Beck and Woods, they didn't return for the sequel. Woods said they were not interested in a franchise approach and that they would rather ""create original ideas"" whole Beck claimed that his goal was ""...investing back into the ecosystem of original ideas in a massive marketplace."" Krasinski had told the produces to find another writer and director before finding the idea and meaning behind this sequel.An important team that returned for this film was supervising sound editors Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van der Ryn and re-recording mixer Brandon Proctor. Their ability to drop sound and then bring it back make the noises in this film anything but wallpaper and dramatically show the experience of the film's hearing-impaired characters.On May 29, 2021, director William Friedkin referred to this movie as ""a classic horror film"" and ended his tweet with ""Cinema is back."" How about that for high praise?",A Quiet Place Part II
10,michaelRokeefe,Being very quiet is still imperative.,8,11 October 2021,"More of the same, maybe a little more creative. This sequel starts with the death of Lee Abbott (John Krasinski), who happens to be the movie's director. The creatures waste no time with their hunting by sound. Emily Blunt is very good as she now takes solo leadership of her family. And Millicent Simmonds is even more outstanding as the clever daughter. An old family friend (Cillian Murphy) has mixed feelings on offering the Abbotts spare supplies or shelter.Tension filled situations with erie cinematography Dreadful and suspenseful saga of survival. Also in the cast: Okieriete Onaodwan, Djimon Hounsou and Noah Jupe.",A Quiet Place Part II
11,CinemaSerf,Characters we care about...makes all the difference....,7,9 June 2021,"Now, as sequels go this is not half bad. Building on the well crafted 2018 film, we take the story of the ""Abbott"" family still in hiding from the deadly alien locust like creatures. Still grieving, mother ""Evelyn"" (Emily Blunt) must try to keep her remaining two children ""Regan"" (Millicent Simmonds) and ""Marcus"" (Noah Jupe) as well as their newly arrived baby out of the clutches of their nemeses. Forced to flee the relative safety of their home, they hook up with neighbour ""Emmett"" (Cillian Murphy) and attempt to reach safety on an island that the invaders (who cannot swim) have yet to conquer... This picks up well on the tension left at the end of the first film, the characters are already established so John Krasinksi doesn't have to waste time reimagining them. Aside from a slightly distracting recap demonstrating how their current predicament started, the feature moves along apace with plenty of tautly directed action that presents both of the younger actors with opportunities to shine - and that they do. Unlike many follow-ups, this expands the story giving us plenty to hide behind the sofa from; an extra character from Murphy that adds to the threat nicely, and though I didn't enjoy it quite so much as the original, it's still a fine piece of cinema.",A Quiet Place Part II
12,Calicodreamin,Humanity,9,17 June 2021,"A sequel that far outpaced the original in my opinion. This movie was all about the humanity in surviving, the directing and acting made the concept come across beautifully and with authenticity. The cinematography was vivid and paired well with the thoughtful acoustics. An overall well made movie.",A Quiet Place Part II
13,view_and_review,I Welcome a Part Three,9,30 May 2021,"I don't know if it was the excitement of being back in the theater after 15 months or this movie was that good, but I was enraptured. I enjoyed the sequel even more than the first. Again, it may have been the sheer giddiness of being back in the theater, but so what.""A Quiet Place Part II"" picks up immediately after part one. The husband and father, Lee Abbott (John Krasinski), was dead, the new baby was born, and the remaining Abbott family found a way to neutralize the aliens. Evelyn (Emily Blunt) packed up the kids and started heading to a new location based upon witnessing a burning fire used as a signal by another survivor.When they got to the other location they found a family friend named Emmett (Cillian Murphy). He was less than hospitable, yet he was a life saver. By the time the Abbotts got to him they were in bad shape and it was only a matter of time before they succumbed to the aliens or some other ailments.I thought this episode was even more exciting. I was stressed out nearly the entire movie and sitting at the edge of my seat. Some of the drama seemed a little concocted, but I didn't dwell on it too much. Every one of the Abbotts-- Emily, Regan (Millicent Simmonds), and Marcus (Noah Jupe)--grew by leaps and bounds. It's a different world now with big, fast, strong, impenetrable, deadly aliens being on the top of the food chain, but the Abbotts may just survive it. I welcome a part three.",A Quiet Place Part II
14,neil-476,So blind dumb aliends outwit humans?,7,10 June 2021,"After a brief flashback to Day 1, this film picks up from where Part 1 left off, with newly widowed Evelyn tiptoeing away from her burning house with her kids, deaf Regan, Marcus, and strangely silent baby The Baby. They fall in with Emmett, and Regan wants to take her squealing hearing aid to an island redio transmitter in order to mess up the critters' hearing.John Krasinski writes, directs, and briefly appears. Emily Blunt isn't in it a vast amount. Cillian Murphy has the main featured adult role, but Millicent Simmonds as Millicent walks away with this movie, although Noah Jupe as Marcus is also very good.I enjoyed it, as I did the original.But I've also had time to think about both. And these aliens - well, they're very fast, extraordinarily vicious and carnivorous, and they have very sensitive hearing. But they are totally blind, don't appear to have a sense of smell or echolocation, and they seem to be pretty dim. Seriously, is the best the human race can come up is to broadcast Beyond The Sea intermittently from an island? How about broadcasting a message? How about setting up sound-baited traps for these blind, stupid creatures? How about living near sources of strong ambient noise? Is there nobody left who can think?",A Quiet Place Part II
15,deloudelouvain,A good sequel.,8,31 July 2021,"Not often is a sequel of the same or even better quality than the first movie but in this case A Quite Place is a most enjoyable movie to watch. That is if you like this genre of movies. It's all more about suspense as there is not much dialogues (which is only logic with a title like that). But the suspense is created by good sound editing, well designed scary monsters, all well done CGI's, and a story that is entertaining. John Krasinski has just a very small role this time. His job is more the writting and directing for this sequel. His wife in real, Emily Blunt, never really fails. She's a convincing actress, easy to look at. I find these kind of movies (apocalyptic doom scenarios) most entertaining to watch. It's just easy cinema, nothing to think about, just sit, relax and enjoy the show.",A Quiet Place Part II
16,siderite,"Kind of the same as the first, but not as good",6,7 July 2021,"When I was watching A Quiet Place I was chuckling. Here it was, a family with three children, one of them an infant, desperately trying to survive in a world where making noise would get them killed. I kind of thought it was petty revenge from someone who enjoyed the proximity of families with children just as much as I did. And there were all the tropes from similar American movies: the independent children always messing something up, but feeling little remorse or responsibility, the valiant father protector of all who just has to die to increase the drama, the unstoppable mother who would do anything to save her children, the improbable monsters and the many ways in which one could defeat them never explored.The second part is pretty much the same story. The family finds another man to save them, the children are again independently stupid then praised for it and the group can't execute a plan together as a unit to save their lives. Literally. But the story got old, the aliens got old, and the ending pretty much uses something as an ultimate weapon, but something that had been discovered in the first film, pretty much invalidating the entire length and tension of this film. And it feels like a TV series turned film. I could imagine the same thing for The Walking Dead, for example, where only the relevant parts could easily be compressed into three films and for better effect.Bottom line: the first film was average, this one is not as good. And Millicent Simmonds still doesn't die in it. Man, her character's annoying!",A Quiet Place Part II
17,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - A Quiet Place Part II (2020) 6.7/10,7,4 June 2021,"""First thing first, Krasinski has a clear mind not to stretch the movie's scale or ambition, the narrative developments are baby steps and Part III is definitely on the drawing board. Instead, he and his teams homes in on devising the set pieces, they're routine scares, actions and twists, but work just fine, if you watch the film in the cinema, it does remind you why cinema-going is a unique experience. Munificent CGI-effects are poured into actualizing the images and motions of the gnarly, snarling creatures, which is a major upgrade from its predecessor.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks.",A Quiet Place Part II
18,thesar-2,28 Seconds Later,9,12 June 2021,"Why wasn't this called ""Another Quiet Place"" or ""A Quieter Place""?But, that's the end to any more missed opportunities.I LOVED this movie. From its cold open that blew me away - more than a few times; I haven't jumped this hard in so many scenes in such a long time, to its many memorable tense moments to one fantastic ending. Top to bottom, this was an incredible movie.The movie cold opens pre-quiet-time, and as long as you're already familiar with the original grand slam of a horror thriller, you'll be on a thousand percent alert (i.e. Why I all-but screamed a few times.) But, then: Title Card! And we're right after the first one's finale.We'll follow the family, with extreme suspense, as their previous bunker house had been compromised and much like the 28 Days/Months series and star, a solution to normality might be within their grasp. Well, as long as they avoid those nasty Species 8472 creatures.This movie is tense, smart, fun, scary, heart-pounding, lightning paced, satisfying and best of all: they set up so many scenarios that we fully understood and knew the danger without hardly having to spell it out in words or a monologue. I was so impressed with how easy they made it look by using the ""show, don't tell"" method. And because of this brilliance, the stakes were even higher and 100% rewarding when the scenes ended.No spoiler, but a Part III is already in the works. Understandable and thoroughly desirable. My hope is that it's an end to an extremely rare/almost perfect trilogy, but I understand Hollywood.Please, just let the creative geniuses behind Parts 1-2 block any sort of long franchise beyond the now, very much needed, Part III.***Final Thoughts: And on the flipside to this highly rated review, I grant the AMC Westgate I went to 1½/5 Stars and that half star is just because they're open. The staff was low (understandable due to the pandemic,) but because of that, the place was dirty and lines very long due to 6-7 employees behind the counter, but only 2 at the registers. (Not sure why they didn't move some of them to more registers, but this is why I'm rating them so low.)Also, the ""large"" popcorn (they couldn't make fast enough, two lines were forming for it) is now the size of a medium and I was forced to go to FOUR soda machines. The first three were out of many sodas and when I could find a selection, the pour sprayed syrup all over my hands and everywhere else. Not to mention, the first fill-up was 100% flat/no soda taste. I had to exit the theatre to find another machine that, once again, sprayed everywhere covering my hands and arms.And finally, zero condiments, including my beloved salt for the popcorn. The napkins they had were thinner than cheap toilet paper. Add all this to the ancient and barely comfortable seats, it's a wonder how they will get us all back in the theatre.That all said...I'm glad I went for this specific movie. For at least half the movie, it was pitch quiet, and unbelievably, the people in the audience, which included several children, were very respectful and as still as the movie. Bravo humans. Didn't see that respect coming during a pandemic.",A Quiet Place Part II
19,FeastMode,"on par with the original, with more variance",7,28 May 2021,"Great horror flick, well-made all around. Doesn't miss a beat as a continuation of the story as well as the tone and feel. Intense and suspenseful with some major tension. An awesome opening scene. Overall very enjoyable.It's hard for me to say which one is better. I think overall they are about the same. But this one had some scenes that were way better and made me think it could surpass the original. But there are other things i didn't like as much and didn't feel as natural. The original was a steadier 7 star movie, although there were some questionable parts in that one as well. (1 viewing, 5/27/2021)",A Quiet Place Part II
20,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Not quite as quiet as I'd like.,7,28 September 2021,"Right from the start, 'A Quiet Place Part II (2020)' is decidedly less quiet than its predecessor. This extends throughout the entire affair, not just the prologue (where it's actually logical), and it lessens the impact of what sets these films apart from almost all others in the genre. Most of the story is told through actual dialogue this time, which is disappointing as the use of ASL and other visual cues is one of the reasons that the first flick feels as genuinely distinct as it does. The movie also lacks the same level of character and character development. Even though it isn't groundbreaking in 'A Quiet Place (2017)', the character work goes a long way in making it as suspenseful and emotionally impactful as it is. This piece doesn't lose those elements entirely, but they are severely reduced. Another issue is the fact that one of the characters makes some truly baffling decisions, seemingly just so that their repercussions can be used to give said character something to do. It's a bit annoying, to be honest, and isn't consistent with the same character's actions in the first film. Having said all that, the experience is still a generally successful one overall. That's primarily because it's just really well put together. It features a few genuinely suspenseful sequences, some effective music, consistently solid performances and generally slick cinematography. It gets you on the edge of your seat when it needs to and it moves along at a relatively fast pace, ensuring that you never get bored. Though the story does seem a little unfocused, with a couple of side plots seeming to appear simply so that each member of the focal family has a concurrently running storyline, and it comes together in a relatively underwhelming way, its final beat evoking a feeling of déjà vu and being disappointing because of it. Still, as I said, the feature is good overall. It's uneven, but its best moments are good enough to make you easily forgive its worst. It isn't as good as its predecessor, but it's actually quite a bit better than it perhaps ought to have been. 7/10.",A Quiet Place Part II

Perhaps, Cold War anxieties related to the space race or nuclear annihilation from the 1950s (say, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951)), or terrorism earlier this century (""Cloverfield"" (2008), e.g.), and climate change since (I'm pretty sure that's what the also-recent ""The Tomorrow War"" (2021) is about). The best monsters, though, exploit the fundamental nature of the art form to horrify us with the monstrosity of cinema itself. The explicit unreality of the visual effects composited with live action (""King Kong"" (1933)), for instance, or the voyeuristic gaze of camera and spectator (""Halloween"" (1978)).In these ""Quiet Place"" movies, though, this and the first iteration from 2018, the ones frightened by cinematic tricks are the monsters. The aliens are the epitome of the anti-movie-goer. Anti-""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977). They're blind and are enraged by even the slightest noise. Play a generic Roland Emmerich blockbuster, or, ironically, a Michael Bay one (he's a producer here), and their entire species would be wiped out like the splattering of a Rotten Tomatometer score.Cleverly, that's basically what the protagonists here do. This was especially evident in the first ""A Quiet Place,"" where the director of the movie himself, John Krasinski, operated a movie laboratory in his basement: the screenplay mapped out on a crazy board, video surveillance, and tinkering with the sound mechanics of his daughter's hearing aid. Once a movie is made, though, to conflate and mutilate Film Theory 101, only indications or traces remain--a murmur from a figure moving here or there or the shadow of a presence emerging out of the corner. The auteur is no longer essential--the death of the author. The earthly, human equivalent is procreation. It's the duty of the children to decipher and see their father's film through.So, I like this sequel even though it seems somewhat predetermined, perfunctory in elaborating the preceding picture to its logical conclusion and even though a lot of the details don't make sense (mindless predators that mastered interplanetary travel, making a cryptic message instead of a straightforward one to lead people to a destination, etc.). Again, I love the sound design and the emphasis of silence even if now it comes across as the horror genre version of ""Sound of Metal"" (2019/2020). I also appreciate the sometimes jerky, unrealistic look of the aliens, which emphasizes their cinematic, composite quality. I rather enjoy the opening flashback, too, precisely because it's such a cliché beginning, as if it were cobbled together with clips from other disaster pictures. American Heartland bliss around a baseball game (reminds me of ""Men in Black"" (1997) and ""The Crazies"" (the 2010 remake), even ""Superman Returns"" (2006), among others I'm sure, as it was pick-up basketball in ""Independence Day"" and football/soccer in ""The Tomorrow War"") turned road-rage frenzy (and probably a lot of those, although ""Bird Box"" (2018) especially comes to mind). Point is, it's the precise sort of action-movie nonsense that would trigger these aliens.It's appropriate that ""A Quiet Place Part II"" is one of the first big releases of the 2021 summer season, as some see a break from the past year plus of a pandemic. The method of inoculation has been discovered, is being broadcast to the world, but the invading monsters remain in force for the time being. That's why I waited for it to stream on Paramount+, quietly, with breathable air, hidden in the seemingly safe place of home. The message is clear: we know how to kill them, so everyone do it already.",A Quiet Place Part II
24,cricketbat,A natural extension of the first movie,8,28 May 2021,"A Quiet Place Part II feels like a natural extension of the first part. It doesn't try to flip the story on its head, nor does it undercut what the original movie set up. It's full of tense moments as well as believable performances from the whole cast. This film has a simple plot, yet I found myself completely engrossed in what was going on as I tried to stay as silent as possible.",A Quiet Place Part II

The tension in this movie was best i witnessed in movies in a very long time.Overall, i won't spoil anything but just say - if you really liked the first one, you will be blown away by Part II which is a terrific thriller and sequel.

28,The-Sarkologist,Somewhat Flatter than the Original,5,29 May 2021,"Isn't it funny that when you see a pretty good film a part of you wants to see what happens next. Well, inevitably what happens next is actually not much, and that is certainly the case with this film. Okay, this film does have some interesting aspects to it, but the thing is that while the first film was pretty tense, this one sort of drops the ball somewhat. Mind you, seeing the cinema packed again does suggest that maybe things are getting back to normal, meaning that cinema worthy films are starting to appear on the big screen again, and people are happier to go back and check them out.This film pretty much picks up where the previous one leaves off, with the exception that the first part jumps back to when the aliens first attacked. I guess that was because the first film was rather low budget, and due to the first film's success, they were able to throw a lot more money into the opening sequence. Mind you, a part of me felt that it really wasn't all that necessary, and the thing is that other than introducing a new character (which didn't really need to be intruduced in that way), it just seemed to be an excuse to have lots of aliens running about smashing everything up.The film has the family encounter another person from their home town, though he isn't all that keen to have them hang around. We also know that they have discovered a weakness in the aliens, namely that there is a frequency that makes them incredibly uncomfortable. Mind you, why this guy doesn't pick up on this fact, despite him actually watching them from his snipers nest, is beyond me. I'd have thought that this discovery would have been a pretty big thing, namely because it would give them an edge.They also discover that there is a radio station that is broadcasting a song over and over again, so the girl decides to make the trek to get to this place so that she can broadcast the sound over the airwaves, and hopefully defeat the creatures (though it seems as if they are pretty entrenched already). As such, we end up with one of those post apocalyptic quest films where they have to not only deal with aliens, but also with violent gangs, in an attempt to get to this sanctuary (this has been done so many times before that it, well, gets a bit dry).This film is still tense, but in a way it wasn't anything like the previous film. Maybe it is because it is one of those films that I might prefer to watch at home, where I can pause it, have a break, and then go back to watching it as opposed to simply sitting through the film in one go. Yeah, it was sort of one of those films that did end up dragging on a bit, and I guess one of the trickiest things with watching films in the cinema is that you do basically have to sit through in one go.Yeah, like, it was okay, but as I suggested, it really wasn't all that great, and while a part of me, after the end of the first film, did want to see what happened next, when I found out after watching this film, I must admit that I wasn't too impressed. Oh, and the film seemed to end quite suddenly as well, not in the sense that you were left on the edge of your seat, but rather that the heroes had succeeded, and as such there was nothing left to do, which is probably a good thing in a sense because it means that the film doesn't drag on longer than necessary (though sometimes I do appreciate a bit of a wind down at the end, especially when it is a good film).",A Quiet Place Part II

31,Thanos_Alfie,Amazing as the first...,7,21 September 2021,"""A Quiet Place Part II"" is a Drama - Sci-Fi movie and the sequel of ""A Quiet Place"", in which we watch the Abbott family leaving their house and facing the terrors of the outside world after the incidents that occurred in the first movie.Since I had already watched the first movie I have to admit that I had high expectations from this movie and it did not disappointed me at all. It followed the successful steps of the first movie and it became even better than that. For one more time the interpretations of Emily Blunt who played as Evelyn Abbott, Millicent Simmonds who played as Regan Abbott and Noah Jupe who played as Marcus Abbott were very good and their combination worked very well. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Cillian Murphy's who played as Emmett. In conclusion, I have to say that ""A Quiet Place Part II"" is an amazing movie to watch and I highly recommend you to watch it but I suggest you to watch first the former movie and afterwards the second part.",A Quiet Place Part II

While building more of the story with the characters going through a silent post apocalyptic world. While being infested with threats and aliens.Great plot. Cillian Murphy is a great addition to the cast ensemble. The film has plenty of thrills to put you on the edge of your seat. The script and direction is great. Great music score. And the film does end for another sequel with a cliffhanger.,A Quiet Place Part II
33,eddie_baggins,Another silence inducing thrill-ride,7,26 May 2021,"Make no doubt about it, the man who loves his bare feet Mr. Quentin Tarantino will most surely be thrilled with the amount of bare feet shots present in John Krasinski's follow-up to his surprising box office smash from 2018, part 2 of A Quiet Place; for this is undoubtedly a foot fans fever dream.Whether they like their feet dirty, bloodied or bandaged, the big screen has never looked so good from the perspective of foot fiend.When it comes to the actual film here we get as a final product (a final product that was one of the highest profile delays of last year's Covid-19 scramble at the last minute), Part 2 is a tension riddled sequel to a film that had no right being as good as it was and while the uniqueness of the first film and surprisingly great concept and delivery of it is gone here as we are more aware of what is in store, Krasinski still crafts a polished and white knuckle thriller ride that's tailor-made for the big screen shared experience people are still wary about participating in.Kicking off with what could unfortunately be considered the films best set-piece as we are taken all the way back to day one of the moment the world was overtaken by a nasty sound focused alien race, Part 2 starts with a bang and Krasinski shows his growing skills here as director with some fantastically designed moments of terror and thrills then gets things going right from when the first movie finished with Emily Blunt's Evelyn Abbott and family jetting off from their overrun farm to find shelter and safety in surrounds near-by.What happens from here is better left explored by eager cinemagoers but as is to be expected things don't go too smoothly for the Abbott's as they find themselves undertaking various missions in order to survive, as well as coming to terms with Cillian Murphy's old acquaintance Emmett, who has had his own battles to deal with in the new world everyone finds themselves in.There was always a fear Part 2 would try and go too large in a universe that really benefited from keeping things small-scale in the first outing but those fears can be laid to rest fairly early with Part 2 still a character focused exercise that's built around some key set-ups and scenarios that at times might frustrate in how they got to where they were but still thrill and entertain as they take place in the moment even if the characters we grew too love first time around don't all get the benefit of the screen time you might've expected.A breakout star from the original, Millicent Simmonds as teenager Regan really gets time to shine here and its always a joy to see Cillian Murphy get a chance to be a part of such a high-profile production but surprisingly Emily Blunt and Noah Jupe as Noah get relatively little too do here and you sense that the film lacks a little impact because of this and while everything here is edited and put together in an extremely professional manner, there's a distinct lack of scares present here this time around and while audiences are likely to be spending the majority of their time with hand in popcorn rather than eating it thanks to the tense nature of the film and many silent scenes, Part 2 lacks significant moments of impact this time around with the film unlikely to be spoken about in the same manner as the first when it comes to jump scares and iconic moments.Final Say -A rare sequel that doesn't tarnish the name of its forefather, A Quiet Place Part 2 is a top-notch thriller and sees growth from Krasinski in his directing craft but while its highly enjoyable in the moment and a great experience for return cinemagoers, Part 2 of this budding universe does lack the surprise and memorability of the first outing and is unlikely to create much in the way of a lasting legacy.3 ½ first aid boxes out of 5.",A Quiet Place Part II
34,Tweetienator,Good One Again,8,20 June 2021,"A strong sequel - if you like the first part you will like this one too. Of course, there are here and there the usual weak spots plot/story wise - to create suspense the writers take the easy way (like so many these days) and let their protagonists do dumb decisions, which no one with a right mind would do (boy going out for an excursion and leaving the baby with a very limited amount of air supply alone etc.) But nonetheless, there is some good suspense and good acting and, last but not least, I was well entertained. To sum it up: A Quiet Place Part II sticks out from the current massive stream of post-apocalyptic movies like a lighthouse does in the dark of the night.",A Quiet Place Part II

37,SAMTHEBESTEST,One hell of a deserving sequel. Takes the haunting game to next level.,7,20 June 2021,"A Quiet Place Part 2 (2021) :
Brief Review -One hell of a deserving sequel. Takes the haunting game to next level. A Quiet Place 2 was hyped since the announcement and deserving so. The predecessor was a great film for this genre and the way it ended really left us all wanting for more. So, there was a burden of expectations on this one. Sometimes i feel this pre-dominated burden spoils many things for a film because viewers expect a lot so even a good stuff feel like average gross. I was worried whether the same will happen with A Quiet Place 2 or what because we had lost one of our main characters in the predecessor so this time can freshers do the same job or not. I am very glad to say that A Quiet Place 2 makes one hell of a sequel. Whatever your expectations are or whatever hype you built, i assure you that this sequel matches them all. To some people, it would be surpassing. A Quiet Place was a terrific invention in this sci fi-horror genre you know, we hadn't seen something like this since first two films of 'Alien' franchise. It's so good to see something fairly good is being made in today's time when we miss those old classics. With this sequel, it takes the horror game to next level. It improvises the storytelling from the prequel as it runs on the multilayer narration to make that cinematic experience unique and gripping. And then BOOM in the climax. Everything as real as it could be, for the humans part i mean. The performances are fantastic, the writing is top notch, the screenplay is damn pacy and the cinematography is breathtaking. The visuals are more horrifying this time because we get to multiple creatures at the same on different locations and the background score will leave you in jitters. Kransinski does it again, a loud applause for him please. Don't miss it. If you have loved the first one, you will love this one too. I won't say it's better than the prequel but it is as Excellent as that.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",A Quiet Place Part II
38,matthewssilverhammer,More of the same,5,14 June 2021,"Quiet Place Part 2 is far better directed than it is written; you could probably say the same for the first, but the gap between them was not nearly as wide as it is here. Can the aliens drive boats now? Why was the music so quiet? Why did the message have to be coded in a song? What happened to those crazy people at the docks? It's not terrible, but I'm shocked people think it's better than the near-masterpiece that is the first film. If nothing else, it's lesser because it's mostly just more of the same.",A Quiet Place Part II
39,imseeg,"I thought it was gonna be rubbish, but I was pleasantly surprised that it wasnt, because of the excellent continuous tension. Quite enticing watch.",7,21 August 2021,"I hadnt seen part one, but I had heard numerous bad reviews about how silly this story was. BUT accidentally bumping into this movie (wihout any expectations) I was quite impressed by the continuous levels of suspension, which kept me mesmerized. Yes, it is a commercial, predictable block buster, but quite a decent and entertaining one.The good: great continuous levels of suspension. Not a minute was boring. Great (althoug not terrific) acting as well. Excellent use of complete audio silence in certain scenes. Beautiful photography.Not any bad? It's too bad that the monsters dont look frightening at all. The special effects of the monsters are quite a bit of a let down, but that doesnt matter too much, because the fear of the folks that get chased by these monsters, is acted with true to life performances, which make me forget the somewhat silly and cheap special effects of the CGI monsters .More good? The continuous excellent use of the fear of what is coming, but cant yet be seen, hightens the thrilling effect dramatically.The story: Emily Blunt has got 2 deaf children and a baby whom she tries to rescue from attacks by monsters that react to the smallest sound... Sounds silly indeed, but I was surprised that such a silly story could still be such an enticing (popcorn) watch... :)",A Quiet Place Part II
40,southdavid,Feedback Loop,6,17 August 2021,"The overwhelming success of ""A Quiet Place"" meant that a sequel was inevitable. Long delayed by the Covid crisis, the film was finally released upon the reopening of cinema's in the summer of 2021. I have to say that ""A Quiet Place"" didn't hit for me like it did for some others. If I'd have found it on my own the maybe, but the hype surrounding its release built my anticipation to something the film couldn't match. This second par though I found that expectation and result were much more in tune.The remaining members of the Abbott Family leave the confines of their ruined farm and soon come across their former neighbour Emmett (Cillian Murphy), he too has lost the rest of his family, but has his own set up in an industrial facility. With her knowledge of how to defeat the alien invaders, Regan (Millicent Simmonds) sneaks away to locate a radio transmitter that is broadcasting still, knowing that the aural feedback loop would make them vulnerable. Emmett agrees to find Regan for Evelyn (Emily Blunt) who must stay with her newborn baby and with Marcus (Noah Jupe) who is injured.Taking the natural idea for the sequel and expanding the scope with more action is a solid way to do a follow up and whilst perhaps failing to do anything particularly risky with it, the film has a lot of tension. The opening scene, a flashback which sees Krasinski return in front of the camera on the day that the alien invasion begins is a wonderful bit of action. Performances are strong, with Millie Simmonds remaining a standout and with Cillian Murphy as the major new addition to the cast adding a lot to the proceedings.To be critical, it doesn't really move the overall story on very much or offer much that the initial film hadn't already covered, but it was a decent experience, and I'll be back for the inevitable part three.",A Quiet Place Part II
41,paul-allaer,Solid sequel is FINALLY playing in theaters,8,28 May 2021,"As ""A Quiet Place, Part II"" (2021 release; 97 min.) opens, it is ""Day 1"" and Lee Abbott is picking up a few things. In the store, the TV is showing footage of a disaster of some sort in Shanghai. Lee meets the rest of the family (wife Evelyn, (deaf) daughter Regan, and son Marcus) at the baseball field where Marcus and his team are playing. Just as Marcus is at bat, something dramatic plays out in the sky, causing a panic at the baseball field. It's not long before all hell breaks loose... At this point we are 5 min. Into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: John Krasinki starred in and directed the 2018 original, which became an unexpected critical AND commercial smash hit, and it wasn't long before a sequel was greenlighted. The sequel was set to be released in theaters on March 15, 2020. Then COVID-19 had other plans and brought a complete stop to the movie industry. After several more delays as the coronavirus kept raging around the country from the Spring into Summer into Fall into Winter (despite the Trump administration's repeated claims that ""we have it completely under control"" and ""one day, just like magic, it will disappear""), the movie FINALLY was released in theaters today (along with another major release, Disney's Cruella). I'm fully vaccinated and I couldn't wait to see it. The movie's 10 min. Opening sequence is ""Day 1"" which takes place BEFORE the first ""A Quiet Place""; that alone is worth the price of admission. Sheer brilliance and edge-of-your-seat tension. The rest of the movie kicks in with ""Day 474"" (meaning AFTER the first movie) and the days thereafter. Whereas the hero of the first movie was Evelyn (played by Emily Blunt), the hero in this one is arguably Regan (played by Millicent Simmonds, who is deaf in real life). But the cast is all around great. And the action scenes are terrific. But the real strength of this sequel is in its pacing and editing, giving a classroom example how to make a 90+ min. Film into something that flows by in no time for the viewers. Bottom line: John Krasinski delivers the good in this solid sequel, nothing less, and nothing more.""A Quiet Place, Part II"" had previews yesterday and opened officially today. The Friday early evening showing where I saw this at in a large theater here in Cincinnati, was much to my surprise and disappointment attended poorly: exact 8 people including myself. I hope for the film makers and for the movie theaters that this is not an indication of the long Memorial Day weekend to come. The film advertises that ""this is what theater were made for"", and right they are. If you have seen the original film, or simply a fan of ""scary movies"", I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD (starting in July) or on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",A Quiet Place Part II
42,jtindahouse,There's a lot to like but Krasinski's character leaves a big hole,8,26 May 2021,"I always say the opening scene/sequence of a film is crucial, and even more so in a horror movie. When the title card 'Day 1' pops up at the beginning of 'A Quiet Place Part 2' you know you are in for a treat. And it is a truly great sequence. I'm not normally a huge proponent of jump-scares, however the first one in this movie absolutely got me, and I'm rarely gotten. This sequence sets the tone for the film masterfully and then everything else flows from there.There is a lot I like about this film, but also a bit I didn't. I'll get the negatives out of the way first so I can finish on a positive note. The film missed John Krasinski in an acting role. In the little bit of time we get with him we are reminded of just how charming and charismatic he is. Cillian Murphy just can't replicate it. The film also didn't feel like it added much to the first. The story advances, but we don't get any new information. The film seems to exist purely as a bridge between the first and what I assume will soon be the third entry in the series. There's also a little bit of a hopeless feeling about everything. We aren't exactly sure what the endgame is in all this and that can make it slightly less investing.The positives though are plentiful. Krasinski proves the original was no fluke, he is indeed a gifted director. The film looks great, in particular the monsters. The characters are again extremely likeable, particularly both of the children. Getting kid actors to make it work is so rare but these films achieve that and the film is so much better for it. Also the pacing is lightning quick. The film is basically non-stop and the credits rolling is going to catch a lot of people off-guard I suspect.I'm a little torn on this one. I like it, but certainly a little less than the first one. It ramps things up with a lot more action and a lot more of the monsters. But it does miss Krasinski in an acting role big time and doesn't quite have the innovation of the first. It's definitely worth a watch though and I eagerly await the next entry.",A Quiet Place Part II

Again, there are holes in the plot as I wondered where the food and water came from. The young deaf girl is the star as she has figured out that feedback annoys The hell out of the aliens. By the end we find out about another shortcoming of the monsters. The story jumps around too much for my taste but is an entertaining diversion for an hour and a half.

Loved the start, it goes back to before the first movie, lots of action when the aliens first appear. Then it continues from part one, only this time it takes place on the move rather than just being set mainly in one location. The best thing about this movie is the action and the numerous jump scares, I don't think watching this at home on a TV would have the same effect. Two things that I didn't like - firstly we get introduced, rather violently, to another group of survivors. We learn nothing about them, and before you know it the story has moved on. Secondly the ending. It just happened. I was expecting more but no, it just stopped. A bit disappointing for me, I can only image that there will be another sequel to give us some better closure (that is, assuming that it will be a trilogy).

They run into some people from D-Day and decide how to best proceed to rid themselves of the creatures as well as survive while needing to be silent while also carrying around a baby. This movie is directed by and stars John Krasinski (A Quiet Place) and also stars Emily Blunt (Edge of Tomorrow), Millicent Simmonds (Wonderstruck), Noah Jupe (Ford Vs Ferrari), Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later) and Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamond). These movies are magnificent and they do such a good job of delivering the intensity of trying to be real quiet and also does a great job with the CGI of the creatures. The acting is also top notch with how the cast and characters are depicted and delivered. Krasinski does an amazing job with these pictures. It's so hard for me to say which one is better 1 or 2 but if you liked the first one you will love this one. I strongly recommend this and would score it a 9/10.",A Quiet Place Part II
49,robfollower,A Quiet Place Part II (2020),9,28 May 2021,"Drama, Horror, Sci-FiFollowing the events at home, the Abbott family now face the terrors of the outside world. Forced to venture into the unknown, they realize the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats lurking beyond the sand path.Director:John Krasinski
Writers:John Krasinski, Scott Beck
Stars:Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, Cillian MurphyThe film was extremely entertaining. Thrilling and Suspenseful. It's bigger, faster, coarser ,louder, and still menages to create tense scenes filling the theater with silent observers at times where there is absolutely no sound from the film. I sat in a row with like 10 adolescent junior high schoolers who basically we're chatting and giddy with excitement ( its fun to be young ) ! I thought to myself ""oh boy they're going to talk to the whole darn movie"" . But here's the thing. Nope. John Krasinski was able to get the moviegoers to be absolutely silent with his writing , directing and the use of the film score and sound effects . It's a pretty brilliant film and the fact that you could hear a pin drop at certain intense points in the movie is an achievement. Krasinski proves once again his prowess in directing and writing .The ideas behind the film are so strong that a gradual change up of more dialogue, more action and more monsters does not disappoint ! A nerve-wracking continuation of its predecessor, A Quiet Place Part II expands the terrifying world of the franchise without losing track of its heart. I will definitely be pre-ordering the Blu-ray when it's released .",A Quiet Place Part II
50,alindsay-al,A Great Larger Scale Film,8,11 June 2021,"After a long wait the sequel to the great film A Quiet Place has made its way to the cinema here in the UK and I watched it last night and here is my review for it. The premise of the film picks up straight from the end of the last film and sees the Abbot family attempt to survive in this world.Main Character
Emily Blunt is back in the lead role and she is really good here. She has to be an even stronger character in this scene as for obvious reasons her husband played by John Krasinski is missing from this film. She plays a strong character and the film does a good of continuing the journey that she was on following the first film and it is really cool seeing her get her hands dirtier in this film. She is joined in the lead role by Cillian Murphy this time and he is also really good, he just adds some star power to this whole thing and he is doing good work as this survivor that encounters the family. You see how this meeting really changes his mindset as a character and leads his character down a more positive road.Supporting Characters
Millicent Simmonds & Noah Jupe are given way more to do in this film and they are both really good, Simmonds in particular is phenomenal. Her character really steps up in this film and I really like how the fact she is a deaf actress allows the chance to convey emotion in different ways and make us really care about her and the narrative that she goes on in this film. Jupe also does a good job, despite the fact that he is more of an idiot in this film, his character is just not written as well as Simmonds but he just about does enough and the ending for his character does make it worthwhile. Djimon Hounsou has a small role in the film and he is fine, reports are that he joined the cast really late in the day and it does show a little bit but he works for the role that he is in.Story
The story is good, I really like the world that has been built here and how there is still a real lack of knowledge about elements like the monster. The film tells you the bare minimum still and lets you focus on the action and suspense instead of some convoluted back story that would maybe cheapen the mythos. The first ten minutes of this film are some of the best and craziest I have seen for a long time and the terror is expertly shown. But I do feel this film is lacking a little bit in terms of the family connection, the story sees the character split up which makes it feel a little disconnected from each other and means we spend less time with some characters which is a shame. Plus despite the ending being satisfying, there was an element that I feel like they weren't sure how exactly to end it and it was a criticism I had for the first film too.Script
The script is good, despite the premise of the film there is more dialogue in this film then there was in the first film but it isn't forced and feels very natural. It is a serious film which allows for a little bit of humour but that feels appropriate and the drama does work and makes you care about these people and their hunt for survival.Style
The film looks great, this film is a larger scale for sure and it works. The design of the monsters is on greater display here and for those gaming fans just imagine the clickers from The Last of Us and you have there design and it is really cool. I also saw this film in the cinema and the silence is super chilling and really sucks you into the atmosphere of the film and the terror that one slight bit of sound could be the end of the characters. But this film does have a little bit of a jump scare issue, the first film was clever and mature with its scares and this film is too but I just felt there were a few too many cheap jump scares for my liking. Also the film barely hits 90 mins and I could have done with like an extra 10 mins as it does feel a little rushed at the end.Overall
Overall, A Quiet Place 2 is a great film that needs to be seen on the big screen to be appreciated fully. I really like the two films in this universe and hopefully they keep this franchise going as I think there is so much more that can be done with it.",A Quiet Place Part II

53,yusufpiskin,Amazing (again),8,20 June 2021,I was sad when I heard that the new movie was coming. Because sequels usually suck. John Krasinski has not failed my trust. The only reason it's not as good as the first movie is because it's not the first. It's not inferior in quality to the first movie. Cillian Murphy is amazing. Noah jupe is still very good.,A Quiet Place Part II
54,cjonesas,"[8.4] Noise, O2 and water",8,3 July 2021,"A very good sequel with basically the same storyline as the first movie, but a little more expanded and explored, if juggling in confined spaces could be called exploration.The acting is the strongest redeeming factor of the movie with equal shiny performances by the ever brave and witty Emily Blunt, the deep and charismatic Cillian Murphy, the stellar Millicent Simmonds and the courageous Noah Jupe.It gravely lacks in horror and comes with a lethargic flow in between, only compensating with superb VFX.The monsters are stupid killing machines with super advanced hearing physiology all around their head and the fact that they came from space doesn't really add to their intelligence as the only thing they love doing on earth is listening and jumping on defenseless humans like wild animals. As one user rightly pointed out, what would they do after humans bye bye?! So, that's not credible and demonstrates a senseless logic or a complete lack of, in the mind of the Writer/Director. After two movies, we should already know what are their plans and what they are after; watching again a sort of incomplete 1h37m movie, told in another manner in comparison with the first one, is not a super fun thing to do.Mr. Krasinski, please elaborate in part III, whenever you feel like it...

55,kirbylee70-599-526179,SUPERIOR SEQUEL,9,9 August 2021,"At one time horror films were the last item on the list of genres for people to praise. Slowly but surely over the last few decades though horror films have risen in stature. SILENCE OF THE LAMBS garnered an Oscar win for best picture. Special effects makeup finally got noticed. CGI has made once impossible creations possible. And actual stars are making movies in the genre.In 2018 a small horror film was released with two major stars involved. John Krasinski both starred in and directed the film which also featured his wife Emily Blunt. The movie was tense and near silent. It lived up to its name A QUIET PLACE. Now two years later they both return for a second feature that gives us more to go by. It's a thrill ride that will grab you out of your seat, even at home.A QUIET PLACE PART 2 opens with day 1 of what happened, giving us more than we got in the first film. Small town USA and families are all at the baseball field watching their kids play ball. This includes the Abbott family: mother Evelyn, dad Lee and kids hearing impaired Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe) and the baby. As the game moves on there is a sudden loud explosive noise and a dark shadow crosses the sky. Everyone runs for their cars and as they begin to try and get out of town the creatures begin descending on them.Move on to day 474. This is the point where the last film left off. With Lee now dead the rest of them must regroup and figure out what to do next. Their home is in flames and they have nowhere to turn. Evelyn gathers up her family and they set out to find out if there were any other survivors. Gathering up what supplies they can as well as a makeshift amplifier that Regan uses with her hearing aid to send out a squelch that hurts the creatures, they set off into a land unknown.The group travels along fine at first but upon squeezing through a fence Evelyn accidentally sets off an alarm, a group of hanging bottles on the fence. She tells the family to run for the nearby building. On the way Marcus steps on a bear trap and the pain is so intense he can't help but scream. Someone is watching them but we don't know who. Regan sets off her loudspeaker and Evelyn shoots the creature closest to them.They continue into the building and the mysterious person grabs them and leads them to a location inside that is safe. It is then that Evelyn recognizes their benefactor, Emmett (Cillian Murphy), Lee's best friend. Emmett tells them they can stay the night but no longer.That night though Marcus and Regan pick up a radio station transmitting. Their home was too far away to pick up the reception. This gives them hope that there are others alive still. Regan comes up with the idea that if she can reach this radio station they could broadcast the feedback she gets from her earpiece and weaponized it against the creatures. She tells this to Marcus and the next day sets out on her own to reach the station.From here the film splits the survivors into two groups. One is Regan and Emmett who tracks her down to help her and the other has Evelyn leaving Marcus with the baby to search for medical supplies. One of the most amazing sequences takes place when both come across danger in their paths and the suspense of one group's predicament is compounded by the same thing happening at the same time to the other. It's a fantastic plot device.This move does a far better job of creating a natural feeling of terror in the story being told. It's great that we get at least a little of the backstory. The acting here is amazing especially from Simmonds who does a superb job. Krasinski shows that he can handle himself in the director's chair as well as he can in front of the camera. Everyone turns in a great performance here.The movie can be found everywhere right now from your local Redbox to rental on your cable stations or even free on Paramount +. I can't recommend this one highly enough. It is a thrill ride that will have wondering when the silence will be broken next and what dangers that will result in. And if that weren't enough it has a nice twist at the end. This one is worth going out of your way to watch.",A Quiet Place Part II
56,lukem-52760,Major Improvement Over The Stupid First Film!!! CILLIAN MURPHY steals the show.,6,12 September 2021,"I did not like the first film because it went ridiculously stupid towards the end with the ridiculously unnecessary sacrifice the father Lee (John Krasinki) made when he didn't need to do it!!! Frustrating, boring & silly was the first film but oh my did they do better with the sequel.The best thing about this superior sequel was the casting of the brilliant CILLIAN MURPHY!!! This guy is a fantastic actor & one i liked from way back in the Classic ""28 Days Later"" & then the underrated but excellent ""Sunshine"" this guy is great & steals the show here as lone survivor Emmett. A man who has lost everything to those savage creatures. His family is dead but he's still good enough to help the Abbott family when they turn up at his hideout. Murphy is such a strong actor & he acts alot from his emotional eyes & is so good here.Emily Blunt gives another strong performance too as do the rest of the cast to be honest.Another plus is we see the first invasion from the creatures & see much more of them & the film has a more exciting & ferocious pace than the slow first film.Cinematography is better too & strangely by the end of the film it felt like an episode of Stranger Things!!! Obviously inspired by that series.All in all this is a great sequel that beats the original & introduces better characters (CILLIAN MURPHY) & explores the Apocalyptic land more & we see others survivor's good & bad.",A Quiet Place Part II

58,kluseba,Establishing one of the greatest contemporary science-fiction and horror movie franchises,8,28 June 2021,"A Quiet Place Part II is obviously the sequel to the successful science-fiction horror movie that became a blockbuster three years ago. This film is on the exact same level as its predecessor and should please fans of the original movie while not being able to introduce any new ideas and attract possible new fans.The synopsis shall be kept as briefly as possible to avoid even minor spoilers. The film introduces the origins of the dystopian world presented in the first movie in the opening sequence before continuing right where the first movie ended. The surviving family members of the first film are looking for other survivors and meet a reclusive former friend who is hiding in an abandoned steel foundry. The group of survivors discover a radio station signal that might indicate that another group of survivors is hiding on an island. The reclusive man and the stubborn daughter go on an epic journey to find out more information about that island while the mother and her two sons stay behind and protect their hideout in the foundry.This movie convinces on numerous levels. First of all, dialogues are scarcely used and employed with care, meaning and precision. Up next, the movie oozes with atmosphere due to excellent sound effects. The locations in this film are more diversified than in its predecessor and it's a wonderful visual experience to follow the recluse and the daughter on their journey to the island. The special effects are employed with care as they aren't overused which make the monsters even more mysterious. The acting performances are quite convincing and especially deaf teenage actress Millicent Simmonds is absolutely authentic and one of the greatest teenage actresses to be around.There are very few elements that could be interpreted as minor flaws. The movie fails to summarize the events from the first film as it takes some time for viewers to remember what exactly happened. The scenes between the opening sequence and the meeting at the steel foundry might slightly overstay their welcome. This sequel leaves several questions unanswered which means that there is probably going to be at least a third movie in the near future.At the end of the day, this movie is as great as its predecessor which means that A Quiet Place is one of the best contemporary science-fiction and horror franchises. This movie convinces with authentic acting performances, gripping atmosphere and an epic story that entertains from start to finish. My suggestion would be to watch the first movie right before discovering its sequel which would make for an eventful movie night with a few friends.",A Quiet Place Part II
59,Pairic,Silence is golden,8,10 June 2021,"A Quiet Place Part II: Day 1 of the Invasion. A sleepy small town, a kid baseball game, suddenly something hurtling through the sky. Utter horror, nay, existential terror as the hippo sized spider creatures appear, tossing cars about, emerging from a the windscreen of a bus after killing/devouring the passengers and driver. Then were on to day 474. Evelyn (Emily Blunt) leads Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe) in search of refuge, meeting up with Emmett (Cillian Murphy) who is at first reluctant to provide shelter. This is a tale of the quest for safety, both immediate and long term. There is always the risk of attack by the creatures, silence isn't just golden, it's mandatory. The experience of the deaf Regan is portrayed by absolute silence but she is no victim. She takes part in the fight against the spiders and human foes as feral human scavengers are encountered. There are many shock/jump shots in the film, some caused by mundane events but all the more effective because of that. Some gruesome scenes of horror but also banal shots of a suitcase, a laptop, shoes, abandoned on a train station platform evoke a tale of terror. A worthy sequel with good performances from Blunt, Simmonds, Murphy and Jupe. Written and Directed by John Krasinski. 8/10.",A Quiet Place Part II

I usually don't care for survival horror, but this was done especially well. I would only say that I think some of the more dramatic bits were a little forced; hopefully, if Krasinski makes a full-on drama, it will be after more years of experience.

62,masonfisk,A WORTHY SEQUEL....!,9,19 July 2021,"The sequel to the 2018 original takes place immediately after the events of the last film w/the ragtag family; mom, kids & newborn (Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds & Noah Jupe) making their way back into the world. No sooner than they cross into uncharted territory (a smelting plant), Blunt sets off a boundary alarm & Jupe, while fleeing to safety, gets his foot caught in a bear trap. Once they're led to safety by a masked stranger into a kiln (which can sustain air for a limited time), their rescuer reveals himself to be an old neighbor of theirs, played by Cillian Murphy, who we saw during an extended prologue showing the day when the creatures arrived. He's like most of the survivors they've come across; shell-shocked, unwillingly to engage w/others & downright hopeless but when Simmonds shows them they've developed a way to fight back (using her hearing aid to amplify feedback through a speaker which can incapacitate the monsters long enough for someone to attack their exposed weak areas) so when they hear Bobby Darin's classic 'Under the Sea' being played from a nearby radio station, Simmonds figures it's a message rather than some random song being aired on a loop. Convinced of her position, Simmonds heads off toward the signal (which resides on an island just off the coast) w/Blunt sending Murphy off to rescue her before she's killed. Meanwhile Jupe, still recuperating from his injuries must stay behind to care his newborn sibling while Blunt travels into town to replenish their medical supplies which all takes a backseat as the monsters come to attack them. John Krasinski, coming back to the fold as a writer/director this time (he does show up in the preamble to the calamity) & wisely parses the story down to its essentials by moving the story forward logically but also ratcheting the suspense to its breaking point any chance he gets. Simmonds is the standout again being the fulcrum on which the story hangs, never being a heroine who is super human but one who can never be called a victim who never gives up in spite of the overwhelming odds (the same can be said for the rest of the clan as well as Jupe gets his moment to shine near film's end). Also starring Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou as an island inhabitant & Scoot McNairy from Gone Girl unrecognizable as a lost member of a pier dwelling tribe who briefly attack Simmonds & Murphy.",A Quiet Place Part II

64,aidanratesmovies,"Again overrated, but not bad",5,15 July 2021,"Formulaic and a bit bland- but remotely entertaining for the most part- A Quiet Place Part II continues its story from the original without ever improving or weakening its material. Millicent Simmonds thankfully has a much bigger role in this film than the last one, and is easily the best actress throughout. I thought the story this time around was far more interesting than the previous film, making it sit in my head a little more positively- but ultimately its plot its stretched out too thin to make any major impact. The film looks great, some of the best cinematography of the year, blending such dark and somber colors with bright hopeful ones all mixed with the existential fear of dread. Some moments can be a bit intense, but for the most part I found the film to be far less scary than the previous one, although its car chase scenes are far more effective than the majority of the scares in either film. Its pacing weakens quite dramatically by the end, and its predictability can have a bit of an affect on that too. Some moments can be a bit silly, earning an eye roll or two. It's far from a bad film, and it's nearly impossible to not compare it to the first. In the end, I found it to be a very slight improvement upon the original, with some solid moments, but all together it doesn't live up to the hype or potential it could have had- and settles for a rather easier route.My Rating: 5.5/10.",A Quiet Place Part II

Forced to venture into the unknown, they realize the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats lurking beyond the sand path.Let's start with what's good about this film .The first 15 minutes I really enjoyed .

We then go back to when the last film left off.Now with the many things that are wrong with it . The Alien in the room so to speak .I don't want to give any plot spoilers but we learn through the course of the film that the badly CGI'd aliens have weaknesses and those weaknesses are utterly ridiculous.One is to do with sound and the second is to do with water .They've managed to travel from another planet and invade the world yet they can't do two very fundamental things !It's almost as bad as Independence Day where they plug in a laptop and give the space ship a virus and everything is ok with the world !No it's not ! It's Lazy writing and ruins the film and that is the case in this movie .I felt myself dozing off through parts of the film because of the silence. That novelty has worn off from the first film .The kids have more of a frontline role and that's not good .

As a new character Emmett who lost his whole entire family and has nobody.Emily and Millicent are great as the latter is really deaf in real life and really we get to see her developed.

69,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid Follow Up Mainstream Creature Feature,8,15 June 2021,"This was a movie that I was interested in checking out because of how good of a theater experience I had with the original. This was another of those films that was caught in the pushback of theaters being closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the vaccine and things seeming to go back to normal somewhat, this one is finally getting its run which is where Jaime and I saw it. We also rewatched the original a couple days before as a refresher. The synopsis here is following the events at home, the Abbott family now faces the terrors of the outside world. Forced to venture into the unknown, they realize the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats lurking beyond the sand path.I will put in here now that there is going to be slight spoilers to the original movie. Without them, I couldn't give a brief recap as this does pick up right where the last one ended.We start this off actually on Day 1. Lee Abbott (John Krasinski) parks his truck along Main Street and the town is quiet. He goes into a store to buy some items and the man running it is distracted. On the news there is a report about a bomb going off in what I believe was Hong Kong. I could be wrong on the location. You get the feel this is a small town as Lee has a tab. He then goes over to the baseball field, where everyone seems to be watching a little league game. Lee goes to the stands where he sits with his daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds). His friend sits diagonal behind him of Emmett (Cillian Murphy).While Marcus Abbott (Noah Jupe) is up to bat, in the sky something is streaking across on fire. This family's world along with the rest of the town is turned upside down with whatever the creatures were from the previous movie attack.We then shift to present day, right after the events of the first movie. Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt) along with Regan, Marcus and their newborn set out. They've discovered a way to kill these creatures, but due to the events of that fateful night during the climax of the previous movie, they need to find a new place to hold up.They follow the sand path Lee made as far as it goes and they go beyond it. Lee knew there were at least 2 other creatures living in the area. They are heading in the direction of the closest signal fire they could see each night. This leads them to a foundry where Emmett is living. Marcus is injured and another creature forces them back into hiding.It is then they discover a song playing over the radio. I believe it is Frank Sinatra's Over the Sea'. Regan thinks there is something more to it and it could lead them to a way where they could kill off the rest of the creatures that are living in the area. In order to do this though, this group is going to have to put their lives on the line where fear runs deep.Where I want to start here is stating that I like what this movie does. I don't watch trailers for horror movies anymore, but going to the movies with Jaime, I did catch a bit of this one. I'm not upset with the trailer as it does show a scene that was pretty early into the movie. It is a tense one though. I like that we open this one up on Day 1 of this new world. Since the original jumped in at Day 89, a sequel should fill in more of the story and that's what we get here.Once the movie picks up after the events of the first one, it works as well. I don't necessarily agree that they need to move on. They know how to kill the creatures, their farm isn't that destroyed and it seems closer to town. I'm not going to harp on this though. With what they went through that fateful night before, I can see moving on due to the sadness that could be there. The movie does well in explaining certain things like why Lee, who seems quite intelligent, couldn't discover this radio station that is still running. Another thing as well, I think this movie does well in establishing a bit more about these creatures. I'm glad they don't over-explain them though. No one is an expert and can only share what they've discovered.Taking this one to the road allows them to expand the world more. We learn more about Emmett and where he's staying. I like seeing what other people are doing to survive since it is similar while also being different. Staying in an industrial forge like he is makes sense with how ore is refined. We also get to meet some bad people that he warns the group of. There is also something quite important we learn as we near the third act as well.That seems to recap the story enough there so I think next I'll shift to the acting. Across the board I'm glad they got all of the actors back so that is good. Blunt is solid as this mother that needs help. That's not to say she isn't strong, but she has 3 children. Regan is strong willed and helps her, but Marcus needs to find that strength. He is nervous by nature. I like that we get a bit of Krasinski here. He's good for that cameo. Simmonds is really good as Regan for me. I like that she's taking on that lead role that is left vacant and thinks she can save everyone. Jupe annoys me. It isn't his performance; his character just needs to step up. I believe it though and it works for me. There would be a minor gripe that the kids aged too much in the 2 years, but I'm not going to hold it against the movie. They got them back. I did like the addition of Murphy. He's an actor I'm a fan of and he fit right in. Aside from that, I'd say the addition of Djimon Hounsou and the rest of the cast rounded this out as well.Something that I really liked about the original movie was the sound design. This movie does it very well again. It works for me when they're focusing on Regan and it goes completely silent. We're experiencing it how she would. I'll be honest; it is even more effective here for where her character goes. The use of quiet is well done and I think that the music fits to help build the tension of the scene. This is again one of the strongest parts of the move.Then finally I'll go over the cinematography and the effects. For the former, I think this movie is shot very well. It looks great to me and I'd say that it feels like the world has ended. I'd also say that the effects are solid. The creatures are CGI, but I don't have problems with it. When done right, it works. I also think that the limited blood we get looks good as do when characters are injured. No real issues here.That's all I really wanted to delve into here so in conclusion, I thought this was a good follow up to the original one. For a sequel, I think that we really need to take what the first does and expands on it. That is what we get here. The movie fills us in on the events of the beginning of the world ending and then we pick up where the last one was. With the original being more contained, we explore this world more here. I think the acting is good, the effects work for me and the cinematography was solid. The sound design of the movie was great and the soundtrack fit. I'd say this is a good movie. If you like the original, I think you'll enjoy this one. To be honest, I think more will find this to be better to be honest as some of the issues in the previous aren't necessarily here for me.",A Quiet Place Part II
70,jadepietro,A Very Sound Sequel,8,1 June 2021,"IN BRIEF: Tension-filled sci-fi sequel.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Perhaps, the one movie that I most eagerly awaited this past year is John Krasinski's sequel, A Quiet Place Place II. Seeing this sci-fi thriller on the big screen in movie theaters has finally become a reality. (Its forerunner was my top film back in 2018.) That original film was an exemplary example of efficient storytelling, fine acting, and skillful direction that caused liftoff from many seats in the theatre during its many tense set pieces. After numerous delays due to the COVID pandemic and studio's hesitancy to release it, that film's latest chapter arrives to officially kick off the summer movie season. (Dear Moviegoers, I urge you to see the original movie prior to viewing this latest installment. It's a masterwork in suspense.)
In this nifty sequel, we again meet up with the Abbott family after their many scary encounters with savage aliens who can attack their prey by detecting the softest of sounds. Now with a newborn baby in tow, they journey across a silent country to seek shelter. (I might want to add a rather obvious caveat here that this just may be the best behaved infant in cinema history, but let's just move on, shall we?)Writer/ Director Krasinski solidly establishes his suspenseful story-line and doesn't dwell on gore and grisly violence that is so commonplace with many filmmakers nowadays. There are many cleverly constructed set pieces to savor (Some highlights: a knock-out opening sequence, the first of many escapes in a steel foundry). As with his prior film, the director is more interested in the chase than the possibly bloody results. In this second chapter, he wisely inserts the events happening from Day One which helps the continuity of his tale and brings his fatherly character full circle. We view the life-altering adaptations people create in order to survive in their new world, and it becomes a sad reminder to us all as we experience the film now through a COVID mindset, making the sequel even more relatable.While the originality of the predecessor is missing and some situations begin to strain the script's credibility in this second go-round, the film works most effectively as it builds tension with its deft usage of contrasting sound and silence, a lesson well learned by Mr. Krasinski. (The same sound design team, Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van der Ryn, are back in control and sure to earn their second Oscar nomination. Perhaps they will win this time.) With minimal dialog to convey the storytelling. Mr. Krasinski's screenplay is more than serviceable as it sets up the riveting plot while hinting at the perilous situations for these well defined characters.The visuals remain haunting as lensed by Polly Morgan and the cast reprises their roles with much gusto. Once again, Emily Blunt radiates strength and determination as Mother Evelyn but it is Noah Jupe and deaf actress Millicent Simmond who become the main focus in this sequel and the young actors are thoroughly convincing as the traumatized children, Marcus and Lee. In fact, it is the complex family drama which elevates the standard horror genre expectations once again. Contributing strong support are Cillian Murphy and Djimon Housou as two survivors who befriend the family, plus a stoic Mr. Krasinski as Papa Lee adds that needed touch of melancholy. Top-notch production design by Jess Gonchor, an ominous sounding music score by returning composer Marco Beltrami, and Michael P. Shawver's concise editing provide the film's many well-earned scares.Not as great as the original tour de force, A Quiet Place Part II is still a very worthy successor. Let us hope these two installments will lead to a rousing trilogy in the future, but only if helmed once again by the talented Mr. Krasinski and company. (GRADE: B)",A Quiet Place Part II
71,rannynm,A Screaming Delight with Surprising Twists and Major Intensity,10,27 May 2021,"As much as Emily Blunt and John Krasinski have to be incredibly silent, A Quiet Place Part II is a screaming delight with surprising twists and major intensity. Just when you think you can't get enough of these mind-boggling jump scares, the film provides new creative plot lines that make you jump left and right. The film does lack a major conclusion, which doesn't really give viewers closure, and it leaves you with the thought, ""Wait, the movie's over?""As you can guess, A Quiet Place Pat II picks up after the events of A Quiet Place. The film follows the Abbott family after they leave their previously destroyed home. When they discover a nearby outlander named Emmett (Cillian Murphy), they attempt to work with him so they can face the challenges outside their known world to survive the day. This sequel broadens the universe in ways that we could have never known in the first movie.When it comes to a horror film, of course you need plenty of monsters. The increased amount of screen time the aliens have in A Quiet Place Part II is immensely more than the first movie. The visual effects department stepped up their game, really improving the CGI with plenty of detail, and making the aliens look a lot more realistic. With the number of aliens being amped up, of course the amount of action is too. The film includes as much action as you could possibly have in a 90 minute runtime.The one word that describes A Quiet Place Part II is - intense. The sequel adapts its genre from horror to more of a thriller, with an emphasis on thrills. Certain parts of the film can be very extreme and make your heart pump out of your chest. It might seem scary on the outside, but on the inside, it demonstrates themes of family and friendship. It also expresses the importance of trust, and how you should bestow it upon new people in your life.Topping an outstanding first movie is an almost impossible task, but director John Krasinski proves it to be possible by making A Quiet Place Part II superior to the first movie. Without a doubt A Quiet Place Part II is dialed up 100% from the first movie, improving the alien screen time and CGI that the debut movie lacked. Therefore, I give A Quiet Place Part II 5 out of 5 stars and recommend the film for ages 13 to 18, plus adults.Reviewed by Jude A., KIDS FIRST!",A Quiet Place Part II
72,justin-fencsak,this movie is an improvement over the original in every way.,10,14 July 2021,This is my first review since I joined letterboxd. See it in an empty theater where no one has their phones on. If your ears are sensitive then this movie is not for you.,A Quiet Place Part II
73,Rob_Taylor,A Quite Unrealistic Place Part 2: No One Does What They Are Told...,5,28 June 2021,"It's hard to imagine what they were thinking here. Let's make a sequel to the first movie, but make everyone even dumber than before, maybe?There isn't one character who acts sensibly in the whole movie. Even Cillian Murphy's character, the lone voice of caution, quickly crumples under the awful writing in this movie.I mean, Kracinski wrote it, right? So, I think he missed his calling. He should be writing teen-slasher flicks instead of sci-fi. He has a real talent for making his characters do dumb things to further the plot.Additionally, the much vaunted ""See how it all began"" rhetoric that was spouted in the marketing amounts to about ten minutes max of people running and screaming near the beginning. Then its back to the present for the rest of the film. Nothing new is learned really in those ten minutes. Though, in hindsight, I should have seen this as foreshadowing. The rest of the movie is people running and screaming for the most part.I hoped after the first movie that they would address the elephant in the room which was the creature's dependence on sound to hunt. But, whilst they develop the groundbreaking (sarcasm) feedback weapon that stunned the aliens before (because nobody else could figure that out, right?), they do little to address what a weakness such a sound dependence would actually be.Instead, we are shown another weakness of the beasties... they can't swim. A moment's reflection on this revelation should have you wondering why there aren't a LOT more survivors. Everyone on islands. Everyone on a boat. Everyone that could get on an island or a boat during the initial attack. That has to amount to a sizeable chunk of humanity. Yet the airwaves are as silent as if everyone was dead. Well...except for the one radio station on an island that our heroes have to get to, of course.As much as I hate writers that make their characters do dumb stuff in order to further the plot, I hate writers that don't think their plots through properly. The ships and islands thing is just a terrible convenience for the small story being told that completely undermines the bigger picture.The crowning scene of badness for me was the boatyard scene. Our heroes enter the area, which somehow has electric lighting, and don't seem to wonder how or why there is still power on there. Needless to say they encounter the worst, most utterly incompetent group of ninja thugs imaginable. People that set a trap, then threaten murder and worse, and don't seem to entertain the notion that, in extremis, their victims might, you know... make a loud noise. A kind of ""If I die, you're going with me"" kind of deal. It's hard to imagine that the thugs ever caught anybody at all.So is this movie worth your time? If you liked the first one, I guess so. If you found it a bit irritating and annoying then this second helping will only further make you grind your teeth in frustration.SUMMARY: More daft plot-driven antics by the main characters. A bad reveal that undermines the ""humanity is destroyed"" plot. The family still refuses to find pairs of slippers to wear whilst walking around.",A Quiet Place Part II
74,vengeance20,Cinema IS back!,7,5 June 2021,"Saw the first A Quiet Place back in '018 & thought it was good, but not amazing. This sequel I'd say is as good as it's a predecessor after a over year long wait thanks to Covid.The film picks up where the last one left off EXACTLY. Which follows the single mum & her kids trying to escape the post apocalyptic town in which the sound driven aliens attack if so much as a pin drops in their presence. This time a friend of the family helps the mum & her kids to get to safety & escape the aliens creatures wrecking havoc in the once lively town.I found the film to be as good as the 2018 original. While like the first film I didn't find it amazing & lacking in gore & violence, I still found this sequel to be pretty good & entertaining enough to get you through the 1 hour & 29 minute cut. The action was great & some what better than what the first film offered. The boat dock scene was pretty good.I liked the opening which I think shows how the aliens came to be in the town in the first film, not to mention how the town itself became a post apocalyptic waste site. It definitely explains how it started.I did however, feel the film dragged a lot in a couple of places & could've been beefed up with more action.But aside from that, the film was pretty good & definitely worth a watch! I guessed right there would be A Quiet Place 3 & I was right, there with be! Can't wait!7/10.",A Quiet Place Part II

Nevermind wait for part 3 it is unacceptable for a film to end abruptly with no explanation as to what happens next.The film starring, written, directed and produced ( yawn) by John kransinski is a blatant cash grab. The story goes nowhere, there is no real explanation as to why the aliens are there and I also found it amazing how they were able to jump off the meteor so quickly.Overall an entertaining alien movie which needs to flesh out the story and have more of a plot than be quiet or die.",A Quiet Place Part II
76,nancyldraper,A superb thriller,9,13 August 2021,"Just as good as the first one (which is always a crap shoot with a sequel). The suspense, the heroics, the cleverness are all in this plot. The writing and acting are superb. I think these two movies should be on everyone's MUST WATCH list. Don't be put off this being called horror. The creatures are ugly but this is driven by dramatic tension. (Trust me, I'm too much of a wimp to watch horror.) As with its predecessor, I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Dramatic Suspenseful Thriller}",A Quiet Place Part II
77,arungeorge13,A solid sequel that delivers on almost every count! [+74%],7,29 June 2021,"""There Are People Out There. People Worth Saving.""Once I got accustomed to preposterous the idea of bringing a baby into a post-apocalyptic world where alien creatures attack (and get attacked) by sound in A Quiet Place, the sequel was infinitely more enjoyable and tense. The opening scene, with a Krasinski cameo, is a stunner. It offers context to franchise beginners as well as makes existing fans miss Krasinski's character, Lee, even more. More so, it is a classic example of how to set the tone for the remainder of a (sci-fi horror) movie. The sequel does borrow more from The Last of Us when Cillian Murphy's Emmett and Millicent Simmonds' Regan take centrestage. The others (Emily Blunt as Evelyn and Noah Jupe as Marcus) have their moments too, but the greater adventure here is that of Regan's. She's really the one who pulls all strings to get something substantial done here.Krasinski once again positions these very curious, very vulnerable characters in uncanny situations. While the novelty of the creatures attacking by sound may have subsided, the set pieces are still solidly crafted and brilliantly edited (by Michael P. Shawver), with the addition of Murphy as a reluctant protector, a perfect casting choice. The cross-cutting between situations comes across as a masterstroke (something that also worked for me in a film like James Wan's The Conjuring). That's also why the pre-climax set-piece is a lot more thrilling. The use (and absence) of sound (by designers Ethan Van Der Ryn and Erik Aadahl) is once again, spot-on. I wish I could have experienced it all in Dolby Atmos or IMAX sound.As with most sequels, certain original ideas get diluted in the process of inculcating newer ones (the aliens apparently can't swim). In many ways, A Quiet Place Part II only mildly advances in plot, setting up the stage for an even more grandiose sequel. It certainly lacks the sheer intensity of the original, but A Quiet Place Part II is racy, suspenseful, and slickly made. Verbal exposition is kept to a minimum while visual storytelling sits firmly in the driver's seat.",A Quiet Place Part II
78,martimusross,"Very Disappointing, The Story Did Not Advance, Just More Of The Same!",5,2 June 2021,"A Quiet Place IIOverall I was very disappointed with this movie, the story failed to move forward in any way, why did the aliens come to earth, how did they arrive, what was their goal, what was the military response to invasion, if the daughter had discovered high pitched sounds others would have done so also, how was earth striking back!We just had a repetition of the first movie with at one stage no less three separate groups wandering around with torches, trying to be silent.We had the ""revelation"" that the invaders could not swim but this new bit of information was not developed, and the ""protected"" community appeared to make no contingency plans apart from popping another sausage on the BBQ!Characters were inconsistent, the son was at one minute a babbling coward and the next a strident hero. The neighbour was distant abrasive and aggressive and then 5 minutes later willing to sacrifice his life to search for a stranger.The AB acting and jump-scare grated as we had all sat through the first movie and we were all desperate for both story and character development. Lastly I paid for 4DX and nothing moved so it was money for old rope!At best this is a 5 out of 10, meaning disappointing fare all round!",A Quiet Place Part II

All the time.(4) A record is played 24/7 (""Beyond the Sea""} to give listeners a clue as to where a safe island is. Seriously? They can't just broadcast a location?(5)No one tells anyone that the monsters are afraid of water.(6) In a powerless world dock lights are blazing brightly.(8) No one thinks to throw stuff at a distance away to distract the monsters.(9)The ending was yet another whimper (of laughter) from me.

A Quiet Place Part II, a movie that stuck to the rules (a family on a farm battles aliens), while adding depth to character, doesn't follow this indication. The cast is not stellar but very good and the plot (of course) not original as the first one. What lacks is in my opinion the unity, in the sense of an overall feeling (while watching the movie) that all is connected, re time and place.

I am so glad they managed to keep the spirit of the first movie while telling a new story. Because they were careful to not just make a carbon copy of Part 1, they did lose some of the charm that made it unique but it was inevitable. I still highly recommend it!",A Quiet Place Part II
84,gedikreverdi,The ending was so abrupt,6,8 July 2021,"I really enjoyed it but it ended so abruptly. It's as beautiful as the first film which is a very rare thing for a sequel. The opening scene showed us the first day and how they came from the outer space. They're aliens. Then they left the farm and ended up in a dilapidated old factory where one of their neighbors was living. The boy stepped on a bear trap and got injured and the man let them inside the industrial furnace down the factory. After the girl heard a song on the radio and located the station on an island, she decided to go there and transmit the ringing noise thru the radio to everyone. But on her way she was almost getting killed in a wagon and the neighbor guy helped her and the two went to the island together. At the dock, they were attacked by a group of people and they saved themselves by diving into the water. The aliens weren't able to swim so the island community was as normal as it was before until they noticed they brought some of them to the island with them. It was very claustrophobic when the boy got stuck in the furnace with the baby with their very low oxygen supplied as the alien chased him down the basement. Their mother helped them but the three got stuck in the furnace and was being attacked by one of them and she started to broadcast her solution for the invasion. I like creature feature films and I liked this one too but the screenplay was a bit too safe. Nothing unexpected happened. No one got killed and almost zero addition to the survivors of part 1. Also first part is more scary with all that isolation, unknown but this felt like some movie titled as ""Stranger Goonies"".",A Quiet Place Part II

87,aciessi,The Silent Treatment,6,11 October 2021,"It's the lost film of 2020. It held its world premiere in NYC, nearly a week before the world shut down and became its very own Quiet Place. No, the sensory-overloaded spider creatures didn't invade our planet. At least that would have been better mitigated. A Quiet Place: Part II is a horror sequel that doesn't take any new risks, which leaves a lot to be desired. But it understands what made its predecessor work so well. Don't fix what isn't broken, you can say. There's a lot of suspense and a lot of creature horror that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Emily Blunt and co. Are once again trying to survive unscathed, except this time, they know how to kill the beasts. If there is one new question that this sequel asks, it's how does civilization begin to re-emerge from such an existential crisis? Can we speak to each other again?

88,Benjamin-M-Weilert,More of the same without advancing the larger plot significantly.,6,25 August 2021,"I'm not usually a fan of horror films, so when A Quiet Place (2018) came out, it was a unique enough concept to pique my interest. While I appreciated the original concept, which played off the audio-visual nature of movies, the cliffhanger ending left me wanting more. Fast forward three years, and I finally got to see the sequel. It was...disappointing. I think I had gotten my hopes up after the first movie wowed me with its suspense and PG-13-level horror but A Quiet Place Part II (2021) was basically just more of the same.What's perhaps the most frustrating thing about both these movies is that they could have easily been combined both films and still kept the run-time below three hours. With each movie being around 90 minutes long, there could have been a tighter story between the two entities if some repetitive scenes were cut out of the sequel. The fact that it's clear they want this franchise to keep going is frustrating because the sequel's plot felt like a beat-for-beat repeat of the first movie while introducing more questions than it answered.I can still appreciate the sound design that goes into this kind of horror-thriller, but that's all it really has going for it. They didn't learn anything new about the aliens, they didn't develop any new ways to kill them, and they ended up copying the same cliffhanger ending from Part I. I'd love to see a re-cut of both of these movies together, perhaps even in chronological order so the alien invasion flashback that started this film off would have set the stage for the combined film. In the end, I'll still probably see Part III (2023), but there need to be some significant improvements.More of the same without advancing the larger plot significantly, I give A Quiet Place Part II 3.0 stars out of 5.",A Quiet Place Part II

90,bankofmarquis,"Good, maybe even very good, but not Great sequel",8,3 June 2021,"Did you enjoy the first A QUIET PLACE film? This horror/thriller from 2018 was unique in that it emphasized the suspense portion of the horror genre while relying, heavily, on sound (or the lack thereof).The inevitable sequel picks up right where the first film ends, following the survivors of the first film as they make their way to a new ""Quiet Place""...and, while not as unique as the first film, certainly holds its own as an entertainment and if you enjoyed the first one, you'll enjoy this, the 2nd of what is promised to be a Trilogy.Written and Directed by John Krasinski (who wrote and directed the first one) A QUIET PLACE PART II has an opening sequence (pre-credits) that is as good of an opening sequence as I have seen for quite some time (maybe all the way back to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN - it's that good of an opening sequence). Again, Krasinski infuses sound (and the lack thereof) as he changes the focus of this opening scene from a deaf character (with the lack of sound) to non-deaf characters (with LOTS of sound). It is this juxtaposition of sound (and not sound) that makes an indelible impression. This opening scene is worth the price of admission all by itself.And...that's important... for the rest of the film is good, maybe even very good, but not great. Emily Blunt returns and is a formidable screen presence, but since this film focuses as much (if not more) on the 2 kids (Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds - more on them later), Blunt is relegated to a co-starring (and maybe a supporting) role, which is too little Emily Blunt in this film for my taste.The always dependable Cillian Murphy is along for the ride this time around as a fellow survivor who has to work through some cowardice issues. While, at first, it looked like Murphy was putting in a ""workmanlike, but unspectacular"" performance, by the end of the film it becomes much, much better. A good, maybe even very good, but not great, performance.As for the kids, Noah Jupe does a good, maybe even very good (but not great) performance, but that might be because Millicent Simmonds as the deaf child (she is a deaf actress herself) is REMARKABLE in her role - and this is needed for a large portion of this film follows her journey - and it is a journey worth watching. I hope this young actress gets a ton more work after these series of movies. I am going to be very interested in seeing her do other things.Director Krasinski pulls many of the right levers in stringing out the audience - and the tension - throughout the film (though, as is often the case in these types of films, I wanted to yell at the screen a couple of times when characters did stupid things that you knew were gonna end up poorly for them). He, again, relies on suspense (and not gore) in scaring his audience and succeeds much more than he fails in this flim.All-in-all, a movie that would be a wise choice to bring you back into the Cineplex. The (albeit small) crowd that saw the film in the theater I watched it in had more than 1 time where we all jumped and screamed together - and I realized that I had missed that.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",A Quiet Place Part II
91,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Entertaining as long as you leave the brain home,6,30 June 2021,"I really didn't like the first film because it was completely illogical with lots of plot holes. The second film doesn't make a whole lot of sense either because its both a prequel and sequel. It covers what happens before the first film and then continues after Lee Abbott's death from the first film. But what I did like was that the action is faster paced, more intense and the editing is superb. The acting performances are also very good.But you still have the same characters and some new ones making stupid decisions. For instance, why are they playing the song ""Beyond The Sea"" over the radio. Are the aliens now intelligent that they need to use code? Are all the militaries of the world wiped out? Aren't there something called Sonic and ultrasonic weapons that military have on hand. No, not fictional weapons, but real life ultrasonic weapons. You can wiki it. ""LRAD"" They were used against protestors in 2012.Anyway, John Krasinski shows that his directing style has grown since the last film. I can't blame him totally if the screenplay has large plot holes and illogical decisions. It is still a decent entertainment film. But I don't think it will stand up against time. I would however like to see him make other movies with better screenplays.",A Quiet Place Part II
92,markthomassintek,disappointing,5,6 June 2021,"REVIEW - A QUIET PLACE 2The highly anticipated film is finally here, put back nearly a year due to Covid but the question is, is it any good.As with many films these days it has it good and bad points where as the original film broke new ground which was copied to an extent With Bird Box and other similar films, A Quiet Place 2 doesn't really explore anything new and in fact I found the story to be lacking. There is an explanation for this, originally the film wasn't going to have a sequel and the producer refused but of course money talks.Monsters in this are excellent because you can see them in full day light and again unlike other films that show you the monsters in subdued lighting, so a major plus for this but again I draw back onto the poor and simply uninteresting story, such a shame, if they knew about the delay in releasing the film they could have used this to make the story better, include more, extend the film with more suspense, but.....Honest rating, disappointing so....Rating 5 out of 10.",A Quiet Place Part II

94,bob-the-movie-man,"Krasinski is missed, but this still delivers as a thrilling sequel",9,29 May 2021,"Positives:
Sequels often try to over-reach, lobbing-in over-the-top action and forgetting why the audience so loved the original hit. This sequel doesn't fall into that trap, continuing the story in a seamless way. We very quickly get reinvested in the character's dire situation (as their situation suddenly gets even more dire!).The pre-title sequence is perfectly paced and utterly thrilling. It's the sequence that most grabbed my attention so many months (years?!) ago when - pre-Covid - I first saw the trailer attached below. That bus!!The ensemble cast works well together. Cillian Murphy is a fine actor, filling the Krasinski-shaped hole. And Emily Blunt is as kick-ass and wonderful as always. But special 'attaboys' need to go to the two youngsters, Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe. They were impressive in the first movie but here have to carry even more of the dramatic action and are just brilliant.Technically, the film has Oscar-worthy strengths.-- The editing here is first rate: many of the jump scares are well-signposted, but they still work thanks to the timing of the cuts.-- The sound design is (as you would expect) fantastic: once again this is a movie where snacks should be banned!-- The soundtrack, by Marco Beltrami, is great, building on his themes from the original but knowing when to shut-up as well!Negatives:
It's a genuine joy to see John Krasinski in the dramatic pre-title sequence reprising his role of Lee Abbott. But it maybe accentuates that his massive presence is missed for the rest of the movie. Perhaps killing him off at the end of part 1 wasn't such a good idea?There's a lot of 'grief and mourning' to contend with here, post- (or nearly post-) Covid. This didn't affect me. But the illustrious Mrs Movie Man was 'not mentally ready' for it, and actively disliked the film as a result.Summary Thoughts on ""A Quiet Place Part II"": Often a sequel doesn't live up to my expectations. Particularly so when I've loved the original AND had to wait SOOOOOOoooooooo long to see it. But this time I was not disappointed. I gave the original 5 stars. This naturally lacks the originality of the premise and is - imho - less good. But not by a great margin. It's still a rollercoaster thrill-ride that - at 97 minutes - doesn't overstay its welcome. Sometimes 'more of the same' is enough.This is also a great movie to get people back into cinemas. Because, ladies and gents, since this is a MUST SEE on the big screen, and ideally in a screen with a great sound system.As long as Krasinski stays at the helm, I'll personally be looking forwards to AQP - Part III, which I understand is in the works.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on t'interweb or Facebook. Thanks.)",A Quiet Place Part II
95,HabibieHakim123,Better And More Alive,9,31 May 2021,"""Even if there is no Cillian Murphy, A Quiet Place Part II is still a better film than the first one, the movie is more alive with more of a conversation, a little bit of drama, great perfomance by Cillian Murphy, a better perfomance by Emily Blunt and the kids, incredible cinematography and yet more intense, A Quiet Place Part II is absolutely a great sequel, i highly recommended""",A Quiet Place Part II
96,AngelHonesty,And it Continues,9,11 August 2021,I liked the original so I was more then eager to watch part 2. I loved that the film picked up right where it left off. Instead of feeling like a completely different movie it just feels like an extension of the first. So if you loved the first then you will love this one too. It has the same vibes and cast. The thing that made this movie a little better is that you get to dive more into the world around you. Instead of being limited to the farm like the first film this one takes a journey through the land. The movie also explains more of where the monsters come from giving more of a complete story. I'm really happy they made a part two and I'm eager for part three.,A Quiet Place Part II
97,Sir_AmirSyarif,"More of the same suspense, but on a bigger, noisier scale",7,4 August 2021,"John Krasinski's 'A Quiet Place Part II' is more of the same suspense, but on a bigger, noisier scale. The ending is a little abrupt and feels like a mid-story finishing point because it caters to fit the opportunity to have a part three but compromising some of part two's potential as a result. Millicent Simmonds shines, but the whole cast is great.",A Quiet Place Part II
98,pietclausen,"An improvement, but still . . .",7,29 June 2021,"Part 2 is an improvement on the first movie, which was too slow in parts with little real excitement or scary parts. This later version starts with the day the aliens landed (day 1) and then jumps to day 474, where the continuation of the first movie starts. You don't have to wait long before you jump out of your seat and for the first time we see the fearsome creatures in detail.Unfortunately it slows down thereafter, but the story is good and livens up along the way. It ends abruptly, but wait for part 3 in 2023. Overall a nice, most watchable movie to enjoy!",A Quiet Place Part II
99,tonypeacock-1,"Overrated, minimalistic future 'horror '",6,30 August 2021,"I looked back on my thoughts of the original Quiet Place film before penning these thoughts and you know what? This film has sequel syndrome all over it. Basically a very similar screenplay with almost the same cast and crew.Just a small reminder to readers unfamiliar with the franchise. The slightest sound attracts big alien creatures that can cause death.Sound is a big part of this franchise. The
sound had issues when trying to listen to the small amounts of dialogue in the film, crammed in between several crash, bang, wallop what an alien sequences.The scenes of silence are intertwined with annoying and extremely predictable jump scare scenes.Cillian Murphy stars in the film. A return to 28 Days Later (2002) territory. I really wanted to give the film a fair crack of the whip but my observations (for what they are worth) is an overrated by many, minimalistic horror.",A Quiet Place Part II
100,RonellSowes,What Does It Have,2,24 August 2021,Like its predecessor the movie was written and directed by John Krasinski who albeit an actor definetly approaches these roles with serious focus. Though you might be able to see the motivation behind his shots and choices he doesn't have the comfortability behind the camera to be a good director. And any skill he has is lost in this befuddled mess that simply doesn't thrill. Its paper thin on plot and characters and intercutting multiple scenarios running parallel to each other doesn't generate the excitement that all the silent creeping and hushed tone fails too.I suppose if you really enjoyed the first you might like this as well because it's just more of the same. But does A Quiet Place Part II have anything more than a one line gimmick of a premise that got some people excited?,A Quiet Place Part II
101,kjproulx,Just as Good as its Predecessor,10,16 June 2021,"More than anything, I was actually quite nervous (even though deliriously excited) to see a sequel to A Quiet Place. It was one of my absolute favourite films of 2018 and even though the ending was sort of left open, I just thought every aspect of the filmmaking made for a stellar film. Not that a sequel needs to be better, but when you have a movie that good, it's very hard to even make something that comes remotely close. Well, I personally think that director John Krasinski came incredibly close to topping himself here. Even though I would probably still choose the first one over this sequel as to which I prefer, this felt like a seamless continuation and felt like an extension that was just as good as its predecessor. Here's why I believe A Quiet Place Part II will remain one of my favourite films of 2021 until the end of the year.Beginning with one of the best opening scenes I've witnessed in a while and then jumping back into the main story, picking up moments after the conclusion of the previous instalment, I was hooked from the very beginning. Everything about this sequel feels like a natural progression. From the way the camera moves to how the sound cuts in and out when the film is focused on the daughter Regan (still played wonderfully by Millicent Simmonds), the atmosphere is still pulse-pounding. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Never once did I feel the film dragging. Although very limited on dialogue, I still found the film to be saying a lot.Without diving into too much detail here, this film follows the Abbott family after they have left their home. So of course, it's only natural that Krasinski would craft a screenplay that would widen his vision. Running into Emmett (Cillian Murphy), the remaining family members find a new spot to seek shelter. Having no belief that anything or anyone is worth saving out in the world, there's a lot of denials to be had. I loved Cillian Murphy as this character and without ruining anything, his chemistry with Millicent Simmonds had me in tears on multiple occasions, making it the true heartbeat of the film.Overall, I can't do anything but gush about every aspect of this film. From the magnificent sound design by the sound department to the stellar camerawork by Polly Morgan, to the score by Marco Beltrami that felt like he just continued his work from the first film, down to the fantastic writing and directing by John Krasinski, my eyes were superglued to the screen. This is filmmaking at its finest and I can't wait to watch it again. The tension was never-ending and I feel that even if you mildly enjoyed the first film, you'll at least feel that way about this one. A Quiet Place Part II is the very definition of how to make a successful sequel.",A Quiet Place Part II
102,kuarinofu,Good sequel if you're into the series,5,28 June 2021,"The second part of A Quiet Place follows up with more of the same while pulling a couple of new tricks and adding new character dynamics. Pretty much what sequels are supposed to do.If you enjoyed the first one you will surely like this one too. I didn't quite get all the hype around the concept, so the first one for me was just a basic stupid people thriller with a simple gimmick.This one is mostly the same, people make unwise decisions and get themselves in trouble, but the writing is somewhat better, characters are more thought-out and their actions are understandable and motivated.It looks good, some of the scenes are well-shot, providing the necessary perspective. It was also nice to see Cillian Murphy, he was good, as always.It was predictable but still fine, I guess. The one-trick approach they are using felt tired even in the first one, and it worked much better until we were given an explanation of how these films work.You get what you expect, and in a story like this, there isn't much they can do. Although I would've loved the Tremors approach where each new film is a new mutation that freshens up the basics.Recommended if you enjoyed the first one.If not, don't bother.In any case, we will surely get a third one (about the kids all grown up), since this one did relatively well, and these types of films don't require a big budget.",A Quiet Place Part II

For some reason, the event at the end of the first movie got ignored. Then, a quote from the trailer misled my expectation.To the good. The tension was handled very well for this movie, similar to the first, maybe a little bit better. There were more monsters, and they looked as scary as ever. Whenever the characters took a step, I held my breath.Emily Blunt was still great as the mother who tried to protect her kids. The two kids had more screen time and they were also good. Cillian Murphy was good, but his character wasn't developed that well.Another aspect was the emotional element. There wasn't much here, unlike the first one.Overall, I still had a great time with the theater as the horror and tension were superb. Definitely check out. 8/10.",A Quiet Place Part II

I enjoyed the acting, the cinematography and the general atmosphere. The plot was a bit barebones and I didn't find it too engrossing past the initial idea of blind monsters that can only hunt by sound and there were too many plot holes for my liking (why were there loads of people hanging out at the docks waiting for someone to pass so they could kill them?

Unprepared? She had no knowledge of what's happening outside. What was with those people and the little girl trapping them at the docks? Also how did the boat float to that island?? How did they reunite after? What happened to the black dudes family after he died at the end? This film was ended so abruptly. Still really entertaining though. No boring scenes, all actors are good!

108,msbreviews,"A Quiet Place Part II feels less than its predecessor in almost every element, but it's still one of the best sequels of the genre.",7,2 June 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)If you're reading this, then you probably visited my review of 2018's A Quiet Place. Hence, you know how much I absolutely love that movie. A low-budget, high-concept horror flick that surprised everyone, including myself, ultimately becoming one of the very best films of the respective year, as well as one of the best original horror stories in the last couple of decades. Now, I acknowledge that John Krasinski created something that could very well turn out to be the ""next big thing"" when it comes to horror franchises. However, that doesn't mean I support that endeavor. Artistically, I would much rather prefer for this to be a one-off, but I know better than anyone that if an original movie is tremendously successful at the box office - especially one that requires a short amount of money to make - sequel talks will obviously emerge.My only major issue with the first film was, in fact, its ending. It's an admittedly badass conclusion, but it also felt like a cry to Hollywood in order to extend the story. I didn't expect this type of ending for such a character-driven personal project, but in all honesty, I rather have a sequel to A Quiet Place than the 10th SAW film or the continuation of the never-ending Fast & Furious saga. With that said, my expectations were still pretty high due to Krasinski's even more impactful involvement in the movie. With sole screenwriting credit and only possessing a few minutes of screentime this time around, Krasinski gets more time to focus on his primary technical role, delivering, once again, a masterfully directed film.I find A Quiet Place Part II inferior to its predecessor in many ways, but the extreme levels of suspense generated by Krasinski's flawless direction are still the highlight of this saga. The beautifully shot opening sequence (cinematography by Polly Morgan) sets up the incredibly high level of tension for the subsequent monster scenes, all requiring the viewers to hold their breath for several minutes. These nerve-wracking moments are elevated by terrific acting performances across the board - I'll get there - but Krasinski demonstrates exquisite knowledge of the art of filmmaking, using his best attributes in favor of the movie. Boasting a nail-biting atmosphere and effective jumpscares, the characters find a few imaginative evasion maneuvers to avoid the monsters.However, this leads me to one of my main issues with this sequel. The first film establishes the creatures in its ruthless, merciless first few minutes, where it becomes clear that if someone makes the tiniest noise and if a monster is nearby, they're dead. There's a minimal chance of survival, and the emotionally resonant ending also attests to this fundamental, lethal aspect of the whole ""sound-hunting beasts"" concept. Nevertheless, during the entire runtime of the sequel, including the phenomenal opening, it's like we're witnessing different monsters. If the first movie already had a couple of logic-related issues, this sequel increases the number of personal nitpicks.People can run away quite a bit before the creatures get close - so much that I firmly believed the film would go back to the opening sequence to explain how the main characters managed to escape a specific attack. Protagonists survive absurdly improbable situations due to heavy plot armor. Even a couple of character/plot decisions are questionable, to say the least, particularly the trigger that sets up the third act. After the first movie, where everything feels surprisingly grounded and far from nonsensical, jumping to the continuation of the same story and having to disconnect our brain continuously is a bit disappointing, especially since the screenplay remains incredibly focused on the characters.Almost every element in this film feels less emotionally impactful than the original, but it's far from being a massive letdown. In fact, having in mind the competition in the genre, A Quiet Place Part II might even be one of the best horror sequels ever for all I know. Firstly, the actors are absolutely magnificent. Emily Blunt (Evelyn) and Cillian Murphy - who I didn't expect to have that much importance and screentime as he has - bring their experience to a movie where the young actors are the ones who truly shine. Noah Jupe (Marcus) and Millicent Simmonds (Regan) steal the spotlight from the more renowned colleagues, delivering impressive performances that will surely guarantee them several award nominations by the end of the year.The focus on deeply exploring the characters strengthens the emotional connection with the viewers, making every scene carry a certain gravitas. Ethical dilemmas are beautifully tackled through Murphy's character, Emmett, who creates an unexpected bond with Regan. The latter stands out as a brave, smart, altruist deaf girl who should inspire many people worldwide - it's worth remembering that Simmonds, a real-life deaf girl, brings outstanding authenticity to her role. Just like the original film, most dialogues contain sign language, so the narrative is also developed through visual storytelling. Once again, Krasinski knows perfectly when and how to tell the audience something exclusively through the camera, many times just pure silence, keeping the viewers' attention on the screen at all times.Throughout the sequel, there are various visual nods and callbacks to the first flick that I also appreciated quite a lot, such as a certain object on a shelf or a repeated sentence. The ending carries less emotional weight than the original's brutal final minutes, but the entire last act will go down as one of the most impeccably edited conclusions of the year. Michael P. Shawver needs to cross-cut between excruciatingly tense sequences on completely different locations with important characters facing the same level of danger. The action is displayed seamlessly, letting the viewers genuinely enjoy the last moments of the movie without annoyingly choppy editing. Marco Beltrami's score is really gripping during the entirety of these last few scenes.A Quiet Place Part II feels less than its predecessor in almost every element, but it's still one of the best sequels of the genre. From the riveting, frenetic opening sequence - much of it shot in long, uncut takes - to one of the most impressively edited endings I've seen in years, John Krasinski maintains an incredibly tense, suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire runtime, something that's becoming a trademark of his directing career. Story-wise, the characters continue to be the main focus of the narrative. Boasting emotional dilemmas and bold character development, the kids have a surprising impact on the overall screenplay. Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt are remarkable, but Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds are astonishing, especially the latter. However, the monsters are depicted in a much less threatening, lethal manner, leading to many questionable plot decisions, as well as absurd survival situations. In addition to this, the world-building lacks significant revelations and creative ideas. Overall, it's a less emotionally resonant film than the original, which doesn't exactly let me down, but I did expect more from this sequel. Still, I highly recommend watching it at the theater. After all, both audience and critics are enjoying this movie tremendously...Rating: B.",A Quiet Place Part II

115,MrDHWong,A solid follow-up to the original that does exactly what a sequel should,8,27 May 2021,"""A Quiet Place Part II"" is the sequel to the 2018 horror thriller film ""A Quiet Place"". Written and directed by John Krasinski and starring Emily Blunt, Cillian Murphy, and Millicent Simmonds, it is a solid follow-up to the original that does exactly what a sequel should.In the aftermath of the first film, the Abbott family, consisting of Evelyn (Emily Blunt), her deaf daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds), and son Marcus (Noah Jupe) have managed to kill the monsters that have been terrorising them by exploiting their hypersensitivity to high-pitched sounds. With their house now completely destroyed, the three of them, along with Evelyn's newborn baby, are forced to vacate the area and search for another place to call home. While journeying beyond familiar territory, the group stumble across an abandoned factory inhabited by their old family friend Emmett (Cillian Murphy), who allows them to stay with him temporarily. A short time later, Marcus and Regan discover a radio signal playing music from a nearby island and thinking there could potentially be other human settlements transmitting it, the latter ventures out to investigate and hopefully find a way to rid the world of the monsters once and for all.Very few films have grabbed my attention in the first ten minutes the way that ""A Quiet Place"" did back in 2018. The way it instantly immerses the audience in this world where even the slightest loud noise could mean the difference between life or death had me nervous to even clear my throat while watching it at the cinema. Instead of being a sleazy cash-grab sequel, ""Part II"" actually continues the story with a more in-depth look into how it is possible this one family has survived as long as they had all this time. Although I was content with the original's ending, I still believed there were some unresolved plot holes that could do with some elaboration and this sequel thankfully does just that for the most part. In fact, this follow-up begins with a flashback sequence that gives a satisfying explanation of where the monsters came from and whether or not their presence is strictly limited to the United States. However, like the original, it is still not explained how electricity somehow works perfectly in this post-apocalyptic world. I initially assumed people were using generators but they would emit too much noise, which defeats the purpose of needing to stay quiet to avoid being killed by the monsters. Aside from that, this sequel answers most of the questions I had about the original through its effective use of world building and subtle newspaper stories littered throughout various locations.Returning to the director's chair, John Krasinski this time spends the entire duration of the film behind the camera rather than in front, save for the previously mentioned flashback. As seen in the original, Krasinski has demonstrated his skill in transporting his audience into a world where bloodthirsty monsters have the power to appear within seconds to tear us to shreds just by simply speaking at regular volume. This is due to the film's innovative use of sound mixing during important scenes such as the family travelling from place to place. We hear every grain of dirt stepped on and every blade of grass brushed past to emphasise how much noise we give off whether we're aware of it or not. Even something as simple as clanging glass bottles can become anxiety inducing when you're trying to stay silent to survive. This is a film that absolutely needs to be experienced at the cinema in surround sound as watching it from home on a TV or phone won't do it justice.Even though both her on and off screen husband wasn't featured prominently in this film, Emily Blunt was still able to hold her own as Evelyn leading her family through the dangerous terrain populated with these monstrous creatures. With her baby in one hand and a shotgun in the other, Evelyn takes charge with a vengeance protecting each of her children whatever the cost may be. This is the same character who was able to remain silent when her water broke and later stepped on a sharp nail so it's certainly not hard to believe she is capable of such a feat. Cillian Murphy also brought a decent change of pace to the story as Emmett, who has innovative ways of staying quiet in the factory area he now calls his home. Murphy previously played a lone survivor of an apocalyptic event in 2002's ""28 Days Later"" so he's definitely no stranger to this type of genre. But the real standout has to be Millicent Simmonds as the deaf Regan. Simmonds, who is deaf in real life, conveys so much realistic emotion through sign language gestures while rarely uttering a verbal word. This is exactly the type of inclusivity movies should be featuring and not something shoehorned in merely to promote a current political agenda.In conclusion, if you enjoyed the original film as much as I did, then this sequel is well worth your time. It successfully expands on the story its predecessor laid the groundwork for while also adding new elements that seem to dictate a totally different direction it may be going in. Judging by the ending, it seems likely there will be a third installment sometime in the future, so hopefully that one will do what this one did in continuing the story with its winning formula in tow. As long as the series doesn't become too bogged down with multiple sequels like other franchises, then I'd say this is a good thing.I rate it 8/10.",A Quiet Place Part II
116,meydiana-65242,Very heart gripping film,10,4 July 2021,"A Quiet Place Part Two was one of my most anticipated movies of this year, and for good reason. A Quiet Place was one of my favourite films of 2018. That movie is basically proof that John Krasinski can direct well. This movie just emphasizes that.Performances- Emily Blunt is fascinating in this film. She is one of the best aspects of this entire movie. Millicent Simmons who plays Emily Blunt's daughter has also given off a really good performance. Cillian Murphy was also really good.TENSION- Like the first film, this one too knows how to keep the viewers on the edge of their seats. The tension is present in this movie, from start to end. John Krasinski knows what to do with the tension in his films, and he knows what conflicts portrayed in his movies are most effective, and he utilizes them to the maximum. That's what makes him such a good director.A WORTHY SEQUEL- This is a damn good sequel. One appreciable thing worth mentioning is that- it feels as though they pay more attention to the human characters in this movie. A bit more than the first one. Another reason why this is such a good sequel is- it doesn't just try to be bigger than the first one. As a matter of fact, it 'is' bigger than the first movie, but it doesn't put too much emphasiz on being bigger. It feels just about as real and simple as the first one. This movie also takes the first ten minutes or so- to tell us where these creatures come from. A lot of sequels don't necessarily give us that-origin story, but this one does. That's great.We want more, John Krasinski- Yes! He has proven his talent as a director with two very intense, amazing horror films. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of his work. Not just in the 'Quiet Place' franchise, but in other stuff as well. The man clearly knows what he's doing- and he's good in it. So, yes. We want more, John Krasinski!So, A Quiet Place Part Two is an amazing movie. It's fresh, intense and is a worthy sequel almost as good as the first one. Although the ending seemed a bit rushed up for me, I don't really have that many flaws with this movie. I highly recommend this film to you.",A Quiet Place Part II
117,cardsrock,Krasinski is really honing his craft,8,25 July 2021,"The main reason to watch these movies is to admire the technical skill at work. John Krasinski's direction here is even more impressive than the first film. He perfectly knows how to build tension and the part of the film with the 3 concurrent scenes all building to a climax is expertly filmed.The story is definitely weaker than the first film and some of the logic from the characters is a bit shaky. This can also feel a bit like a film leading into another film, but honestly the terrific filmmaking outweighs all the complaints.",A Quiet Place Part II

120,saru2020,Pretty good sequel,7,1 August 2021,"A good sequel for sure, it started off as a prequel but only to give us a clue of what happened before so that they could bring back or introduce some of the other characters relevant to the main ones to get hold of the grip so that it doesn't feel like a complete spinoff, that was like a brilliant move by the writers. Although the journey was good, it wasn't that much gripping enough for the audience to hold onto the content as we did in the first part since it introduced the concept anew but this time it wasn't and hence I strongly feel that there should've been some more engaging twists in the plot interesting enough to give a hold. Nevertheless, it is good for a one-time watch.",A Quiet Place Part II
121,ronakkotian,Not much of an improvement from the first one,5,29 June 2021,"WARNING: *SPOILERS*The first installment was disappointing to me so I had high hopes that this film will improve upon the issues of the first. Unfortunately, this one still has the problems I had with the first film.A Quiet Place Part II takes place directly where the first one ended where the Abbott family ventures further into the outside world whilst trying to survive from the creatures.John Krasinski returns to direct this continuation however this time he has also written the film by himself. For me, the best part of the film is its opening sequence where we see the events of Day 1. It's executed beautifully with some great long takes where a lot of action is taking place. Krasinski does a great job directing this scene and creating tension. The mania and suspense of the opening got me hooked and excited for the rest of the film. Once again, Krasinski does well directing and the film looks great visually. I liked how the kids this time had more to do and both Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe give good performances. Emily Blunt is great as always and Cillian Murphy was a great addition to the film.The film's opening is the highlight for me because the rest of the film is pretty underwhelming. There were many questions left unanswered in the first one so I hoped A Quiet Place Part II would provide more answers but the story didn't progress much further and ended on an abrupt note. Whilst I liked the attention being on the kids more this time, there were still decisions made by them which seemed stupid to me. We see the son being told to take care of the baby as the mother goes to get supplies but he decides to explore the warehouse and finds a dead person. This causes him to make a lot of noise leading the creature towards him and the baby. It's an idiotic decision that didn't make sense to me. The deaf girl decides to go after the radio signal by herself which is incredibly risky as she cannot hear anything. The cryptic song that plays on the radio is unnecessary as well. Wouldn't it be easier to record a message of exactly what you're trying to say rather than play a song?A Quiet Place Part II has its merits but it's not a vast improvement of the first film either. The visuals and acting are great but the story still suffers from bad character decisions and needs to be refined more.",A Quiet Place Part II
122,Stanlee107,Part 2,6,18 July 2021,"I was worried about this sequel as the first one is an instant classic. However, my concerns were unfounded as it is a decent sequel.It starts out as the protagonists leave in search of another safe haven. One of the children is injured & find refuse with a strange man that seemingly given up all hope of a place that is safe from the alien creatures.I thought it was fascinating that the cast gets separated in their search for various endeavours.There are good thrilling scenes and a decent ending in which there are believable character developments.",A Quiet Place Part II
123,statuskuo,It's About Mood and Classic Filmmaking,7,10 June 2021,"Yes, it is more of the same. But the same happens to have a very darker tone. Which is when humans turn on each. Sure, we've seen this in an extended universe such as ""The Walking Dead"" If you're burned out from that, then this movie may not be for you.The movie begins precisely where it left off. For those who haven't seen the first one, this one nods to it without losing your place if you never want to see the first one. It doesn't matter, because this could exist in the same world of loss and tragedy.It is decidedly melancholic, in that the loss of the first Dad means a void to be filled with a new one.The surrogate, in this case, is played wonderfully by Cillian Murphy. Whose own loss drives him to near madness until he regains a bit of humanity in the faces of a purpose. Which most in our society needs regardless of an alien invasion.While the film does have moments of eye rolls and frustration with the slowness of which the story unfolds, director John Krasinski has found innovative ways to make it engaging. The mood is strong with this one.One gripe, I've had, is the mumbling dialogue. Most of it was lost to me, which is painful, as perhaps I'm losing my own hearing (waitaminute, could this be to illustrate what Millicient Simmonds is going through?).Speaking of which...Ms. Simmonds is incredible. Soulful eyes, plays what could be corny moments into pitch-perfect grasps at determination. She, herself, is the surrogate to her own father. Their insurmountable pain and trauma of loss means they can rebuild the best they can. And that people aren't bad.Well, some are. And they are feral beasts who invade the goodwill of people.I will need to watch this movie a second time to get the nuances. I'm sure there are plenty.",A Quiet Place Part II
124,trinaboice,"Krasinski knows how to act, make us laugh, and direct",10,27 May 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Wow. This is the very first movie I've seen in an actual theater for over a year! A Quiet Place II was one of the first movies to delay its theater release when the pandemic first started. This morning, I was invited to a press screening in a local theater with just 9 other film critics. The movie picks up right where A Quiet Place left off. Following the horrific events at home, the Abbott family now faces the terrors of the outside world. Forced to venture into the unknown, they realize the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats lurking beyond the sand path...This dramatic thriller was written and directed by John Krasinski. He wrote the first film with Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, but this one is very much all Krasinski. I loved his ""Some Good News"" YouTube videos John Krasinski shared when the pandemic first started. He really does seem like such a nice guy and it's a delightful reveal that he absolutely knows how to write and direct awesome movies. This is a rare sequel that is as good as A Quiet Place. Another film critic I watched the movie with this morning described his review in these few words, ""A great sequel to a movie that didn't need a sequel."" Everyone is saying this film was definitely worth the wait. This is just the movie that might get people going back to the theaters again.THINGS I LIKED:
Who doesn't love John Krasinski and Emily Blunt together? They both look fantastic in this movie. Despite John Krasinski's character's demise in the first movie, we get to see him again in a few scenes that feature Day 1 of the alien invasion. He and Emily admitted they had not considered doing a sequel. John explains that he was ""Jedi-mind tricked into doing it.""
The talented cast also includes Djimon Hounsou and Cillian Murphy.Millicent Simmonds, who plays Regan Abbott, is actually deaf in real life. This is her third film, after the original movie and Wonderstruck. She is a very good young actress. Noah Jupe plays her brother and together, they provide the hope the adults so desperately need in the story.There is so much suspense and tension, with plenty of action that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The movie has all of the jumps and scares you hope it would.The opening sequence was riveting. One of the things I said in my review of the original movie was that I wished we could have seen what happened on Day 1. Well, here you go!The aliens are intriguing but the characters are truly the center and heart of the movie. You get to see the aliens up close and personal and often. We also learn why they are so sensitive to sound.Speaking of sound, the sound effects are impressive.There are several camera shots that reminded me of the incredible destruction seen in Tom Cruise's WAR OF THE WORLDS.John Krasinski really pays attention to details. For example, we see his character grabbing a few items in the local store. As he walks by some shelves, we see that toy rocket ship that was featured in the first movie.I loved seeing the small-town community in the first scene. A lot of people have a romantic notion of living in such a town where everyone knows and trusts each other. I thought the pandemic had made us realize what's important in life, but lately, almost everyone I interact with ""out there"" seems super rude and impatient.You WILL get goosebumps while watching this!One of the things I really love about this movie and its original is that a great horror movie doesn't have to be bloody and gory and disgusting.It definitely helps if you have seen the first movie, but you can still enjoy the sequel on its own. If you haven't seen the part 1 of A Quiet Place , what are you waiting for?THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:

128,sbweightman,"Still good, but lightning doesn't strike twice.",6,29 May 2021,"Very similar to the first part, but it lacks tension and suspense - I never really engaged with the characters and never felt the fear or threat they obviously did thanks to their great acting performances. There's some effective jump scares and the creatures look impressively menacing, but it just feels as though it's lacking overall. The simple plot gives no answers and offers no surprises and although it changes things up a bit, it loses some of what made it special along the way.",A Quiet Place Part II
129,destroyerwod,Its part 1 but without the surprise and some questionable moments,6,26 September 2021,"I watched part 1 last year so for my 7th movie of Halloween Season i decided to go with the second one. I like to mix things up and continue series i started. It is not really Halloween thematic but it has monsters so it qualify.This movie is well made in term of acting, filming, even has some good tension moments, and a great sound design too. But the issue is we already know the monsters from part 1 so the surprise/reveal ain't there this time. Part of stuff that is frightening in horror movies like these is the unknown and the shock of the reveal.And it feels like it kinda try to replicate part 1 by going trough a very similar arc only replacing the dad character by another man they used to know before the ""invasion"". It does not really add much to the story. His background is mentioned a bit, he lost his family, but thats about it.I don't recall if the monsters were implied as Aliens from the first movie, i don't think we knew their origin, yet in this one it show some spaceship i guess crashing, the issue is they really look like ferral monsters and i don't think it match well to this technology.There is more tension built up than action scenes, and i think it work well enough for a first watch, but when the action kicked in i noticed the monsters more or less liked to slam the humans around instead of ..well...eating them, or slashing them with their big claws. I don't know if this done for rating or something, but i couldn't really understand their motivations. They kill for what? We never get to see them eating their pray or using them for something else.I wish we would had learn more on the monsters/aliens but i supose they wanted us to keep guessing. The problem is really that the story does not seem to move forward much.They already knew how to kill them, so their end goal seem to be trying to use that method to broadcast into radios? But it just really stagger them and they still need to put bullets into their head... We learn that they can't swin so some survivors found shelters on an island, but then weirdly one of the monsters decided to hide on the boat they use to reach that island? So far they were portrayed as mindless killing machines, so it felt off for me.There is one scene with a bunch of survivors that seem to be ""bad peoples"", they have a bunch of boats and yet they never tried to reach the island? They just try to trap peoples and i guess use them as bait? But why? And why kidnapping the girl? Are they abusers? They used a little girl for the bait wich seem to be fully with them. I dunno really, some parts of the movie seem to be added for no purpose but just an action scene.Its like the producers saw that the first one worked well, so they said ""make something similar"" and thats it, here comes part 2.I know it seem overly negative as a review but actually i enjoyed the movie enough... Its rather short at 1h40 minutes end credits included so it does not overstay its welcome. Its servicable... Its one of those movies i am ""happy"" i saw and was not bored or anything, but i wouldn't watch it again. I would probably watch part 3 by curiosity but i wouldn't be in a hurry lets say.",A Quiet Place Part II

132,Xavier_Stone,Why was this made? Money. Pure and Simple. Part 3 in the works.,2,29 May 2021,"With the first movie had so many logic errors and mistakes it was frustrating to watch, but it made money so clearly people like this type of movie. So they ordered another one and John and Emily quickly got back to work writing, directing and starring in this sequel. You would think that they would have read at least some critical reviews and made this one a bit better, maybe had the script proofread. Nope.Tons of the same logic errors when dealing with monsters, questionable character decisions that just get annoying after a while.But did this movie really need to be made? Basically the end of the first one they find out that a hearing aid harms the alien invaders, and this whole movie is spent trying to use that hearing aid, so extremely predictable.It's a pandemic and actors need to make money. So they made this, then instead of the usual salary for industry writers and directors these two decide to forgo those salaries and hedge on a percentage of the box office profits. As they know this will be a popular film in the midst of such terrible competition. Good gamble. Except when the studio makes a change to enable showing via streaming after a theater debut.So the box office numbers are going to drop and John and Emily are suing Paramount for missed profits. I guess I can understand it, but when actors are no longer satisfied with $6Mil/movie and need the $30Mil+ payday then it's just greed.Of course a cliff hanger ending, and already some talks about a part 3 sequel after a huge 1st weekend at the box office.",A Quiet Place Part II

The effects looked great, but the scare factor is none existent because you can almost tell exactly how each scene will play out. At an hour into the film nothing had happened and the following ending was underwhelming. I'm sure I'll never do a re-watch.",A Quiet Place Part II
134,sweidman-28016,Just As Great As the First,8,5 June 2021,"""I don't know why you came all the way up here. There's nothing left.""A Quiet Place Part II picks up right after the first. The Abbott family now face the terrors of the outside world. Forced to venture into the unknown, they realize the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats lurking beyond the sand path. The first was a hit and already a modern day classic. The sequel is no exception. Jumping right into this, I really enjoyed part II. What's really great is the opening. It's some of the best horror directing in recent years. Much like a Spielberg film, it focuses more on the family and what's happening with them rather than the terror that is the monsters. There's plenty of callbacks to the first which is a nice touch. And what's great is there's so much suspense built up even though we know what's going to happen. As the story moves back to the present day story, it's still as good as the first. Venturing out to new locations helps explore the apocalyptic world apart from the farm. And even with the new locations, we still feel secluded. One of the new additions is that of Cillian Murphy. He adds a great deal to the story and just an overall well written character. It's hard to read him which adds to the suspense. All of the characters are very good in this and there's is clear development. In the first, Emily Blunt felt like the star. Now it's Millicent Simmonds. She's excellent and is almost the heart of the story. Her goal is to carry on the legacy of her father, and the same with Noah Jupe. I like how the overall messages about family are strong with these two over the horror elements.The suspense is almost more than the first. No ideas were recycled. I mentioned the opening, but just minutes into present day there's so much built up that I did question whether they would make it out or not even though I fully expected them to do so. Technically, this is almost better than the first. The cinematography is amped up from the first significantly. Honestly it might be the best looking film of the year so far. The score is almost better than the first as well. The ending is really beautiful there. And, of course, the sound design is spectacular. I don't know how it can get any better. It sort of sucks that we're trained to expect things and such since we've seen the first. It's not like seeing A Quiet Place for the first time and feeling so overwhelmed by the silence. Still, it makes use and does what it does best. There's one part I'm conflicted about. The editing is pretty good, especially in the first and second act. It ties characters together in similar ways pertaining to the story. In the third act, though, there's almost too much of it. I liked what was done at first, but it's almost overbearing by the end and takes away from what it is. Some might like it, but it just didn't do it for me. I should probably leave it here to avoid any and all spoilers. A Quiet Place Part II is one of those rare sequels that is just as good as the first. I can't say whether I like the first or second better because both feel just as great. Plus, with how they connect together, I'd almost consider it one big film together.",A Quiet Place Part II
135,Draysan-Jennings,A Boring Place,5,23 June 2021,I was really looking forward to watching this movie. Unfortunately it almost put me to sleep. Nothing close to being up to par with the first film. Not sure why it almost has an 8 star rating. 5 stars.,A Quiet Place Part II
136,ethanbresnett,Doesn't build enough on the first film for my liking,7,10 June 2021,"I really liked A Quiet Place Part I. I thought the concept was great, the tension and atmosphere when watching it was almost unbearable (in a good way), and the cast were terrific. A Quiet Place Part II is pretty much more of the same though. As a result it's not a bad film, but I was hoping for the sequel to change things up a bit.There are so many positives of this film and I did enjoy it. Firstly the use of sound to induce tension and drama was second to none. It really was incredible and created a deafening silence that was torture at times. The direction from Krasinski was superb, with the opening sequence a very special highlight. The addition of Cillian Murphy was inspired, a fantastic actor who really brought something fresh to the film. There were also lots of great emotional beats throughout the film which I found very moving at times. On the whole the plot was pretty strong too.So where's the catch? I can't help but think if you've seen the first film you've seen the second. Given the fact that at the end of the first film they discover the weakness of the creatures, I thought we might mix things up in this film, have the family a bit more on the offensive, but it all felt very familiar. We see them silently walking through barren landscapes until inevitably someone makes a noise and a chase follows. Lots of the same story beats are repeated from Part I.It's a shame because they give us glimpses of what the film could have been. We see other groups of humans and Cillian Murphy's character alludes to the wayward morality of survivors in the post apocalyptic world, and that maybe would have been a more fresh and interesting path to take.In a way I feel like this film should be A Quiet Place Part 1b. It just doesn't do enough to progress from the themes, plot points, and interactions of the first film.I had a good time watching this film, and seeing it in the theatre in the dark with the surround sound was a fantastic experience, but the plot and scenarios all felt far too familiar.",A Quiet Place Part II
137,PedroPires90,More of the same...and that's not bad.,8,5 June 2021,"More of the same, but that's not exactly a bad thing, as the movie is still very tense, not afraid of using the silence for long minutes and very good building up the suspense.Is it better than the first? No. Is it worse? Maybe a little bit, maybe the same quality. More monsters and a fantastic performance by Millicent Simmonds. The end clearly asks for a 3rd movie more than the 1st asked for a sequel.",A Quiet Place Part II
138,MovieCriticOnline,Definitely not as good as the first one,4,16 July 2021,"Definitely not as good as the first one. I liked the first one, but I didn't like the alien creatures. It felt too much like War of the Worlds, but what made that film really work was the family drama and emotional connections never seen in ""horror"" films.My fundamental problem with the insect-like creatures is they arrive on space ships apparently, which they could never have built. None of them have the anatomy to build much of anything.As a side note, that worked in the original alien, because the xenomorphs were just native creatures to the planet they lived on, like lions/crocodiles on Earth. They weren't these intelligent beings that were physically building space ships etc. That was left up to the engineers as shown in Prometheus.And this continued in part II. They also never provided any explanation of what the creatures were. Not totally necessary, but it would have been interesting. It became a footnote in the opening sequence. Another problem was how they didn't know ahead of time there were things entering the atmosphere. Instead they just stood in awe and looked at it. There would have been emergency sirens going on and/or the news would have warned people ahead of time. Humans may be stupid, but not that stupid and equipped to detect objects entering the atmosphere.Also, I didn't like the over-the-top screaming even when they got hurt when they knew that noise attracts the aliens and potentially risking their lives. That was one of the biggest issues. The constant part of the characters acting against their own self-preservation and putting themselves at risk when there was no need to. Bloom's character made the most sense in what she did, but everyone else, no.Like some others have pointed out, too many of their actions were motivated by the writer's need to create drama, which we need, but it has to come naturally, not forced. And certainly not by beyond dumb decisions like doing exactly what you know you aren't supposed to be doing.I honestly didn't find it necessary to have a sequel since the first one had a perfect ending. Purely made for money.Why does every big Hollywood film have the acting speak very slowly, in a raspy whispering voice?I did like the kids, especially Millicent Simmonds, but once you took out the family dynamic of the first then it loses the heart and soul. Overall it didn't bring anything new to the sequel and it was way too predictable. I literally foresaw pretty everything that was going to happen.I give it a big ""meh.""",A Quiet Place Part II

141,stevenrotherforth,Nothing much is gained by the time credits roll,7,6 July 2021,"A Quiet Place Part 2Movie 7/10Not nearly as good as the first instalment. Part 2 treats us to a Day 1 opening scene which allows Writer/Director John Krazinski to make a brief cameo. The movie then proceeds to follow on exactly where the first film finished. This is a blessing in disguise because Part 2 never tries to do the usual sequel thing by trying to top the original. Instead this new instalment is a seamless continuation which can allow the audience to watch both films back to back.At 1hr 37mins the runtime is lean. I wouldn't say I was disappointed in this film, rather a little underwhelmed. Nothing much is gained by the time credits roll. The story doesn't progress much and the Abbot family seem to be back at square one by the end of the movie. We never really get any answers but then again being kept in the dark was part of the first films appeal.Krazinski shows once again he's a master of building tension. There's some excellent set pieces and the CGI monsters look better than ever. A truly stunning horror creation, their design is original and inventive.Cillian Murphy takes time out from being a Peaky Blinder, joining Emily Blunt in the lead and is an excellent choice.That said it is still the two child actors who steal the show. Once again Millicent Simmonds being the stand out.I enjoyed this movie but I may have set my expectations a little too high. There's nothing here to match the first films creativity or surprise factor but still manages to be a solid sequel. I'm looking forward to buying the 4K Blu-ray so I can review both audio and picture quality for us Home theatre nerds.If the sound on the disc is anything like Part 1, which I suspect that it will be.

144,maxglen,A pretty solid continuation of ideas,7,31 May 2021,"Last night me and my girlfriend went to the cinema for the first time since COVID-19 shut down the cinemas last year. Our local cinema was playing a one night only double bill of both A Quiet Place and A Quiet Place Part II, meaning we got to experience both film back to back and I must say, this is absolutely the way to experience these films. A Quiet Place Part II benefits heavily from initial viewing it's predecessor as it picks up directly where the original left off and has many visual nods to that prior movie. The story goes the only place it really could have with the remaining members of the family attempting to relocate after having their home ravaged by the blind aliens that have inhabited the earth. Oh yeah, it's basically confirmed that they are aliens now, thanks in no small part to the absolutely fantastic cold open of this film, taking place on the day of the 'invasion' which also allows for a cheeky bit of John Krasinski which I will never complain about. Eventually, back in the present, the family arrive at an old, seemingly abandoned industrial factory where they fall into a trap lain by Cillian Murphy's Emmet. If you've seen the trailers it will come as no surprise that Murphy ends up being one of this film's main players and protagonists and I've got to say, he adds a lot of heart that could have been missing without him after the death of Krasinski's character in the first film. Just as it's predecessor did, A Quiet Place Part II has absolutely stellar sound mixing and editing as well as an enchanting, unsettling soundtrack. There is also plenty of tension, it's best scene coming towards the end of the second act when Emmet and Regan walk into a trap whilst in search for a boat and Marcus and the baby end up trapped in a furnace fighting for oxygen; it's harrowing stuff and a great pay off from the constant build up we'd been given up to that point. I think my main complaint about the film is that it does feel a little derivative of itself in moments, especially it's ending which is almost identical to the first film's, down to the method in which the characters are saved and the abrupt ending seemingly setting up another sequel. I also found it to be less emotional all round which may be down to the lack of a certain John Krasinski. I found Lee Abbott to be a big part of the emotional core of that first film, there's not really any really touching scenes in this one like Lee and Marcus at the waterfall or the sign language ""I love you"" scene but honestly these are more nitpicks than major criticisms. This is a worthy sequel and there are things done here that make it worth your time, especially if you loved the first as I did. A solid 7 to 8/10 from me. Thank you for reading my review and have a lovely day or night wherever you may be.",A Quiet Place Part II

146,Mike_Devine,Krasinski turns up the volume,7,27 July 2021,"2018's surprise runaway hit 'A Quiet Place' redefined the post apocalyptic horror subgenre thanks to its smart screenwriting, unnerving premise and masterful execution. It's no surprise that the 2021 follow-up was equally powerful.Despite its name, there's no reason to sleep on 'A Quiet Place Part II,' as the part-prequel/part-sequel is able to turn up the volume in the scares department. While not as groundbreaking as its predecessor, 'Part II' is able to continue the story in a way that doesn't feel forced or like a cash grab, which is easier said than done in this day and age. John Krasinski proves once again that he is a triple threat with his ability to direct, write and act in the film, and Emily Blunt doesn't disappoint as matriarch Evelyn Abbott. But it's Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe who steal the show as sign language-speaking siblings who are forced to wiggle out of one death-defying curveball after another.While 'Part II' does not compare in the originality department, it's able to feel different enough while still being entertaining. The incorporation of a larger cast adds another element, and even though the creatures have lost some of the fear factor they had in the previous film, Krasinski and team found new ways to accentuate their ferocity.It's not often that a sequel is on par with its predecessor, but 'A Quiet Place Part II' is a good example of how clever storytelling and compelling acting is a killer combo.",A Quiet Place Part II

They are for the most parts not that well made. Closeups of the monsters looks more like a video game. Unrealistic and not scary In movie medium. Where practical effects could have lifted an allready solid and well made movie Even further.But It's ultimately the fan service and lazy audience of today that are content with cgi filled movies and never complain about anything or complain about everything.

Original creature design and nifty story on one family's struggle to survive the threat. In Part 2, I was hoping we'd get a larger view of the alien's ecosystem, it's technology and a picture of how the aliens decimated the larger cities...are there many islands on Earth with a population? Are the aliens just an advance force prepping Earth for a colonizing invasion?Like the ridiculous, The Tomorrow War, the creatures here just appear to be vicious, killing morons...yet, they have mastered space travel? Why are they here?Nothing is answered...it's more of the same...maintain silence, blast them with a feed back machine and administer a head shot. The film ends abruptly.I hope Part 3 really gets into the universe of the story.

153,eagandersongil,a worthy continuation,7,13 August 2021,"""A Silent Place 2"" is a beautiful continuation, in a current cinema full of generic Blockbusters the film directed by John Krasinski shows again its own identity, which even follows a certain standard arc of character development, but has unexpected ramifications and mainly, a beautiful visual identity all its own, the facial designer of the ""monsters"" is very reminiscent of The Last Of Us game and their physical body is something scary, they are more visually explored in the second film, but without being forced, and their appearances are always followed of enormous tension, the director manages to transmit the physical incapacity of human beings towards creatures.Another interesting fact is how Krasinski managed to turn this second film into a giant second act, here we don't have a beginning or an end, we only have a development of a story in the sequel, that's cool, of course, creating a trilogy is of course, and the proposal to make it a perfect division of acts between the films is interesting, the only detail that escapes from this proposal is the first 10 minutes that show how it all started, we have a small brushstroke of the origin of the creatures, and it's very well as this origin is neither chewed nor explained to the viewer, the addition of the new character Emmett (Cilian Murphy) is good, but it doesn't surpass the character of John Krasinski (Lee), who alias hovers in the film and we feel very sorry for his missing, another point of the script is that I expected a little more from Emily Blunt's character who has a great arc in the first one and now in the second she does a secondary plot, on the other hand, Millicent's deaf character is still great.The performances are good, the biggest highlight for me is the actress Millicent Simmonds, who has a difficult text but delivers too much, Emily Blunt also does a good performance, Cilian Murphy despite being a great actor does a bit dull performance.The first 10 minutes are amazing, we have a magnificent construction, interspersing several technical devices to compose the action scenes, the visual and photography are great, the soundtrack is good (although not so well used), the makeup also works well, anyway, the entire production designer is great and very authorial.""A Silent Place 2"" loses a little the essence of its predecessor, but it's still a great sequel, we have two unnecessary scenes, and some bad uses of jump scare, but the film fulfills its function, showing a cinematic maturity and very authorial, it's a tense but fun and fluid film and we're looking forward to the trilogy. 7.5/10.",A Quiet Place Part II
154,fciocca,"Entertaining, but looks like a generic action/horror movie. A huge step back from the previous chapter.",5,7 July 2021,"The first part of ""A Quiet Place"" managed to build up tension and suspense like very few recent movies are able to do. It was so deep because it was telling the drama of a family that, since the very beginning, lost so much and needed to deal with negative emotions such as grief and despair. However there were also a lot of positive aspects like union, hope for a future together, despite the extremely difficult world, invaded by unknown aliens. The focus was on human feelings, rather than action, that was still there, but was just to enrich the plot. I loved the open ending, and honestly I did not feel the need for a sequel. It was a balanced movie and Krasinski did a wonderful job.Unfortunately, I cannot say the same thing of Part Two, that feels like a generic action/horror movie. All the efforts to build tension and a believable story of a family that is psychologically destroyed and physically proven, here are completely gone. We understand how the invasion took place, and the first ten minutes are really intense and well directed. Then, the movie completely loses itself in a lot of shooting, massacre and killings scenes. It has some good moments here and there, and the acting is good. I was not expecting otherwise with Cillian Murphy in the cast. I do not understand why I should watch this sequel: a lot of things are left unexplained and everything feels rushed. I did not discover something new about aliens, there are no new human feelings explored and in general there are no meaningful events that may progress this ""franchise"". There is another open ending that looks like the ripoff of the first chapter. I presume that in two or three years we are gonna get a new Quiet Place part.Honestly, I don't understand why ruining a beautiful movie, forcing it into a ""series"". The first chapter accomplished a lot and set my expectations bar very high. For me this should have been just a stand alone flick. Part Two does his job barely to keep you entertained until the end... more or less. There are a few parts that are really boring and basically redundant. What a pity.",A Quiet Place Part II
155,DeBBss,"Decent sequel, but not nearly as good as the first",6,11 July 2021,"With the success of the first movie, it's inevitable that a sequel will be in the works. I was never expecting the sequel to be better than the original, so at least I wasn't disappointed. A Quiet Place Part 2 takes a completely different tone than the first, and that tone switch ruins the fear and intensity. The first film barely showed the monsters, and when they did, it was always dark. Doing this creates a mysteriousness that then results in fear, because we fear what we don't know, and in this case, we fear what we can barely see. In A quiet Place Part 2, the monsters are in full view, and sure, the monsters are scary looking, but it wasn't nearly as scary as the first movie. So the tones are completely different, but I don't think this new tone helped in the fear factor.Aside from the film being less scary, the characters became more stupid. Nearly every character makes a dumb decision at one point in the film. It's almost as if they didn't live in this apocalypse for over a year. But what's worse? The script needs the characters to make dumb decision to push the plot forward. Once that happens, the script loses any form of intelligence. Also, this movie is technically longer than the first, but it feels way shorter, and I blame that all on the lack of intensity.A Quiet Place Part 2 is a decent sequel, but not nearly as good as the original. This movie isn't even that scary; it lacks the intensity that the first film had. The script is also way more inferior in almost every single way. The film also leaves on a worse cliffhanger than the original, so I guess it's implied that there's going to be another sequel. If there is a part 3, then I really hope that it sticks to its old roots and not continue with this.",A Quiet Place Part II

Director: John Krasinski
Starring: Emily blunt, Cillian Murphy, Noah Jupe, Millicent Simmonds, John Krasinski, Djimon Hounsou etc
Overall rating 92/100A quiet place 2 follows the aftermath of their home being destroyed, the Abbott family now face terrors of the outside world. Forced to venture into the unknown, they realize the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats lurking beyond the sand path.This movie didn't disappoint, it was a rare sequel that matches the original. I loved the character background and expanded story world. The cinematography was incredible. The tense tone and jumpscares were incredibly crafted, I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to end just like the first film. The sound design and gore was used effectively. I loved the new characters added. The progression to the plot and separate storylines worked a lot better than expected. The performances from the whole cast was excellent, especially Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds who really upped their game in more leading roles here. There was a lot of cleverly crafted and well thought out plot points. I liked the added development to the monsters. The character development to the characters, especially the children was excellent. I thought the directing from John Krasinksi was truly top notch. And I loved the set up for another film.There was some flaws however, not many though. I thought the set up for the separate storylines was slightly rushed. There was a few more questionable character decisions that made the film feel more generic but only in certain places. And for me the family dynamic was missing slightly, so therefore the movie lacked more character depth and emotional weight.Overall, A quiet place 2 delivers everything you loved from the first film, whilst also expanding the story world and developing the characters well. With a great focus on the children. The directing and the scares were stronger, but the character depth and emotional weight for me was slightly weaker compared to the first film. But its overall still as strong, and it makes you want more.",A Quiet Place Part II
157,shanayneigh,A movie that shouldn't have been made,4,14 September 2021,"In my review for the original movie, which I gave a score of 8, I wrote: ""I hope they don't make sequels and turn this gem into a franchise. How many horror franchises can you name that have not come with diminishing returns?""It turns out I'm psychic. The characters have evolved into morons. Plenty of things don't make much sense. How do people figure out within the first two minutes of the creatures arriving that they have to keep quiet? Why do the island people play a song like a riddle instead of broadcasting a message like ""Hey! The aliens can't swim! We're on an island having a luau!""The movie suffers from sequelitis - same same, but different - to the point where it almost becomes ridiculous. The ending is almost a carbon copy of the one in the first movie. I wonder if the very last shot is a last minute reshoot or if they ran out of money, because that was some Langoliers-style compositing. We won't see that shot on any VFX artist's showreel.",A Quiet Place Part II
158,gavinp9,Another taught thriller,8,27 May 2021,"'A Quiet Place: Part II' is a rare sequel - one that almost surpasses the original! It does a good job of having an action-packed opening 10min flashback, to remind you how the sound-hunting-aliens work, but also so Lee (Krasinski) can get some screen time and we unveil a bit of the initial terror when the outbreak started. From there, we follow Evelyn (Blunt), Regan (Simmonds), Marcus (Jupe) and the baby from the immediate aftermath of the first film.They run into Emmett (Murphy), who we meet in the flashback, who's been dealing with his own trials while trying to survive. Obviously, a few things go wrong and there's many fraught moments as they're hunted by the creatures. The film is smart by making Simmonds the main character and following her journey as she sets out to use her hearing-aid against the aliens.Once again, the score - and often lack of any sound - is used really well and forces you to put yourself in the character's shoes. The pacing is also great, with there being a few moments of respite, but overall there's plenty of momentum and it all feels like it's over too quick (does only go for 90min). Very enjoyable - would watch a third one!",A Quiet Place Part II

161,flicklover,"Finally, a sequel that truly rivals the original!!!",9,29 May 2021,"In 2018 A Quiet Place was a really great surprise. A suspense/horror film with a great concept that was very tense but focused on it's characters not just the mayhem they live through. It was a simple, but effective story executed very well. . As an audirnce we really came to care about the Abbott family in their quest to stay alive in the face if an invasion by creatures that hunt and kill based on what they hear. The use of sound, and the lack of it made the actor's facial expressions in their interaction more important it's success it was inevitable that there would be a sequel. Well after a year of its release being delayed due to the COVID pandemic it was finally out. I'm glad that it's being released only in theaters because that is the best way to experience it.The film film begins in flashback with the day of the initial invasion by the deadly aliens. It is a great way to open the film. We see tge Abbotts living their normal life. They are out at a baseball game being played in by their son Marcus. All is well and suddenly the spectators see a flaming object falling to earth. The creatures begin to attack and of course nobody realizes yet that the attack based on noise. It is very tense scene and even though it there are others running for their lives the film focuses on the Abbotts. Joe Kresinski and Emily Blunt are great as the parents but the kids Regan and Marcus are more focused on in this film and are great as well.After the attack the film goes to present day. With her husband Lee gone Evelyn and her kids leave their home in search of other people that may have survived the creature attack. They come across Emmett played by Cillian Murphy. They know Emmett as he is a friend of Lee. He lost his family to the creatures and is hiding in a bunker in an abandoned factory. He reluctantly takes them in but says they need to leave tge next day. Along with Marcus and Regan, Evelyn is taking care of her baby that was born the year before. These scenes are very well acted by all especially Cillian Murphy in a very good performance as a man who's lost everything and just wants to survive. Marcus had gotten caught in a bear trap set by Emmitt and is in alot of pain. His screaming attracts the creatures but they are able to hide a in a sound proof bunker. The next day Regan discovers a song on the radio and deduces that it is coming from a nearby island. She wants to find the island and attempt to transmit the high pitched noise her father discovered before he died that makes the creatures vulnerable to weapons because their reaction to the high pitched noise made from Regan's Cochlear implant being close to a microphone leaves them exposed so they can be killed. She goes off alone and Evelyn pleads with Emmitt to go after her and bring her back. The heart of the film is all the main characters trying to survive. We do see the creatures more this time because they were revealed in the first film so here there is no element of surprise. And the creatures don't disappoint. They look more detailed this time and are done very well. The sound design of the creatures and the rest of the film is excellent. Again alot of the tension is derived from sound. There are encounters with other surivors who are both friendly and dangerous. The last half of the film is very intense and the action is compelling.It us a rare these days for a sequel to truly rival an original on how good it is but this film is right there. It's hard to say that it's better because the first film had the newness of the concept and was fresh but A Quiet Place Part II is one of the best sequels to come out in a long time!!!Grade: A-",A Quiet Place Part II

This world is filled with the sound-hunting alien monsters and surviving humans that they don't know if they can be trusted.At first, John Krasinski didn't want to make a sequel to the first Quiet Place, but the other producers convinced him and gave him all the freedom for this sequel. With this sequel, he knows how to expand the world and provide additional information. You may start to doubt certain information if you compare this sequel with the first part. Hopefully they can overcome these hesitations with a third film. Krasinski also seems to have used some moments as a tribute to director Steven Spielberg, as some names or events link back to some of his films.John Krasinski manages to provide many exciting moments in this sequel. Because of this tension, you as an audience try to remain silent, just like the characters in the film. If someone in the room makes a noise by coughing or eating their popcorn too lazily, you almost start to get annoyed by this.The film is also told more from the points of view of the children of the Abbott family. This creates a bit more tension, because children make different choices than adults. As a viewer, you can't really get annoyed by some things the children do, because they don't know any better. With this film, Krasinski also tries to give the message to parents that they should teach their children to let go more.Fortunately, the acting is also well done by the film cast. Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe manage to carry the film as the children of the Abbott family. Millicent Simmonds in particular knows how to provide extra tension as a deaf actress. In some of her scenes the sound is also removed. In this way, as a viewer, you experience the events as her deaf character also experiences the events. In addition to the children, the adult actors also provide good acting. Emily Blunt plays well as the mother of her children who tries to care for them but also has to deal with them to keep them safe in this apocalyptic world. Cillian Murphy also delivers good acting as a somewhat traumatized man, who trusts others little. His character also knows how to create tension, because you never know for sure what he's going to do. It's also nice to see him again in a similar movie, such as the movie 28 Days Later for which he is known. In 28 days later the world is also hit by an invasion only by zombies instead of aliens as in A Quiet Place.",A Quiet Place Part II

However the characters don't have much new to offer. Emily Blunt still delivers a great performance through body language and little more dialogue this time around, along with both the kids although it's frustrating that Regan the daughter still thinks she knows better.

The only major new character we really get is Cillian Murphy as Emmett an old friend of the family who has lost his and just has given up on life.

For the film's tension to be higher, the cast is heavily relied on for painfully realistic performances, which they each succeed to do perfectly. With the whole story making sense as the film entertains, the writing of the story is pretty much perfect. There are always those unnecessary fractions that'll bore you, but there's a lot more of those than the first A Quiet Place. So by the time it ends is when you'll be able to admit that A Quiet Place Part II was a pretty decent sequel.The terrors of the more-outside world illustrated in this movie means every movie witness are in for an entertaining, strained and violent journey.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",A Quiet Place Part II
177,elliotte2,This is why you should not do sequels,4,15 July 2021,"When you do a sequel, especially for a horror film, people who survived the original will have picked up some level of survival skills. This movie was a collection of 'who can make the most idiotic decision today'. The main actors took turn trying to outdo the previous character's stupid mistake....and there are plenty. In the first movie there was a couple but overall the movie held up well. This movie relies on stupidity instead of smart writing to provide plot devices.The trailer is misleading, giving the impression that this is a prequel, showing how this all started instead it was a flashback and reminder of movie was contrived conveniences and misdirected motivations.",A Quiet Place Part II

See the part-1 than watch this one.Wow! This movie carries all the thrill, all the horror, the suspense, the surprises and the shivers.Simply splendid direction and what superb awesome acting by Emily Blunt and a thousand time more by Millicent Simmonds.A must must see.",A Quiet Place Part II
180,tccandler,It is good to have movies back!,8,3 June 2021,"Very similar to the original, in terms of quality, tension and visceral discomfort. This was the first film I saw in a theater in over a year (due to Covid), and perhaps it benefitted from missing the theatrical experience. Nevertheless, this is a sequel that is well worth the price of admission. It is good to have movies back!",A Quiet Place Part II
181,martinrobertson300482,Pretty good,7,16 July 2021,"Took me a while to review this one seeing as I know my opinion is in the minority, but here it is. I honestly think this is a bit better than the first quiet place.I thought the original had a good idea that was taken a bit far. I thought it was really gimmicky having no one able to talk for the whole movie, and they went overboard with it. This second movie had more talking and felt more grounded, so I preffered it. Even if I wasn't sure about the ending at first.Anyway, most people will probably find it pretty equal to the original. As most were'nt put off the original for the same reasons as me. So here's someone who thought the first one was OK saying check out the new one.",A Quiet Place Part II
182,bhernandez2216,Far better than the first,10,5 June 2021,"The second movie is intense, it's also a thrill ride of silence and scares. It's ""A Must See"" horror flick. John Krasinski has brought back a new Quiet Place sequel to the big screen! This is what you'll have fun to experience the horror of jumpscares at the edge of your seats in the cinemas.",A Quiet Place Part II
183,ivanmessimilos,Great sequel,8,3 June 2021,"The second part continues directly to the highly praised original with one digression at the very beginning of the film, but that scene also has its purpose. Not only does it have a purpose but that scene is impressively shot and is an effective introduction to the film.It is extremely difficult to make a quality sequel that is at the level of the first part, and it is even harder to do it when it comes to the horror genre. Personally, I think that director Krasinski succeeded in that. Part two follows practically the same formula by which part one is made. It can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you follow the winning formula, but the downside is that the film doesn't look that fresh because it's already been seen. I personally didn't mind it because I stick to the one if it's not broken then don't fix it, even though if I had to choose then I would say that the first part is better for me precisely because of that freshness in the sea of similar horror movies.Logically the sound, as well as the absence of sound aka silence, is essential to the film, it seems almost like one of the characters in the plot itself. That's why I really recommend watching the film in the cinema, because then the experience is incomparable, literally a different experience (I made that mistake with the first part).This time the bigger story arc was given to the eldest daughter played by Millicent Simmonds, a young actress who is deaf in real life, and although a certain risk seems to have been made with this, I think it paid off because part of the story is told and shown from her perspective and it is one of the stronger parts of the film. Krasinski proved to be a master of directing extremely tense scenes and he confirmed that in this film with a few impressive shots, I would especially single out the last ten minutes of the film as a peak of that tension. Every shot is beautiful.I believe if you liked the first part you will love the second because it follows the same formula. The objections may go because there isn't a lot of explanation, but that's not the goal of the film either. The intention is to provide you with an extremely tense ninety-minute experience. I hope there will be part three as well. I can not wait.",A Quiet Place Part II
184,FelipeCarrillo,'A Quiet Place Part II' Review: Krasinski's Hypertonic Sequel Demands Theatrical Experience,8,13 July 2021,"After the tragic-yet-empowering showdown of the first film, the Abbott family unquietly comes back to the cinemas after a delay of more than a year in a worth-the-wait sequel that takes its apocalyptic survival tale to new and exciting grounds.John Krasinski has wisely reshaped his own career after his breakout role as nice guy Jim Halpert on NBC's legendary sitcom ""The Office"". Upon revisiting, the TV show reveals both as a pleasure on its own and an awkwardly rewarding testimony about how much most of these talented actors have grown professionally. Voice acting has stood out throughout his filmography, being credited in numerous animated productions such as Pixar's ""Monsters University,"" DreamWorks's ""Shrek the Third"" and uncredited in Netflix's wacky ""BoJack Horseman."" He has done a fair amount of ""physical"" acting as well, with Kathryn Bigelow's electric ""Detroit"", Michael Bay's war actioner ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" and Amazon Studios' geopolitical spy show ""Jack Ryan"" among his most notorious drama chops on screen. Less remarkable was his screenwriting and directing background, debuting with 2009's ""Brief Interviews with Hideous Men"", directing three ""The Office"" episodes and his dramedy ""The Hollars"".He certainly struggled maintaining his star momentum, being mostly recognized for his fantastic work on ""The Office"". However, he caught everybody off guard in 2018, when he released a contained, brilliantly paced and scripted thriller, produced by Paramount Pictures and Platinum Dunes, which infused new life to the modern ""movie experience"" concept. Accurately titled ""A Quiet Place,"" it was a project initially considered as a would-be addition to the ""Cloverfield"" meta-universe that evolved as a standalone picture bursting with potential. In 2016, Scott Beck y Bryan Woods sold their promising screenplay to a studio that greenlighted it without hesitation. The final result was jaw-droopingly good: an original apocalyptic tale with top-notch performances from the whole family (Krasinski as the father, Blunt as the mother, Millicent Simmonds, Noah Jupe and Cade Woodward as the children), amazing craftsmanship and an Oscar-worthy sound design. The latter caused funny problems to audiences to the extent of not being allowed to make any minimal sound in the theater due to the almost dialogue-free must-see event it became. It was a genuinely anxiety-inducing experience like no one has ever seen before.Suffering multiples delays throughout the pandemic, anticipation towards its release could not get bigger. Now the long-awaited follow-up has finally seen the light with a theaters-exclusive marketing campaign. It may be said that Paramount's summer slate has started strong, with Krasinski's passion project smashing post-COVID box office records and ranking the highest-grossing movie spot domestically yet. It totally deserves its impressive achievements as we are in front of a great second installment that treasures a couple of high-octane suspenseful sequences, some smart script moves and fantastic performances across the board.Following one of the best, most badass cliffhangers in modern history, it picks up in a different time, which brings the world the opportunity to nourish itself and propose pathos to the story. Running for almost 10 minutes, the chaotic prelude, gloriously climaxed with a heart-stopping, do-not-make-a-sound sequence, both retcons some details and serves as an exquisite entrée by flipping the premise. The use of sound, going from everyday noises to screams and screeching cars, does not apparently seem consonant with the tone and pace stablished by the precedent film, but it eventually finds its raison-d'être, justifying some of its narrative rules and revealing some routes to take in the future.Constricted in its proceedings, the original film's biggest asset was its show-don't-tell factor, moving forward with four characters and achieving outstanding results through visuals. After the tragically-touching ending, Krasinski- who wrote it single-handedly -had to discover the perfect tools to honor that final denouement and boost the next movie with a new set of tricks. He did find his way to do it, introducing new material led by Cillian Murphy's Emmett. The script does not shift the storytelling dynamics at its core, but it does endow the kids, especially Regan, the chance to become more fleshed-out characters. Emily Blunt does not disappoint-will she ever? -, excelling at portraying distress, pain and terror without saying a word. Noah Jupe's committed performance makes him even more relatable and grounded but it is Millicent Simmonds who steals the show, delivering vulnerability and strength all at once, carrying on her shoulders some of the most demanding duties of the film with a performance that will open doors for representation by definitely getting her recognition as one of the most talented young actors working in Hollywood right now.With Krasinski working off-screen, a new on-screen leader should be crowned. At some point, I wondered how much stronger this sequel would have been without a main male character, giving Simmonds or Blunt carte blanche to seize the whole film. A fair complaint if Lee's substitute would have been a second-rate addition. It is, in fact, not the case at all. Cillian Murphy's Emmett receives a good, painfully poignant background, with sadness and hopelessness as his driving forces. His development within the film's core storyline fits perfectly; however, what grants Emmett that potency and hook is definitely Murphy's honest acting work. ""Peaky Blinders"" aside, it has been a while since the Irish actor has imbued this much rawness and vulnerability into a character. Reaching unbearable levels of tension and building a well-earned relatability, Murphy is practically what leads the sequel to break into new places. Sans his involvement, a radically different movie would have been released in cinemas.Speaking of which, Murphy and Simmonds, an unexpectedly charming duo, are entrusted with presenting the new directions. Their world's foundations remain the same; however, humans feel more present this time around and the psychological effect played by the creatures in the original film has been somehow lessened. Both actors channel Emmett's and Regan's motifs and expand them in such an intelligent way, they take us to unexplored corners in this survival tale. With a masterfully-deployed rug-pull and a rushed yet invigorating third act, the film stablishes more ambitious, interesting pieces that are going to play out in an imminent third entry.There is still a feature diminishing considerably the suspense component: the monsters. The first movie maneuvered tension in a really clever way: through expert visual storytelling. Not showing the monster in full was a valuable decision, keeping the spectator in the dark, leaving plenty of room for imagination. As a deft tension exercise, it has become a method that pays off most of the times. Take for instance the masterful build-ups in classics as Spielberg's ""Jaws"" and Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", or in modern gems as Matt Reeves' ""Cloverfield"", David Bruckner's ""The Ritual"", Gareth Edwards' ""Godzilla"" or Frank Darabont's ""The Mist"".Closer to ""10 Cloverfield Lane's"" third act than ""The VVitch"" or ""The Babadook"" on its what's-in-the-dark techniques, the sequel feels more confident showing off its hair-raising creatures, boasting a couple of jaw-dropping CGI scenes and, at the same time, leaking some visually questionable creature appearances. Rendered in sharp detail courtesy of a tripled budget, you may now appreciate the creatures in all their splendor, with the suspense lying further on when they are going to burst into the frame than being unaware of the monsters' latent presence.Despite not shying away from showing its scary creatures, it does not hurt at all the brilliantness of its craftsmanship, even leveling it up considerably here. Decently bigger and louder, the sound design calls Oscar recognition, which equals to experience it only in theaters, either on an IMAX screen¬- as I did -or a Dolby Theater. Small sounds play a key role in a story where noisy sighs, water falling down or heavy footsteps may unchain a total disaster. The film certainly keeps paying close attention to those little elements, concocting sequences as good and thrilling as the first one's. Polly Morgan's cinematography and Marco Beltrami's score are both great, restrained and elegant, building the suspense of each moment through genius camera work and heart-stopping compositions. To illustrate, suffice to pleasantly break down the final sequence of the second act, a beautifully-unbreathable three-moment synchrony of a climax where sound, visuals and editing becomes one unstoppable riot of tension.""A Quiet Place Part II"" by John Krasinski certainly defies expectations by deftly balancing the legacy of the first opus with the unexpected, new turns of this post-apocalyptic continuation through a chillingly-immersive sound design, tailor-made casting, excellent performances, smart direction, a few impressive twists and a couple of for-the-books sequences. There are, nevertheless, some easy-to-miss storytelling elements that prevent it from surpassing the 2018 picture. There is no doubt this one is meant to be experienced in theaters though, representing such an experience that it will be the responsible to bring audiences and films back together and help us forget our own, on-going, stranger-than-fiction apocalyptic reality.",A Quiet Place Part II
185,jackgdemoss,To be experienced in a crowded theatre,8,7 June 2021,"I so distinctly remember when I saw A Quiet Place (Part I) in theatres. I was in a brand new theatre that boasted 160 seats, each of which was filled with college students in my undergrad town. Everyone was laughing, joking, and eating popcorn during the previews. Once the movie started, I never even saw someone reach for their popcorn.Both of these films use a lack of sound as a tool to build suspense, and it works. A Quiet Place Part II is objectively better than its predecessor from a technical standpoint. John Krasinski is finding his form with directing, and I expect his films to only get better from here.This movie is definitely worth seeing, specifically in theatres. Just note that there are a few cheap jump scares, owing mostly to the drastic change in sound during suspenseful moments.",A Quiet Place Part II

This because exactly as the first movie this is decently creepy and exciting. The idea is pretty good and the movie has that pretty realistic ""end of the world"" tone, acting overall is great and this is not a bad movie.However, there are so many dumb moment in this movie (as in the first). There are so many times I wonder what they are thinking or how stupid people can be. Especially since they are smart 98% of the time, and then suddenly, all alone, watching a baby, badly hurt, one kid need to go walkabout. Yea, why not. It's not like he is bleeding, can barely walk and has a baby brother to look after, nah, let's explore the area like it is a video game...The daughter, being deaf, is of course the most useless character in both movies. Sure they all learned sign language because of her so she is a good plot device, but otherwise? She is deaf. She cannot hear herself walking, if she walk past something and knock it over she cannot hear it. She is the least useful character, but instead she is made out as the main ""hero"". Okay, sure...And why would ""evil folk"" set up traps that hurt people so those ""victims"" can scream? Let that one sink in for a while...But the dumbest most idiotic thing about this sequel is the song. Why? For the love of all that is unholy, why!? Can the Aliens understand human speech now to? Will they hear any vocal message and go ""hmm.. there are lots of humans on this island, let us go there for lunch"". Is that why the song needed to be cryptic? Hey, here is a though; why not tell people? Like here we are, come to us, the Aliens cannot swim.No? Okay...The best part of this movie was the beginning. The first 5min is great with amazing acting, great action, fantastic CGi. They should have gone more along those lines and built this up from the start.Again, this movie is not really bad. It has a few great moments, and there is enough here to be decently entertained and perhaps even like it. But in the end of the day a good idea with good acting and some great scenes does not make a movie. You also need directing, script, and continuity that make sense. I give this a 5/10. I cannot recommend, but this is not horrible. If you liked the first, you will like this too.",A Quiet Place Part II

193,pivic,A fine sequel: both Hollywoody and not,6,28 June 2021,"The first part was quite good and I liked the premise: human-murdering aliens that can not see but hear very well.The first ten minutes of this film were promising and brutal. Suburbia slaughtered, bringing some of George Romero's later zombie-apocalypse flicks to mind.Emily Blunt must be one of the best famous actors of our day. Consider how she can evoke emotions simply by changing her facial expression. It's a sight to see.I think the fairly anti-family intro is badly contrasted with regular family sentiments in the rest of the film. The main kids just couldn't be annihilated, could they? Kind of pores other people into an 'unworthy victims' bucket, which is drab.I liked the jumps between the 'hearing' and 'non-hearing' scenes. About as much as I disliked how unlikely it seemed that the super-clever kid actually was that clever: it more felt like a rubber stamp had been left on their forehead than making me feel it were true.As with the first film, I loved how this one made me feel what the first 'Alien' film did: the monster's presence was there even when the monster physically was not. This, padded with the non-hearing scenes, were frightening.The rhythm of the film felt balanced. Action, inaction, non-action.The asthmatic scenes added to the feeling of having the pressure mount; Perhaps this is the best way for me to describe the film: viscerally thrilling as good horror films can invoke.I also liked how two sides of the adventure were on display towards the end.

The decision to show some 'before the end of the world' scenes was alright, but a wasted opportunity. One day the monsters just appeared. Nothing interesting made of the reveal. Then we fast forward back to where we left off from the first film.Backtrack some old footage from the first film, and then move on like it this movie is a TV series or something. Was a little boring at this stage. The introduction of some new characters was a good idea, but they were flat and uninteresting and added nothing to the story.Nothing, it seems, was new or developed.

195,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Fun and entertaining BUT first film was fine on it own.,7,16 July 2021,"I thought it was good film. Entertaining. Full of tense moments.....but I still think it wasnt a necessary film. A Quiet Place would have been fine, on its own. This film doesnt really add anything to the lore. Its not like we really learn anything new about these creatures. Were not really shown a new perspective, like seeing the military side of things. It even ends the same way as the first where the hearing aid is put up to a microphone to blast out some feedback and the creatures get shot. And I also didnt really like the characters splitting up. It just felt like 2 different stories were being told. Especially with with the mom and son staying back just feeling so non important to the overall story. And I know this isnt the fault of the actor....but Noah Jupe clearly looked older and it was so funny to me trying to pretend this takes place immediately after the last movie and even funnier when they show the flashback of the first day. Also for the flashback, they had Millicent Simmonds hair be longer (I guess they wanted to have some clear visual representation of passage of time) but it honestly looked like they added extensions to her short hair. It looked bad.Again though, I didnt hate this movie. It was still fun and entertaining. It was tense and gruesome. I really liked the character of growth of Millicent's character and that she was given more to do in this film. I just think A Quiet Place was perfectly fine on its own.",A Quiet Place Part II

It seems like the scenes from the first movie were rehashed. Despite its short runtime, I found it hard to bear it. It really started to get on my nerves. The characters are dumb as ever and they introduce more of these creatures.This is a really very boring film and I'm just glad I didn't pay to watch it in the theatres because they were closed in my country when this film came out.

198,PCC0921,Silence is key!,8,31 May 2021,"Released: May 28th, 2021
Viewed: May 29th, 2021The subject of the modern day horror movie came up recently, when I went and saw Spiral (2021). The idea that horror movies aren't really scary anymore, was weighing in on me. We have pushed the violence envelope to the limit, when trying to scare the audience. We've seen everything you can do with violence and gore. The films end up not being scary anymore, just kind of, gross. The original Halloween (1978), was scary and believe it or not, barely had a drop of blood in it. But, maybe it's just R-rated horror films that have run into this content problem.I took this idea even further when I saw the first, A Quiet Place (2018), film, about five days ago and that is when it struck me. Maybe horror movies have to reinvent the wheel and go back to the basics. What made a more tense, suspenseful and jarring film was the one that wasn't concentrating on what you could see, but what you couldn't. It was holding back and not showing everything that needs to be seen. I still believe that audiences in 1931 were more scared watching Frankenstein (1931), than the audience who saw Spiral (2021). By the way, I am not bashing Spiral (2021). There are parts of that movie that I really enjoyed. Just not the silly, cartoonish-looking, overdone, overused, gore parts. They aren't scary. Maybe dial it back a little and go PG-13. It seems to be working with A Quiet Place (2018) and the sequel is no different.This one picks up from where the last one does, albeit with a flashback to launch things off. Our heroic mother, Evelyn (Emily Blunt), and the two kids, Regan and Marcus have moved on with the baby in a box. They follow the train tracks and eventually come to a factory that houses an old friend from the good old days. What we all know needs to happen and does when Regan realizes her father's signal can be used on a radio station, which could really stir things up for the invading, what-ever-the-hell those things are.What makes these films work and this one particularly, is the idea of the silence. It is Krasinski using old school film techniques to tell a story. In this case, I have been watching a lot of old silent movies lately and that kept coming into my mind, while watching this film. Those moments of silence tell a lot of the story and are the most scary moments. The vulnerability of Regan, being deaf and having to make no noise, but you know they are there. It's not your fear you are feeling, but hers.There also is the case of the creatures. They too are presented in a classic film style. Not too much. Not too little. It harkens me back to the old Aliens movies of the 1980s, all the way up to the monster in Super-8 (2011). They are frightening, effective, but still used in the shadows and revealed sometimes only by the noises they make. It's a film audio engineer's dream.Don't get me wrong. You see the monsters a lot, but the use of them isn't in your face. There is a subtleness that makes the scare quotient go up. This film is just as good as the first one. It could be a hair better if it wasn't for the loss of John Krasinski. His character was missing, but maybe it's safe to say that the first movie belonged to his character and the mantle is passed on to another in this movie. All I really know is, at this moment in time, the PG-13 horror movie is becoming better than the R rated ones.8.6 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",A Quiet Place Part II

Short in length, few dialogues to be expected and few characters but they do a wonderful job of bringing suspense and wicked climax to the movie. I was on the edge of my seat most of the time during the suspenseful scenes and you really get in the position of feeling for the characters. Can get a bit slow at times when there are no dialogues and you watch them walking through the forest or making sign languages but when suspense come you really feel it.

Evelyn sigourney-weavers her way around solo. The day is saved without any darlings getting killed. Yet in the first movie, they offed a beloved child in the opening ten minutes. This movie was sunshine and rainbows in comparison.Sure, it was feel-good and hopeful. But it was just too safe.It had lots of neat ideas though. Like keeping that loud-mouth baby in a soundproof picnic basket. Think of the merchandising there.Maybe the third film will take risks that this one didn't.",A Quiet Place Part II

This movie knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat- literally- and how to make your heart pound non-stop.

207,jdring2007,much more creature screentime than first; Cilian is great; dumb decisions and plot holes cripple the experience,7,18 July 2021,"With substantially more action than the first movie, you'd think it would be better overall. However it's even more riddled with plot holes, predictable jump scares, dumb and unexplained character decisions, nevermind the excessively drawn out scenes of staying quiet (despite the sluggishly loud and bassy music) as a means of sustaining suspense. If you can manage to ignore or compartmentalize these flaws, you might be able to better enjoy the great CGI creature screen time and action scenes. With Krasinski out of the movie (except the first 10min), we're compensated with Cilian Murphy, who delivers a great performance as usual, and pretty much shares the starring role with Emily Blunt. The kids play an even bigger part than the first, which didn't help my enjoyment of the movie, especially given some of the aforementioned plot holes and dumb decisions entirely on their behalf. Regardless, it's a nice end (?) to this ""franchise,"" although I think I'm not the only one to say we'd love a movie in this timeline that doesn't involve a cliché deaf or mute child, during the actual invasion. Given my complaints about the movie, you'd expect a 6, but I up it to a 7 for the increased creature screen time and action, a lot of which is in great lighting, and for Cilian.",A Quiet Place Part II

This is pretty much more of the same, though the gimmick in now not a novelty hence not quite as good, but sequels rarely are. Nevertheless, this does have have a few jump at you frightening moments and it certainly is filled with tension. It's an odd thing to say about a horror film as plausibility is many times a toss, but this is a bit more implausible than the first one. The very best moments are really the very beginning which takes us back to Day one of the invasion. The acting is good, particularly by Millicent Simmonds. Emily blunt doesn't have as much to do here, which is a shame. The ending reeks of another sequel, but I've not heard a word about one in the works, so here's hoping that does not occur. This one was stretching a good thing enough.",A Quiet Place Part II
209,Slarkshark,Lives Up to Part 1,8,19 June 2021,"I still like the first one better, but this is right up there with it and not a let down at all. A bit of a back story was much appreciated. John Krasinski is easily one of my favourite people in the business, so I'm ecstatic that he's done so well directing these. Cillian Murphy is a welcomed addition, and as expected only elevates the film.Some very tense moments just like the first one, however armed with their audio 'weapon' the creatures are much more beatable, therefore taking away some of the vulnerability the characters experienced before. It makes me wonder if these things really could devastate the world and leave it in a apocalyptic state as we see in the film.Looking forward to Part 3!",A Quiet Place Part II
210,fredschaefer-406-623204,A very worthy sequel.,9,30 May 2021,"After a year's wait, A QUIET PLACE II has arrived, the sequel to the unexpected 2018 hit about an alien invasion of Earth, and the desperate struggle of a family to survive in its aftermath. One reason why the original succeeded was the spin director, writer, and star, John Krasinski, put on this long standing WAR OF THE WORLDS story trope: the invaders are fearsome killing machines without eyes, finding their human prey on sound alone. This wrinkle allowed the movie to build enormous suspense and tension as the humans survivors by necessity had to move about making virtually no noise whatsoever. To up the ante, Krasinski had the lead female character, played by Emily Blount, pregnant and about to deliver her child, a situation fraught with incredible danger. The first film succeeded so well because Krasinski built his story solidly, and exploited his premise to the maximum for a solid payoff for the audience. But sequels are a different matter, and usually are judged on how well they manage the degree of diminishing returns, as they often are nothing more than a rehash of the original.I'm glad to say that as sequels go, A QUIET PLACE II is one of those rare ones that builds on the first film, and actually feels like an organic continuation of the story of the Abbot family, as they must continue without the father, Lee, played by Krasinski, and care for their newborn. One thing that right away won me over was an opening sequence that flashed back to Day One of the invasion, where the Abbott family is attending a ball game in the small town where they live just as everything descends in chaos. It's a great way to bring everyone up to speed on just how deadly these creatures really are, along with satisfying fans' curiosity as to just how things went down at the beginning, something we were left to wonder about after seeing a few newspaper headlines (another scifi apocalypse trope) in the first film. The movie then picks up right where the first one left off with Blount and her children, including deaf daughter, Regan (well played by Millicent Simmonds), and son Marcus (played by Noah Jupe), leaving their farm with their newborn in tow looking for fellow survivors. A near disastrous mishap in an old steel mill leads to an encounter with a man named Emmett (played by Cillian Murphy), a family friend from the before the invasion, but now a traumatized survivor who offers them little. The story then divides into three arcs, as Regan sneaks off to follow a radio signal that may hint at a larger community of survivors with Emmett not far behind her, intending to bring her back, while mother Evelyn must search out medical supplies for Marcus, who had the misfortune to step in a bear trap, leaving the boy to protect the baby, retreating to an air tight furnace if necessary. All of these story lines are journeys for the characters, especially the children, who must face great dangers if they are to emerge as the kind of people who will not only survive in this world, but triumph in it. Emmett too, must learn that there is strength in numbers, that there is more than just hiding and hunkering down.In many ways, I might like this sequel more than the first, as Krasinski really goes all in to make this a monster and horror film in scifi clothes. He understands the conventions of the genre, and how to build suspense and then pay it off despite a couple of unfortunate jump scares (the last resort of the lazy). And despite opening the story up with its exploration of the wider world, he continually finds ways to get his characters into enclosed locations (an airtight blast furnace, the interior of a radio station) to give the audience a sense of claustrophobia and menace. This is a film that also uses the small details well, such as when the camera pans along a line of empty shoes on a train station platform, leaving it up to us to imagine the grisly fate of their owners. The creatures are CGI used well, and whose appearances are sparing enough that they don't become less intimidating. Krasinski gets great work out of his actors, especially Simmonds, who is a real find; Murphy, who knows something about apocalypses after being in 28 DAYS LATER, is an excellent choice to step into the surrogate father role, and Dijimon Hounsou is a welcome sight in any film.My fondness for the film does not blind me to the presence of logic holes in the plot, as the premise, like in many scifi horror films, might not stand up under rigorous examination - just how does the alien acute sense of hearing work, and what is its range, and why does some ambient noise easily shield human voices, while in other situations, it does not? Both films are made for those ""Everything wrong with (insert title) in 15 minutes"" videos on Youtube. But whatever the problems with the premise, Krasinski does manage to make me buy into it while watching, and that's enough. Will there be a third film? The ending leaves that possibility open, though I do think the Abbott family saga might all be told. That said, any future film(s) could be set anywhere and explore different facets of this apocalyptic world. And they might expand on just who these, so far, one note killing machines from outer space really are; my theory is that they are simply the first wave shock troops, or just plain exterminators, sent in the clean out the dominant species on this planet, before the real invasion can begin. It's a thought.",A Quiet Place Part II

212,vailsy,suspended all of my disbelief for this movie except the bit ..,6,16 July 2021,".. where the little girl knows exactly how to use the recording studio to hook things up and go on air (with elaborate ceiling switch) while being hunted by a monsterit would take me possibly an hour to figure out an unfamiliar studio by myself and definitely i would not put my hand up in the air and confidently/magically find a switch like i'm turning on a light in my home. As soon as she did it i said to myself 'how would she know where that is' .. i can suspend disbelief for the big stuff, but the small things have to be rightthat moment was a result of them trying to stuff too much into one movie .. often 3 things going on when actually all that was needed for the latter half of the movie was focus on 1 thing; the girl and the guy (the best characters by far) trying to get to the island. Then there would have been time for the story to breath a bitlike the first one, the sound design is very high quality .. still not exceptional since it makes no sense to have zero nature/ambience .. clearly these creatures cannot go around killing all the crickets and small noise generating insects in the world. It also somewhat abuses the ears of people watching the movie with very heavy creature movements and jump scaresstill an entertaining watch nonetheless.",A Quiet Place Part II
213,hunter-friesen,Missed Opportunity,6,7 September 2021,"""A Quiet Place Part II"" once again lets John Krasinski illustrate his directorial chops with constructing set pieces. While I bemoan jump scares like every pretentious film nerd, Krasinski's handling of both the sound and camera work give the jump scares actual meaning, and aren't just cheap tricks to keep you awake.But for all his technical prowess, Krasinski still hasn't found his way with the pen. While I don't normally listen to the ""Last Jedi"" haters, they are right in saying that Johnson's film spun it's wheels when it came to progressing the overall story. ""A Quiet Place Part II"" is in that same boat as it wastes its opportunity to expand on the universe it so desperately wants to create. No matter how much I appreciated the craft, I couldn't shake the ""is this it?"" thought throughout.Milicent Simmonds continues to astound and she deserves much more than what Krasinski can offer her. Cillian Murphy is a nice addition to the cast and Emily Blunt still rocks. This movie does commit the sin of completely wasting Djimon Hounsou in an unintentionally hilarious role.",A Quiet Place Part II

The whole movie was going great but the ending really ruined it for me. The directing was good tho.I really don't get these rating, like people just shut their brains off when they're watching the Quiet movies?John Krasinski, I like your directing dude, but please don't make a third one or if you do, at least have a real conclusion and don't just copy and paste the previous two movies ok?",A Quiet Place Part II

216,arabnikita,Not as fresh or emotional as Part 1 but that doesn't stop it from being good,8,12 June 2021,"A Quiet Place Part 1 is one of my favorite films in the recent years as it had a unique concept, excellent production and most importantly an emotional story that made me care for the characters. A Quiet Place Part II skillfully manages to retain the high quality production value while elevating the intensity level. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to it's predecessor due to the lack of that freshness of the idea and the emotional aspect that made the original so memorable.The story picks up right after the ending of Part 1 as the family tries to make it to safety but their plans are swiftly derailed by a series of unfortunate events. Things get intense very early and the monsters are a lot more deadly and mobile in this film. What's more, the tension feels real in this movie due to exceptional use of sound. The music was atmospheric but occasionally, it took away from that sweet quietness that I was expecting.Honestly, I wasn't happy when they announced a sequel but I have to admit that John Krasinski has managed to create an interesting story that not only kept me engaged, but also planted seeds for future movies. If you enjoyed Part 1, then certainly check this out as all the elements of the original like cinematography, sound and effects are here with the exception of that emotional touch. Watching this movie in the cinema is definitely going to elevate the atmosphere and if you can manage to find an empty theater, then you will experience the movie's full potential.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Shows.",A Quiet Place Part II

218,philthegreatone-786-63058,A Quiet Place Part II,9,8 June 2021,The film has a flashback at the beginning to show when the monsters first appear. You see the father Lee and Evelyn played by Emily Blunt with the family. Then we go to where the first film finished and pick up there. The father is gone and the family have to move on and move out from their home. The tension building in this film is so great and keep you on the edge of your seat. Reagan the young daughter has a more central role in this film and the young deaf actress does a great job. Cillian Murphy takes over as the male lead as a family friend who helps the Abbott family stay safe from the monsters. I really enjoyed the quiet scenes in the film (excuse the pun). The action scenes were really great and the score was beautifully done. I think John Krasinski did a great job directing this film and has created I think a new kind of horror film. He has real potential as a director. I really got involved in this film and enjoyed the theatre going experience. I highly recommend this film.,A Quiet Place Part II
219,gk303007,Repetitive,5,2 August 2021,"I read the highest rated reviews, and even the most helpful; and i find in every one of them the same complaint, if any: why the heck did that or this character made that mistake. True, absolutely, and I second those thoughts.But what I feel is a little different though. When i categorise horror/slasher/thriller movies like this, I feel the scenario is either self originated or induced. In this movie, it was induced. And that's why, we see the lame character display. Wouldn't creators be thinking of what we are? Or what if they knew and therefore, the thrill induced after originating that dumb idea held more strength.For example, the deaf girl taking her own journey to go to that island. A dumb idea, but i felt that the situation in which she fell did hold my nerves. I mean, the suspense was enough to give you goosebumps.And that's when i also didn't like the idea, because that's what a B-horror/slasher movie creators do: they trick into a situation through a dumb/silly/non-nonsensical act. Did i expect that from this movie creators: NO!When the bear trap held the boy's leg, i somewhat got a vague idea what should have happened next. But the delay of aliens to relinquish this mistake as to capture their trap was stupid. Remember in the first part? The youngest kid fell trap much soon as soon as the toy created the buzz. Then why didn't the same happen now? I mean, he shouted like anything, and yet aliens took time to come! Oh, maybe they were having lunch (LOL).Like the first part, many silly yet questions remain the same? What about when a kid/adult fart, snore, or get a hiccup, or wail due to some reason, where were the aliens that time? Or am I missing something still?I expected more, but came out the same mediocre thriller.",A Quiet Place Part II

and mother, of course.. always crying and with the power of being female.. just cries a bit more and other said nondescript male guy to fetch her daughter and dude just goes for it.. one would think he wouldn't care.. they haven't seen each other in a while so I why should he risk his life to get the girl that isn't even his own?

Evolved Jim from The Office and team make an entertaining second effort with several intense sequences, particularly the opening one, good-great performances across the board, especially with the addition of Cillian Murphy (one of my favourite contemporary actors), while also maintaining the QUIET aspect of this universe.However, the novelty does wear off and there is a lull in the middle of the movie that does get too slow. Also, in order to further the plot, the QUIET aspect, which was so heavily emphasized in the first one had to be tapered off a bit where even the sound mixing had to be tricky to sell the fact that they are making little to zero sound even though the objects they are interacting with would be making a lot more. It was annoying at times but I understand because gotta have a sequel. The character and emotional aspect was also not as strong and could have been developed more but what was there was still strong enough to elicit an emotional response to a strong enough degree at crucial moments.Overall, it's an entertaining ride.

226,bastille-852-731547,Tense and powerful horror sequel,7,28 May 2021,"Three years ago, John Krasinski's ""A Quiet Place"" stunned audiences through its meticulous abilities to generate genuine suspense and fear through something as simple as the (mostly) lack of sound. The movie was set in a post-apocalyptic world, but its stakes still felt primal, and the performances felt raw and real. While not perfect, I'm happy to say that this sequel, which was delayed by 14 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is still an effectively visceral treat for those who enjoy being on the edge of their seats for an hour and a half.After an eerily relevant prologue, the story shifts to Emily Blunt and her two children looking for human survivors in the area. In the meantime, they encounter plenty of hair-raising situations away and ongoing threats to their survival from those lurking monsters. Cillian Murphy joins the cast, giving a strong performance as a cynical survivor who intersects with Emily Blunt's character and her children. Just like in the first movie, the editing and craftsmanship of the suspenseful scenes is riveting. Every sound detail is clearly tailor-made for maximum impact on viewers absorbing the film's suspense and terror in a theatrical setting. Krasinski's production design of a post-apocalyptic wasteland is clearly detailed and often startling. This film clearly builds upon the world of the first film. The scope is bigger, and the scale of the suspenseful sequences feels larger and more kinetic. Yet it is certainly no less effective. Even though there is relatively minimal dialogue, the emotional impact of the acting is still striking. Blunt's performance shows a clear range and a resonant desire to protect her children in spite of the terrors in the outside world. Millicent Simmond's performance as her daughter, who is deaf and communicates using American Sign Language, is also outstanding. She gets far more screen time and her character is even better developed than in the first film. You truly feel a clear sense of trust in the main characters as they try to make sense of the monster-devastated world they are living in.My only main criticism about the movie is that the attempts to simultaneously set up dual narratives in the second act can sometimes feel a bit disjointed. It can make the storytelling a bit less tight, taut, and cohesive than the first film, which found simplicity in its superbly effective narrative devices. For me, the comparative tightness of the first act and the third act's structures were more impactful. That said, Krasinski's direction and ability to create a memorable genre film experience worth seeing on the big screen both remain very strong. Recommended. 7.5/10.",A Quiet Place Part II

For some reason, the mostly annoying children become the focal point, and the result is a collapse under their general inability to act. Yes, the boy is good at looking ""freaked out"", too bad that's his expression 90% of his screen time.The story itself doesn't go much of anywhere, other than extended ""Day 1"" sequence that probably should have just been the 1st half of the film, instead of 10 minutes.Just like film 1, characters do bizarrely strange things, like completely split up 1/2 way through with zero communication about what they were doing, and that just becomes the rest of the plot. Okay?Also, why did the ""sea pirate evil doer"" (or whatever) group have literally dozens of boats at their disposal but never think to visit the very closest island to them once since it all began? The friendly survivors were like a 20 minute boat ride away.Anyway, weird film. Why do these get such high praise, again?",A Quiet Place Part II
240,rudygerst,As bad as the first one,2,11 July 2021,"Maybe worst. Characters are still horribly stupid in every decision they make. No storyline. Forced contrivances.

243,silicontourist,Its Not Varied Enough To Warrant Having Been Made!,5,14 September 2021,The story line of the original film is really good and the actors brought together for it made it work great too. Unfortunately in this second offering we are not given any real variation and new bits to hold much interest in your viewing it. They could have just taken 40 minutes to 1 hour of it and had it in the first film; we would not have had repeated scenarios etc. Its still nail biting terror but not so much as it was in the first because you had already felt the terror when you watched the first film.I think they should have spent a lot more film time on the creatures (they were great designs and visually scary as hell) themselves so as to fill in all the answers to what people were wanting to know!Why were they always barefoot when it would have been safe for them to wear athletic footwear?,A Quiet Place Part II

245,therealjaysmoke,Nothing new here!,7,30 June 2021,"There was nothing really new in this sequel. I felt like this was just the director putting together the deleted scenes from the first movie. I was really expecting a lot more than this. From the beginning, you'd think the director was taking us back in time to before the whole invasion started, which would have been awesome. Tell the same story from many different angles and then arrive at this same family. But nuuh that wasn't what this was about. Instead we are taken on another rollercoaster ride, watching as these same family run from these creatures, even though they have a weapon that can destroy it. It wasn't until the very end of the movie did they figured out a way to amplify the soundwave and kill these creatures. Very few scary scenes since you know the main characters ain't dying anytime soon. But definitely looking forward to the third part. Hopefully by then, the story has developed so much more. Amazing cinematography as usual. Acting was on point on all levels. And I loved the part where the boys (white and black) were hidden in the closet. It felt like that was the last of mankind and they had to represent it well. Great job by the team.",A Quiet Place Part II

After an intense opening and a solid first act, it begins to drag a bit in act 2. When the twist arrives later in act 2, it feels all too familiar. Anyone who has watched the Walking Dead has seen this many times. A Quiet Place Part Two is well directed, well acted, and is well paced. That goes a long way toward overcoming the ""been there, seen that"" feeling that keeps nagging. Unfortunately it can't totally overcome it.",A Quiet Place Part II
247,theredsky,A Quiet Place Part II Review,6,20 June 2021,"I feel almost exactly the same about this one as I do the first. I would probably say the first film is slightly better than this. John Krasinski feels more comfortable behind the director and writers seat now because both have improved. The writing still isn't fantastic but it's slightly better than last time. However, Krasinski still fell into the trap of characters putting themselves into unnecessary danger but it felt worse this time. There is a train car scene with one of the main characters that serves no other purpose to the story than to put one of the characters in danger. At least in the first film there was a reason. Some of the decisions the island group characters make are really stupid to me and that island scene has a MASSIVE plot convenience involving a boat. The story this time took a two pronged approach with two plots going on at the same time and I appreciated it although was one was better than the other. The story following Cillain Murphy and Millicent Simmonds was much better than Emily Blunt's. Every time we cut back to her character, the story came to a halt because her story really had nothing to do with the overall story. There was definitely a lot I liked though. Millicent Simmond's performance has improved between the films greatly and Cillian Murphy was the best part of the movie. Krasinski did an excellent job relating him to the characters and incorporating him into the story. Emily Blunt did a good job as well. There is an action set piece flashback at the beginning that does a great job with tension and overall camerawork that I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. All of the other action was creative especially the boat dock scene. I did like that the story got out more and focused on the rest of the world. A Quiet Place Part II went in the right direction story wise even if the film is still pretty mediocre. If you saw and liked the first one then check this out.",A Quiet Place Part II

Spectacular from every point of view, both from the actors' point of view, both from the photographic point of view, and the precise and set direction of John Krasinski. A Quiet Place is singular and one of a kind because it brings to life the concept of terror and survival like no film has done so far and at every frame it enchants and puts suspense, a film that ends with the kite in your mouth, so much so that you ask for another big bite.",A Quiet Place Part II
250,pritol,Worthy Sequel...,8,12 June 2021,"The first film was a masterpiece, reinvigorating the horror genre and creating a dystopian future which in tone was a lot more similar to ""The Last of Us"" gaming franchise, than anything in the horror movie genre which had come before.The ability to maintain agonising tension is once again brilliantly executed. The film isn't as linear though, and although the same family are at the core, they are at times split apart which leads to moments where they are all in danger...very edge of your seat stuff!Like all good sequels should, it expands the world within which it's set. Meeting some new characters and expanding the geography, where they roam, however it does this in a very natural way without feeling forced.The ending is very satisfying but at the same time it clearly leaves it open for a third instalment in the series.

251,chi_town_fed,Even worse than the first one,5,24 July 2021,"I waited until I could watch this for free on Paramount streaming. I did so because the first movie was just as boring and filled with plot holes. The reason I watch a movie containing aliens is to see the aliens versus faux suspense leading up to a cup falling off of a table.Moreover, I'm still amazed at how no one on Earth including scientists at MIT and the military (on the entire planet mind you) considered using sound as a weapon against creatures with hypersensitive hearing. This is the first thing that came to my mind. A simple dog whistle might make their heads explode.As with the first film, fast forward allowed me to survive this extremely slow paced garbage. Also, Hollywood's disdain for black men shines bright in this movie. If you watch it you'll understand.I suspect some reviews are biased in favor of the death girl. I treat everyone equally. Thus, having a disability does not make me judge you any differently than anyone else. Why? Because I respect individuals with disabilities just as much as I respect anyone else.

Part 1 was slow, but it managed to stay interesting and entertaining at the same time. Maybe it's because in part 1, the whole premise was new. Maybe now I know it inside-out, it's lost it's appeal. There was hardly any tension, nothing felt like it was at stake.

The question is did they massacre a town or did they take over the world?The way they learned how to stay silent felt underdeveloped, especially on the first day. I know the first movie was smart. They had everything prepared on staying quiet. However how can you control chaos and fear especially when you met these creatures for the first time? We had screaming, phones ringing, car's engines starting, breaking windows, and so on. We had No military involvement, just focusing on the family and Cillian Murphy.I felt unease throughout the film. Especially when the family had to simply get something.

The acting and directing were great, and the story was pretty good for a sequel as well. The main problem for me was that the tension and atmosphere weren't nearly as strong this time around. It started out great but as the story went along it lost that intensity. Several plot holes and some ridiculous choices by certain characters took away from the tension for me. The boy (Marcus) obviously had PTSD and was nearly paralyzed with fear, but at times it was hard to sympathize with his hysteria and irrational mistakes. In the first movie I remember being on the edge of my seat and the theater was so still and quiet that I didn't want to move or even eat my popcorn, but for this second installation, although there were some great ""jump scare"" and tense moments, it just didn't have the same potency as the first.

ACTION!",5,15 July 2021,"Surprisingly, I found myself getting bored and nodding off a few times, which is not what I was expecting with a concept as compelling as this.Even so, I enjoyed the way the production team ramped up the tension and gave the aliens greater presence and physical threat than in the original, but this also meant the film lacked mystique and instead relied on jump scares to grab our attention, followed by alien attacks and bursting action.What I really wanted to see was how a group of people could survive and make it work in such a damning situation, but I found myself questioning plausibility all the time. What do they eat, especially the baby, how do they get unlimited candles to burn, how does the boy sleep at night after such a horrific wound and where do they go for bathroom duties in the middle of the night, etc.; just practical questions that didn't make any sense.Life would be unbearable in such a situation as this, so I would expect more justification and soul-searching between characters to make us understand how they get through their plight as a unit, but the movie decided to go very slow and then very fast, which made for pacing problems between all the whispering to keep the noise down, which meant there was little character development and hardly any interesting dialogue.Not a total dud and definitely entertaining in places, but the shush-whispering becomes very tiresome after a while, knowing it all leads up to another rinse and repeat life-threatening scenario while chased by the baddies.",A Quiet Place Part II

As I wrote in my review of the first film I've completely bought into the world of the film and I love the USP of it.When I saw John Krasinki was in the film I thought he'd somehow survived the creature attack and was very very saddened when I realised quite early on this wasn't the case.I love the intro where it was a flashback and we saw when the creatures first landed.Cillian Murphy a superb addition and I feel like he is very different in this to usual roles. Dijimon Hounsou also a big name addition. I realised I'd seen Noah Jupe in 'the undoing' and was very impressed with the deaf in real life (I didn't know!) Millicent Simmonds.More jumpy than the first film and the creatures are very loud!The run time was a little short however and we'd already found out how to kill the creatures in the first and this film didn't really add much apart from them leaving their home.I feel like this series has not finished, this was a bit of a filler film and there will be a trilogy where it all gets resolved!

It's literally just the same movie as the first one. Same beats, same jump scares, it even has an almost identical ending. A Quiet Place had some solid acting and tension that carried it despite the monsters being somewhat generic and one note. It irritated me in the first one that monsters don't actually appear to eat anything or serve any purpose other than to chase humans and throw them around. It worked the first time, but the second movie doesn't evolve the story in any meaningful way or add any nuisance. The family gets chased around some more, the frequency turns out to hurt monsters again. It's wasn't terrible, but I was mildly bored through the whole thing.

And going alone on a journey leaving her mates behind? And how can she even know how to use a piece of hearing aid to generate a sound out of nothingness to scare off and freeze an alien? It's kind of ridiculous when you think about these. Also if the aliens are only sound driven, they could be easily disposed of, just setup tripwires around the house that generates sounds at a distance that drove them off once its set off, or setup ground traps to lure them in. The story is also somewhat predictable, maybe after watching too much movies, and though my memory is a bit vague I remember the first movie was better.",A Quiet Place Part II
271,tresm87,"A tremendous sequel that offers all the aspects that made the first such a surprise hit, with even more relentless chaos and creature feature action.",9,26 May 2021,"A Quiet Place was a massive surprise hit with brilliant concepts and creativity unseen or unheard in any film before. Some might think it was lightning in a bottle that can't be expanded on. Well this sequel might be even better than the first somehow. They upped the ante across the board with insane intensity, larger set pieces, and just overall absolute action/thrills.The formula is similar but adds a few more characters to give it some more depth. Cillian Murphy's addition to the story is monumental and he once again shows he's one of the most underrated actors around. Almost harkens back to his post apocalyptic days in 28 Days later. The returning characters are just as great and Emily Blunt gets to shine once again. Krasinski proves once again his prowess in directing and writing is immaculate which is surprising seeing how he's really just getting started in that realm of his career.The array of new settings add a ton to the overall film's atmosphere and they utilize some clever spots to accelerate the action and fear. Once again my favorite aspects are the alien creatures and their vicious designs. They're just as frightening and potentially even more bloodthirsty this time around. The cgi used to portray them is marvelously realistic. The use of sonic tension and innovative ideas with various sounds continues to be something that's so satisfying from this franchise.I will honestly say that this is one of the best sequels to come out recently and maybe of all time.

274,BeanieCore,A merely decent sequel.,6,23 October 2021,"The original ""A Quiet Place"" was one of my favorite horror films of the 2010's decade. A potent mixture of searing Hitchcockian suspense and sincere emotive story-telling, with a focus on small-scale, intimate horror, rather than being needlessly complex. It was the story of one family's fight for survival. A welcome change from the ""worldwide"" focus of many alien invasion/monster films. So needless to say, I had reasonably high hopes for the sequel. Especially with John Krasinski returning to the director's seat. Sadly, while this is not a bad effort, it's in no way comparable to the heights that the first film accomplished.While the small-scale focus of the original film was a strength, here it's a hindrance. Mostly because Krasinski can't seem to find anywhere to take the film's plot. This is mostly a re-hash, with certain moments, particularly the ending, being almost identical to the 2018 original. The script does attempt to expand the world of the films, by showing a few enclaves of survivors. But these parts of the film are incredibly derivative of countless other post-apocalyptic pictures, and bring nothing new to the table. Nor do these moments have much effect on the narrative of the film. Whereas the original felt incredibly personal in it's scope, this one simply feels a bit empty. It's a good thing then, that despite it's disappointing narrative, the film's moments of tension and fright keep it moving along.Krasinski remains fiercely adept at directing scenes of almost unbearable suspense. There are several moments here, in which the film cuts back and forth between multiple disasters as they unfold. The effect is suitably intense, and the cast is still exceptional enough that dramatic weight is lent to those moments. Millicent Simons takes center stage here, and despite her limited experience and young age, she continues to give an incredibly heartfelt and layered performance. Meanwhile, Emily Blunt retains the perfect balance between grace, vulnerability and strength that she juggled in the original. Cillian Murphy is his likeable self as the newest character, and lends an air of dignity to a somewhat cliched character. All together, the tightly effective suspense, smooth direction and quality acting keep this sequel from mediocracy. But it's still a disappointment when weighed against it's predecessor.",A Quiet Place Part II
275,boris_unanimate,A Very Mediocre Place,5,25 July 2021,"Except for 2 good fake scares, a few moments of suspense and action, and maybe 2 laughs, this movie was just too uneventful and too full of plotholes to be enjoyable at all. You can't simply shut off your brain when the movie mistakes keep stabbing you in the eye and then coming up with new asinine ideas.Add to that the terrible sound design, which simply tuned down everything except the awful score, and idiotic characters, and you got yourself a boring ""horror"" movie.

278,matrixdukenukem,Ssssshhh ... Stop with the cribbing,8,2 July 2021,"After A quiet place, I didn't think we would get a sequel even though it was open ended. I thought the novelty of this concept would be gone, specially after we saw many more releases like Bird Box trying different take on this concept. But if Don't Breathe was getting a sequel, I thought why not.What this movie loses in novelty, it makes up in more action, monsters and gives us a backstory this time. There is not much of a world building except that there are more survivors and not everyone is friendly. This time Millicent Simmonds and Emily Blunt take front seat instead of John Krasinski and the infant is paired with Noah Cyrus. Cillian Murphy is also there as a pathfinder or helper. Millicent is a terrific young actress. She stands tall as Emily at her opposite. I didn't think Cillian had such pivotal role here and he does fantastic job. Noah is given more to do and he gives an amazing performance most of the time.The tension is still there, this time the monsters are more visible and in bigger numbers. People are complaining about some choices some characters make as if they're survival experts or human behaviour specialists. I thought everything was logical and believable. I had so much fun watching this at home. I wish I could see this in a well mannered theatre. Also yes always great to see John on screen. Even if it was for a short time.Djimon hounsou was wasted though and I don't know why and how they figured to stay quiet in the first scene at the restaurant.

279,tiskec,Very Awesome- Only One Issue**,7,12 September 2021,"The movie continued right where it left off. This was great because in my opinion: that's the only way a sequel will match up to the original, unless it's an anthology of some sort. I like how the beginning also gave us a rewind of the times precedent to both..Just like the original, the acting was awesome, the setting was great and the cinematography was satisfying. This movies fundamentals were all intact and were executed well.The one issue that I have with this film was towards the end of the story when the deaf girl and guy ran into a bunch of bandit cult members by the marina. After the two escape the bandits by making noise to attract the monsters, they discover that the monsters can't swim. When they make it to the island they've been trying to get to, they discover a civilization of people that have been there for some time. When the guy that was with the deaf girl wanders down to the river, he finds a boat that he recognized from the marina. That would mean the boat would've had happened to float in just the right direction across a vast body of water, and just happen to land in an inlet river to the island, in the back. The boat would've had to do this with a monster that's attracted to sound and has no vision aboard. This is very highly unlikely. The possibility of this happening would be like one in a trillion. There's no way.Other than that one illogical stance I have, the movie was awesome, emotional, and suspenseful. I would've easily given the movie an eight if not for that one issue. Hopefully the editor or director screens for common sense a little better next time. They could easily make a nine rate with a little better logical premise.I would definitely recommend this movie to friends and family. It's very suspenseful and emotional. Great to watch with a group or a +1. Rated 7/10.",A Quiet Place Part II

Stupid characters, doing things that they wouldn't at the first movie (for being unnecessary risk), nothing new to the plot, and a feeling of something unfinished at the end. Also, the first part of the movie doesn't seem to connect to rest of it, totally unnecessary (Funny thing is that this is the best part of everything).",A Quiet Place Part II

284,Harry_Gleeson,These Films are made for the Cinema,9,11 June 2021,"Overall, I thought A Quiet Place Part II was a very strong and witty sequel to its predecessor. It had all the intensity and drama that the first film offered and still left me wanting more at the end. I have no doubt that a part III will arrive in the future and that will culminate the journey of these film to it's end. Writer and Director and essentially creator of these films, John Krasinski deserves huge praise for building this unique 'monster world' and making two original, but brilliant, horror/thriller films.Emily Blunt and Cillian Murphy both bring their class to this film, especially the latter who is prominent throughout most of the film. Both have incredible range as actors. But I thought the younger actors, Noah Jupe (Marcus) and Millicent Simmonds (Regan) both have amazing performances here. Millicent Simmonds, who is deaf in real-life, shows her unique talents and Krasinski did a really smart job in showing the audience how her character views the world that's unraveling in front of her as a deaf person.As I say I thought the film was extremely thrilling and had such an energy to it throughout. It never stopped. The pace was consistent all the way through and that was something I loved about it, one part wasn't better than the other, I loved the film from start to finish.If I had to pick at it, the only fault I had was that I felt maybe in some parts the film became typically a little too dramatic in its writing choices, but as I say there were no obvious negatives.I loved A Quiet Place Part II, it's a film that's meant to be seen in a cinema, the experience adds so much moreOh and the soundtrack!Quote - 'The people that are left, their not the kind of people worth saving' - EmmettRating - 4/5.",A Quiet Place Part II

286,garethvk,A Quiet Place Part II Sets The Tension To Max And Improves Upon The Original,9,26 May 2021,"Last year we had a screening for ""A Quiet Place Part II"" scheduled and eagerly awaited the follow-up to the suspenseful and popular original film. Sadly we all know what happened soon after as a two-week lockdown grew and cinemas around the world were closed.As cinemas re-open with growing but limited capacity; the film is set for release and will be a great indicator as to if the public is ready to return to cinemas in significant numbers or will they sit it out and opt to see the film down the line on Paramount+.The film opens with a look at the day things changed for the world as Lee (John Krasinski); does some shopping while news reports come in of an explosion in Shanghai. Enjoying the weather; he joins his family at a Little League game and talks with his friend Emmett (Cillian Murphy) when the game is interrupted by the appearance of a large fireball in the sky.As they head home; the city falls under attack by deadly creatures and Lee and his family narrowly escape. The film then jumps forward immediately following the conclusion of the first film and Evelyn (Emily Blunt); attempts to lead her newborn son, daughter Regan ( Millicent Simmons), and son Marcus (Noah Jupe) to a safer locale.When Marcus is injured along the way; Evelyn takes refuge with Emmett who is not happy to have to care for others after the loss of his wife and despite a secure locale in a foundry; demands the family leave the following day.When an unexpected radio signal appears; Regan is determined to leave and find the source as she knows the frequency of her Cochlear Implant is a weapon against the creatures and she figures if that can be broadcasted and the information revealed; then humanity has a chance to fight back and win.What follows is a very gripping and intense story as Regan and Emmett attempt to complete the mission while Evelyn and her family endure all manner of threats as they try to survive.The film builds upon what made the first film so great in that there are strong and relatable characters and some very tense situations. The screening we attended was so quiet you could tell that audience members were so enthralled that they were afraid to make any noise.The film ups the action and expands upon the universe without losing any of the strong character-driven elements or relying too much upon CGI to carry the film.John Krasinski writes, directed, and produced the film, and while he has less screen time than he did in the original; the film is the rare sequel that holds its own and actually improves upon the original.My only issue with the film was that the ending was rather abrupt and left me with several unanswered questions. While this would be more than fine if we were assured of a third film to resolve unanswered elements; word is that a spin-off is in development so hopefully this will resolve the issues I had or at the least co-exist with a third part of the series.For now; ""A Quiet Place Part II"" drives home why we need the cinematic experience as from the large screen to the Dolby Atmos sound; the film is a sensory experience that needs to be enjoyed in a communal setting with maximum sensory input.The film sets the tension meter to the max and never disappoints and I urge you to experience this film the way it was intended.4.5 stars out of 5.",A Quiet Place Part II

What an attitude - she needed a proper bestimg from the father or mother. Plus why does she look like a 50 year old.

293,levybob,A Big Letdown,3,3 June 2021,"I am rooting for the movies. Rooting that they will return to cinemas and draw lots of fans and make lots of money. And so my hopes, regarding this sequel, were high.Also, they were dashed.Here's why.1. The film's beginning, a too-long flashback to the aliens' arrival on earth, accomplishes next to nothing. Yes a new character is introduced, but the time devoted to this flashback could better be used to reacquaint the audience with the aliens' vulnerabilities (water + sound-sensitivity).2. The notion of quiet / silence, the fact that any noise whatsoever will amount to a death sentence for earthlings, that basic construct is nowhere near as impactful here as it was in the original.3. A hoped-for big scene featuring the aliens and some ruthless survivors is so dark, and shot from so far away, it has no dramatic effect. I could not have cared less.4. The kids. Again the kids save the day. And why? Because the producers want the film to appeal to young people. And there is nothing wrong in that. If only the mother - Emily Blunt - had as large a role here as she did in the original. The film's new character, admittedly an adult, is someone we don't really know. And so his fate is not as compelling as was 'the father's' in Part One.5. Nothing is resolved. My way of saying, 'Here comes Part Three'.Anyway, that's my take.But if, despite this, you go to see the film, I'll be happy.Like I said, I'm rooting.",A Quiet Place Part II
294,ryanpersaud-59415,Solid Summer Blockbuster,7,3 July 2021,"The Good: After a year of bad Netflix movies in the living room, this movie's cinematic, epic feel was noteworthy. It's such a tightly made film with fantastic set pieces. I actually think a lot of the performances were excellent, especially from the child actors. The world is expanded upon, but it never loses sight of its claustrophobic thriller personality.The Bad: I think it's fair to describe this movie as such: I wouldn't really want to watch it again, but if it was on TV, I'd probably watch it. It's solid, if unspectacular. Not rocking the boat much, but perfectly fine. I do wish they spent a little more time with the family, pre blind monster invasion.The Ugly: I think this movie, with less of the deafness gimmick to work with, loses a bit of what made the original special as well.",A Quiet Place Part II
295,Benslie,Still has the same heart as the first one,9,23 June 2021,"One of the things that I feel like everybody enjoyed about the first movie was the acting and this movie still has some outstanding acting in it. Emily Blunt, who plays Evelyn Abbott, and Millicent Simmonds, who plays Regan Abbott, still kill it as their characters and bring so much emotion to this movie. Every time you see them on the screen you know you're going to feel something. But, the real stand out for me in this movie was Cillian Murphy, who plays Emmett. I honestly did not expect much out of him in this movie but he brought so much heart to this character. When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was nervous about seeing the creatures in the daylight and thinking they wouldn't be as scary or look stupid but honestly, I take it back because seeing them in the daylight makes them so much scarier. On the topic of scares, I will say that this movie definitely got me with some of the jump scares in it. This movie is definitely more of a horror movie than the first which was more of a drama. I also want to applaud Marco Beltrami who composed the music for this movie because it helped intense certain scenes and make you feel something as well. I will say that I did at times wish the music would cut out so it was just silence to help the suspense of the scene. The cinematography in this movie was amazing and I loved it. The one thing I will complain about is that I wish the story was more focused. I love the first movie because it just focused on the Abbott family and how they were surviving in this world while this one had two different plots going on at the same time. Overall, A Quiet Place Part 2 still has the same heart as the first movie and took what was great about the first movie and improved on it.",A Quiet Place Part II
296,and_shove_it_up_your_butt,First movie was exceptional. This one not on the same level.,6,29 July 2021,"And I understand because it's hard to make a prequel or sequel on the same level as the first. A Quiet Place was *chefs kiss* almost perfection. And what I loved about it was how quiet it was. I mean, when we saw it in theatres you could hear a mouse peeing on a cotton ball. Part two was loud. Like a ton of sound and It was jarring compared to the first. Almost like I was watching a different movie.What really made no sense out of some seriously nonsensical scenes and mishaps is how the one demogorgon (come on, that's pretty much what they look like) ended up aaaaalllll the way across the water to the island. Are they now driving boats? Make it make sense.Classic ""Jim"" face made an appearance in the scene where they were hiding in the restaurant. Half a star for that alone.Overall I enjoy the franchise but it needs to end here. They are going to ruin part to three if it's more of the same of part two.",A Quiet Place Part II
297,mmuggi,"More of the same, bigger scale",7,26 September 2021,"A quiet place part II continues in the same direction as the first film. The scope is a bit bigger, without actually using much of that scope, but the budget in this film has also tripled. I think the first sequence and the extra expense of more actors have required the extra budget. The film could explore a lot more because we have no idea why the aliens are coming to Earth, as it does not seem that they have an agenda. In fact, it seems that they have not had enough time to take advantage of the opportunities that a sequel provides. The fear of a threesome is that they dilute the otherwise fresh concept that the first film was back in 2018.",A Quiet Place Part II
298,Master_Strange,Almost as good as the first one,10,29 June 2021,"Performances- Emily Blunt is fascinating in this film. She is one of the best aspects of this entire movie. This movie knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat literally and how to make your heart pound non-stop. Nevertheless, it made me satisfied to see these characters get the ending they deserve. Even though they are fictional, the love they have for eachother is very much real to me. Every pain they endured my heart had to endure too. A Quiet Place Part Two is an amazing movie. It's fresh, intense and is a worthy sequel almost as good as the first one. Although the ending seemed a bit rushed up for me, I don't really have that many flaws with this movie. I highly recommend this film to you.",A Quiet Place Part II

It's wonderful to see these characters in more depth and detail. I trust there will be a part three, and if so, I hope we will be able to learn a little more about why these terrifying creatures came to Earth. Is there a higher purpose to their deadly mission (i.e. Colonization) or did they just accidentally stumble upon a ""Global Denny's All You Can Eat Open 24/7?""

The story is not all that great and like a lot of people said it was a rehashing of the first movie. The only thing I really gripped about was that she had a baby...get real why would you bring a little baby into the world when you can't make a sound.

301,jackson_ro,A Quiet Place Part II,7,26 July 2021,"Surprisingly a part II that picks up the mantle from the first and out performs the first. Yes, character motives are still questionable, but we get to see much better character development as the focus turns from the parents to their kids. The family being on the run also opens up the world of A Quiet Place. Nevertheless, the film is about never-ending suspense and the film delivers that in a bountiful. Though the silent can be suffocating at times, the film is just short enough to not be annoying. Would have liked the script to tell more of the side stories involving Emmet's family and the come to be of the dock people, but maybe we'll learn more in the next entry. Its quite annoying to see these film never really ends in a satisfying way, leaving the door for more entries whether we want it or not.",A Quiet Place Part II

It effectively holds a torch to the first installment and builds off all the amazing visual effects from the first and continues to the sequel. It's certainly controlled chaos if I ever saw it. I will say the first ten minutes of backstory totally fuels the excitement for viewers myself included, I really hope the plan for the third film is to continue this backstory. I really felt like John Krasinski's role in the first film gave it real magic and was lacking here a bit, but with the addition of Cillian Murphy was genius and was an appropriate substitution in my opinion.

303,ThomDerd,Nicely predictable.,7,4 July 2021,"Although AQPII is not bad, it does look like an attempt to cash in. There's a few problems with it and most of them are in the storyline. Here is an overall difference with the first film:In the first one, there was a clear storyline, almost no plot holes, novelty and the right amount of tension.In part 2 however , you kind of know exactly what is about to happen and that lessens the film experience.For example, the tropes used in this film, are all the classics. Yes, they were used in the 1st film too, but at least then they were timed and deployed better, so the tension was nicely built and a sense of unpredictability was evident.Now in part 2, I have a feeling that the story was a bit of a stretch. Also, the motives of the protagonists were at times unjustified, just to push the story forward.So the story ends up with flaws, which disappoint mostly because of the predictability and the too many cliches. I would want to mention a few which I m sure many noticed but better not to spoil it. You will know once you see.Also, it's not as quiet as the first film. Sound editing is great also in this one, but maybe there were more speech moments than needed.Overall, the good parts: tension is there, cinematography is beautiful once again and we get to see some good acting.I do hope that there's a part 3 and I hope they improve the story.6,9/10.",A Quiet Place Part II
304,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,"A tense, carefully-crafted sequel",8,21 June 2021,"A Quiet Place Part II is an intelligent, intense sequel to the 2018 horror hit. It is carefully-crafted and expands on the strengths of the first film, delivering the nail-biting thrills and progressing the story of the Abbots onwards satisfyingly, leaving more to be desired.John Krasinki directs with an uncanny amount of audience awareness as if he snuck into theaters across America note-taking everything that worked in the first film. As writer and director, he is in tune with what the audience likes, their expectations and carefully uses all that knowledge to tell the story.The sequel's opening sequence subtly recaps the first film by revisiting certain locations of the Abbot home, which I desperately needed because I had forgotten all the plot details of the first Quiet Place. Seeing the empty locations instantly jolted my memory. The director knowing exactly where my mindset was put me in instant ease and I knew I was good in the hands of John Krasinski's direction. That is fairly consistent throughout this sequel.The central gimmick of keeping complete silence still plays effectively and infectiously keeps everyone in the theaters silent and on high alert. At my screening, an audience member made a loud unhinged phlegm cough and I laughed inside my mask thinking, ""Hock it back! You're going to get us eaten!""The monsters have become less scary by default. Everyone knows how the monsters work and now, their weaknesses. John Krasinski rolls with this by focusing on character and suspense.The sequel cleverly expands the story by focusing on the Abbott family, more specifically, the two children Regan and Marcus, who are played brilliantly by returning child actors Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe. Hollywood sequel rules would normally dictate that Emily Blunt, the biggest star in the cast, would be the lead character. The script earnestly stays true to the Abbott family's situation; the mother character wouldn't be out and about. I loved where the story went and more importantly, I liked how true the sequel stayed to its own roots.I enjoyed the first film just fine but A Quiet Place Part II pulled me further into this world than I had expected. Now, I feel solidly invested in these characters. It's odd to read that the studio has already greenlit a spin-off film but not yet a third film. I am waiting for the announcement of the third film. The heart of the story is not in the world or the monsters, it's the family.",A Quiet Place Part II
305,WooderIce64,"Decent, but Different",6,14 October 2021,"A sequel to Quiet Place was one of those inevitable ones, especially given the low production budget, surprise box office success, and cliffhanger ending. Part II is a very distinct film from the first, even though it is a direct follow up. What separates Part II from the first movie is that it is the circumstances allow them to communicate much more directly, also giving the characters more personality than they had in the first. The perfect tension in the first movie is eased, making it a more traditional monster/survival movie. While it still does this well, the first movie was unique in its silent tension, while it's much more overt in this film. While it's not bad stuff, it doesn't stand out the way that the first movie does.This one is much more plot oriented. Whereas the first movie is more of a screenshot of life in this post-apocalyptic world, this one has its own distinct story. The family finds themselves in the basement of Emmett, a fellow survivor after leaving their home. Marcus gets injured, and Regan wants to go out and find other survivors without her mother's permission. It follows the same theme of sacrifice as the first, but it doesn't feel as meaningful, for a reason that will be addressed. It also shows what the world was like on the day the aliens arrived, which gives us some insight to the world that was. The acting is generally pretty good, especially for a film where visual cues are much more important than dialogue.One thing must be addressed: the story of this movie is remarkably similar to that of The Last of Us. A defiant teenage girl forms a bond with a jaded, bearded middle-aged widower with a Southern accent as they go on a trip to find survival in a post-apocalyptic world and reach a place where survivors dwell. Sound familiar? There are some lines and scenes that are ripped straight out of Last of Us (notably when Regan brings up Emmett's wife). The Last of Us is getting a TV adaptation, and this movie was similar enough that it felt more like a TLOU adaptation than a sequel to the first Quiet Place movie.",A Quiet Place Part II

That does not take away from how great the acting is in this, everyone is amazing and doing such a great job. The cinematography is fantastic aswell, the single shot sequences are great and there are so many of them and I love it. The effects are great and improved on the first one.

As a voice actor you like to have lines because you are usually paid per word spoken.Occasionally a movie comes along where the script could fit onto one piece of A4, which is great for movie actors who are paid just to be on screen and have are lousy at remembering their lines.The sequel to a ""A Quiet Place"" is such a movie.In QP 2, they open with Day 1 of this horror franchise as just another ordinary day in Smallsville, USA.Except there are hints in Breaking TV News that Houston has a few problems.I liked the reference to the toy in the towns General Store from the original movie in this new release.All hell breaks loose at a Junior League Baseball game that was more Apple Pie than middle America until frickin aliens turned up to spoil the party like they always do.Luckily we didn't have to wait as long to see these freaks from outer space as we did in the first film and cinema goers are exposed to way more Stranger Things type creatures over the next hour.Plus we will discover another weakness these monsters have down on dock of the bay.You are best advised to put logic and commonsense to one side for the duration of this cinematic thrill ride, just like you would for some many other action packed movies.Don't overthink it...it's not academic it's pure entertainment.Being a former Radio man I enjoyed how one of my favourite medias plays a role in ""A Quiet Place 2"" as it often does in lots of sci-fi dramas.However, the Radio Station needs to get a new Music Director because the Bobby Darin song is on too high a rotation, but has a secret message in it which needs decoding.Director, Writer & Star John Krasinski (The Office) created even more atmospheric scenarios in his own sequel...the railway track scene is reminiscent of TV's ""Walking Dead"", but no Zombies were harmed in the making of this movie.In his own words Krasinski was, ""Jedi mind tricked into signing on to the sequel"".Well the force does seem stronger with this one than the first instalment.Parallel nail biting scenes happen simultaneously on the big screen to great effect.Djimon Hounsou makes an appearance, but its Krasinskis real life and screen wife, Emily Blunt, as Evelyn Abbott, who headlines the marquee in this project.""Batman's"" Cillian Murphy is dressed like a dirt farmer not a Scarecrow in a strong supporting role.But for me it's hearing impaired actress Millicent Simmonds who really stands out as the Abbott couples daughter, Regan as she tries to save the day.Ironically this movie about the end of the world as we know it was due to open in March 2020,
You know you've really made it when ""The Exorcist"" Director William Friedkin tweets ""a classic horror film"" and ""cinema is back"".He would like it though when one of the main characters is named Regan...it's a face that'll turn heads.Fun Fact: The first take of the Bus scene from the trailer was used in the final cut for this movie.Silence is not enough...go see it for yourself.",A Quiet Place Part II

I think A Quiet Place Part II was worth the wait. I actually don't know what I've been expecting from it but I think it gave me/us what I/we needed and it's not more than that. I don't think it's better than the first one but it still is a worthy sequel in my opinion. The most captivating thing from the movie must be Noah Jupe's phenomenal acting. He is just great.

311,Pyro_Pizza,Masterly Crafted Sound,9,5 June 2021,"Right off the bat I want to say that the sound design in this movie is amazing! It adds the perfect amount of tension to the story without ever bogging it down. And as sequels go, this is a near perfect one that really builds on the original. My only complaint is that certain elements of the movie are a bit predictable and over foreshadowed, which can ruin some of the tension that the film so perfectly builds up.",A Quiet Place Part II
312,alanhowden-86367,Beautiful but disappointing,5,1 September 2021,"I had really high hopes for this movie after really enjoying the first and ultimately felt quite let down.First the good: The acting was excellent, the direction was great, the film looked amazing and the creature effects were very very good (I thought the budget for the movie was much bigger than it was).The bad: The story. The movie continues directly on from the first and just isn't that interesting. Not a lot happens that's new and what does happen happens very slowly. It also feels like a lot of re-trodden ground from the first film. The film is also very, very quiet. I know this is a feature not a bug but that means what dialogue and story there is really needs to be gripping and it's just not.I kind of feel like this movie was made by some very talented people who weren't aiming very high (certainly not to supersede the first film).",A Quiet Place Part II
313,garethwooduk,Good follow up movie!,8,10 June 2021,"Enjoyed it but first one definitely better, but loved the intro to the back story... I like the progression of the story but just felt the pace lagged a little bit and locations not overly exciting and felt a little stale, but where the first movie was about hiding, remaining silent like Covid lockdown, this movie is about stepping back in the light, after lockdown and with a 'cure' to fight back... So much more to explore, good acting and great cast!",A Quiet Place Part II
314,MovieWarfare,Continues to do what made the first movie great,8,25 July 2021,"A Quiet Place was the most surprising hit in 2018. It gave us something refreshingly new in the horror franchise and it was best of all, a great movie. When a sequel was announced, I wasn't remotely surprised and was also thrilled about it. The premise is ""Following the deadly events at home, the Abbott family must now face the terrors of the outside world as they continue their fight for survival in silence. Forced to venture into the unknown, they quickly realize that the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats that lurk beyond the sand path"". So does the sequel live up to the first movie?Firstly, the returning actors Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe are still great in their roles as the Abbott family. Special praise to Noah as there is a scene where he gets hurt and his acting made it seem like he was in actual pain. Their characters also have great character evolution from the first movie. Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt) goes from the mother in distress to being the one who has to lead their family. Regan Abbott (Millicent Simmond) now embodies the heroism that her father had and is more forward to helping others. Marcus Abbott (Noah Jupe) is an interesting one as he was always a more frightened character in the first movie and part 2 seems to become more fearful due to the loss of his father. He does have an arc in this movie and it is very satisfying to watch him transform. Cillian Murphy is the newest addition and he is great. He is the opposite of Lee Abbott (John Krasinski) as he plays someone who is a hardened survivor who has little hope, but not zero, for the world. Cillian conveys this pained character perfectly and is a great new protagonist for the sequel.Additionally, everything else I loved from the first movie is also here. The tension in each set piece is here, the great sound design is here, the effective use of the music score is here, the use of visual storytelling is here, the emphasis on characters and some great monster action is also here. A Quiet Place Part 2 also has an amazing introduction scene that might be one of the best starts to a movie I've seen in a long time. What this sequel does new is that it starts expanding more of the world-building as we see more of the outside world. I like that we get scenes showing day 1 of when the monsters came and I also like that we get to see more different survivors in this new world.If I do have to force myself for some flaws then one would be that it feels a lot less scary than the first movie. While a lot of the monster action in the first movie was in closed and claustrophobic areas, here it is in more open areas which reduces a lot of the scare. There is also something that happens midway which results in two different storylines and perspectives. One perspective is more story focused and the more interesting one while the other is just there to give the other characters a monster set piece. It results in less plot cohesion compared to the first movie.There is also a problem from the first movie that is still here which is some characters still do dumb things. It's not a typical horror movie dumb decision but it can annoy you a bit. There are also some silly things in the plot if you think about it too hard so you got to suspend your belief a little to enjoy the movie. Another small problem I have is the VERY ABRUPT ending. It felt like there should have been at least 5 more minutes of scenes after to give a more satisfying ending. The first movie had an ending that left it open for a potential sequel but was a complete and satisfying ending that didn't need a sequel. Here the ending is a very blatant sequel hook that 100% warrants a sequel as that was not complete at all.Overall, if you love the first movie then you are definitely going to like part II. Everything that I loved in the first movie is here. While it doesn't do a lot new or better than the 1st, it does the things that made it great in the first place and does it well. While it isn't as great as the first movie, none of the flaws stated take away from the experience. I thoroughly enjoyed A Quiet Place Part II and cannot wait for part 3 or any spinoffs being planned.",A Quiet Place Part II

322,MK_Ultra_,Not bad. Not great either.,5,30 September 2021,"I was a skeptic, especially for a sequel to a fairly well received film.I like that they initiate the backstory element. What comes after is fairly paint by numbers and pedestrian. The creatures seem to have lost their ooomph with me, maybe because you know their ins and outs after the first one, well most of their characteristics anyways. CGI wears on this viewer, though I do appreciate with tasteful and not overdone usage. This film, not unlike the original, ride a fine line with my pet peeve in regards to turning a creature into an animated mess.The characters, the ones still alive anyways---are good, as acting is like most ""good"" portrayals, just not a lot that would warrant sitting through this film twice.Sat through it, and sometimes that's enough to make it watch worthy, which it is. Fairly overrated in my unwanted opinion, but ""decent"" escapism.I did hear they immediately ordered, yet another round, and that's where my skepticism will more than likely be stretched to it's limit. There just isn't enough material to work with, outside of studio pressure to rush another one out while ""the iron is hot""",A Quiet Place Part II

324,pronitmallick,A good enough sequel,7,1 July 2021,A Quiet Place Part II is a movie that starts with it's signature move to put the audience right in the middle of suspense and thrill. Director John Krasinski's style of storytelling will make you stuck in your seat and make you crave for more. Acting performances in the movie don't go down even for a bit. Everyone delivered a stunning performance and shined whenever they got time on the screen. Screenplay of the movie is as good as it can be but somewhere in the middle it gets a little down and things become kinda predictable at a certain point. The pacing of the movie starts and ends on a good note with just a few bumps in the middle. The editing and sound design is always a big highlight for this movie series and it shined in this one also. Overall this movie is a must watch especially in the theatres and everyone will enjoy the balance a mix of suspense of thrill with a good enough story.,A Quiet Place Part II
325,Luv2Spooge,A slight improvement from the 1st,7,4 August 2021,"The first one was so so... The 2nd one was slightly better in the sense it didn't take place in 1 setting and it included more people and more aliens. But other than that, it seemed the story is still cliche, predictable, and just nothing we haven't seen before elsewhere.",A Quiet Place Part II
326,PerryAtTheMovies,The story continues with equal entertainment value....,10,11 June 2021,"Initial Thoughts:
I went in expecting a more sub-par experience compared to ""A Quiet Place"" because of some reviews I read before going in. However, by the end, I was as much enthralled by the experience, if not more. In fact, I can't wait for more....Once again we're given the experience of the quiets are quiet and the louds are loud. Everyone in the theatre knew when to hush, listen, and be still. They also know when it was okay to crunch their popcorn as loud as they would like. It truly made the experience better seeing this movie in theatres. Getting off track though.First to the acting aspect. Millicent Simmonds is a star in this one. Having only seen her act in Part I and II of this series, I think she'll be a star in the future if more directors include the deaf in their films. I absolutely enjoy the immersion of sign language (SL) into the movie and the fact that some characters don't understand SL makes it even better because now you need to find alternative ways to communicate. Cillian Murphy is also a nice addition to this film. There's not a ton of dialogue regarding his character. I just enjoy that he's in this film. Other than dialogue, the sounds of the film are great. Music is key in this one to get the tension building. It's not just about whether a scene is quiet or not. It's whether the there's enough tension built to unleash the next beast and I think it's done perfectly here.Hopefully you're reading this and you've already seen the first film, but if you haven't maybe skip this paragraph..... When we ended in the first film things were on fire and drenched in water. People were dead, or at the very least unaccounted for when we were done. The nice thing about this film is we get to expand beyond the farmhouse and see what others are doing in the outside world. From meeting Emmet (Cillian Murphy) to crazy people to civilized people. This movie is more humanized and expands beyond just the Abbott family.The last thing to kind of touch on is the beasts. Although we get a better understanding of where they came from we still don't know why they attack. As with the first film they just seem to attack sound because it is convenient, but there still seems to be no rhyme or reason. If a third film is created, as seems to be the case, maybe we can get some closure, but for now, the beasts continue to bring the heart racing, and slightly gut wrenching, suspense more than before.Overall:
Acting was great once again. The quiets were quiet and the louds were loud. The inclusion of a deaf actor has continued to enhance the experience of this film. The addition of new characters and groups of people have expanded on the human experience. Although we know how the beasts came to being we still don't know the 'why' to their attacks (other than sound). Personally, I thought this film matches the first one and hopefully a third one is created to give us complete closure.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'Yes, especially if you've seen the first film and enjoyed it'.Enjoy the show!",A Quiet Place Part II

Some events were stretched out a bit much while other things are done with inadequate reasons. Although not a cliffhanger, it did leave it wide open for a third movie. It seems to me that the story drags because the powers that be want a full trilogy. I am OK with a third movie but I would have liked to have seen more development in this movie. It is like they had around 4 plot points and then try to write a script to fill in the rest. That can be a good method but what this movie is filled with, although not bad, doesn't really engage me much. I suspect that this will ultimately be an entertaining but mediocre trilogy but could have been an excellent 2 movie set. New information is teased out. We basically learn a couple of new things, get some new scenery and detailed views of the creatures but basically the first movie with some variations. It kind of ends in a similar way to the first. Since it seems obvious to me that it is being stretched to a trilogy for the money without giving adequate content to justify a trilogy, I will find the cheapest way possible to watch the next part.",A Quiet Place Part II
356,severindringel,A worthy sequel with many flaws,8,10 July 2021,"After the (relatively) open ending and the financial success of the first part, this sequel was only a matter of time. Some have already seen A Quiet Place Part IIin press screenings over a year ago, before the pandemic interfered before the official theatrical release and the film only officially started in cinemas now. Once again directed and written by John Krasinski, the sequel follows the events of the predecessor and offers new tensions, acquaintances and discoveries for the Abbott family.As in the first part, the focus is not on one main character, but all family members get their own storylines and are even more individually directed by Krasinski this time. Emily Blunt is a stunner, as always, and stands up to her sometimes haplessly written character Evelyn (the number of bad decisions is almost unprecedented). Blunt's facial expressions are unique and exude a vulnerability that some actors can only dream of. She is believable in each of her scenes and is able to get everything out of her performance even from less screen time than in the first part. The same goes for Krasinski, who makes a short appearance as family man Lee. He makes quite a bit out of very little and it is mainly his chemistry with Blunt and the family bond where he stands out. With Cillian Murphy in the role of Emmett, a former friend of the Abbotts who joins the family after all these years, Krasinski has made a perfect addition to the cast. He steals every scene and has a surprisingly authentic chemistry with the family's deaf-mute daughter, Regan. Millicent Simmonds has much more freedom this time around and can also provide some highlights. However, her character is again not likeable. Only when she and Murphy share the screen do you feel a little more for her and root for her in tricky situations. Noah Jupe falls short as the second child of the family, the film doesn't really know where it wants to go with him. This is even more extreme with Djimon Hounsou, who makes a cameo appearance at the end. The expansion of the small cast has its light and dark sides. On the one hand, there is Murphy, who visibly does the film well. Introductions of other characters like Hounsou's, however, seem totally superfluous and out of place.The first impact A Quiet Place Part II had on me was the full force of a thriller and first cinema experience in a long time. Suspenseful, adventurous and electrifying - in these elements, the second is quite a bit ahead of the first part. After a few days, however, I had to realise the many weaknesses that the film brings with it. Similar to the first part, despite its short running time, the film runs out of steam a bit at the end and doesn't quite know when to come to an end. The result of this is a rather unsatisfying and predictable ending, which makes another sequel essential, but not really worthwhile. My advice that Krasinski should take screenwriting lessons after the first part was unfortunately not increased either. The weaknesses of the predecessor are almost identical in A Quiet Place Part II, which in the end makes it feel a bit like a copy of the first. Nevertheless, the film is a worthy sequel and celebratory comeback of cinema!",A Quiet Place Part II

What made the first movie great is Krasinski and the 'less you see the scarier it is' mantra which are both absent from this film. Both those omissions are necessary but lessen the sequel greatly.

This sequel was very underwhelming and only flexes the same novelty as the first one only with much less development or pay off. It feels like a bridge to the third film without being too impactful on it's own. There is almost no beginning or end. The characters don't get far, and it drags. I found my eyes dropping heavy from how almost boring it was. Feels like a made for tv movie you could see on SyFy. The first one utilized tension and suspense. This one clearly lacked that depth of tension. Just more of the same. And the ending was totally instantly forgettable. The plot holes were basically so evident that they basically WERE the whole plot. Right off the bat I could only focus on the irritating and glaring plot holes. The plot holes nearly bordered on hypocritical and counterproductive. If there's a third film I will definitely wait until it's free. Fool me twice shame on me. I enjoy the alien creatures, but all we ever see of them is growing stale, we get it, they leap and crawl forward. The ""theme"" is wearing thin here.

I truly thought I was going to love this movie as much as the first film but it wasn't the case. I was more excited to watch the sequel knowing that they were going to show the first time when the aliens hit the Earth. My excitement was towards watching the terror of the people of them not knowing what was happening, it was fantastically done and it could have been a little longer though I was grateful for what they showed. The film started fantastically but it went downhill the moment they decided to push Emily Blunt into the background. This story took the main essence of a video game called The Last Of Us. The storyline is completely different but the main characters were almost the same as strangers bonding and having a purpose to save the world. By having the daughter and a stranger, who was once a friend before all the horror happened, it took one of the things I was looking forward to the most in this sequel. What it took was having a mother and daughter thrilling badass moments. The main thing which made this film for me not being able to watch again was the son, due to what he did just because of boredom or curiosity. It made him irresponsible and selfish. His actions led to an unnecessary chain of events which was not believable due to the way the family learned to adapt and I felt like they added it just for the ones who stayed in the background to have some kind of action. I wouldn't mind that scene if it was because the son was looking for something to save someone but it wasn't the case. I was annoyed throughout the film when he did it and from that point on I thought they should have not made this sequel.This movie can never be compared to the first film and it isn't even on the same level of greatness. The first film was perfection and this film strayed too much. I didn't dislike it completely it has great emotional scenes, there is one thing that thankfully didn't stray and it was the love of the family. The performances were all magnificent I could easily feel the love they had for each other. The cast was perfect I just wished that Emily Blunt would have a more central role replacing Cillian Murphy's part and I did like his performance, he was fantastic but I didn't like how it took the shine from the mother. This film unknowingly replaced the father with another character and didn't even try to make the mother important enough to be able to do all he did. Emily Blunt and Millicent Simmonds could have incredible scenes together but sadly the story took another approach. Every male and female actor was great the problem was not any of them it was the script.The composer Marco Beltrami was the one who composed the first film and I'm glad they chose him again because his music sets the horror and the emotions in such a beautiful way.",A Quiet Place Part II

367,j-madej,"There is so much high end filmmaking quality here, that my short descriptions of experience will not do it justice.",10,22 June 2021,"My review of 'A Quiet Place Part II' by Janusz Madej
I was looking forward to this sequel from the moment the trailer premiered, but due to the COVID pandemic lockdowns and restrictions, we had to wait for it. Instead of seeing it in comfort of our own home, sitting in front of flat screen TV, finally we can experience it as it was originally intended, on the largest possible screen with Dolby Surround sound.What must be said first is that a large credit must go to the writer/director John Krasinski, who has made very successful transition, from highly capable comedic actor, to an excellent writer/director, capable of crafting very cinematic world.As squeals go 'A Quiet Place II' doesn't disappoint and to be honest perhaps surpasses the original, which is mostly unheard of.Yes I really liked this film and was fortuned to see it on very large screen with 360'o DOLBY ATMOS, which enhanced the experience even more. Oh, how I missed this sort of cinematic experience and since the cinemas reopened I've been looking to feel the excitement, only great cinema screened, immersive movies can deliver.There is so much high end filmmaking quality here, that my short descriptions of experience will not do it justice. Through fantastic action filled introduction, which partly we can see in the trailer, that leaves you breathless, you know that you are witnessing something very special. The point which often most action Hollywood directors miss is that its not the actual CGI action that is exhilarating, although sometimes if done right, it can be, but the suspense of what you don't show, that truly keeps us hooked.Due to the fact that most of the movie the characters can not use normal conversation, as a form of exposition, (as with the first installment the alien predatory species hunts using their sense of hearing), its the sound design and body language of the actors, as well as sign language and how they react to the danger on their path, that creates constant state of tension, which the viewer feels. In essence you are experiencing the action together with the characters and perhaps that is what elevates this film beyond my expectation. It almost feels like you are actually there with them trying to survive.I will not write much about the plot, because the less you know about it, the better experience you will have. As the lead characters split up, the editing brilliantly jumps from one suspenseful scene on to another, not letting us breathe. Because all characters are well defined in the script, they have a very clear objectives in their motivations for their actions. Due to that fact we truly sympathize with their struggle.The performances are very strong. From brilliant Emily Blunt who tries to save her children and have a few emotional, potentially film stealing scenes, to Cillian Murphy who you can always depend on, whenever you look for characters which are torn between cowardliness and heroism. Although it seems Millicent Simmonds character, who plays the Emily Blunt's daughter, due to her disability of being deaf, might be the narrative spine of the movie. There are moments where we are transferred in to the world of silence in her head, as she is experiencing the action around her which adds to suspense even more.To some extent I see a parallel between Danny Boyle's zombie classic '28 Days Later' and 'A Quiet Place II'. Not just because Cillian Murphy is acting in both movies, but perhaps both films offer similar type of tension and challenge questions of what makes us human and how far would we go to endanger ourself for others safety.I am very impressed with this film and perhaps more so then its predecessor. As horror master William Friedkin wrote on Twiter after watching 'A Quiet Place II' 'CINEMA is BACK'.Oh, how I missed you... There is a clear indication of Part III its being on the way and judging by this installment, this franchise is shaping up to be something very special.Specially in highly capable heads of John Krasinski, who might be elevating himself, as one of the very best suspenseful writer/directors working in Hollywood today. I am pretty sure Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud to see what Krasinski accomplished here.Highly recommended to see on the biggest screen with the best surround sound.",A Quiet Place Part II

Paraphrasing another reviewer: it was a number of relatively competent characters trying their best in a bad situation. The silence is just a gimmick. Bird Box (2018) is a prime example / copycat that demonstrates that a gimmick doesn't automatically make a movie good.So in this sequel, we have characters who survived in this post-apocalyptic world for way more than a year, they knew the rules of survival (miraculously since day 1), then suddenly threw all that away. Not watching what they are walking on, running off without discussing with family, ""rescuing"" people who don't need rescuing and getting them killed (why is it suddenly a time-sensitive mission?)... Making all sorts of irrational decisions.In the end, the moment of empowerment is worse than being identical to the first movie --- it is basically Jaden ""ghosting"" in After Earth (2013).

And the aliens are sometimes destroyed by a couple of shotgun blasts, but then other times they are not. In addition, if the aliens can be destroyed by small arms - how would they fare against the combined forces of the earth's military? Finally, the characters act illogically - why were the people at the boat landing just staying there instead of making way for the island refuge? As for the acting, cinematography and direction - that redeems the movie from being below average to me - I just can't get by the illogical premise and storyline to rate this above a ""C"".

More bad guys, more explosions, much, much more of everything. Except story and depth and character development.A Quiet Place II, thankfully, doesn't fall into that trap. It starts almost exactly where it left off. Right at the point in fact, where we were left wanting to see more in the first film. Then it simply and effectively expands on the original.Overall I rate it as good as the first instalment, if not marginally better in places.

383,huntersmithx,Sizzling in tantalizing silence and emotion.,9,9 June 2021,"John Krasinski's masterful 'A Quiet Place' from 2018, while being one of the numerous original films to come out of Hollywood every year, seems like it's too good to be true. A comedic actor who had been making his transition into more dramatic and action territory made and starred, alongside his wife, in his directorial debut that made for an incendiary and riveting Horror picture with minimal dialogue that'd then sweep up plaudits of critical acclaim, award nominations including wins from the AFI and National Board of Review, plus importantly- the respect of audiences (and it was produced by Michael Bay of all people). Now after a brutal start of the decade for cinema, Krasinski's follow-up is deservedly being seen in the biggest screen possible because it's a richly spare and satisfying sequel.'Part II' hits several of the hallmarks of the best type of sequel- more world-building, new characters, character growth and not forgetting what made its predecessor so novel. Krasinski's direction is as good as ever, and it isn't merely the juxtaposition of silence, visual storytelling, spare score, cinematography; there's also the hair-raising editing that combines several aligning scenes and moments in separate locations together like the tracks of a Pink Floyd album. You'll be more than glad to see the returning cast of the Abbot family come into their own again, and especially the daughter Regan played by Millicent Simmonds. She was pivotal in 'Part I', but in many ways this is her film- not only in her interactions with the family, but also newcomer Emmett. Cillian Murphy's turn here as the grizzled loner is a perfect successor to Krasinski's Lee from 'Part I', plus his arc of being an unlikely surrogate father to Regan and finding salvation along the way is immaculate.There are hints in the trailer that there's a new location involving some survivors, which in-film makes for a compelling albeit temporary development. If any one flaw were to be pinpointed, it's that we get a merely 5 minutes or so with this section before the climax. Some viewers might be jarred by the aging of Regan and her brother Marcus (rising young star Noah Jupe), but this is minor once you get in the swing of events and care about these characters. If you can handle the recastings of Rachel Dawes in 'The Dark Knight' and Rhode in the Marvel Universe despite them looking starkly different from those who came before (which don't bother me either), than aging children isn't a pushback.If any original film these past several years deserved a sequel, 'A Quiet Place' was a shoo-in. 'The Nice Guys 2' seems like a pipe dream at this point, but 'Part II' here is a wish granted from the fountain. It might not quite have that first-time magic of 'Part I', but its ingenuity and forward-momentum plot shouldn't be taken for granted, especially in 2021.Grade- 3.5 out of 4 stars.",A Quiet Place Part II

In short: Humanity is stupid sometimes especially when the emotional component of fear is added. In our vicious critique of the film, we all talk like lions, but put us in the same circumstances and see how easily we sacrifice like lambs. I simply treated it as a what-if scenario; meaning, what if I were in such a dilemma? How would I react?Another interesting facet of the film is in its stellar cinematography. It shot from different angles yes, but also from different perspectives too. The daughter was deaf and so the camera would go silent @times. Personally, I found the daughter to be one of the most courageous persons around. I w beginning to wonder if it had something to do with her deafness. She couldn't hear the crackle of twigs on the ground or the brush of leaves as the figure approached.

399,Entertainmentsparadise,Listen closely!,8,29 May 2021,"Seeking safety, the Abbot family navigates through the monster infested world with every possible mishap.They've done it again!The film starts off with the precedent of events that occurred before the original Quiet place. Which proves to be an effective element towards some of our questions. The film sticks to the theme once again, immersing you with intense sounds shifting from minuscule, extremely loud, to no sound at all.The film still focused on the monsters running around destroying everything they hear 😉, they flirt with the element of human threat yet the actual threat was the main characters faults. For instance there are some teeth clinching scenes that cause troubles for the characters throughout the film.Verdict:
Everything bad that could happen, happened. Part 2 has better structure than the first installment. The structure was plot development to action/ thrill scenes throughout yet the story build up is still slowly paced. Definitely worth the watch especially in the theaters!",A Quiet Place Part II

The first film really didn't need a sequel and yet, here we are. It made money so a follow-up was commissioned. And I'm pretty thankful for that because Part 2 stands up strong with the first film as a worthy follow-up (continuation at of the story) and expands the universe.No spoilers here but great acting, the creature effects are just as good as the first time around, the jump scares are plentiful (I don't normally jump in films but this one got me twice).Now I just want Part 3 (and then hopefully they will stop there).",A Quiet Place Part II

405,Here_2_Review,A Quiet Place Part 2 is absolutely excellent,10,7 June 2021,"Pretty much everyone that has hyped up this movie is actually right! This movie is even better than the first one. The plot does take place exactly where the first one left off, and considering nowhere is exactly safe and they now have a baby to take care of, they need to pretty much go into No Man's Land while figuring out how best to proceed with their life, what it is they should do next.I cannot say that there is exactly any standout actors here, everyone in this movie is fantastic. There is A LOT more for our protagonists to do, there are missions that need accomplished, Regan gets a lot of spotlight, Evelyn gets hers, Emmett we get attached to, and wow is he a great addition to this franchise! Cillian Murphy does pretty great!This whole movie is pretty damn phenomenal, more so in the second half. Everything is good to great. The movie stars off badass and ends badass. The tension never gets old, it actually gets better in the second half, as I said the latter is even better.I'm not gonna say much more, I mean I am pretty much just repeating what everyone else is saying, especially particular YouTube film reviewers I watch, everything was pretty top notch! A+ a phenomenal sequel that succeeds the first one in every way!Also, I would love to give special praise to the people in the auditorium I was in. There weren't that many people, but still, most of them were DEAD SILENT! You should be regardless of what film you are seeing, but with this one, they were completely silent....except a couple of people in the very back. They were at a quiet whisper, but given how quiet the whole movie was, I could still hear them.....and I think one of their phones was making racket. Other than that, thanks to the people who were completely respectful all the way through. They won't see this post of course, but stillThank you John Krasinski for knocking it out of the park.",A Quiet Place Part II

So bad. If you are going to zone out for two-hours..., forget the ridiculous, ""A Quiet Place"", as an option! Now, I know if you are even a little like me and you've already seen the few other available movie choices, and if you're feeling lucky like Columbus did, whom, as you know, did take a chance...even though he died in chains.., (that's a joke) but that's besides the point, I stray...Anyway, nearly immediately...
you will not know or care who or what is going on or whom is doing what to whom or if and when they get their just rewards from the silly, creepy crawling aliens... running around and NOTHING will make sense. Just like the sentence you just read! That sums this movie up: Disjointed. Nonsensical. Uninteresting.Since my wife and I were the only two in the first Monday showing, we got to play ""MST 2000"" and commentarially, we tore this laughable, foolish idea to shreds. Too many incongruent points that would prove my point but I don't want to possibly give any spoilers so I'm saying nothing except plenty about the results. Maybe this is the main thing I can say about this money cow: After leaving the theater, walking through the parking lot to the car, I considered that, ""Hey, it's only $5 and some tax, so why not go to the movie and take a chance and still..., this script was so poor, the movie congruence is so missing, and the story made so little sense at all to even care if any of these running around characters even survive!

And I was disappointed that the alien creature that has destroyed the town and made it eerily empty, is still a pretty dumb monster when the main characters are involved. And even with all that repetition, I was at the edge of my seat.A good sound system is a must for this or the jump scares will not be as effective and all the parts filled with the mind-numbing silence will not heighten your senses. I held my breath a lot, the acting convinced me that it was a real dystopian world I was viewing through a screen and at any moment, hell could break loose.But I no longer doubt the dumbness of characters in movies, whether is venturing out in the dark or stepping out to explore their surroundings at really bad timings, as this pandemic has proven, humans are reckless and dumb, and all that big brain access is limited to a few who choose to use it.",A Quiet Place Part II

Bird Box
Cloverfield 10There are roughly two ways one can go about making a sequel. First - make exactly the same movie as the first one. It will be unoriginal, but usually when the source material is good enough this kind of approach is fail-proof. If people loved the first film, they will like it's copy with tiny deviations as well. The second way is to try to go and do something completely different, bringing new vision into the story, only taking the setting and the characters from the source. This is extremely risky because it either works brilliantly or turns out to be a spectacular failure. The successful examples would be ""Blade Runner"", ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Last of Us 2"" (don't lynch me for this one).""A Quiet Place Part II"" is the safe, fail-proof copy of the first movie. It takes place 5 days after the events of the first one, jumps straight into action and continues organically in exactly the same tempo as the previous film, to the point where you can literally just start watching the second one right after the first one is over and treat it as one long movie. This isn't bad per se - the first film was just outstanding in the ocean of crappy horror films of the time, and it was nice to revisit this world and the characters within it. Nice, but nothing more - in those 3 years I expected at least something new coming from Krasinski so, as I said, the film works but I'm still not too happy about it. I will let that one slide though because Krasinski didn't even want to ever make a sequel, and this was a studio project more than anything. Compared to how unimaginably bad other big studio projects can be this is a very well-crafted film. If you loved part one, you will like part two.",A Quiet Place Part II

420,Aria_Athena,Didn't enjoy it as much as the first,5,28 June 2021,"By no means a bad film, it just didn't click for me in one too many places.John Krasinski's character was, I dare say, the heart of the first film. While Cillian Murphy's acting was up to the task, I thought his character was somewhat weakly written and didn't have the emotional impact they were going for. I also thought the script lacked subtlety. While they were at the train station, Regan, the deaf girl, straight up told Cillian Murphy what his character is about.Another issue I had, was that this sequel added almost nothing new. Only thing they introduced was that some of the survivors have completely lost it and should be avoided.While the film is very well shot, I found that having 2 or 3 scenes happening in parallel was overused. The way it was done during the end, with the music and all, made it a bit cheesy, befitting to neither a horror movie, nor a drama.My final complaint would be an interval of 15 to 20 minutes in the middle of the movie, when close to nothing happened. It was building suspense and setting up events, but it was doing so very slowly because the movie was showing 3 different sets of characters simultaneously. I got bored for a bit and had trouble getting back in the mood.Also, in all likeliness, there's going to be a 3rd movie.",A Quiet Place Part II

It had a good premise, surprisingly solid direction from John Krasinski, and Emily Blunt was just a badass in that whole movie.This movie? It's so much better and a much leaner and exciting thriller. The opening ten minutes are incredible. It's crazy that Jim Halpert from the Office could direct an establishing action scene that sets up the world of these movies and still deliver scares.Emily Blunt is just as cool as before in this movie. But both the child actors playing her children were very good too. Their performances show how much they matured as characters since the last movie. Cillian Murphy is good too as Blunt's costar.The setpieces are thrilling and the sound design is just as amazing as the first movie.

There were enough people in the cinema, normally only needing a few to cause a disturbance, and apart from the odd packet rattle, there wasn't a peep - the first movie did this when I went to the cinema, it was so effective, and this one was similarly influencial on mouths that would have otherwised talked through a movie.

I've read a lot of one and two star reviews and my first question is why did these people watch this movie? Did they not watch the first movie? And if so were you expecting something different in this movie? Why do you even bother watching it if you didn't like the first one? So to all those people who rated this movie dumb and boring, I have to say you're pretty dumb for watching a sequel to a movie didn't like in the first place.I also see criticism for the characters in the movie making dumb decisions, all I can tell these people is that until you've been a stressful situation where fear consumes your thoughts and decision making goes right out the window, you have no room to criticize. These are ordinary people, not train soldiers making split, life and death decisions. Walk in their shoes and find out just how smart you are or how dumb.As for this movie I thought it kept up the level of the original and in some areas exceeded it and others nit. But overall a very good very suspenseful and a high quality thriller. I thought the acting was very good and the ending also pretty good.I definitely recommend seeing this on the big screen as it makes you feel like you're actually There with the characters and it very much increases the level of suspense.",A Quiet Place Part II

My favorite aspects were undoubtedly the editing and mixing of the sound, without it you could not live the auditory journey that history proposes. Secondly, the editing seemed very successful, apparently simple but that is where its success lies because if we analyze the structuring that they achieved is very difficult. The music captivated me in 3 moments and sets me with the beat to which my heart raced. Of the rest it is clear that the special effects were good, the direction has captivating moments like I never thought that a shot of feet could say so much. And something that I must highlight is the success achieved with each moment of tension and fear, because the film manages to move between the genres of drama, horror and adventure flawlessly.",A Quiet Place Part II

Unsurprisingly it is derivative, but to gi e it an edge it would need to add something new.The new was the introduction setting the scene for both movies with its explanation of the origins of the monsters. But apart from it being clearly extraterrestrial, we are not much the wiser. If the aliens could cross interstellar space surely they would have some means of crossing water? Apparently they have crossed to all inhabited continents. Without any evidence of tools we are left with monsters which are just mindless killing machines. Perhaps indeed they are just predators some kindly alien race released on earth to rid it of its previous inhabitants prior to occupation or sale?Turning to the characters, there is little to say. The boy, despite surviving more than a year in the newly hostile world the family now inhabits, continues to make reckless decisions. The girl - whether in a deliberately sexist twist or not - is more of a man. Unfortunately the limitations in the young actress"" acting ability is now more apparent. She shows scarcely a flicker of emotion whatever unexpected horror faces her.Probably the weakest element was the island scene.

Maybe if they went into the aliens origins instead of the characters' it'd have been a better movie, otherwise it's almost the same as watching another version of the first, instead of a sequel to it. The first installment of the movie was great because there was nothing like it, while this didn't bring anything new. You leave with just as much knowledge as the first one. It's quite predictable as well, starts out great, but after that it's about who's gonna make a mistake, leading to the action scene or jump scare. So you see where the movie is heading. The acting was still good, just about as good as the first one.The storyline has ""Book Of Eli"" homage to it as well so it didn't feel as original.

It had great tension, acting, set, script, it delivered so much, i just wanted another few hours of it.It didn't need amping up, the level of action was plentiful. All if needed was to be a lot longer, to keep me as a viewer in that state of pre-orgasmic suspense a bit longer. The end came too fast, and i was still ready to enjoy another hour at least.I'd definitely pay again to see the next part (3) if they hopefully make one.This movie gets it right. It's not overloaded with CGI and too many action scenes. It allows the build ups, the character development, the set and scenery to do the work. It uses the silence beautifully. You find yourself breathing quietly as the scenes draw you in. The jump scares are very well executed.I'd love to see this as a TV show, BUT, whenever that happens they tend to turn into soap operas - like that garbage walking dead.

If I'm pulled out of the film by a character making decisions they'd never, ever make....then it's a problem. There are too many of those moments. Too many times mistakes are made because apparently everybody has forgotten what survival instinct is. It's unreasonably unrealistic in that sense and it damages the experience in a world we're supposed to believe is gritty and paralleled with our own.I enjoyed Emily Blunt, even if she is heavily sidelined...infact you could argue it's all really about the kids and I'm not sure it always works.Cillian Murphy was also excellent, even if he isn't really given the most creative plot.Overall I enjoyed it.

433,thefoochie,"Strong start, weak middle, great finish",7,28 May 2021,"I adored the start of this movie. I liked that they explained where the monsters came from. I did not expect them to come from a meteor! It was also a good way of showing what life was like on the first day of the apocalypse. I also really liked the suspense in the beginning. You know that something terrible is going to happen, and when it happens, it's scary as hell.Then, the main trio meet Cillian Murphy, and the boy gets caught in a bear trap. This part was really scary, and I liked the introduction to Murphy's character.The middle was undoubtedly the weakest part of the movie. Emily blunt going outside the bunker felt pointless to me. All she did was leave her ring on her husband's grave. Also, the scenes with the son in the bunker just weren't scary. At all. I knew there were no way he was going to die, and all he had to do was close the bunker door when the monsters came.The scenes with Murphy and the dead girl were also boring at times. The main action scene we got with them in the train wasn't very scary, either. I expected Murphy to show up out of nowhere and save the girl, and it happened exactly as I expected.Even though the middle was somewhat weak, I loved the ending. Once Emily blunt and her son meet up, things actually get intense. I was on the edge of my seat, and I did not expect her to use water to her advantage. The part where the monster almost kills them in the bunker was very intense.Also, the subplot on the island was very good. I loved the way things seemed so normal, but the second the monster arrived on the island, things escalated so quickly. I really liked that the daughter ended up saving Cillian in the end. Then, we get another annoying cliffhanger!Overall, it was a good movie that was on par with the first one. I Highly recommend it!",A Quiet Place Part II
434,TruthSeeker4Life,"Excellently directed, but the concept has a lot of holes in it, which ruin the film in many ways...",7,20 June 2021,"The directing was great, but the film was far too short! What are they planning on making 2 more movies after this one? Are they really trying to juice this for as much $$$ as they can get?! Makes me a little upset because they could easily wrap this up in three, which I would prefer, and four just seems greedy to me, and played out! They could close it out in three, which would make far more sense.What does bother me about the concept is how did these aliens come from outer space, traveled all this way, and they are basically primitive retards? How did they build a spacecraft to get to earth with that type of retarded mind? Are we really going to find out that they are controlled by some omnipotent overlords on a space ship which we haven't even seen yet? Which would be really porr execution to make it known by movie THREE! If there are overlords, who are far smarter than their pawns, then we should have known about it in movie 2! And if they get the idea from me, then they better contact me because that is bad karma, and give the credit to where its due! The idea is great, but the actual follow through with the entire plot has many many holes, which could easily be fixed, if they had someone like me helping, but I guess, you have to be a movie star nowadays to be able to write a screenplay that's picked up.Secondly, the way they found out how to kill them with sound is something the US government, and many other governments, could have figured out quite rapidly. Clearly, they would test all sorts of things out, and they would have many many underground, impenetrable bunkers (since these aliens are so low IQ) which would allow them to live and sustain themselves as long as they like to figure out how to stop these things. It certainly wouldn't take them 400+ days to realize that sound waves is something that could potentially render these low IQ aliens into easy targets to be destroyed at will. Maybe for the simpletons out there, who don't know much about our government, or science would think this story is plausible, but for an educated viewer, it just seems too convenient, and unrealistic.Thirdly, what happened to the Air force?! Between all the nations in the world, we are talking 100,000+ military planes like F-16 and a plethora of bombers capable of bombing and attacking these creatures, so why are they not used? Especially since America and other nations have aircraft carriers! If these aliens cannot swim, and we have nuclear powered aircraft carriers, without hundreds of aircrafts out there, and fully loaded with bombs etc, then there is no reason they are not out there bombing these creatures into bits and pieces! Or, at the very least, at the beginning when this all began, but there isn't anything about airplanes, or the military, and none of that throughout the first two movies, which makes ABSOLUTELY no sense.Lastly, the whole part with the weirdos at the boats, who prefer to live amongst the alien creatures, and were waiting for people to come to the boats so they could capture them is absolutely asinine! Seriously! These guys would prefer to wait around, after MORE THAN a year goes by, waiting for someone to come to the docks, while they just wait there the entire time? Absolutely unrealistic! Lets be real here, after a year goes by, how many people do you think go to the docks there? They were probably the first people in months, and so they wait patiently the entire time, whilst there these aliens all around waiting to kill them? They would rather wait by the docks to kill people etc than to get to safety?I think Krasinski did an EXCELLENT job directing the film. It was absolutely superb, and even though there were so many holes in the plot, which did irritate me, it was executed brilliantly! John, if you are reading this review, imagine how much better the next two films would be if they were REALISTIC! You can get peoples hearts beating fast with great directing, but what makes a movie go down in the history books as the BEST is that it captures people in a way that they believe what they see is possible, and it could happen in real life, which is not the case with the first two films, but hey, if you're looking for a side kick who can help you write something that is amazing and realistic then look me up because you have a great idea here, but I think you have too many Yes Men with you, and people are not giving you authentic answers about your plot and writing. B. Corvalan is my name.... I already have a career, but I certainly would love an opportunity to be involved in a project like this, and making movies that are realistic, where people actually think that could be them in the movie, and put an end to unrealistic Hollywood films! My profession is psychology, so I know what people want to see, and what people crave the most, more than anything, is to watch a film that takes them into a world where they think it could actually happen to them...",A Quiet Place Part II

436,floydbastable,Worth watching but.....,6,21 June 2021,"Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed this jump scare ride but two things: 1) it's like the first one, right? 2) ending was too abrupt. Oh wait you'll do part 3 and go for more cash. OK I get it, bit disappointed at that. I know its only a film but wouldn't the army and some big guns sort those thing out?",A Quiet Place Part II
437,moviematthewh-60783,"Great sequel, amazing cinema experience",9,27 May 2021,"Best cinema experience I've had in a while. A near full house with a near silent crowd (some loud eaters heh). Some may not of enjoyed the lack of plot (as in not much happens) and the ending, but I just see this film as a continuation of the story (as it's obvious there will be a third). You have to remember that it's right after the ending of the first one so the setting and time is the exact same, I think some people didn't get that. Millicent Simmonds shines in this film and Cillian Murphy alongside her only makes it better. Emily Blunt is still great but steps down this time and let's Millicent take the spotlight and she uses it perfectly. I didn't find the sequel as scary as the first film, but the scenes that had some jump scares in them were executed very well. Replacing the lack of scares in this film are big action pieces, which are great on the big screen, but I would of preferred more silent scenes where sound is used as a jump scare element rather than big explosions and loud sounds, but the action was still intense. Again, the sound design is perfect, especially when we're through Regans perspective and sound is cut out completely. Favourite scene was definitely the opening, big action scenes and a good origin to how the world is how it is. The only thing that bugged me was the theme of family has died down. It's now become 'every man for himself' almost, but we get a few moments that revolve around the theme of family, but you can see Regan and Marcus trying to be like their father during the film and trying to lead the family to safety. Highly recommend seeing this film, even if horror is not your taste you can appreciate the sound and production design.",A Quiet Place Part II
438,JoelAlexanderr,"Just as good, if not better than the first",8,20 June 2021,"A QUIET PLACE PART II is about as good as anyone could have hoped. Good horror sequels seem to be somewhat of a rarity these days, and John Krasinski makes this feat look easy by carrying over everything that was good about the first one while making everything a bit grander in scale. This movie picks up exactly where the first one left off, except the Abbott family is venturing beyond their household to find refuge with other survivors.Similar to the first film, the performances are all spectacular and deserve far more credit than they are getting. The highlight for me is Millicent Simmonds, who manages to steal scenes from the A-listers (Emily Blunt, John Krasinski, Cillian Murphy) all while speaking no dialogue. She deserves roles in far more projects than this franchise, and I hope other directors are smart enough to cast her. This movie is also directed by Krasinski as if he was a veteran, Oscar-winning director who has decades of experience. The opening sequence is the most suspenseful 15 minutes of film I've seen all year, with Krasinski building the tension in a chilling way that makes me excited for whatever else he does in his future. The jump scares are top notch in almost every scene, not because you don't expect them, but because the tension-building is so strong.All the flaws I have with this movie are the same flaws I have with the first movie: the ending is too abrupt, the concept of the story has a bunch of plot holes if you think about it too hard, and there are too many fake jump scares (where a scene builds tons of suspense and the jump scare is just a raccoon, for example). But the fact that A QUIET PLACE PART II is just as good, if not better than the first is a major accomplishment and the cast and crew should be proud. It is also a wonderful movie to return America to the movie theater experience. A-",A Quiet Place Part II

440,AnAverageNerd,Fantastic sequel!,9,6 June 2021,"A Quiet Place Part II builds upon its predecessor superbly and joins a very exclusive club of amazing horror movie sequels. I would recommend this film be watched in a cinema to really appreciate the atmosphere and tension built up throughout it. The performances are fantastic within the film and as watchers we are able to connect with them on a very real level; the emotions and pain the characters go through are extremely believable. The investment into the development of the characters is also noteworthy with us as viewers really getting an understanding into their personalities. The horror is balanced perfectly between occasional jump-scare, in-your-face moments and gradual tension build up. There is very little to critique with this film and its only issue is that it suffers from being a horror sequel in that we are aware of the threat posed and therefore the element of mystique holds less power. However, that being said, as horror sequels go this is a stand out and is a must for any fans of the first film or horror in general.",A Quiet Place Part II
441,Camerenth,A solid sequel for a horror franchise,8,9 June 2021,"If you liked the first one like me, you will like this movie. This sequel continues the themes, tone and character developments for the family with the addition of Cillian Murphy's character who is also exceptional in this. The movie has tension but not quite on the level of scenes from the first movie. This movie has emotional moments, also not as deep as the first movie. But these scenes of tension and emotion are included and they are done fairly well. By far, Millicent and Cillian are the stand outs in this film. They both carry the emotion of the movie and have the most tense scenes. Overall, just a solid film. And to think a sequel for a horror movie is good comes a long way in film history. Recommend fully.",A Quiet Place Part II
442,jaredkjacoby,A Worthy Sequel to an Excellent Horror Film,9,29 May 2021,"This sequel to A Quiet Place takes place right after the end of the first film so there will be spoilers for the first film so if you have not seen the first film and you want to, watch that first then come back to this review.After finding the weaknesses of the mysterious creatures that can sense sound, Evelyn, Regan and Marcus leave their destroyed home to face the outside world with Lee gone. They stumble across Emmett who was an old friend of Lee's that learned not to trust anybody or go further than where he lives. He agrees to let Evelyn and her kids stay. Regan hatches a plan to get to the radio tower to play a song on loop so she can transmit the high-frequency sound so others can fight the creatures.I feel bad for John Krasinski. This movie was one week away from being released and that is when theaters were shut down because of the pandemic. It took over a year for this movie to come out after that. The best thing I can say about this situation is that if A Quiet Place Part II was released in March of 2020, I would not have seen it because I did not see the original until quarantine. I have to say, I fell in love with A Quiet Place for its atmosphere and worldbuilding. It is one of the few horror films that creeps me out. The ending with Evelyn loading the shotgun made it clear that a sequel was on the horizon. Is this a worthy sequel to A Quiet Place?Short answer: yes it is! A Quiet Place Part II is just as good if not better than the first film. It shows a little bit more about these creepy creatures and where they came from in the opening scene. One moment, everything seems normal and carefree. The next moment, everyone is running for their lives and getting swiped by these monsters. The opening scene captures the feel of an apocalypse. We see how this city was wiped out by these creatures in the first place and how the Abbott family survived. The movie only gets better from there.This sequel scores on expanding its world, delivering chilling scares and atmosphere and exploring the cracked family dynamic. The family is close, but not as close as they seem. Marcus is a bit more laid back and wants to stick with his mom, though it is very understandable after his injury. Regan on the other hand wants to find a way to help any survivors take down the aliens while being much more willing to venture out by herself. I was surprised at how damaged their relationship was, but it is done well with authentic writing and acting. Evelyn is still such a strong mother who goes out of her way to help her kids, even in certain death situations. She never hesitates to help her kids and that is why I love her so much as a mother character.Then there is Emmett played by Cillian Murphy. He is one of Lee's friends who seems to have lost his mind a little bit. However, he is a tragic character, but he ultimately warms up to the Abbotts, especially Regan. His philosophy about humans being bad is understandable because even though this is a time they should work together, they may still turn on each other for survival. Murphy's performance is amazing. He shows a lot of range in his character and you can tell from his emotions that he is a troubled individual. It is hard not to feel bad for him even if he is a bit more paranoid than he should be.Speaking of performances, I think that Millicent Simmonds gives one of the best performances I have ever seen from a child actor or teenage actor I have ever seen. Her character is deaf and Simmonds herself is deaf in real life. Her emotion range is great from her eureka moments of brightness to annoyance that her family back out of her ideas. Her best scene involves a breakdown that she has. It is easily the most powerful moment in the film and I just wanted to hug her there. She expressed loneliness, betrayal and sadness in that particular scene.Noah Jupe as Marcus is terrific as well. When he gets stuck in one of Emmett's traps, he unleashes a scream of pain that is horrifying. Yes, they need to stay quiet, but it is hard when they are in that much pain. Jupe also conveys the emotions of a frightened teenager very well. Even beyond his injury, he makes terrifying discoveries and gets claustrophobic. Jupe never overacts at all during these scenes. Emily Blunt as Evelyn is always great with her emotions and determination. The performances in this film are top notch and even better than the last film.For the story, it expands on the original by showing other survivors and how they interact with the main characters. This movie does a good job showing how different people react such as showing friendly and hostile survivors. It is more action-oriented than the first film, but it is still a slow-paced horror film. The tone is even darker here than in the first film. There are almost no comedic beats in the film. There is pure intensity and horror here. It works beautifully and it is refreshing from some of the cheesier horror films out there.Not only are the creatures as frightening as ever, but the world is more terrifying. The fact that there are hostile survivors that may try to kill others out of fear or malice makes the film more intense. Meanwhile, suffering a bolt of pain may as well be a death sentence unless you are good at not screaming. Details like this make the film terrifying, not just the creatures. The background of where the creatures came from is believable, but I have to wonder where else in the world they ended up in. My only gripe is the ending. I really did not want the film to end where it did because it still felt like there was a lot of story left to tell. That brings me to another point. There is a lot of ambiguity in the story. That may be good or bad depending on how you like stories to wrap up.As for the technical aspects, they are as wonderful as ever. Being in the theater definitely made me appreciate the technical aspects more, but the sound is amazing. Each sound matters in this film from knocking over something to clanging noises. Even the musical score is haunting. The editing is top notch as it makes the movie more intense than it already is. Krasinski sets it up where both two conflicts happen at the same time for the different pairs of characters to make the drama that much more effective. It works because they go through similar situations and the masterful editing makes it easy to make out what is happening. It shows that most people in this world are going through similar hardships.The cinematography is breathtaking. Every frame looks so polished and beautiful. I especially love the shots of the sprinkler dripping water and the shots of Regan and Emmett together after they agree to work together. It adds so much to the creepy and dreary atmosphere of the film. Any small detail can. The set pieces are fantastic and tense. They are beautifully shot and edited and they utilize the strengths and weaknesses of the creatures. They also keep the characters the focus of the action and their thought-process when confronted. Maybe it is because I saw this on a bigger screen, but the creatures look even scarier here than in the first one. They just have that disgusting factor to them with their faces and their movement. The sounds they make are also creepy. It almost sounds like a drain leaking loudly. The color palette represents the tone. It is just as bleak as everything else, but it fits the movie perfectly. This movie is damn near perfect as far as technical aspects go.A Quiet Place Part II is everything a sequel should be. It expands on the lore of the original film, it has a great story, the scares are scarier and the performances are even better here than they were in the first film. John Krasinski really showed how passionate he is about filmmaking and especially for this film in general. He puts so much love into both of these films and you can feel it every step of the way. This is a great sequel to the first film and a great horror film in general. If you love the first film, definitely check this terrific sequel out. So far, this is my favorite movie of 2021.",A Quiet Place Part II

That really brought the whole movie down. Also the plot is like OK ... whatever. They elaborated on the fact we already new from the first movie without anything added to be honest. And looking for a safe haven following an audio recording, yawn ... how come that became the template for these movies?So, story wise actually quite terrible. But production wise, men ... It's again just done so well in presentation, suspense, SFX and sound It still was just very entertaining. It almost makes you forget about It's flaws, but I can't deny that writers actually wrote this and didn't care about our intelligence, which Is just insulting to the viewer, apparently a trend nowadays.

It was also clever in that you get a flashback to 'day 1' when the alien monsters arrived in a terrific tense action sequence.As with part 1, it is a lesson in tension, and simplicity in storytelling that relies on character and their relationships with one another. The pacing is again on point and doesn't overstay it's welcome, it ends right where it needs to... Hoping there is a part III that might devolve more about the origins of the alien creatures...Most reviews seems hell-bent on only commenting on perceived flaws, nothing is perfect, as in life... I think we are spoilt in the fact that most films now can be streamed upon release and the consumer is just that, all be it on a greater scale now.Don't get stuck in the 'negative' hit play and enjoy the ride...

447,willcrabbe,"A solid, if unremarkable follow-up",6,14 June 2021,"A Quiet Place Part II (QPP2) acts as a direct sequel to the original smash-hit horror film A Quiet Place and follows the Abbott family as they encounter an old family friend and intercept radio transmissions hinting of a safe haven somewhere beyond the sea.The opening scene of the film takes us right into the heart of the start of the alien invasion of Earth and is executed sublimely. You could cut the tension in my screening with a knife. Not a single sound - no crunch of popcorn, no slurp of drink - everyone was totally engrossed. Unfortunately, it turned out that the film had played its trump card far too early and that scene acted as the high point of the film. Nothing following managed to meet that standard and that served as a big disappointment for me.The film varies from the original and is much more expansive and less atmospheric focussing on more action set-pieces but still contains some tense, enclosed sequences similar to the first film. I found some of the internal logic of the film inconsistent with the original but I didn't feel it was too distracting from the overall picture. Although, some more anal reviewers may pick that apart more than me.The performances from Emily Blunt and Millicent Simmonds are both great and Cillian Murphy's character Emmett is an okay addition to the cast but I didn't find him particularly interesting. There were some hints of depth to his character but I wish they had developed him a little more.Again I've found myself asking ""Is that it?"" at the end of a film. Maybe not as severe as Earwig and the Witch, but the end of the film did seem to happen so quickly and anticlimactically. I wanted more, and it seemed like there should have been more. It is likely they're setting up for a further sequel, but if this series continues to serve up diminishing returns, it likely won't be worth watching (I've already expressed my feelings regarding providing sequels to the original film in a previous review).Overall, QPP2 acts as solid follow up to the original with some tense sequences and nice cinematography, but fails to make the same impact. I'd still recommend to see this in the cinema though, especially for that killer opening scene.",A Quiet Place Part II
448,nerdgasms,Corniest ending ever,6,20 July 2021,Ok it was a pretty average movie but it follows like the same exact flow as the first movie. It's almost copy and pasted. Can't blame John Krasinski either cause he said he didn't even wanna make this but the studio basically forced him to. Cillian Murphy is a great actor which is why I had some hope but idk it didn't seem like they gave him a lot to work with. Like he doesn't have much personality at all.All that would be kinda acceptable if it weren't for that corny a. Ending though. The first one had a little hint of that at the end but it at least had the rest of the movie to make up for it.

This flashback sequence plays out while the creatures take townspeople down en-masse and has all the great tension and horror of the first film but honestly from a plot standpoint it was unnecessary and only serves to introduce one new character. It also had the unfortunate side effect of weakening Dad's sacrifice in the first film. Back in the present we pick up right where the first film left off and we get more of the same tension and horror as Regan, the deaf daughter, teams up with a neighbor on a mission to help stop the creatures.The film is an adequate sequel, but something just felt off... putting the focus on the daughter as the heroine was a great story choice but the scare sequences are telegraphed, the family theme score is overused to the point it felt as through the movie was dragging and the mother whose actions and motivations were so critical to the plot of the first film seem completely out of character in this one.

460,Educhico,-,5,1 October 2021,"Like so many other cases, the success of what might be considered a relatively small venture in the form of A Quiet Place led to the inevitable and perhaps unjustified creation of a sequel. It turned out to be a clear profit given the low budget of the first film, but which ends up not recapitulating the novelty of the first one, but rather repeating it and taking the effect out of it.At first, I couldn't have felt a greater smile than the one that increasingly outlined as I watched the opening scene of the film, in a wise decision to take the opportunity to see this film in its IMAX version. Because that format does the best for highlighting the capabilities that Krasinski increasingly demonstrates as a director and that offers greater impact to the represented events.The focus on dramatic elements that we know from the first chapter, or on elements that better frame the geography of the following events; the occasional use of silence to offer a greater impact to the moments that will follow; the continuous take that allow us to maintain the attention to the various elements and guides our vision. All elements we know to make good directing, but which illustrate here the thoughtful and efficient narrative thought, in its controlled application in this genre (and specifically at the beginning of this chapter), managing to offer impact to a flashback for which we know to be zero consequences for the protagonists. At the same time it presents us narrative elements relevant to the film in hand, and brings expectations for what we will see next.We quickly realized, however, the impact that this prologue has on the rest of the film, since what it does will never be equaled or surpassed, not even narratively. There is already a repetition of the same beats, in which the tension begin to lose its impact, as they revisit the same finite number of scenarios in which sound is applicable as a sign of imminent danger. There will always come a point where one of the protagonists will make a noise that leads to an escape, often with the appearance of a character at the key moment, where before the scenarios were framed so that the characters reach a resolution for themselves.Even when three different situations are framed simultaneously, with different characters in different degrees of danger, one of these situations is enhanced by an foolish decision by one of the characters, not consistent with what has been shown of him so far, just to create a moment of tension.And where in the original there is the gradual emergence of the potential of the discovered ""weapon"", here we already know its effects and, therefore, any attempt in its use is lost in our exact knowledge of its application. It even results in the almost exactly same revisitation of the previous movie's ending. If the element essential to the premise becomes redundant and devoid of its expected impact, what more can we expect then?So, in the same way, there is an attempt to expand the initial idea and the underlying universe, in the illustration of the consequences of the events in a population forced to survive by whatever means necessary. We received tips from some groups of people deprived of their humanity, reduced to the routine of setting up baits so that other people can be caught in their place. Tips that never slip into the rest of the argument, where those never become a constant threat in parallel to the creatures. Instead, they are just another useless obstacle, as no character perishes or suffers permanent consequences to them.And where in the final act we are presented with the notion of a piece of land surrounded by the substance that the creatures cannot cross, finally a stronghold where sound is a possibility without fear of reprisals, not enough time is offered to savor the calm before the storm, where we could have followed our character's settlement, knowing the eventual and inevitable fall to come, almost as an hitchcokian exercise.Perhaps Krasinski has gained experience in his role as a director, but finds himself still in need of further experimentation and learning as a screenwriter. Where the extra hands of the first film could have cooperated again for a clearer and more focused script, as the first movie did through its only four existing characters. And if here the other family members are almost enough to maintain our emotional investment, if there is a third chapter, the formula needs to be revised, so as not to become completely devoided of the impact that we remember from the first entry into this universe.",A Quiet Place Part II

Then it just floated like a lost buoy in the middle of the ocean. However there were some good jumpscares early on. Yet we know those are always cheap gimmickry and cost nothing except maybe the respect of the viewer/audience. This one had a hard time keeping my attention all the way through. Also was it just me or was there an awful (often literally) lot of dialogue for a ""Quiet Place""? The part with the bear trap and screaming was too hard to believe. These to me are the reasons to me that kept it from being anything to remember it by besides a few sighs or rolls of the eyes. On the other hand it did have good scenery, imagery,etc. It just all seemed a bit wasted. I'm gonna give it a generous 6 as it will keep you interested for some mildy.

Not so much. Still a good world, but I find it hard to believe that everyone becomes an evil dirtbag almost immediately. Oh, except for the lucky few who escaped to an island.It raised more questions than it answered. Like, why did the aliens even come there?

465,parkerrodney,A Quiet Place 2 - Cheesy Biblical Apocalyptic Theme,2,23 July 2021,"AQP2 is a film that belongs to a pre-existing genre, that of living a hopeless existence in a post-apocalyptic world caused by an alien invasion of the supernatural type. Due to its nature, we must consider the possibility (albeit a very far one) that AQP2 is either a political, social, or religious commentary, or a combination of all three. Turning to metaphors and parallels can be our only point of departure that might help explain this train wreck, keeping in mind of course that metaphors and parallels do not imply that AQP2 is a good movie, or that it's sophisticated and merits very close examination, it's a god-awful film. The lens of metaphors and parallels only reveals that we can identify the conscious or unconscious motives and foundation for the movie's point of departure - that of judgment, salvation, and the promised land. The question is that does it do so in any compelling way, as one understands salvation in the NT?Movies in the genre of the apocalyptic or post-apocalyptic, are almost always inherently about judgment, blowback - the unintended consequences behind man's actions or ignorance. Examples are, I am Legend, for man's tampering with medicine, The Day after Tomorrow, for man's failure to understand the implications for his actions on the environment, and War of the Worlds, for man's arrogance in believing that other lifeforms in the universe would not be hostile to humanity -the superiority of earthly man. This genre goes on an on add nauseum, with scripts of various quality and incompetence. . Whether we care to acknowledge it or not, the underlying and often unspoken idea behind many of these movies is the fact that at their core the message is usually about the consequences of man's tampering with God's creations, or as in the OT, wanting to become like gods. In this regard, AQP2 doesn't quite fit the bill but, it does so in the important ways of the NT, the refusal to hear the message of salvation.The most obvious theme in AQP2 is the opening of the sky and the reigning down of beasts to slaughter everyone, the innocents as well. This Book of Revelations motif, is obvious and in your face. It cannot be missed, nor can we ignore the baby who is protected from death, as the family that moves from location to location. The baby in this movie is a symbol of Moses or Jesus both who faced death as infants and who had to flee their birthlands. First, Moses from the Pharaoh, and Jesus from Herod. The Moses theme of floating on the water down the Nile is cheesy and superficially applied to the baby in AQP2, who is floated in a make-shift basinet on the water in a basement while his protector retrieves an O2 canister for his safe passage. The positing of the infant in this way places him as a savior in some way for AQP3, which is scheduled for release in 2023. The making of an APQ3 may fulfil the triadic structure of mythology.Hope, faith, and making it to the promised land are carried out by the strong and precocious young girl, who cracked a radio code and sought out a boat to get to an island. Given all of the preceding events, the island can only be viewed as a promised land. On this island, others who had also heard the message found safety and life. But we are reminded that all who had heard the calling did not make it to the promised island. Only 2 of 12 boats made it there safely. The message is that everyone will not be saved from this judgment. The NT has numerous scriptures about boats, deafness, silence, and muteness, many of which are relevant to the general theme of this movie.Bottom line AQP2 is a either a poorly done metaphor of the overdone Biblical apocalyptic theme, it relied upon elements of the Bible for its plot. At the end of the day, it is cheesy, not intellectual and even as an atheist, I know it is an insult to the brilliance of Gospel literature. Don't even make popcorn for this one.",A Quiet Place Part II
466,chrisw-17947,An Unexpectedly Better Sequel!!!,9,28 May 2021,"A little slow in the middle of the movie and ends abruptly (like the first one did). One particular issue I have with A Quiet Place Part 2 is that there are little predictable jumpscares, while others are completely unexpected and well-utilized. But A Quiet Place Part 2 is an excellent sequel, and surprisingly better than the first! I found the first one to be intense, but this was a lot more scary alongside with it being intense as well. Millicent Simmons and Cillian Murphy steal the show with their spot-on performances as well as Emily Blunt and Noah Jupe. The direction, the sound editing, and the narrative of the story is what makes this an outstanding sequel!Grade: A; Score: 9.5/10.",A Quiet Place Part II
467,KieranSaosila,Doesn't Let Up,8,19 June 2021,"The 'A Quiet Place' IP has cemented itself as a franchise that I personally find, offers an experience hard to find elsewhere. Part II delivers with a well shot, tightly edited adrenaline rush that doesn't let up. Sound design is again used so well to capture the sensitive personality of film, utilising sound itself as a vital part of the experience. In furthering the journey of these characters, I felt the film loses part of the family dynamic and in turn some of the emotional resonance and charm I really enjoyed in its predecessor. The film was also so smoothly paced that the time completely flies by, and I actually would've like to see the runtime stretch a little longer. The ability to intercut back and forth between tension is undeniably the outstanding quality of the film. Despite not quite matching the quality of the first instalment, Part II is a very much worthy sequel that again offers an experience hard to find elsewhere.",A Quiet Place Part II
468,Dunkaccino,Shhhhhhh!,8,19 June 2021,"A Quiet Place's sequel, this film is entirely written and directed by John Krasinski. Who gives a little performance at the start.This movie starts us with what was happening on Day 1. How people panicked everywhere etc. Then it jumps to exactly, and I mean exactly, where the first one left of. I think people are smart enough to see the first one first. If you did not, you should first.Cillian Murphy is in this. A man living by himself in am abandoned factory. Of course, he has an emotional backstory and dead family. His character is unexpectedly great and charming.The movie itself is not as quiet as you would expect. It has a great score and some effective jump scares. The monsters appear a lot. Everytime they're there every second just becomes suspenful.It is a great film, but I personally want to see more about the first days of the attack. It would've been very interesting to see more of that (and John Krasinski).This film ends quite unexpectedly. You'll find yourself wanting to see just one more scene. Just one more.It is rather rare to see a horror sequel with the same concept, cast and villain as the first one but still being wonderful. But A Quiet Place Part II pulls it off amazingly.Also, please do not talk or fart during the movie. Thanks.",A Quiet Place Part II
469,timmyhollywood,Underwhelming after the superb original,7,30 May 2021,"Some horror films are standalone, such as It Follows or Get Out, or part of a director's oeuvre, like Hereditary and Midsommar. I thought John Krasinski's A Quiet Place was likely to be a standalone, but when I heard there was a sequel I was excited. AQP had the hallmarks of a good standalone; it transcended genre. Beyond the creatures and gimmicks and jump scares was a piece of cinema, a riveting family story, layers of suspense, and some damn good acting and directing.AQP II does not transcend. Instead, it relies heavily on the first film. The opening scene is great, showing us ""day one"" of the alien apocalypse. It is suspenseful and gripping while moving right along and delivering some good shocks. The opening scene makes a promise: this will be another cut above the usual sci-fi horror fare.But the promise of a story as well told as the first movie soon fades. We pick up right where the first film left off: Evelyn Abbot (Emily Blunt) has slayed one of the alien beasts, but her family's home is burning. After they're forced to leave, the Abbots find a man alone fighting to survive - Emmett, a pre-apocalypse acquaintance played by Cillian Murphy - who is reluctant to help them.Here the story diverges. The deaf daughter, Regan, wants to find the source of a song that's being played repeatedly on the radio. She's convinced it means there are more survivors - maybe a remnant of civilization. When she sneaks off to find out, her mother begs Emmett to bring her back. And with them gone, Evelyn leaves her son and baby to find more supplies.Krasinski then jumps back and forth between the two storylines, building each to a climax, in an attempt to get double the bang for his buck. He does this twice, both when Emmett and Regan are confronted by rapey bandits and Evelyn is returning to encounter one of the beasts, and then again for the denouement.AQP II feels overly simple, and short, and ends rather abrupt. The suspense in this one is not layered but tedious and sometimes grating. (I can derive no guilty pleasure from babies running out of oxygen and screaming while it happens.) On the plus side, the performances are strong. Emily Blunt has an incredible knack for tears brimming in her eyes. Mouth slightly agape, eyes shining, she conveys all the hardship of a bereaved mother of three in this nightmare world with just a look. Cillian Murphy is adequate as the reluctant hero, Millicent Simmonds does a good job of the impossible character of Regan (how is she the one always off adventuring when she's deaf and can't hear if she's made a noise to attract the creatures?) But it's Noah Jupe as Marcus Abbot who's the real standout - and the only one who has a real arc, outside of the old-as-dust reluctant hero slog for Murphy.The fine thing about AQP II is that the children are becoming capable adults. They still make silly mistakes, but by the end, they've done some transcending of their own. 7/10.",A Quiet Place Part II

It kept the audience sucked in and on the edge. By the end, you didn't want it to end. Can't wait until the third installment.The only criticism is really just funny.

The story stays with the same characters. We learn a little bit more about the cause of the apocalypse, without leaving the very personal, narrow focus of the one family: we know no more than they do. The action is incredibly tense. I highly recommend seeing this on the big screen, as the atmosphere is terrific. And yet it's still a deeply intimate film about the love between one family. So much of the emotion is told through silence, facial expressions, body movements and each of the actors in the film does an absolutely amazing job. The creatures are literally out of this world, so cleverly done, so terrifying and utterly alien.Fantastic. Do not miss this sequel.

Can never really go wrong with Cillian Murphy.I would have to agree with some other reviews that the characters do make some pretty dumb decisions all in a bid to tee up the next tension filled set piece.

I know it isn't nice, but I couldn't help thinking, you're breaking the one, in fact, the only rule. I mean, I know your foot is caught in a bear trap, but didn't you know you're not supposed to make any noise? Please stop screaming.One thing that bugs me about both movies is that this is somehow supposed to be such a new and creative idea. I'm sorry, but please tell me the horror movie or thriller movie in which there isn't at least one situation where a character is hiding in a closet or under a bed and if they make one noise, they're dead. In fact, in almost every other horror or thriller movie, no matter how bad otherwise, that moment is usually pretty good simply because of the silent tension that is created. In this movie, as the first, it ends up just being redundant and I pretty much stop caring either way. Just let one go and it will all be over soon.",A Quiet Place Part II

504,ReaLMoisan,Suspension of Disbelief Tested.,4,3 July 2021,"How do blind creatures navigate and hunt without other sensory information? Bats have eyesight and are not blind as some people suspect, in fact, in low light conditions they can see better than humans. They also have some of the best hearing in the mammal kingdom, and would be able to hunt humans by the sound of our breathing alone. They also have echolocation to hunt and navigate that's so acute they can sense objects measured in fractions of a millimetre. Sure there are blind species of animals, but they all rely on some other sensory information to hunt and navigate. Also, there is no blind species that uses speed to pursue prey for a good reason. There are moles that use tendrils and smell, with their tendrils being the most touch sensitive organ in the animal kingdom. There are fish and salamanders that use water pressure, smell, and hearing. There are spiders that can sense with fine trichobothria hairs on their legs to feel, and sense chemicals on the ground left by prey they've specialized to hunt. There are crab, crayfish, and shrimp that use antennae to smell, touch, and taste when they graze. There are jellyfish and sea urchins that can sense light without having eye organs to perceive light.A regular house cat can hear a mouse from 60 meters away. They can hear your breathing if they're on the same floor of a house as you, and can hear your heartbeat if they're in the same room as you. When compared to a human, their eyes require seven times less light to see, and their peripheral vision is over twenty degrees wider too. Their eyes can see in the ultraviolet spectrum as well. They also have a third, semitransparent eyelid, which means they literally won't miss something when they blink. A cat has the second best hearing (not echolocation) in the animal kingdom, just behind the porpoise. Yet, they also evolved to have very acute eyesight developed for hunting. Not including their sense of smell, and even touch. Those whiskers on their face and brow aren't just for show.The creatures in this movie have no extrasensory organs to navigate and hunt besides sound. Which means they need to hear prey to locate it. You know what doesn't make noise? Buildings, parked vehicles, tree trunks, the ground. How can any organism traverse their environment this quickly, when they literally have no way to perceive their environment. Ever walk up or down stairs in the dark? What happens when your walking up or down the stairs and you think there's one more step than there is, or when you don't realize there's one more step than you thought their was. Now imagine this creature travelling at cheetah speeds, killing humans, while every step is an unfamiliar staircase in the dark. Now throw in tree trunks, fallen logs, parked vehicles, buildings, walls, fences, poles, cliffs, mounds, holes, etcetera.Not only is it preposterous to believe this species could ever successfully evolve, but they surely wouldn't have a chance against modern humans and their military. I had to pause the movie because my mind was racing with all the possible ways I could trap, lure, detour, and avoid these things with only what I have in my home right now. I came up with dozens of solutions to deal with these predators off the top of my head. I won't even get into any other aspects of the movie, because the antagonist, threat, and plot relies on a ridiculous premise that makes the movie impossible to take seriously.",A Quiet Place Part II
505,mha-89327,A Courageous Display of Feminist and Collectivist Empowerment,8,28 May 2021,"'A Quiet Place Part II', as a North American dramatic production, steps out of the all too frequent Hollywood template of storytelling. How is this achieved, and why is this significant and meaningful? Well, first, culturally and socially, this production attempts to address the inherent reproduction of sexist and minority stereotypes around women and disabled persons. Second, the narrative makes a bold and courageous statement in terms of a realistic portrayal of the equally self-efficacious nature of gender and sex assignment roles. Women are, and continue to be, just as capable as men, assuming they are willing to invest, and vest, themselves in their own capability and efficacy. The same principle applies, frequently, I imagine, to disabled persons, as well.So, in terms or storyline development and creative projection, how does this impact this dramatic production? Fist, the lead male protagonist, the husband and father figure, is no longer present, having fallen prey to the ever-present threat of alien predation. Now, children, a mother, and a hearing deficient daughter must function as a singular, effective survival system. Failure is death, effectively. There is no second chance; although, we discover that is not entirely true. Regardless, this remains a worthwhile rule to attempt to adhere to if one is to survive this post-apocalyptic state of ongoing crisis.Again, as with all good character driven drama, the humanity of the characters is allowed to shine. Such that, the family's own stereotypical attitudes towards what is possible and achievable, by children, adolescents and disabled persons, is often far in excess of what our comfort zone would normally allow. Inevitably, crisis sets its own standards of comfort zone - an uncomfortable one. Creatively, the storyline manages to inform and situate almost every character with their own opportunity to shine, as an individual.Operatively, we observe this when agents display a willingness to sacrifice for the benefit of the collective - the family or kinship group. This is a not an inherently westernised approach, culturally. Although, frequently, under recognised, and often maligned, it is common to indigenous cultures, and it does represent a stronger societal option for wellbeing.In fact, collectivism, arguably, offers far richer rewards than individualist culture, so frequently promoted in our daily, mostly westernised existential state socio-political focus. How? Simply put, it reflects the value of the whole, not just the parts in a societal context of wellbeing. In short, within a collectivist approach, one has to consider not just outcomes for ourselves, but for those we love, and those who surround us, and our environment, equally and continually.",A Quiet Place Part II
506,tandeki,A one trick pony with an old trick,5,3 July 2021,"I was really looking forward to this movie. And it was somehow entertaining but also quite annoying and overall disappointing.The first movie taught us that these alien landed on earth. They cannot see but they can hear absolutely everything. So everyone has to be quiet otherwise they, I don't know, smash you? But okay, this was enough of a story for a first movie which was based on the constant threat of these aliens storming at you the moment you seem to breathe too loud. It was tense from the beginning to the end and we had some very sad moments when we could feel with the protagonists loosing their loved ones. And the first movie ended with the groundbreaking finding, that a hearing aid combined with a broadcasting device not only hurts these aliens. It also makes them vulnerable whereas they are normally nearly indestructible. Ah, and they can't swim.So that was what we got from part one. And I expected from part two to develop the story further, give me some context and explain one or two questions which arose during part one. But nothing really happens besides the aliens still being the constant threat, everyone has to be quiet and a hearing aid saves the day now and then.Where did the aliens come from? What are their motives? Are they even intelligent? I mean, what is the benefit of travelling somehow through space only to sit in literally every corner of the world, waiting for someone to make a noise and then smash them? Is it sport? Or are these aliens some kind of dogs, something like a pioneer cleaning the planet before the real masters come? And why earth? It is called the ""blue planet"" because it mainly consists of water. And you are able to conduct interstellar travel but chose to conquer a world full of water when you are not able to swim? And what are aliens doing when they don't hunt? Do they have a place where they sit and talk things through? And how many aliens do you need anyway, when there is always one around, no matter where you are?There are so many questions and part two sadly gives answers to none of them. It also does no character development and even projects no direction for the whole story of humanity fighting for its survival. It is just a somehow entertaining movie which relies too heavy on the thin story from part one. And it mainly functions like a mediocre horror movie where things only happen because stupid people are doing stupid things.",A Quiet Place Part II

In truth, AQP2 brings absolutely nothing new to what now is obviously planned to be a long-running franchise of never ending sequels. Well, other than a very slight flashback to when the aliens landed on Earth pre-dating the first installment, I guess.The best way I can describe this one is: More of the Same.The direction is still tight, and if you like jump scares, this will entertain you, but that's about all you're going to get other than another cliff hanger ending without having learned anything at all about these alien beings or a feasible plan to eradicate them in future sequels.All in all, I was *very* disappointed in this cash grab sequel offering absolutely zero overall plot development.

510,HeroOfTomorrow,"A feeble, plot-free soft reboot of part one.",3,18 July 2021,"An utterly perplexing, stakes-free carbon copy of the first movie, A Quiet Place part 2 leaves much to be desired.In the first film, which I thought was fine for a mainstream horror, we slowly got to know the threat of the aliens and the ""cure"": high-frequency sound. While the first film really didn't have much to say, the premise was fun enough to keep you mildly engaged, and John Krasinski's sacrifice at the end had some weight. Because of the more suspenseful filming of the aliens and the high tension, you weren't constantly thinking about the glaring problems with the plot and the threat.But Part 2? Hooooo boy. Part 2 is exactly the same story as part 1, but with the stupidity and emptiness dialed up to 11. I'll go over all the problems with the film as far as I can remember all of them.-plot. You tell me: what is the story? How do the characters grow, or situations change? As far as I can tell, we know speaker feedback makes the aliens vulnerable because that happens in the first movie. In part 2, we use speaker feedback to make the aliens vulnerable. Nothing changes, nobody grows, and we learn nothing -LITERALLY NOTHING- new. Not why the aliens are here. Not why they choose to land on a majority-ocean planet when they can't swim. Not why they kill. Not why the baddies at the dock are crazy weirdos. Nothing.-plot holes and logic gaps. WHERE IS THE MILITARY? A 12-year-old can one-hand pop one of these aliens in the head with a shotgun - where is the navy? Aircraft carriers? Islands with armies? Why does everyone have power and running water, but they for some reason don't use the internet? Is this global? If so, how are islands in trouble? If not, where's the help? What is the aliens' goal? If it's just ""random killing"", there are more than enough deer in the forest. Why does the son go walk around in the dark? Why does Emily Blunt waste time honoring her dead child and husband, while she leaves her ALIVE children alone and in danger? Why on earth does a completely deaf girl wear a hearing aid? How does she survive not knowing how much sound she makes? How does a boat with an alien on it just HAPPEN to drift to the island perfectly? Why does the sprinkler system in an abandoned derelict factory still work? But mostly, again: WHERE IS THE DAMN MILITARY?-structure. At one point in the movie, I looked at my partner and asked: ""do you know where we are in the runtime? Is this the midpoint, or the end?"" Part 2 forgoes any type of structure, making it a continuous slog of linear scenes that really don't have much to do with each other. This leaves you frustrated and bored.-foreshadowing. This movie does TOO MUCH of it. Every five minutes the camera holds on something, and ten minutes later something happens with that something. This makes NOTHING a surprise.All in all, this movie has no plot, no tension, no characters... hell, it barely has dialogue. You learn nothing about the people, nothing about the aliens, and nothing matters. The ending is literally the same as the first film. No thanks.",A Quiet Place Part II
511,sybil11,"Better than the first movie, in my opinion!",8,27 May 2021,"Although we get to see a glimpse of Day 1, when this all started, essentially, this movie takes places exactly after the first. Without getting too into it, there were a couple things that my friend and I felt were out of place, but overall, we both agreed that it was better than part one. I enjoyed the pacing, and the storyline much more; the acting is also top notch, without a doubt. At least John made use of his character with act one, and it's fair to say that Cillian is still heavily underrated as an actor. Emily & Millicent were amazing, but Noah Jupe definitely stood out with his scenes. Visually, with the creatures, it was also decent, and the sound effects definitely get you in certain spots.Additionally, in comparison to other films in this type of genre (apocalyptic/horror type of movies or shows), while I did enjoy it, a fair part of the storyline isn't relatively that original. In other words, if you watch a lot of these types of movies, perhaps you know where this will go, and yes, there are dumb decisions, however, we can look at it from a human side or your typical horror movie dumb decision to further the storyline. Nonetheless, as stated, it is still an enjoyable and entertaining film to go see with your friends or family.Lastly, I can finally rate and review this, given that I was sitting on it for a week as I saw an advance screening. So, go check it out!",A Quiet Place Part II
512,nalindra-ferdinando,No where good as first movie!!!!,7,3 July 2021,I may be in the minority here but this was rather a disappointment. Direction and scares were good but too few unlike the first movie which kept the excitement throughout the movie. Plus the overall story is not great and a mess. Why someone would just take such a huge chance is not explained and makes no sense. Whilst it's decent it's clear that movie concept is struggling to keep up excitement and hope future installments would be better.,A Quiet Place Part II

I'd hoped for a conclusion to this series.....however, it is clear that there will be an endless amount of sequels to this story.",A Quiet Place Part II
514,benmundie,A Fantastic Sequel That Is Even Better Than The First!!,9,1 July 2021,"'A Quiet Place Part II' is the sequel to John Krasinski's nerve shredding 'A Quiet Place'. It is set moments after the first film's end and brings back the same magnificent cast, along with one big addition: Cillian Murphy as 'Emmett'. This movie is perfect in broadening the world that was built in the first film and makes way for future follow up titles.First of all, John Krasinski, Cillian Murphy, take a bow. Krasinski is quickly cementing himself as one of the best horror directors of the modern era as he somehow not only follows the first film but in my opinion surpasses it with great ease. Murphy's performance is stellar, he slots in perfectly after the events of the first film. He plays a broken figure after his family had been ripped away from him at the hands of the aliens that have invaded Earth. His relationship with 'Regan Abbott' (Millicent Simmonds) is brilliantly written as she takes the lead role in the film with Emily Blunt's 'Evelyn Abbott' taking a back seat to Regan's arc. Along with Simmonds, Noah Jupe's 'Marcus Abbott' is bought into the light with his arc being a key part of the story this time round.The opening scene, instantly puts the audience at the edge of their seats with high paced cuts between the usual dialogue and sound design and the point of view of Regan as she can only react to people's actions and not the sounds. The scene sets the tone for the entire film and leaves the audience flabbergasted within the first 15 minutes, which compels them to continue to watch and not move a muscle.It is really apparent that the budget this time around was vastly increased on the last movie and it shows in the designs of the aliens. Previously, the lack of a budget meant that the aliens went unseen for large portions of the film but now they're shown more frequently and they look great, extremely menacing. Also, the sound design that accompanies the aliens is fantastic and is definitely Oscar worthy when awards season rolls back around.Overall, I loved this film, somehow it improves on the last without losing the key themes and heart that were behind the previous instalment. The ending is abrupt which suggest a sequel is on the cards along with the already announced spinoff. I personally cannot wait for whatever Krasinski brings out next.9.5/10.",A Quiet Place Part II

517,mikeyboy26,A perfect sequel!,10,1 July 2021,"Brilliant! Brilliant Brilliant! This is what a film of this genre should look ""sound"" like. Suspenseful, with a touch of horror. I enjoyed every minute of this sequel to A Quiet Place ( which i also enjoyed enormously ) i really had a interest for the well being of the characters their decisions and their outcomes. This sequel did very well to tell the story the day the creatures arrived on earth (day 1) and fleshed out some of the characters especially the young son Noah and his lack of confidence and anxiety as illustrated when he goes up to bat during the baseball game. Then again, after the events of the first film how he had continued to be afraid cautious and unsure. This was especially evident as his father (John Krasinski) was so courageous an able.The movie then showed his transformation in the finals scenes, where he steps up and protects his mother and baby sister. How joyous!Also the editing was top notch as it jumped from multiple scenes and events occurring concurrently from different locations but still with a connection. It had me me looking away through my fingers and fearful. The sound production was also absolutely perfect. When it was supposed to be quiet .....you couldn't hear a thing you shared the world of the Regan ( the hearing impaired character). At times when they were trying to be quiet all i could hear in the cinema was the buzzing of the many speakers on the wall. Finally the score was fabulous too especially highlighting when the creatures were on screen and in those tense times. A perfect example of film of this genre for me. 10.",A Quiet Place Part II

From there it's just another edge of your seat popcorn thriller. Throughout the movie everyone is still cautious of course but there more confident because they know the aliens weakness and they use it to there advantage which is cool. And we also learn a new weakness and the fact that people are just as much a danger as the aliens. The Ending was really cool too, it had me smiling and honestly I wouldn't mind a third movie.

524,Krush_Burner,A (New) Quiet Place - Still Quiet Still Cool,7,26 May 2021,"The most basic, and most important, thing one should know about ""A Quiet Place Part II"" is pretty simple: it's an extended version of the first part. Everything which constitutes an essential element in first film, appears here, and John Krasinski carefully expands these ideas to continue the story. So, this is a good sequel in a most straightforward way: it's just following the original.At it's core its still the film about the family surviving in a hostile world. But dramatic pieces are moved to the background for the sake of suspense and pacing. There's also less character development (since most of them were already established in the first part) but more horror. Krasinski uses ""stay quiet to stay alive"" concept for lots of chills and thrills. To keep the tension, film also uses parallel editing and it's really looks refreshing.Of course, some of the family members (as well as Cillian Murphy's character) sometimes acts kinda rushy, but all such decisions look and feel convincing. There's some shortage of gore and blood, as well as in the first film, given the speed and ferocity of the creatures. Last but not least, great acting work from Emily Blunt and Millicent Simmonds. Go see it if you're fan of the original. Or if you just love small-scaled post-apocalyptic stories with a human touch.",A Quiet Place Part II

530,jacobsperling,"As someone who hates 99% of movies made today, this movie-a sequel no less-is a worthy successor to the original",9,4 August 2021,"Wow. Shockingly, somehow, someway, John Krasinski has done it again.As stated above, 99% of what is released today is absolute garbage. The only true cinema still around is Christopher Nolan's mastery and the occasional gem (1917, A Hidden Life, The King's Speech, Sicario, etc.). So when I took a chance and actually watched A Quiet Place back in 2018, I was absolutely stunned by how good it was. It's acting, originality, cinematography and score were excellent, not to mention immensely gripping throughout.But when I heard they were making a sequel, I groaned out load (not an exaggeration). Yet again, proving that money is what it's all about nowadays, another good movie was going to be followed up by a horrendous sequel, such as Jaws or Jurassic Park; extremely rare is the quality sequel such as The Empire Strikes Back or The Godfather Part II.But this film, in another stunner, is fantastic. Krasinski's excellent direction and script shine in this much darker, even more intense sequel that retains all the elements that made its predecessor great while taking on an entirely new plot. The acting is, once again, phenomenal. Emily Blunt nails it again (I thought she had the best performance of the year in 2018), and yet she is matched step-for-step (""line-by-line"" doesn't really work here, if you get my drift) by an utterly brilliant Millicent Simmonds, who shines in every moment she appears onscreen, and the always excellent (and incredibly underrated) Cillian Murphy (hearing that he would be in this film was what gave me hope that it would live up to the hype), to go along with another great performance by Noah Jupe. Polly Morgan's 35mm cinematography follows in the footsteps of Charlotte Bruus Christensen's from the first film-one can't help but take notice of the wide, sweeping shots despite the nonstop tension, and Marco Beltrami provides another extremely tense, gripping, yet hauntingly emotional score.All in all, this is about as worthy a successor to the original as one could have hoped for. Brilliant, gripping, pulse-pounding, yet emotional; the only thing it doesn't do is make Part 3 (as in the actual Part 3, not the Jeff Nichols installment) come out any faster.",A Quiet Place Part II
531,lauren0531,Rated the first one a 10/10,7,10 June 2021,"John Krasinki's absence from this movie is a HUGE loss. Emily Blunt's diminished appearance time is also a huge loss.

I craved to connect with another character and longed to genuinely care about another, but found myself irritated with the screaming boy and independent girl, whom both just literally lost their father only a day or two prior.Would absolutely LOVE to see a 3rd film focusing again on Krasinksi and Blunt, their relationship and their struggles as parents in a very COVID-like world. It would be very fun to see not only day 1 and days 89 and 400-something, but also night 1, and days 2-88, so that we can see their reaction to finding out they're having a baby in a quiet world, so that we can see how they prepare their home to be silent, so that we can see them call their parents and friends, and so that we can see them struggle to teach their children how to become quiet when children simply are not.I just crave so much more than what the sequel provided and definitely was let down.

The aliens should have a purpose and a target...It's dumb to put a girl who is barely a teenager on a suicide mission to God knows where, in reality no child would try something that stupid after seeing what those creatures can do and will do...Great cinematography, great acting, great audience control but plot was too random... And too short, I was expecting a two hours plus and that ending was a big no for me, more like the movie ended at the wrong point...Where it ended felt like it was just starting... Please John come back with a better part 3.Establish more on the alien purpose and create more dangerous humans as challenges too as there was at the boat yard.Add twists and more... This movie didn't meet up for me... I gave it a 5 because it went quite well but when I got to the end I was like ""is that it? Is that all there is?""Good work John but this can be way better.",A Quiet Place Part II

There is an inevitable series that is going to take place. I hope they make more, but how many more? Hopefully all equally as awesome as the first two.Cillian Murphy made me love the sequel. I have followed him since I first watched him in Sunshine.

560,evilpinklolita,Both better and worse than Part 1,7,3 June 2021,"I went to see the movie yesterday. It was one of the best sequels I've ever seen. The alternating POVs were interesting and the acting was superb, especially by Blunt, Murphy, and Simmonds. But it still didn't answer the one question I wanted answered: where the creatures came from. A sequel wasn't necessary, since the characters already knew how to kill the aliens. I expected closure from the movie and didn't get any, although seeing some background on the town before the invasion was nice. But the movie ended too abruptly, without a good resolution. It seemed an obvious setup to a part 3. Due to the lack of development of the storyline, I think I would pass on seeing a Part 3. But if you see it, see it in the theater.

It's a very fine ending to a satisfying sequel that could never have hoped to live up to its predecessor.Emily Blunt and Cillian Murphy do their bit admirably but this is Milicent Simmonds' movie.

I caved in to go see this b/c there were a handful of good reviews and like I said, I've been frothing at the mouth to see where this would go given that I absolutely loved the first one.I'll just cut to the chase: it goes by quickly without much happening (at least it feels that way), it's almost a rehash of the first film and feels like mainly an intermediate setup for a 3rd film. A Quiet Place would've been better as a one-and-done film outside of A Quiet Place 2's opening sequence, which is agreeably wonderful (though very similar to The Last of Us' opening cinematic).There is at least one dumb plot contrivance towards the end of the film that helps to bring it down a little bit.Anyhow...I'm glad I supported this film, but was disappointed that it didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped.",A Quiet Place Part II

571,cameronmcclure,Glaring plot hole - still excellent,8,2 September 2021,"There a glaring plot hole at the start of this movie but you can get over it quite easy I'm not sure how many people would notice but still I'm a big fan of the first and didn't take much to be quite obvious for me.Basically I'm stuck between if the first film now ended wrongly or if the second film just ignored the ending of the first because it would be impractical for it to continue to acknowledge. Basically at the end of the first movie it ends with the mum shooting the spider alien thing with a shotgun and then end take shows lots of them running towards the farm house because they obviously heard the gun shots, whereas in the second film, they simply walk out the farm house gather their things and get out of there. So either they ignored the fact they showed an overwhelming amount of them coming to attack, and realised we wouldn't logically be able to find a way out of this for the start of the second film, so just hope for the best and it's not picked up too much and carry on. Alternatively, they realised it maybe should haven't ended that way to continue with the story and went with their new stance on the subject.

572,Naive-fox,Not quite there... yet,6,6 July 2021,"John Krasinski's sequel to the well received first instalment he himself directed is almost an opposite of its predecessor. While the first part blasted off with a great start only to slip midways and derive into a pretty mediocre film with a terrible ending, its sequel starts with a less than worthy reveal of the origin of it all, with so many absurd situations just for the convenience of the plot and to build up tension (how can it be total chaos in the streets but one second later be so quiet that monsters are even paying attention to the slightest of sounds inside of closed locals?) it's almost infuriating, but picks up and ends in a way better fashion than 2018's instalment.Krasinski's able hand at directing is still very noticeable. The pacing of the films is very adequate and along with the gorgeous cinematography (that salvaged the first one and is just as good this time) makes the whole film fly by. And while the script is far from perfect and raises many questions about the state of the threat worldwide and humanity's inability to deal with an enemy with so many flaws and weak points, it still edges the first one story wise, even if everything outside Regan's and Emmett's plot line does nothing but drag the film, Noah Jupe's character and performance were enough to annoy me to unexpected degree and the elements introduced late into the film provide little to no payoff. Even so it still maintains a much more pleasing exposition-conflict-resolution structure and an ending that, while still abrupt and dragged by the terrible CGI in the later fights, is still much more well rounded than the blatant senseless cut its predecessor ended with.If something's clear is that probably Krasinki himself and if not someone else will definitely go for another one. Maybe third one is the charm and 'A quiet place' finally receives the instalment it really deserves but it's not quite yet getting.",A Quiet Place Part II

582,solminafya,The quiet place is probably the filmmaker's skulls!,2,29 June 2021,"I'd give the two stars for the few good jump scares, and maybe Cillian's performance. Otherwise, meh, even Emily's performance is overacted!The movie start with a very brief backstory, which involves a comet gets through the atmosphere at a very sharp angle, which cannot hit the earth except maybe hundreds of miles away. Seeing this comet, for no obvious reason, everyone heads to their cars. Why? Nobody knows!Only a minute later, the creatures (that cannot mathematically have even landed) start slashing and shredding people, in a supposedly traumatic and surprising situation. Nevertheless, everyone hides in some building and stay quiet (which can never happen so quickly in such a panic) as if they already know that these creatures have subsonic level hearing on which they rely for their attacks! Even Karasinski quiets an onld man whisppering with prayer as if he already knows the trick to evade anlien monsters who just happened to land on earth during his son's baseball game!!That was (supposed to be) the backstory, which added litereally nothing to the movie except that we knew that the creatures are aliens. Thanks, 12 wasted minutesThroughout the movie, too many rediculous things that don't make any sense. Most notably the bandit subplot. I feal like it's only put there to fulfill the movie's tagline: ""...they realize the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats lurking beyond the sand path"", because it absolutely adds nothing to the story except that! I mean, who TF would rob a necless in a post apocalyptic world where everyone's merely trying to stay alive by avoiding the slasher creaters! Another 8 minutes wasted on literally nothingBack to the begining of the story. Regan (Millicent Simmonds) who can't hear anything decide to go out to rescue a world that she can't even hear any of its threats, let aside hearing the noise that she makes, which attracts the aliens!Skipping a lot of BS and flying up to imagine that post appocalyptic world, where nobody thought to use supersonic or ultra loud sounds to at least impair hypersensitive to sound creatures until they seemingly eliminated humanity! In AQP 1 we didn't know much of the backstory, so it was left open for many plausible interpretation. But now after we knew, does this already sound rediculous enough??Some of the other BS, the creature that ""accidentally"" reaching the safe island merely by staying on a boat (note that the creactures don't recognize their weakness in water, nor even see it), the creature unable to tear Evylen and her sons trapped two feet away, and in the same time the other creature is so slow attacking Emmett, Regan dramatically plays the song before she sticks her earpiece to the microphone, and oh boy! Marcus's confident walk regardless of his beartrap destroyed leg towards the creature, with a Harry Potter look on his face, killing a creature that wasn't killed by three shotgun rounds using a single revolver round, which his mother could have used in her previous engagement with it instead of the dramatic fule exploision that didn't even scratch it!!Man I got tired writing this! I want to delete from my memory! RUN AWAY AS LOUD AND QUICKLY AS YOU CAN!",A Quiet Place Part II
583,TrueNumber-38,What a Terrific Sequel!,9,31 May 2021,"Knowing that A Quiet Place was such a great and prestigious movie, I was hoping that A Quiet Place Part II would be as well ... and it definitely was! If you were a huge fan of the first movie, than you will be astounded by this sequal. It has everything that one would want in a horror movie; suspense, drama, and plenty of jump scares! I saw the film at the cinemas and I'm very glad that I did; it really enhances those jump scares and makes you and all other watchers just want to be quiet.Compared to the first movie, this one is definitely a more than worthy sequel. It pretty much picks up from how and where the last one ended, but it additionally throws in several more characters and interesting conflicts. Some might worry that it would seem a bit mediocre since the film is being picked up from where it left off and stretched into a whole other movie, but that is not the case at all. While the film is rather short (compared to most other sequels), it was very well done and it didn't seem as if it was being stretched out in the slightest. Each conflict that arose was completely original and unexpected, yet at the same time, true and compatible to the first film.But the movie was, of course, not flawless or perfect. It was lacking a few little details in the story line (which are for you to discover and judge), but could easily be excused depending on the viewer. However, one issue that I had with the film was the effects of starting from where the first A Quiet Place film left off. There were noticeable changes in the scenery and characters compared to the last film, but mostly the aging of the characters. But I suppose that there isn't really much that can be done about these things.All things considered, I have decided to give the movie a 8.5 (9)/10, as 10/10 would be saying a lot about it and 8/10 just wouldn't be enough for this terrific movie sequel.",A Quiet Place Part II

No. Everything is perfect! The sound and ambience is beyond chilling. The writing and acting is just top notch! The suspense is a whole another level. It's so damn quiet that one noise you hear, it'll literally startle you. John Krasinski is just one of the best directors out there right now. He knows what he wants, he knows what he's going for, he knows the definition of horror very, very well! He just knows how to put people in a position to where they feel major desperation for the characters. He doesn't half ass anything. He knows what to put on the table. I'm just so happy I had very high expectations for this and it turned out amazing just the way I thought it would be. While I can't say anything else about the movie, just go see it.

We then continue right where ""A Quiet Place"" left us and the pacing of the movie just feels right, more quick-paced than the first one, which is to be expected since we already know what's going on.The new character, played by Cillian Murphy, was well introduced and had a natural integration into the story. You get so much character development, especially with the kids, so exciting! The last few minutes were so, so good, I just didn't want the movie to end!Emily Blunt was also amazing, she can do no wrong, you can see how tired and broken her character is by the events that took place in the previous movie, but she doesn't have time to dwell and to mourn, she has to make sure her family is okay and that is even more impactful.Overall, if you enjoyed the first movie then there is no reason not to love this one also, Krasinski's direction is better, the character development is on point, and aside from some moments where the characters should have just stood still instead of running like crazy, the movie is pretty flawless.

598,kh-17438,"These Are the Meanest Extraterrestrials Ever,",10,13 June 2021,"And how ever did they get here anyway? My godson thought it was some sort of meteorite that delivered them to earth, but I reminded him of the pharmacy scene where the store's television showed people running and scattering away from something in Singapore. So there could not have been simultaneous meteorites delivering these monsters to decimate earth's human population. But just what was, was being italicized, going on in the sky on Day 1?And what is the mission of the monsters? I did not see any of the monsters snacking on humans-just killing them and tossing them around like rag dolls.Are they here to make way for more intelligent extraterrestrials who are interested in establishing a culture and way of life on earth? And are the monsters the original colonists getting rid of the any population that would not mesh well with theirs?Where are the scientists dissecting these things and testing their blood and giving the viewer some information on the monsters' etiology?What is with the monsters not being able to swim, but yet they can commandeer a boat?And were the human people at the boatyard cannibals on methamphetamines? We were not sure, but they looked to be up to absolutely no good whatsoever.And the monsters tearing up the roofs? I must say it is hard to watch when it cost me a fortune to replace mine.We loved all of the characters, in both movies. I will stick to QP, P II for this review: Marcus was so annoying, getting out of the dungeon when his mom was very clear he should not. But all was forgiven when he saved his family. More than likely they would not have needed saving had he listened to his mom. We loved Regan and that a young girl figured out a complex message, and could make monsters bow down to her is just mega hero stuff. Of course I worried during the movie however would Regan's hearing aid be replaced if it were lost, and then my fear was realized. It was lost and then found by Emmett. Evelyn is our hero mom and getting her boy out of a bear trap without fainting says how much strength she has, and Emmett turned out to be an admirable guy for the ages. We can't leave out the baby-he's adorable.So I'm giving it a 10 as my rating and I have more questions than ever. I am am rooting for the Abbott family in my noisy place here in the world, as we know it today.",A Quiet Place Part II

600,steven_wallery,Solid sequel,9,30 May 2021,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and found myself tearing up throughout the movie because I couldn't stop thinking about the sacrifice the dad made in the first one that is the only reason they're still alive. A powerful scene that stuck with me throughout part 2. The young kids are exceptional actors and have a. Right future. Cillian Murphy was awesome as usual My favorite part of the film are the scenes where both of the split up parties have scenes paralleling each other. I thought that was refreshing. The design of the monsters overall is one of my favorite designs in any movie. Very unique looking. Definitely see this in the IMAX.,A Quiet Place Part II
601,Jacobs43,I really wanted to like this...,5,18 July 2021,"I really wanted to like this but, yet again, the sequel is filled with many plot holes and contrivances and telegraphed jump scares.To its credit, the actors were all good in their roles and the score adds to the anxiety. It seems as if the ending to this sequel is set up for a third installment. It would be interesting to see some explanation of the aliens: Where did the come from? How did they come to Earth? (especially since they seem so primitive) Why do they seem to just kill for the sake of killing?",A Quiet Place Part II
602,jaeelbooks,Huh...,3,4 August 2021,"Well... that was lackluster. After the hype, I had expected a rather fast-paced flick with a ton of scares and maybe a conclusion to the story. Instead, it was a slow and mostly boring movie with a rather 'non-ending.'",A Quiet Place Part II
603,taborfreddy,"Pretty good, but missing a little something!",7,16 August 2021,"I enjoyed this film, but I think the ending could have offered a little something more. For example, the attack scene at the island hideout could've had more monsters, and the battle to defeat them given an extra five minutes or so. I also would have like to see the whole Abbott family together on the island fighting the monsters. Which brings me to the other issue.I didn't care much for the back and forth scenes between Emmett, and Evelyn Abbott. I think there was too much of it. Perhaps, Evelyn should've defeated her monster and then came to the island to help fight the rest of the monsters. In fact, I thought that Evelyn would join Emmett and Regan on the island in this film, and then the ending. Overall, I think it was a good film, and one that will make it in my movie collections.",A Quiet Place Part II

609,tyelder,Terrifying audiences once again...in SILENCE,10,10 November 2021,"The man, Jim Halpert himself, John Krasinski has hit it out of the park once again in A Quiet Place Part II. Expectations were extremely high coming into this much-anticipated sequel yet, it brought back everything that made the original so special and took it to the next level. Krasinski's story takes us further into this silent post-apocalyptic world where we get to see how others have survived-some turning into monsters themselves.A Quiet Place had one of the greatest opening scenes of any movie, so Krasinski had to go and top it with Part II. We get to finally see what happened on Day 1, but we realize it's a good thing we had to wait for it because it was so much more wholesome seeing John's character 'Lee' back-and of course, made it more terrifying. From there, we get another 90-minute suspense ride where anyone with a heartbeat will be at the edge of their seat until the excellently-timed credits roll.Being a sequel, AQP2 had some pre-determined hurdles to cross with the biggest being originality. That's difficult to achieve, so what Krasinski did was expand the 'Quiet' universe to include additional characters that helped this broken family learn another important lesson. In the first film, they learned forgiveness and now they have to learn an equally hard lesson, letting go. The wonderful Emily Blunt portrays the strong protective mother who, by the end of the film, learns that her two oldest are ready to face the world because they have been raised by her and her husband.Written meticulously, directed precisely, shot beautifully, and edited rhythmically-this is cinema at its greatest and funnest. This movie was made to be seen in a theater packed with strangers all enjoying each scare as they jolt their popcorn from their laps. Luckily, I was able to have this experience with my family who haven't been back to the movies in well over a year. All thanks to A Quiet Place Part II for simply making us hold our own breath once again for the duration of what is one of the best sequels ever made.Regardless if there's a Part III, this one will speak loud next to its predecessor as it kept its promise to continue to scare us all, in silence.-TE (6.1.21)",A Quiet Place Part II
610,joannabarker-04823,Looking forward to part III,9,12 June 2021,Didn't feel like a repeat of the first one. Character development moved along nicely. Great pace. Lots of jump scares.

611,louieshowers,I wanted all the characters to die after the first 30 min.,1,12 August 2021,"This was a movie that was super annoying. Everyone made these over-dramatic facial expressions and because of this, they over-acted every scene. The kids in the film were slow motion moving, mopey-faced creatures that just didn't carry the film.The other thing that desperately needs to happen is some sort of explanation of what the heck is going on! Where are the aliens from? How widespread is this attack? Are they visiting or planning to take over? All we get is Emily Blunt making mopey, sweaty long faces and kids that try to be as charismatic as the Stranger Things cast. This movie was just another dud.",A Quiet Place Part II

Predictable, you saw everything coming.Oh well, it was short, good length. Had it been over 2h - The rating would have been 6/10.",A Quiet Place Part II

The entire crew delivered excellent performances. This is a remarkable movie in many many ways. I look forward to AQP3.",A Quiet Place Part II
614,michielodb,"Not as good as the first one, still better than everything else.",7,5 July 2021,"I really liked the first A Quiet Place because it was so refreshing and well-made. I extremely appreciate the attention to detail and character that John Krasinski put in it.The second film is exactly the same in that way. Almost all of the focus goes to the characters (although there are still some great monster scenes of course). Not to mention that the great Cillian Murphy is added to the cast to sort of replace John Krasinski's character.That being said, one core element did bug me (just like in the first movie): the pacing. Without credits, this film is around 88 minutes long...which is really short. Although the events still feel natural, there are certain cases of scenes happening/ending very abruptly. My main gripe with the first film was that it ended just like that, very abruptly. It did help on second viewing. A Quiet Place: Part II probably has the most abrupt ending I've ever seen. It ends right in the middle of a scene, and suddenly all sound just stops and we cut to black...credits. It really left me confused. Now I get that they are probably going to make a third one (which I am all for!) but I do hope they are going to work on these pacing/editing issues. I get you want to end a film with a sort of open ending so you can make a sequel, but at least make it flow in a natural way instead of just cutting to black at the most random point.It's not as good as the first one in my opinion, and it did kinda dissapoint me. Mind you, the entire prologue where we get to see the events of ""Day 1"" is absolutely GREAT.Not as good as its predecessor, but still better than all the other thrillers these days.",A Quiet Place Part II

617,adirbell,Better... but still meh,7,20 August 2021,"This sequel was better than the first film, which had so many ridiculously unrealistic expectations for a storyline, that from the first scene I was wondering why they expect us to believe the family managed to live without coughing or sneezing for years, giving birth silently etc. You get the point.AQPII started with a bang. Honestly the first scene was so intense and entertaining that I wished it wouldn't end. Arguably the first scene was better than the entire franchise. The movie was OK, and had some scenes that were full of tension, however the characters are lacking real depth except for the mother that carried the film literally on her back with the baby and two kids, if only someone could help her to make this a better story.",A Quiet Place Part II

They do a lot of dumb stuff, many more than a typical horror movie that's rated as low as possible for being ""dumb"" but at least fun. Really stupid creature moments.Lastly, nothing really happens.

It excels in Hitchcockian suspense and each of the tense scenes has a satisfactory payoff, especially the ending.

625,ekimmichael,We clearly didn't need a sequel,6,4 July 2021,"I didn't really get at first why John was doing a sequel but he kinda explained he was literally forced to do it cause they would've done it with or without him but Part II is a big deception when you put it with the perfection of Part I. There was so many potential instead they turned it into a basic horror movie where characters are doing stupid thing and spectators are telling them to not do it cause they're gonna die and they do like when the boy went to explore while his mom went to look for meds that's not Quiet place at all at this point he would have never done something so stupid I would understand him leaving the baby out of necessity like to look for water and food and then something happen but not just ""exploring"" while his character is clearly the less brave so that part was just a killer. When they met with the wild people out there the people that are ""not worth saving"" that seen was completely incoherent first they went into a trap so obvious cause there was electricity all along first I thought it was some mistake maybe to have more brightness for the scene but then seeing it was a trap was completely unfit cause the characters would have known it was one at the first place because electricity or what're it was doesn't come out from nothing, so they went into that obvious trap which the only solution to escape was obviously the beasts but they took so long to execute something so simple and ""obvious""knowing you already have one of the beasts weakness, now they use that scene to introduce another weakness ok but it would've been so much better if those wild people knew about that weakness which would've been the reason for him to leave near the sea, and when they obviously call the beast to escape the trap the wild people should have some kinda of ""marche à suivre"" à way of reaction to a possible attack so while they are dealing with the beast the main characters use that distraction to escape to the island while they are being followed by the wild people. So the island people are not just going to live their life freely like they picture in any realistic end of the world even know the beast can't swim that doesn't mean they aren't gonna prepare for a possible infestation so the island should've had barricade, protocols of action, trained and prepared people to act with tower watch 24/24 so they could've had so much action in that island with the main characters and the wild people and some beast to crack it all and in all that chaos the main characters are making their way to the signal tower to play the interference song ending with epic suspense and sacrifices with the girl losing blood and at last boom she puts it right before falling and then the beast that was going to eat her stopped immediately while Cillian cut his head off with a fire axe. And everyone knows when you put Djimon as secondary character it's for good action they literally did nothing with him such a waste. Last flaw would be the first encounter of John with one of the beast near the police car you don't just start running when you don't even know what's going on you first get shock by the event maybe fell on the ground and then putting gradually your mind together when you start running all that could've have happen in the same amount of time they had for that scene. One last thing the pharmacy scene when they made a long shot at the kid plane was just unnecessary we're not kid they could have just pass it on just like they did for the rest of the items. Once again I don't think a sequel was necessary but if he was forced he should've been at least as explained there or maybe more wonderful ideas to not ruin a beautiful concept like that I hope Don't Breath 2 won't make the same mistake(not necessary either).....",A Quiet Place Part II
626,keywester-05337,Review from regular adult,4,30 May 2021,"It is with great disappointment I give this a 4. Since QP2 was delayed by covid, I was really looking forward to seeing this. It was to mark the end of covid and the beginning of this going back to normal with a big blockbuster movie. But, this movie is so slow! There is nothing new here, nothing. Same creatures, same using sound to defeat them, same everything. This movie relies heavily on child actor Millicent Simmonds and she is just too inexperienced and uncompelling to pull it off. Emily is only in about 20% of the movie with Millicent and Cillian trying to do it themselves and it does not work. The end is just a setup for QP3, thats it.The best part of the movie is the beginning which is a prequel and I was thinking YES! But, it doesn't last and the boredom begins. Long boring scenes of nothing new. VERY disappointed.",A Quiet Place Part II

628,petereviews,A Decent Rollercoaster Ride,7,2 July 2021,"(NOTE: All spoilers of the film will be in the cons and identified in a spoiler warning)THE PROS: A Quiet Place II follows its predecessor's footsteps in creating a memorable opening sequence that is easily the highlight of the movie.The expanded scope and wordbuilding in this film at parts is interesting, even if underdeveloped (see the cons).The first 20-30 minutes of this movie has minimal background music (one of my largest gripes with the first movie) that does wonders for the tension before it comes back in full force.While the negatives will appear to be long, I do want to praise the film's brisk runtime; while not as good as the first movie, it was an entertaining ride and I did have a good time watching it even if I doubt I will be remembering much of it in a month.THE CONS: I won't go into spoilers quite yet but will say that there were a lot of questionable character decisions in this movie, as well as the monster being inconsistent of how quick and ruthless it was as a killer.My biggest gripe with both films, however, has been with the movies not living up to their title. Both movies excel and are memorable in scenes that leave the characters struggling to be quiet in order to not be killed. Sadly, the movie seems skittish with this novel concept and insists in putting in ""suspenseful"" background music that spoonfeeds the audience of what they should be feeling at all times and ruins any moment of horror by having viewers bracing for impact.And then there are the story problems with this movie....(SPOILERS):Why does Emily Blunt's character not go herself after her missing child but forces an acquaintance from the old world to go instead?When Emily Blunt's character leaves the bunker, why does her son decide to leave and poke around the area aimlessly?Who were the survivors on the boat area and what was their motive/purpose?Why is the monster a ruthless, effective killer in some scenes (opening, attack at the camp) and then takes its sweet time to attack when it comes to the protagonists?Why was the ending so abrupt? What was the arc or character growth in this film?... the list goes on(END SPOILERS)The Verdict: Overall it was a fun time at the movies but A Quiet Place Part II is not something I would put as essential viewing.",A Quiet Place Part II
629,snowadian,Not every movie needs a sequel,7,27 September 2021,"The first movie was a 10, and the story should've ended after one movie. Revisiting this world with a sequel seemed cheap and bereft of any real emotion after how the last one ended.Every hit at the box office triggers a sequel as they are usually guaranteed opening weekend success.

632,bobbyem-1,I didn't like the first one - this is even worse,4,23 September 2021,"So the first one has a lot of good things, It looks great and the acting is pretty good. My biggest problem with these movies is the writing. You have to check the brain at the door and since the tone is so serious.One thing that always bother me in monster movies is how some monsters are completely impervious to harm. And in this movie universe in a land built on making the most powerful small arms like the 50cal and so on, none of these can put even a dent in these fleshy creatures?And that is just on the civilian side, what about the military? These movies claim that not even a missle from a jet or a minigun could take one of these monsters down? Like I said this is a problem of credability that the film creates for itself by trying to be realistic and super serious.These creatures can't fly and they can't swim. The meteor they came on struck somewhere in the US so the rest of the world should be fine to help them kill these things. Send in containers loaded with alarm clocks and napalm.Place warships on the coast with loudspeakers and just pick the stupid creatures of one by one.I don't think they did a good job with the story. Why did they feel the need to put a new father figure in the film? The strong female character played by Blunt was the obvious choice to be the driving force in this next installment. Instead she is sort of just running around doing nothing. The kids are stupid and selfish and the only really capable character is the new man.I love monster movies and I should like these but they are borderline pretentious and really stupid, I am sad to say it.",A Quiet Place Part II
633,toredah-1,Good - but at least 30 minutes too short,7,14 June 2021,"I enjoyed the first one, and this one as well. The monsters are (mostly) convincing,and are so fast and devastating that it feels believable that they could subvert the entire planet in a short time - as opposed to zombies in other films and series, that are so slow and weak that they can be killed with a stick most of the time.But that said, the movie could have been a lot more interesting, with more insight into the first days (and not only THE first day) and weeks, with a more thorough character building, especially for Cillian Murphy. I'd welcome a Director's Cut here, 45 minutes longer, to enable us to know about the circumstances that resulted in the first film. Some scenes also seem a bit underdeveloped, like the marina confrontation and the island community ones.But all in all, a solid effort, just desired even more.",A Quiet Place Part II

635,chloeurc,Good sequel,7,5 June 2021,"Pros:
-A worthy sequel! The sequel is just as good as the first film! The film dives a little more into the plot, story and origin of this crazy apocalypse while also introducing some great new characters (Cillian and Djimon!)-Acting. Everyone does a great job on acting! Specifically the kids. The actors that play the kids are the same cast from the first one except the actors are older and they've gotten more talented! They are the heart of the movie and really shine!-More intense. One thing about the first one was that it was a little slow the first half of the movie. Part 2 was a lot more intense! Way more monsters and crazy intense scenes! A bigger film for sure!Cons:-Some inconsistency. There were things that were in the first film that for some reason never made it into the sequel, things that would of been big moments in the film that were nothing. I can't say specifically or else it would be a spoiler!-TV show vibes. These movies seem a lot like tv episodes. They have plot holes you won't know till later and cliffhanger moments throughout each movie. It can be frustrating because it's not a tv show and needs more closure. Unless they are planning to do a bunch of sequels, it can be frustrating.-Short. Both of the films are only an hour and a half. While some may love that I didn't. It needed more in my opinion, they had the time they could have finished some cliffhangers and origin scenes.Solid film though and worthy sequel!Both films are 7/10.",A Quiet Place Part II

I was getting increasingly bored (ever thought it's a 90 min movie). The best character is the daughter. Emily Blunt always seems on the verge of hysteria, the son is a whiny puss with no courage or smarts for that matter (I mean he couldn't handle staying alone with baby brother for a little while when Mom had to go get medical supplies AND he screws up and about kills the baby and himself) and PLEASE tell me how they have the most quiet, non crying baby EVER? And the poor baby has to live his life is a dark box. The family go off (which I didn't understand why) to find a so-called ""friend"" who wasn't much of one to begin with. He does come around and saves the daughter because apparently aliens creatures make survivors turn into mean, robbing, vengeful a$$holes.What really did it for me in not liking it was the movie just ends leaving AQP 3 a 100% CERTAIN!

Our family unit is now forced out into the great wide open which sets up a pulsating set of run ins with the best set of manic aliens in a lonnggg time - they really are scary good.Fast pacing, good effects, great tension and some clever editing of concurrent scenes totally set this movie apart from the pack. What really raises the bar on both 'A Quiet Place' films though is the unique use of atmospheric sound effects, which are of course essential elements to the whole storyline. Too bad Simon and Garfunkel's seminal Sounds of Silence wasn't used somewhere along the line for fun though.Yep, I was generally really impressed with this one - and it looks like a third instalment will be on the cards soon... but be sure NOT to shout from the rooftops about it - or else!!",A Quiet Place Part II

It does seem the characters get away with a bit more noise now, and the alien reactions are not as immediate. But there's still no explanation of their purpose other than taking any available opportunity to fatally smack anyone upside the head for no other purpose than just 'cuz. And let's be honest, the whole baby in a box with an oxygen mask remaining just quiet enough to keep everyone safe is ludicrous. But they opened that ridiculous plot line in the first movie and now they are stuck with it.A new male character is introduced with little other reason than taking over for dearly departed dad, despite the predicted initial resistance. And despite the big budget, the computer generated aliens still appear like glorified cartoons. Lots of other twists and turns seem ill-conceived and don't really make much sense. And when the movie ends basically in the middle of a situation, it's clear this is going to extend to an ongoing series of movies. And while it was harmless fun, I'm not sure how far they can extend this premise, especially if there's not much effort put into expanding the reasons for the aliens and what they are doing.",A Quiet Place Part II

680,MikeeMike,there is absolutely NOTHING necessary about this movie,4,7 June 2021,"... mainly because it doesn't need to exit.Usually, the sequel film needs to offer the audience something new, whether it's a new story, new theme, or in the case of monster movies - bigger and badder monsters. But no..... not this movie! Quiet Place 2 did nothing of the sort, except for the exact same movie as the first, except told in a much, much less entertaining and interesting way. It was almost an attempt to remake the first film, but failing miserably.The goals of the first film's protagonists were straightforward and clear, like every apocalyptic/ zombie/ monster film ever: find a way to get to safety while hoping to try and defeat the opponent. THAT'S IT, that's all we need. But of course not, because the characters in the second film want the same (safety) but only with less storytelling power because they're going out of their way to find unnecessary safety. Secondly, if you already know how to kill the monsters, and the monsters don't upgrade at all, then the same tension/ threat doesn't exist. Therefore, the characters would have to go out of their way to put themselves in danger's way - like separating, being deaf and alone in the field, or creating a false emergency with the oxygen tank - which brings me to a side argument: in the post-apocalyptic world ran by monsters, farms in the middle of now where and towns have the same level of threat, because people don't gather in towns any more, therefore there shouldn't be more monsters in town than in the wild. SO then, why would they travel out of the way into the outskirts and walk back into town for oxygen supply? WHY NOT just find a spot in town close to supply? Because again, the threat levels should closely relate. But I digress...
The second movie should have been about the evil of mankind despite monsters running around. Which seems cliche but isn't easy to write. This film tried, but again failed. You're telling me a group of savages that survive by luring victims to the docks don't know the monsters can't swim? Even on top of that, why are they savages already? It hasn't been that long since the incident, and it's not zombies, being savages doesn't give you more leverage with the aliens than being regular people... demonstrated by the awful scenes by the dock.. which again, absolutely unnecessary.Or it could have been two parallel stories of kids growing up: coming of age stories, which again, Krazinsky tried to do but didn't really have confidence in himself to stick with it. Too much attention was diverted to the side character Murphy played.. who served no purpose other than replace the director's role in the first film. He didn't feel confident enough to leave the kids' stories be and had to step in with a substitute of himself, which not only ruined the storytelling, but downplayed the climax. Which, by the way, was terribly parallel edited because the pace weren't even remotely on the same speed.Enough of that. This movie needed reasons to exist, other than cash at the box office. I saw potential but none followed through. Thoroughly disappointed after a stunning debut from an actor-director.",A Quiet Place Part II
681,berk_ozenc,Everything was great until the end.,7,29 July 2021,"I can easily say that this second movie of A Quiet Place managed to be as scary as the first one with having more tempo.Even though now we got used to the appearance of those monsters and know that they are killable, I still got terrified in every scene that has those monsters. I had thought that those monsters would feel like zombies from the movies that are just there to create some action sequences and die after that since we now know about them more. However, I was wrong. Those monsters were still terrifying, like in the first movie. I believe that camera angles and music have a lot of influence on that, so I think the director, John Krasinski, has done an excellent job. The movie had a strong opening, which I believe ended a bit abruptly and too soon. When we first saw that thing like a huge fireball was falling from the sky, I had goosebumps. I also loved Cillian Murphy's character, Emmett. But, I can't understand why he is okay to do anything when someone merely ""pretty pleases"" him after he clearly states that he will never do that or help them.There are other things that tangled me as well. After Emily Blunt's character Evelyn leaves the shelter to grab some medicine, I couldn't reason why the hell the kid Marcus left that shelter. I think a coward character like him leaving the shelter does not make any sense. I think the only reason he left there was to get into trouble and give us something to watch. In addition to that, when Marcus saw the skeletons behind the curtains, I expected to see something revealing an evil secret of Emmett. It just turned out to be something to scare him so that monsters can come.I expected to see more from Djimon Hounsou's character since they showed him in the trailers and introduced him like he might play a considerable role in the future. I felt quite disappointed when I saw him die after 15 minutes after his introduction to the film because as I said, I pictured him in my head to be more important. Last but not least, the thing that tangled me the most is how the hell did that monster manage to come to the island with that boat by itself. The explanation might be something like the water flow, but I still think that this thing has to be clarified. Those were just the little things that confused me a bit. It did not really affect my watching pleasure, but the next thing that I'm going to talk about did.I feel something incomplete about the ending. The movie just ended while it deserved a proper final that resolved most of the things. I am aware that they did this to give something to part III, but I think it is enough. Because they just ended abruptly, it does not feel like a complete film and leaves a weird taste in your mouth. It would still be okay if they presented a paragraph about what happened afterward because it would at least settle the story. Finally, they demonstrate that children killing those monsters is an important thing, even though we already knew that they can kill them. Even if they end the movie abruptly, it's better to show something that will change everything, similar to the first movie. It would be much better if someone else from far away that we do not know killed the monster because it would show that now everyone knows how to kill them with the help of the broadcast.That was all I can say about the movie. Even the end troubled me; I still had a lot of fun watching it. On the other hand, I still believe that ending in a movie is so important.",A Quiet Place Part II

Went downhill from there.We then return to the end of the first movie. The deaf daughter wires together a microphone and a portable amp to help ward off the creatures with the help of her hearing aid that is set to a frequency that disrupts the creatures ability to hear, disorients them, and leaves them vulnerable, some how, to conventional attacks.The deaf daughter then fails to use the device at several important moments. The mom is also not free from behaving stupidly as they enter the territory of another person or group and fail to look for boobytraps, stepping right through a tripwire. UGH.The deaf daughter goes off on her own looking for the source of a radio station constantly playing 'beyond the sea' instead of actually transmitting important information. Surprising considering how otherwise intelligent the character is. The mom convinces the neighbor they intruded upon to go after the daughter, which he does.It just gets more stupid from there. The son with a gravely injured leg is somehow up and at em with a limp in no time. The mother decides to leave the gravely injured boy to care of the baby. The neighbor and the deaf daughter finally make it to a safe haven on an island with a radio station. Instead of insisting that they play the hearing aid's disruptive frequency over the radio immediately, potentially saving lives immediately, they're just like 'Ya, guess we'll do that in the morning'.Jeesh, what an awful movie.

No, instead they would rather just flee from the one area on earth they know is now practically creature free.Makes sense huh? No, it's just Stupid.Just one of several inane plot devices used in this franchise milker.I wish that before they left their hidey hole, all the Abbotts had severed an artery in their feet on the nail on the staircase they curiously, simply refuse to remove or even render harmless by pounding flat.Inexplicably, The Abbotts choose to leave relative safety and plod blindly into the unknown, chasing a smoke signal from miles away where, when they arrive, they are rewarded for their trouble with the introduction of a few well placed boobie traps.Why would someone beckon people with a smoke signal if you really don't want them to come?I guess it is just a reason to keep Cillian Murphy's character around. I mean he did survive 28 Days and 28 Days Later, after all.The Abbotts even provide Cillain/Emmett with a well executed display of their creature eradication technigue.

It is less than a minute.Later, after he saves Regan from certain death in a derelict traincar, some other nonsense occurrs that forces a showdown on a pier where we learn that the creatures cannot swim.....AT ALL.But we also learn that they are excellent seamen and boat navigators, as they follow our hapless duo (Emmett and Regan) to a completely creature-free island paradise where the inhabitants welcome the newcomers with open arms to a seemingly never ending bbq, totally unaware thatsalty Captain Creature has deftly followed our heroes, makes landfall, and then sets about the rampaging task of nearly destroying everyone and everything until Regan deploys her now perfected eradication method, and brains Captain Salty with a piece of aluminum conduit that might have weighed 8 ounces.Now, I am leaving out quite a bit of John Kranzinski's hack storyline because it just wouldn't be fair to give away all of the banal, paper mache-constructed edifaces he ""borrowed"" to draw out the runtime of this third rate offering.And yes, there will be a third iteration of this soon to be forgotten sequel.",A Quiet Place Part II

693,furfur-1,A well produced poor story,5,21 July 2021,"This movie disappointed me a lot. Mostly because of the good reviews. I though the first one was already more than enough but I wondered ""they must have found some special idea hidden in the plot"". No, they did not and I have no idea why the movie has so good rates, I have a guess.Basically, the movie is pretty well produced and the effect are nice to me. It's a good foundation to be for a at least a good movie. The problem is the plot. The plot is so poor, there is nothing more to take out which you had not seen in the first 20 minutes of the first part. It's basically always the same, beside some terrible character decisions which I don't want to comment now.If you think you would re-enjoy the first 20 minutes of the first part over and over again than this movie is for you.",A Quiet Place Part II

How is the deaf girl the only one to figure out that a certain frequency of noise is harmful to the creatures? Like, could the military or no one else figure it out? And, where is the military? These creatures didn't look like they could take on F16s, choppers and battle tanks. What were those explosions in the sky in the beginning? These creatures cant fly so how? Just dumb, so dumb.

I love Millicent and the way her deafness played into all this. It even threw sign language into the eyes and hearts of millions. I along with many others probably have a new found interest/importance of sign language in this world.The flow of the movies reminds me of The Walking Dead, especially the first season. Although I do have one more thing that bothers me, how does a non powered guitar amp amplify and a non powered mic transmit to said non powered amp? 🤔 am I missing something here?I'm sooo looking forward to the 3rd installment but I must say I'm going to be very frustrated if they continue to just leave it open ended and continue to drag it out.

""They didn't explain where the aliens originated"", yeah, they did- a meteor from outer space, it was kinda obvious- not like they can tell you where they came from. In conclusion, stop giving a movie with good actors, good creatures, good animation, good scenery, and a good plot a bad review just because you find the actions illogical or stupid.

707,MelliDan,John Krasinski went all out this time.,8,12 June 2021,"'A Quiet Place Part II' is an example of the rare instance in which a sequel surpasses its original. This film has all the same elements that made part one enjoyable, but on a larger scale. There is more action, more tension and the protagonists are better developed, especially the children, as their transition to showing bravery in the face of terror is very evident.I think all the performances here are top-notch. In this film, facial expressions are everything. The scenes that have minimal dialogue, but rely on characters' actions and facial expressions to convey emotion, are what elevate this film past part one as well. The creature effects were also awesome and really keep you on pins and needles when the horror kicks in. The sound design is brilliant and makes this film an incredible theater-going experience.All in all, I highly recommend it, I think it's a very impressive sequel and I look forward to the next installment. Well done, John Krasinski.",A Quiet Place Part II

Evolution obviously did nothing to compensate for their lack of vision. Their perception of sound is so inefficient that they would be no much for Daredevil!Why is this stupid family still going barefoot? Haven't they heard of Sneakers or the etymology of the word?After all the stupid things this mother did in the first movie (first of all, bringing a baby into this nightmare world), how does she manage to leave the baby with her young son forgetting entirely to say, ""Do not put the baby in the box! There is not enough oxygen!""And for all their stupidity, these people are still the smartest in this nightmare world, since they have found so many ways to kill these monsters where all the others, including the Army, have obviously found none!Everything on Earth is wrecked, but not the boats! So many lovely boats in peak condition!And, all of a sudden, the monsters learn to sail!The people in this movie always move so quietly and slowly, supposedly to build suspense. The only thing they do is prolong the scenes needlessly and inflate the movie to 90 boring minutes.Only scenes I really enjoyed was where a lot of things are happening at the same time (probably because there was no time to realize what was wrong).And, oh, yes: Cillian Murphy can be great even in the worst movie!",A Quiet Place Part II
710,mackcrocker,My thoughts on a quiet place part 2,8,11 August 2021,A quiet place part 2 was a very suspenseful and heart racing film. I really loved the opening and how they showed us how everything started but still leaving some questions unanswered which is a good thing. I really loved the sound design and the awesome set pieces. I really like how they expanded on the first movie and showed other characters in the world and how they dealt with the invasion. There were not many things I can nitpick about. There are some awesome kills that I didn't see coming and so many heart pounding scenes that really had me at the edge of my seat. I think this was way better than the first one and I they set it up so there could be a third and I hope there is going to be one. I give a quiet place part 2 a 8.5/10.,A Quiet Place Part II

I had anticipated we might have some kind of storyline, possibly learn something new about the alien creatures, an ending with some kind of closure....no, not a bean.

716,beginasyouare,Blind Aliens Don't Walk Into Trees,7,24 October 2021,"Quiet place 1 and 2, decent horror if you don't hold it accountable to it's implausible facts. It keep your attention, in a universe all its own, possibly a disguised spoof, like a disguised Shaun of the Dead or disguised Army of Darkness. Perhaps we have seen so much in general that we have to go to the implausible to be entertained, similar to all the time travel seen in sci-fi shows. There is one implausible fact I haven't seen mentioned but I didn't read everything. Besides the glaring fact that the family didn't go live in a noisy place such as near rushing water, how is it that the monsters can walk around freely without bumping into trees and buildings when they're blind? They can only locate humans by their audible sound. Perhaps they walk run climb safely by echolocation? But if the monsters used echolocation like bats, which is part of hearing, how is it they couldn't use echolocation to locate people walking down sandy trails? What's amazing is, it kept my attention and I found it entertaining to a point, but not believable, at least in retrospect. The writers must have discovered we'll chase anything that makes a good sound.",A Quiet Place Part II
717,joao-luiz_mjr,Feels a little repetitive,7,10 July 2021,"A Quiet Place Part II is still engaging and features some delightfully tense scenes, but I didn't get the same feeling of passion and enthusiasm I got from the first movie. Sequels are typically at a disadvantage because they can't benefit from the same originality and freshness of their precursors, and this one is no different. It relies on some level of convolution to justify plot beats, and, beyond a vague sense of 'survive', I didn't really get much out of it.Cillian Murphy does a good job of playing a somber character with strategic, clever solutions to problems, and the first scene of the movie is very memorable, but what really detracted from the experience for me was the ending, specifically how the ending of Part II, despite being similar to the ending of the first movie, just did not hit as hard.In part I, Millicent Simmonds' character has some level of tension with John Krasinski's character. The entire family's still reeling from the death of the youngest child, and she feels guilty for having handed him the toy that ultimately caused his death, as well as feeling frustrated and less-capable because of her deafness. Her father is ultimately just trying to protect her, not specifically because of her disability nor because he thinks she's more vulnerable, rather just because he's protective of all his children, but ordering her around and keeping her from putting herself at risk ends up being understandably upsetting to her.The father-daughter tension is ultimately resolved when he sacrifices himself to keep his children safe, telling them he'll always love them. Then, the hearing aid he'd been working on for several months (a symbol of his love and dedication to his daughter) turns out to emit a frequency that disables the monsters, so the climax of the movie has mother and daughter working together to kill one of the creatures, successfully fighting back for the first time. The entire movie's been building up to this moment - we've seen glimpses of the basement with radio equipment, we've seen the hearing aid's effects, we've been watching the monster stalk the family for half an hour - so it's very satisfying to see them finally figure out how to weaken the monsters and get a win. It's a climax that manages to engage all themes of the movie: reconciliation, technical ingenuity, perseverance, familial love, all at once, in a triumphant victory.In part II, the climax is just... more monster killing. Using the same strategy we've been watching them use rather nonchalantly since the movie first started... There are only so many times you can have a character make a mistake, attract a monster, be backed into a corner, disable the monster with a high-pitched signal and then shoot it in the face before it gets overly predictable and un-engaging.",A Quiet Place Part II

The Aliens looked like CGI in a lot of the shots. What did the Aliens actually want? They didn't eat the humans they just ripped them apart easily even though they couldn't see. How come sometimes a single gun shot would bring an Alien down and other times multiple shots would not. Why did she leave her wedding ring at the homage to her son and husband, made no emotional sense. Cillian Murphy's character went from not wanting to be involved to becoming the protagonist only because Miss Blunt asked him a second time and just gave him a death stare. Those feral people who ties them up at the boats - what were they hoping to do once the Aliens came out. How did the people on the Island get all the gear likes cars etc and how come there's only a few people in the world of the movie? Also, if they worked out that the Aliens can't swim and also their hearing is messed up from the sound of water didn't the script use that as a way to defeat the Aliens.When Blunt went back to get medical supplies why didn't she grab some shoes or thongs while there.",A Quiet Place Part II

It was well acted and the quietness in which the characters must navigate their reality brings a slow burn that has you on the edge of your seat.There is an unpredictability to the story which truely adds to the experience and helps the viewer immerse themselves in this terrifying world in which every step could set off a chain reaction leading to attracting the creatures.Such a great concept and delivered perfectly by Mr Krazinski in the directors seat. Nothing super tricky Camera wise just great angles that sufficiently tell the story and enhance the drama.I highly recommend this and the original for monster movie lovers who are ready to be surprised by something totally original.

The amount of tension is palpable, the addition of Cillian Murphy's character was a smart move, and the kids really shined as their story was brought to the forefront. This was a family you root for, which is why I love it so much. So often characters are stupid in horror movies which makes you indifferent to their fate, but every character is complex and likeable so you feel the need to pray for them as if your own family is in jeopardy. The jump scares aren't as important as the tense moments leading up to it. It's not exceedingly gory, but it's suspenseful enough to really leave you on the edge of your seat. John Krazinski said this movie was an allegory for parenthood - and I definitely can understand why; you want to protect your kids, but you also must have faith in them to make the right decisions to carve their own path. It also illustrates the need for cooperation, trust, and forgiveness. 10/10 would recommend!",A Quiet Place Part II

However, the movie goes far beyond simply the first day.I won't spoil it, but the movie follows Emily Blunt and Cilian Murphy's character as they navigate this treacherous new world. The less you know about the film, the better. But I will say this: there's more action than the first film, while still portraying several emotional moments.

736,djvaast,"But, why?",4,16 July 2021,"I just finished watching A Quiet Place 2 (AQP2). I was left wanting. Wanting more information, wanting a satisfying origin story, wanting wanting wanting.I enjoyed the first film. Like a tightly wound short story, we were dropped in the action and followed along over a short amount of time. The world-building was satisfying. It was good.The second was a bit of a mess. I really enjoyed the opening sequences and I really wanted more of that storyline. It all just happened too fast for me. Plus the fake out of the baseball game from the ""empty"" main street without any of the sound coming from the game was a little unrealistic given that the dad walked there from parking his truck at the store.There are too many implausibilities for me to overlook - where did they get all of that sand for the pathway system? Who clears off the dead leaves in the spring? Speaking of spring this is in upstate New York. Winters have cold temperatures and snowfall. How are these people walking around without shoes? Who trucked in all that sand? Do you know how heavy sand is? That's a lot of sand? Why didn't other people just follow the sand trail to their farm? Do you know how HOT sand gets in the summer? The family were not hobbits; they have normal feet like the rest of us.Why did the family abandon the farm? There was food, water, shelter - yes there was a fire and the basement was flooded but there were other places to live.Where are the baby's diapers?Do you know how long oxygen tanks last? (2 hours at most)Where are they getting all of their consumable supplies (such as all the candles, batteries, etc?) This has been AT LEAST nine months since the invasion (aka baby time). How is the electricity grid still functioning?Why has NOBODY figured out that the creatures can't swim? Not very bright these aliens dropping in on a planet covered in 71% water. Oops, bad planning on their part.If the marauders are so bad, why hasn't everyone figured out about that island before? Or seen the HUGE BONFIRE (where did they get the wood for that?) on the island or the lights in the windows? I can see lights on an island many kilometers away and MIT determined that a human eye can detect a candle flame is 2.76 kilometers. That's just a candle!Additionally, if a casual current can take a boat to the island, why hasn't anyone else gotten to the island before?Other commenters have mentioned the dubiously questionable decisions that other characters have made.Okay, well, that's my list of wanting more questions.

737,hancifatih,...So?,5,21 June 2021,"Everything that made the characters in this story awesome in the first movie is abandoned in this one. You know, if you're not making a movie to tell a new story, you're making a movie to make money off of an already existing one.In the first installment, every move was claculated almost perfectly and everybody gave realistic reactions that required fast-thinking, which made it even more believable as people in average think the sharpest when they're in danger. But in this one, almost all actions taken by the characters were for and only for the movie to continue... That is, the film wasn't shot on a story; a ""story"" was made up with the weakest contexts so that there could be a film. And there were incredible sources of new stories like the baby, and the ""people who've gone crazy""... But nooOOO! Let's stick with the weakness of the creatures! As if the audience had not gotten it in the first one..! I still can't believe the main character was made to make one of the many dumbest decisions in the film, so that there could be a ""cool"" railroad shot in the movie... So pretentious that it's offensive.Average to watch in spare time if you haven't seen the first one. And believe me, you don't have to see the first one...

For a moment I thought the movie was going to be a prequel, not a sequel. Turns out it was both, but only 10% prequel and 90% sequel. Having watched the whole movie, I wish the movie was more prequel. I find DAY 1 far more interesting. What would I do in that circumstance? Once we see the aftermath in the original movie, there isn't a lot of new ground to cover. In the beginning, couldn't a 60-ton tank with a 50 caliber machine gun turn the aliens into Swiss Cheese? Couldn't sound be used to distract the aliens? Ring a church bell, then another 1 mile away, then another, then another--get those aliens running in circles--all the while shooting the hell out of them. I thought we had a few guns in this country. Use helicopters with machine guns or missiles and turn those aliens into steaming piles of goo. So many sequences I would have loved to see.

Not one thing is added that expand the story. The same plot device of the sound pitch has been used extensively. The movie reaffirms the same thing that we already knew that they used the sound as a weapon against the aliens. THATs THE WHOLE MOVIE..
While The climax is well acted out and may keep you on the edge but you will soon realize it is the same scene done in the previous climax this time with kids instead of the mother .. The good acting masks several repetitive story elements but they are there..

Nothing about the aliens has been revealed, and humans are not in much better of a position after the movie.If they dared to make this into a trilogy they'd be pushing this concepts staying power well beyond its capability. Just like nobody asked for Bird-box 2, nobody is asking for A Quiet Place 3.The conflicts are lazily thrown together while lacking any horror aspect to make up for it.

755,cmdown-50506,WHY ARE THESE CHARACTERS SO STUPID?!,4,29 September 2021,I really want to like these films but I just can't. I hate stories that are driven forward not by storytelling but by the sheer stupidity of the characters actions.It would be understandable if this was right at the beginning of the attack but they're literally over 450 days into this and still making the most ridiculous decisions! I hated the first movie because of this and I can't believe I'm saying this but I actually enjoyed the first one more because at least it was new this film just rehashes the same old story and refuses to build on it after the opening scene.I love the atmosphere but maybe that's just because it reminded me of last of us. The film does a great job at building up suspense but overall its a just a hollow copy and paste of the first one.Emily blunts performance was brilliant as always although I feel her character development was non existent and a step back from herself from the first movie. We're talking about a woman who literally gave birth in silence and hid herself and the baby straight after to her going on a walk leaving her injured child (who is a big stupid wimp BTW who she never should have trusted) to go have a moment at a grave instead of going straight for supplies and back.Cillian Murphy delivered on his role but yet again his character was a fool. He could have dropped the kid off and done the missions all by himself he would've been in less danger and would've been quicker. He was the one who told the audience how people are but just automatically wants to help someone (I get it was a little girl but he literally ignored his friends and their family because he simply didn't care)I'm not even going to talk about the children as they're young and have plenty of room to grow as actors but if their directions were play be most annoying foolish hateable characters in the film then they absolutely nailed it.Overall it wasn't enjoyable but if you have an hour and a half to spare give it a go maybe I'm just being a little too critical.,A Quiet Place Part II
756,rossjackson2,Worthy sequel - not as good as part 1 though,8,10 June 2021,I loved AQP part 1 as it was so original. I didn't feel it needed a sequel either. So I didn't really have any high expectations of this. But I was pleasantly surprised. A lot of people have mentioned the opening sequence in their review and I agree it's a superb start. The rest of the film is good too but I don't feel it advances the plot much and it's obvious they're building for a third film. Some properly good jump scares as well. Definitely worth seeing in the cinema.,A Quiet Place Part II

760,tiaanb-18673,People must be joking with these 1 star reviews...,8,15 July 2021,"I get the point that some of these reviewers are trying to make, but 1 star? Seriously? You're telling me that this beautiful film is worse than most other movies? Seriously, it's like some people just see others give it a 1 star and then decide to jump on the bandwagon of hating it because that's the 'in' thing. This movie to me, is better in almost every aspect compared to a lot of today's garbage mainstream mediocre high budget films. Movies like these are what gives me hope for future films, and allow me to not have to lower the bar of expectations for upcoming films. I LOVE the cinematography in this, it kind of gives me Last of Us vibes, or just game vibes in general since the camera placement is somewhat reminiscent of an over-the-shoulder camera style video game. I'd recommend this film to lovers of the first one, horror enthusiasts, disaster/post-apocalyptic film lovers and people who aren't a cynical critic about every semi-mainstream thing out there.",A Quiet Place Part II
761,bigdog-05144,Krasinski's filmmaking has yet to dissapoint,8,31 May 2021,"I would like to start by saying this film is not a nominee for best picture. The story has no special element that has this film cross into the Academy's standard for best picture.However, the film's cinematography, sets, sound work, and control of atmosphere are unmatched by any horror film of the past decade.The opening sequence of a quiet place part 2 has much to offer people who have seen the original and not. John Krasinski's performance with Blunt both drive home the small town feel that is necesary for understanding the family dynamic for the rest of the film. The reflected shot of Lee walking to the baseball pitch and back are strongly reminiscent of Shaun of the dead's black to work, and excellent scene to mirror. The angles taken in the films cinematography to give the viewer just enough view to incite terror is masterful. Over the past few years, I have seen well over a hundred horror films and this is the first in some time to truly give me chills. Very refreshing.The set work in the film by Amato is excellent, all of the settings give a realistic view of possible scenarios of an area surrounding a small town as well as giving neither the monster nor survivors unrealistic advantages. Chilling.I would not be surprised to see A quiet place part 2 nominated for sound design. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I would do it simply for this reason, it's indescribable.You never feel safe during this film. The monsters are a constant threat and comfort is far away at all times. As I said earlier, no film has kept me on edge like this one since I watched the original Rosemary's baby. Fantastic atmosphere work.While this movie was a feast for the eyes and ears, it struggled in two prominent departments, story and characters.The story is nothing special with no prominent themes to set it apart in terms of profound story making. The story isn't weak, it serves its purpose well, but not much more.The characters are smart and relatable in the sense that they make none of the overly stupid decisions that feel tacky and plagues much of modern horror. From a more opinionated stance, I never cared about any characters in the film. The only character with an actual arc is Emmett (played by murphy), but even this character remains mostly static.All in all, I gave A Quiet Place Part 2 for the filmmaking elements, atmosphere, and unremarkable story. The film is incredibly fun to watch and even better for lovers of the original. If you haven't seen the film yet, please do, it's a treat. I saw the film with a friend and it was everything we could do to not cheer during the opening sequence. I look forward to seeing more work from my new favorite modern horror director.",A Quiet Place Part II
762,hotjanuary,Well made but you must ignore the dumb things.,6,30 July 2021,The overall movie is of decent quality. If they could skim out the silly things that people in those situations would avoid you'd have a higher quality movie. Here are some examples.1) They walk around with bare feet when most any soft soled foot ware would work just fine.2) They carry nothing to toss and make sound as a distraction like a few pebbles.3) If the latch on the furnace might trap someone inside just disable it so it cannot latch. Stuff something into the strike so the latch can't fall in. Lay the towel over that so it is quiet.Things like this break a movie for me.,A Quiet Place Part II

No deep answers; The trailer basically shows most of the action. But it sets up the character played by Cillian Murphy.After the prologue, the story picks up almost immediately following the end of part one. The story jumps back and forth between three threads, which my daughter found a tad confusing for a minute or so, but quickly picked up on what was going on.The action is brisk and well done. We already know what the antagonists look like, yet they are mostly used sparingly, which was a wise decision.There is, of course, plenty of room to expand on this installment for Part Three, and I have to admit, I am looking forward to seeing where we will be taken.More, please.",A Quiet Place Part II

Convenient.Why is it, that now, the monsters take forever to attack even when someone is screaming at the top of their voice?Pet peeve: The woman going to find a guy who is surviving on his own then blackmail him withe a baby.

It expands upon the world and story from the first film. Great acting all around. I really enjoyed that we didn't spend a whole ton of time on the mother as we did in the first film. Cillian Murphy is awesome and is always a delight to see on screen. Cinematography, music, and action are awesome. My only complaint is that it suffers from some plot holes/questionable decisions.

For most of its time though, it is very intense and does not bore, even when it gets predictable and nonsensical.

781,socialsunshine-12645,Why did they make a second one,4,23 September 2021,"This was a really unnecessary sequel. First of all we didn't learn anything more about the aliens or why they came here. If those questions were answered the movie would've been a bit better/worth watching.Additionally, these were some of my biggest issues with the film:1. First of all why didnt the family just move next to the waterfall or to places that were naturally noisy so that they didn't have to live in complete silence? Yes there was the issue of shelter but they could have honestly built a makeshift shelter without being discovered because of how noisy the area was2. Why didnt they wear shoes at all, especially if they were walking a lot in areas that they weren't familiar with? Everyone kept on stepping on stuff and getting hurt when literally some injuries could have just been avoided by not being barefoot!3. Why does everyone keep splitting up?? It's like they didn't learn anything at all from the events in the first film, which supposedly took place within a day of the second film.4. Why does the daughter ALWAYS do the most. Like in each film she is so set in her ways to the point that it endangers literally everyone and no one checks her on it.5. Why did the island people make the announcement of the safe haven so cryptic?? Like just say on the radio that you have a colony off the coast and just inspect the boats of survivors as they come in? I feel like so many people could have found safety if they just announced where they were, it's not like the aliens would understand??6. Another thing with the island, it's really weird that they had almost no safety measures in place at all. Like one alien wiped out nearly the entire town and its infrastructure within moments?? No weapons, no training/preparation, just vibes ig.In conclusion, they could have kept this sequel.

All that stupid premises, again.MEN: powerful, protect women and kids, only have intuitive emotions-to protect women and kids, wounded.WOMEN: powerless but emotionally kinda strong, want to protect their own kids, I-am-a-mother, I-wish-my-husband-is-safe-out-there, forgive-my-kids-and-help-them-grow-into-men-and-women.KIDS: stupid, stubborn, but at the end always SUdDenLY out-strong their parents.<<< The reason why I'm angry about this is that disability is included in this story, but only expressed in auditory novelty and a source of fear.The uniqueness of that disabled girl only turned into stubbornness, anger, and possession of a hearing aid.Yes I know they're in a life-threatening situation, but there is time and room for exploring their inner world--Actually we had: the boy risks his and a baby's life and walks with his painfully wounded foot only out of curiosity of his neighbors' life. Well, needless to say, curiosity turned into stupidity, for plot.And that characteristic intense curiosity has no context nor source, so it doesn't feel like something that comes from that living boy. Maybe that's why we feel aversion to that stupidity, it's not organic.Aren't we all trying to survive all the time? We just have much more time for pondering about subjectivity and what's on other people's mind and the meaning of everything, of life. That's why we human have a different kind of consciousness than animals.Consciousness is different from attention, attention is only an aspect of consciousness.""Narrowly Focusing"" is only one kind of attention, the kind that doesn't involve your right hemisphere, and this movie makes you narrowly focus on sound.I don't think that grants any superiority to the sound design of this movie, foley is done more carefully of course, but isn't pursuing for perfection a universal goal of sound artists?I want more audiences to realize sound of film is a form of art, not to remember ""this movie has better sound"".Auditory simulation of hearing disability + building a world afraid of sound is affective, it makes the magic, but apparently this formula is not created by this adapter and he doesn't really understand the magic.It stopped at the level of sympathy, it can't reach the level of empathy.",A Quiet Place Part II
791,Angerforz,Well done!,9,14 June 2021,"This movie is a perfect example of a sequel well done, i was shaking, i was scared, i even think i cried a bit during certain scenes, i had goosebumps, and felt all kinds of emotions during the movie, i was amazed and stunned by how amazing John Krasinski made this movie. Creating this sequel was a bold move, there is a lot of things that could have gone wrong, it could have been overdone and it could have lost it's uniqueness from the first movie but Krasinski continued doing an outstanding job with the whole movie and how he continued to tell this story. I personally think the movie was excellent, i loved everything about it, it is simple and it's also so execution based, it's all about the tension. The whole performance was amazing, the story telling of the characters the development and everything was flawless, with a movie like this, the creators and actors have to rely on all the visual story telling, the silent communications, they simply have to go on their looks, sign language and body language, which made us more invested in the characters and made every sequence of the movie so amazing, it is a movie where the actors can play around and truly shine. Krasinski made every shot stunning, every sequence filled with tension, with lots of high music that fit right in, every little detail just made the movie better and better. It was truly a real experience to see this movie in the theater, i truly recommend to see it in a theater if you ever get the chance.",A Quiet Place Part II
792,imdb-11847-61144,Enjoyed this!,8,5 June 2021,"Can't wait for part IIII just saw this at the Dendy Lounge in Sydney tonight. An experience. Sat next to two wonderful stunning ladies (seated to my left), however unfortunately had a gent to my right who felt it was appropriate to loudly munch down a meal (as loudly as possible) during the silent parts. I literally plugged my right ear canal with my index finger, I guess he was perceptive enough to sense that, he gracefully egressed to the bathroom, collected his drinks, and relocated to another seat.The sound engineering was exceptional. Didn't check if they have Dolby Atmos, but there were some incredible spatial effects, also the acting was wonderful, plus plenty of 'shock' moments (leveraging the use of sound very well)... One of those ladies to my left, had her unique shock moment - there was one scene and she knocked over a jug of refreshments and drenched herself. If she's reading this, i apologise for laughing. As if the movie wasn't entertaining enough?Definitely a great one to see at the theatre.",A Quiet Place Part II

794,mjvanzundert,A bit disappointing,4,3 July 2021,"I gave it 4 stars which is probably lower than it deserves but I was anticipating it for so long that it gave an anti climax because the story is just not as well build up as in a quiet place 1 which is superb. What I found annoying is the girl that suddenly wants to save the world and she cannot even discuss the plan with her family, simply takes the only tools they have to kill the monsters and takes off. This is the basis of the story and because of this all things are set in motion, people die etc...they could have made the plot a lot better...",A Quiet Place Part II
795,hfiyxniu,So many gigantic plot holes ...,1,17 July 2021,"I honestly do not understand how people loved this so much, it's so dumb!! These creatures can hear you whisper but not walking? Not a single floor board in your house creaks when you step on it? What if you eat something crunchy? How about when you are breathing? Your body makes tons of uncontrollable sounds that would be easily heard by these creatures. I was done with it when she had the baby, I'm supposed to believe she had a 100% sound proof childbirth? The baby just never makes sounds??? WHY DONT THEY LIVE NEAR THE WATERFALL?!?!!!! ITS SO DUMB!!!!!!!!!!! If the world is basically over & you need protection from creatures that can ""hear everything"" why didn't you find someones bomb/storm shelter? A sound proof room? Anything underground really. Hell why not go break into Home Depot & take as many sound proof blocks as u can find?? I love John & Emily as much as the next guy but this movie is completely idiotic.",A Quiet Place Part II
796,aceupyoursleeve,Pretty good,7,31 May 2021,"A Quiet place IIClassic horror tropes done right.If you haven't seen the first one the basic plot is an alien invasion on earth, were they hunt by sound.In the sequel we see horror done right.As the remaining abbot family leaves there home to find other people, and hope to provide a way to help them.The plot
Regan abbot has an hearing aid that senses vibration. But using the high frequency it omits she is able to deter and immobilize the aliens. She sets out with her mother and brothers to find a way to stop the aliens.Along the way they encounter an old friends who by the course of certain events takes Regan to an island where people found a way to live with sound again. Here they devise a plan to defeat the aliens.As all this unfolds we also fallow Evelyn abbot, her son and new born baby.They are hiding out in an old mill vault with risk of being heard by nearby aliens.Pros
Though we follow classic horror tropes, we get good character interaction, good acting, good special effect, and cliche but good story telling.The message of the family as well is very good, and goes deeper than most horror out there.As far as horror and jump scares you get plenty. Done well, but a little repetitive.Cons
This movie is significantly different and less intense than the first. Rather than built up suspense and emotional tension this movie has more of a panicked fear drive to it. I wouldn't necessarily say this is bad, but would put each movie in different genres. (Thriller) (horror)
There are a few instances were we get some early 2000s cheesy skeleton scares that break up the more natural down to earth feel.Along these same lines we get a bit far fetched with the plot in how they discover a safe place on a island.But all in all there are very few instances in this movie to deter any horror/thriller fan away.I give this movie a 7.0 for its quality and solid characters.PG-13 for violence and gore.",A Quiet Place Part II
797,bccpldt,I hereby dub this the Walking Dead strategy,4,27 September 2021,"I suspect the makers of this movie realized they had a cash cow on their hands.

800,thom59,"Suddenly, a flash of light appears in the sky ...",6,1 July 2021,"I'd been excitedly awaiting the sequel like many other fans of the original movie and the tension within the cold open flashback was certainly palpable. It's a beautiful, yet ordinary day where a mini league baseball game is in progress. Suddenly, a flash of light appears in the sky, and a burning meteor plummets to the Earth ... and the ultimate cliché of every sci-fi/horror genre broke the spell. It instantly reminded me of Alan Harper (aka Jon Cryer,) of Two and a Half Men fame pounding away at his lonely laptop ""writing the summer blockbuster that will lift him from poverty and put him in a place of his own."" Alan in the rather ironically titled episode ""Baseball was better with Steroids"" crashed like the proverbial meteor into my brain and it took the heart stopping appearance of the first alien to dismiss him. As sequels go, Part Two is no Empire Strikes Back, but it does continue an intriguing tale. A Quiet Place was fresh, disarming, mesmerizing and genuinely riveting. In Part 2, in some scenes, rather irritatingly, I knew exactly what was coming - again, cliched writing so familiar of many scripts. However, the actors deliver an authentic performance and there are some genuinely scary moments. Cillian Murphy is a terrific addition to the cast. I read there is a Part three is in the offing. To be honest I'm okay about it. The original was on a par with the dystopian 1978 film Invasion of the Body Snatchers by Philip Kaufman, one of the great science-fiction horror films of all time. My hope is that Part three doesn't tie up the trilogy (if indeed it is a trilogy,) in a pleasantly soporific ending with a pile of dead aliens and an ensemble of hugely relieved and extremely chatty actors.",A Quiet Place Part II
801,taniabot,Solid monster movie,8,21 July 2021,I do not understand the bad reviews for this movie. It ticks all the boxes of what one expects from a monster flick. Great acting. Brilliantly directed. Edge of your seat stuff. Definitely a two thumbs up from me.,A Quiet Place Part II
802,Amygdalahaha,3/4 of a sequel,8,2 July 2021,"It's good. Cillian Murphy brings some heft to the acting and there's a fair bit more action but is it as good as the original? I would say not quite. The main issue is there seems to have been a good deal of it left on the cutting room floor which only undermines some of the character motivations as the plot unravels.For instance, deaf girl says, ""Enunciate... remember?"" Remember what? Neither the word nor the actual principle of enunciation has never been mentioned in either movie up to that point as far as I'm aware, and it certainly hasn't been pointed out to the character she's asking to remember it. So it just seems... odd... and out of place.A lot of this sort of stuff happens and it really pulls the foundations out from under the characters' ability to act logically or reasonably. Some actions taken by them seem so wildly irresponsible, absent sufficient reason, that we tend to think of them as idiots that deserve to get hacked and slashed and I'm quietly confident that's not what the film-makers were going for.Anyway, other than that it's still better than most. If only we got to see the entire film, it might actually be top notch.",A Quiet Place Part II
803,teachinglegend,Very engaging,10,2 June 2021,"So many movies in the horror and science fiction genre are just mediocre. The Conjuring part 22 doesn't cut it. This movie, as well as the first Quiet Place, are well-crafted, well-made films. The acting is largely facial expressions and the children in the family are especially excellent. This is a very engaging film worth your time. John Krasinski, well done!",A Quiet Place Part II
804,RogerOThornhill1959,"Satisfying, but not quiet (quite) the original",7,14 June 2021,"Part 2 is a solid horror movie, and a great theater experience. The use of sound is of course incredible, just like in the first movie. The acting is great as well just as in the first, and Millicent Simmonds needs at least a few awards nominations for her performance. The story is truly a Part 2 and not a forced narrative that had to be shoehorned in. The flashback of how it all started was well done too. There are some heart wrenching scenes, and some absolutely harrowing ones. One particularly masterful aspect is the way the action of multiple storylines is shown. Krasinski's ability to put together a unique movie is proven, and he will likely be one of the top Hollywood directors in the coming years.But this film does suffer from some of the horror movie clichés that did not plague the first one. You love to see more of the monsters, but that also means you see those monsters acting differently than they usually do, just to add suspense when they are around a main character. Even more distracting, in the original when a character did something irrational it was usually a human mistake, a sign of the character's failings. Part 2 jumped off the ledge into characters doing things that just didn't make sense, and often completely out of character. This was solely to set up the situations that the story ""needed"".In fact, the primary mission that the movie revolves around is itself illogical. It is an implausible quest that only pays off due to a more implausible deus ex machina. While this sets up a very satisfying conclusion, it is still naggingly off.A very satisfying movie overall that is worth the view, but not quiet (quite) the original.",A Quiet Place Part II

807,andermic18,What a disappointment...,5,3 June 2021,What a wonderfully thrilling experience the first movie was. 3.5 hours and great story telling. The 1.5 hour sequel was so far short of the first movie its immeasurable. 20 minutes of flashback takes away from the movie and makes you feel like you just watched an hour long special on HBO. The flashback only was to introduce a new character. The split timelines was done well in my opinion but that's about it. The movie lost a star for me in the first 3 minutes by the way that baseball game was played. There was clearly no attention to detail. What a horrible disappointment I'm not sure where the good ratings are coming from no one I know that saw the movie liked it. Don't pay for this wait to the dvd comes out seriously not worth the money and definitely making a trip to the theatre for 90 minutes is not worth it. Didn't even finish my popcorn or soda.,A Quiet Place Part II
808,lucyfranceshurst,Disappointing.,1,6 June 2021,"I was really looking forward to this but it felt like such a waste of time. Silly scenarios and corny dialogue. The children just felt like they were there to create obstacles and problems.Like when they are being chased through the building and jump down the shoot thing to safety, even though the baby is in a cushioned box, how the hell did it survive a drop like that? How did cillian murphy's character get the choclear implant thing while in the water? Plus it going into the water would surely wreck it anyway? And despite being told to look at her and enunciate earlier in the film, how did the daughter hear CM's speech about how much like her father she is, when he had his face turned away from her and was mumbling for most of it?I even sat and watched all the credits because I couldn't believe that the writers decided that that was an ending.",A Quiet Place Part II
809,fairhaven,Quiet Place 2 is a good sequel,10,1 August 2021,"Much of this is realistic of what would happen in an apocalyptic situation. I missed seeing John and Emily together in the second one, but that's what made it more realistic and sad if he was gone.Emmett's character would be true to life also, being he lost everything and watched it happen. He just gave up. Bringing Evelyn and the kids back into his life actually has saved him, bringing him back to life. It's a story of survival, good and bad people.

XD Or those weird cannibals whatever they were which dont know how to use boats and check out the lighted signal tower on the island a few hundrets of meters away.

824,Kronenbourg16,Overrated rubbish with perhaps the most ridiculous premise in movie history,4,19 June 2021,"The biggest problem with this film is that it takes itself seriously. The premise is ridiculous. No creature hunts indiscriminately by sound - attacking the source of whatever they hear, because that's retarded. They'd all fall in to a volcano, or noisy meat grinder, or run towards bombs, or bite off more than they can chew with a stronger creature that, I dunno.. can SEE?! No creature would ever evolve like that, and cetainly none would ever be created like that. Before you talk to me about bats, recognise my use of the word ""indescriminately"". Bats bounce sound off objects to see their size and their movement. They don't go chasing tin cans that a human knocks over, but inexplicably not tin cans the wind knocks over, or rock-falls, or anything else that happens to be dangerous and noisy - which is the vast majority of dangerous things.To compound the problem the movie is filled with ambient noise. The noise of crickets and birdsong are constant. These monsters will hunt down inanimate objects because a human makes a noise with them yet they won't hunt down noises made by other living creatures or natural noises. In the real world these creatures would just be running around in desperate, frantic circles between creaking trees, birds and and tin cans rolling in the wind, until they die of exhaustion. Humans would watch them kill themselves for a laugh. You'd be perfectly safe walking around with 5 pebbles in your pocket to throw and make noise if you ever run in to one, but apparently none of the characters in this movie are smart enough to figure this out, and instead whenever one makes a noise they choose to run - inevitable creating more noise. All they'd need to do is sit on their asses and shut up.None of this would be a great issue if the movie didn't take itself so seriously. It wants to be a serious drama about how people would live in such a scenario, with long, tedious shots and drawn out dialogue and evocative music. Who in their right mind could buy in to that?! Apparently alot of people, but remember, half the people in the world are idiots, and most of that group watch Hollywood movies.The characters, writing and script are all awfully dull. The little deaf girl isn't gonna die, theres no point even placing her in ""danger"" because this is a Hollywood movie and nothing bad would ever happen to a little deaf girl in a Hollywood movie. Any tension the movie tries to manufacture is fatally flawed from the out-set.There is really nothing here. Even the design of the monsters is uninspired. The best I can say is that it's competently produced and acted, and for that it gets 4 stars, but it's a profoundly dumb movie.",A Quiet Place Part II

Using the same narrative of part 1, focusing on the human trauma a lil too much yet again.Not sure why they wasted time frolicking in the sun at the island instead of transmitting the frequency out immediately.

Glad I didn't pay to see this. The monsters are pretty creepy, the acting was ok, but I feel like I only saw half of a movie. John Krazinski disappears, you don't see it happen, he just isn't there with no real explanation. The daughter goes off to ""Save"" them, but there is no explanation how a deaf person ""Hears"" music...then the movie ends all the sudden, with us wondering what happens next! Do they go back and rescue Mom and the Boys? Did all the monsters get killed on the island? Looks like they are planning a part 3, which I won't bother going to see...",A Quiet Place Part II
829,tdinscoe,Part 1 is waaay better,3,17 July 2021,Boring. A pointless sequel.Basically just a cash grab leeching off of Part 1's success.The only semi-interesting part of the movie is the intro. The rest of the movie is legit some of the most boring cinema I've ever encountered.,A Quiet Place Part II
830,m_radicevic,Plothole the movie,4,6 September 2021,Somehow even more plotholes then the first part. Its fun if you dont think about it or watch it with friends to discuss all the plotholes.

832,manasrules,Quite an Ordinary Experience,5,31 May 2021,First thing first - This is absolutely nothing like the first movie.

836,kendelldavenport,Great return to Theater,10,29 May 2021,"This was my family's first in theatre movie in 15 months and probably the same for much of the audience. And you could literally hear a pin drop. This movie had EVERYONE on the edge of their seats and involved. Our popcorn bag and soda cups were still full when the movie ended. On the way home we couldn't stop talking about it and none of us could sleep without decompressing.Not to take away from the ALWAYS amazing Emily Blunt, but the kids were the real stars this time. The child actors really stepped up their performances in pace with the intensity of their roles. And as with the first film, this was more than just a suspense film, but also a great drama with characters we CARE about who falter, fail, recover and triumph.",A Quiet Place Part II
837,gregorrhuber,Absurd!,4,23 June 2021,"This rating is much too high and the movie itself lacks ALL the attributes and ingredients of a good movie.The story lacks imagination and intelligence.An interstellar traveling alien species, its culture being many thousands or more proable tens of thousands of years old and therefore socially, emotionally and morally highly evolved makes it to earth only to kill those primitive homo sapiens? And they are too stupid to have heard of the electromagnetic spectrum, like light for instance (meaning seeing) or dont posses the technical equipment for that? Well, then they wouldn't have made it to the next planet in their own solar system, not?A lot of things don't make sense or defy reason. It is a very trivial, empty and foreseeable plot. Utterly boring!",A Quiet Place Part II
838,omearadarragh,Too many errors and inconsistencies,5,26 June 2021,"Sooooo many continuity errors and inconsistencies with part 1 and also just a bit crap and has a different vibe... The aliens seem to react waaaaay slower to noise this time, and also less sensitive. Characters are way more comfortable whispering and making slight noises than before.It was also really annoying the way the last one ended with loads of aliens charging towards the house and this one begins with no aliens moving towards them.Cowardly kid makes stupid, un-cowardly mistakes like exploring an abandoned warehouse on his own with a broken leg.Yeah... Just not that good.",A Quiet Place Part II
839,imdahoda,"Better than the original, but still kind of a Grade-A B-Movie",8,1 June 2021,"It was really intense, like the first, but moreso. That's where it shines the most, and where attention should be focused the most. The more you think about it, and the more you expect from character development or believable scenes, the more you'll find it lacking; I think it's been overrated, but I'd give it a 7.5 if I could. Better than the first in most ways, but still not as great as the '70s and '80s horror classics like Alien, The Thing, or The Fly. Most young people of course would just see those as dated and slow, because they're not full of the predictable quiet-to-loud jump scares and shrieking flailing monsters every 5 minutes like the typical mainstream horror movie these days... but it is better than most mainstream horror movies in a long while.The opening is a well-done twist, with a nice bit of exposition on the monsters, and a very immersive and believably-human sequence of events that I wish more scenes of the movie had been more like. Cillian Murphy and Millicent Simmonds bring strong presences and very believably-human traits to their roles, even if Cillian's character may be unforgivable. I've not seen many actors outshine Emily Blunt in movies, but unfortunately her character didn't have a lot to chew on in this one, or she didn't bring her normal chops.Besides being annoyed by the ""here's another quiet part leading to a jump scare"" parts, the monsters' behavior sort of left me scratching my head again, wondering why they do what they do, how they don't seem to be hungry, and how they ever evolved to be able to decimate a planet's top species without being able to see or smell well... there's a twist weakness that's revealed of them that just makes me want to laugh based on what they're doing here to begin in. It's about as silly as Signs... but actually presented better.Really, it's greatness is in its presentation. It doesn't really beat you over the head with anything, nor does it go so far over the top that I can't take it seriously; it's a great sci-fi horror, and moreso an intense experience, tied together by the believability of the characters. It's got some cheese, maybe a little too much, but it's way better than Cloverfield and maybe even a lot of Stranger Things episodes even if it seems to lift from them a little too much. I'm glad The Office guy did this, and I recommend it.",A Quiet Place Part II

It's definitely above average but I don't think it hit the ""good"" mark. Some of the decisions that the characters make in the movie are straight up dumb.

844,dmsl-22193,More Hits Than Misses,6,31 May 2021,"I enjoyed the movie but have some issues with the continuity of the first half hour. The story jumps from day one to day 341 (not exactly sure of # of days). Waiting for the many months that this was released I was very much hoping to see the progression of the initial attacks (as alluded to by the ships in the sky at the baseball game) up until where the first movie ended. Where is the mayhem in the big cities? How did the aliens take over the earth? What about the military response? We're their pockets of civilization that were untouched? Spending a half hour on these events would have added to the movie tremendously. Given all that, it was still a helluva good movie and I enjoyed jumping back on this thrill ride. Millicent Simmons should be called 'Magnificent' Simmons, I feel she carried the movie. There were some good action sequences showing the aliens but there was virtually no further inroads to their strengths and weaknesses, except for the no swimming part. Surely there were some alien brains behind the building and piloting of the ships, and was there possibly a massive Master Alien at the helm. And the most begging question of all: why were they here? That didn't matter that much for the first movie, but would have loved to see a little more creativity on their mission.",A Quiet Place Part II

This was beyond great. The acting was flawless, the suspension was through the roof, and almost everything lined up with the first one.As a huge fan, my favorite parts of these movies is how much time is put into the little details. This movie had a few flaws that would only stick out if you are like me looking & admiring every little thing.I am already planning on going back to watch it at least two more times in theaters.",A Quiet Place Part II

849,awesome-21765,Overrated and nothing new happens,5,10 June 2021,"Firstly, I appreciate that the producers respected the name of the movie and kept it as quite as possible, because I thought the movie wouldn't be quiet anymore after watching the trailer.We already know that the deaf girl is a natural genius survivor but there was no need to make her unnaturally genius that can solve and figure out everything and defeat every monster in the movie.Why did the two adults take the deaf girl with them when they wanted to distract the alien? Logically speaking, Why would they bring a child with them in a dangerous suicidal mission?! The new male lead actor was just there to fill the role of father but he wasn't interesting to me to be honest.Emily was literally wasted in this film, the movie focused more on her children and how her annoying boy finally managed to overcome his fear of course after getting his family in trouble several times.Come on guys, this is a movie not a saturday show. Why so slow? The story has only moved 10% forward? Are you planning for more 10 parts? God forbids!This movie did not manage to steer clear of the clichesDo you remember the copycat movie about the blind bats produced by the netflix? This time Quite place retaliates and copies some of its elements lol! The crazy cultists that capture the people and endanger them? Have seen this in walking dead, bird box and the silence.I hope that the next part doesn't pick up itself from where this part stopped, this kind of direct continuity comes with a really slow pace that makes the movie very short. We knew everything, the characters were developed enough and the two weakness of the monsters were already discovered and are enough to ward them off. It's time for a time jump or a new cast in form of military personnel or scientists to understand the origin of the monsters whether they are extraterrestrial or manmade biological weapons or whatever, and of course wrap it up next time.",A Quiet Place Part II

This movie didn't give me what I was expecting but maybe part 3 would be better and in part 3 you will see exciting scenes, a real continuation of that great idea that part 1 revealed and of course more fear. My rating for the film is as follows: the plot seemed boring to me 6 points, the performance of the actors and their suitability for their characters is very good 9 points, the idea and the meaning of the film is also great (of course, this belongs to the first part) but I could not find something new 6 points, the decorations, music, special effects used in the film are also suitable for the average low-budget film 6 points.

858,wroclawkontakt,It makes even less sense after part II,1,30 June 2021,"1. If the creature can hear you from miles away when you speak, it could hear your breath and hartbeat from upclose. All those scenes with creatures slowly aproaching and the protagonist trying to stay quiet or hide are ridiculous then (for example the one in the basement in part I, or in the train in part II).2. Lack of oxygen kills creatures in water, but somehow didn't kill them in space before they got here?3. If creatures can't survive in water then all islands, boats, cruise ships, or even continents they did not land on, are safe. This is not a global cataclysm, but rather a local tragedy then. Rest of the world is fine and needs a bunch of their aircraft carriers to be parked on the coast of unfortunate land and slowly clean it using planes and aircrafts.4. Creatures are so tough that it's hard to kill them with a regular gun, unless they hear a certain frequency, and then.. then what? Their biological outer shell toughness somehow gets turned off, and now a todler with a metal bar can kill them?5. Or is it that it is easy to kill creatures once they have those sound flaps up? In which case that whole frequency thing wouldn't make a difference since they have those flaps up a lot. You just have to wait for a moment.6. This series shouldn't be called ""A Quiet Place"", but rather ""A Loud Place"",
since the creatures can't operate in loud enviroments.It would be so much safer in a loud place. Think about it, in a quiet place your stomach growls - dead, you fart - dead, you sneeze - dead, you burp - dead, there is so many things that you cannot control.It only took rain (fire sprinklers to be precise), for creatures not to be able to locate their pray. That would mean on land a loud place is the safest one. Like a waterfall from the first part.7. If creatures run blindly in the direction of sound, it would be incredibly easy to make a trap like a dock with water or a cliff, to kill them all one by one with a remotely triggered loudspeaker pretending to be a prey.Seriously, if they rely on sound so much, how hard is it to come up with an idea to use it against them? And you have islands and continents of people unaffected that could make those traps, and install them while a loud swarm of helicopters and jets is flying aropund as a distraction.8. On a topic of speakers, even if the main family decided not to live by the waterfall, why couldn't they at least put some speakers in the distance and blast something on them in cases of emergency? They did have wires and electricity to power those chains of lightbulbs in part I, didn't they?That's already 8 points, and I haven't even touched those ridiculous situations created by displayed characters, that could be another 8 points or more (encrypted message in a song? Really? What for? Because only ""the good guys"" can decode it and come to your island?).I wanted to point it all out after the first part, but decided (against my better judgement) to hold it off untill after I see the second one, kind of hoping for some reediming scenario. That unfortunately did not happen. I have no idea why this got the ratings it did, I for one, cound not stay quiet any longer.",A Quiet Place Part II

863,alelorier,An altogether predictible storyline,4,22 June 2021,"Basically, I agree with all those who said that this movie is a rehash of part I.There is very little surprising moments. It's still relatively thrilling when the alien monsters are on the attack mode but the viewer can guess from the beginning that the core family is going to come out of all their travails just fine.The most disappointing factor, because it's currently over-used in all end-of-the-world scenarios, that is that faced with massive life extinction many people will resort to infighting amongst survivors rather than trying to organize a resistance movement. This as been explored over and again in movies, series and comics. Robert Kirkman has comprehensively exploited the idea on walking dead and there isn't much more fun nowadays to explore this theme.In this movie this idea of men/women turning up against their own kind is especially stupid since, obviously, the alien monsters have absolutely no desire whatsoever to keep a surviving downsized human population.As far as direction is concerned, john Krasinsky still manages to do a good job.

The whole plot about the weird humans in the dock was also pointless and it just left more questions unanswered. Same goes for the people on the island. Someone else said that it felt like the characters were fighting to see who could make dumber decisions and that was true. The ending is also very unsatisfying, but I hope there won't be a third one.

The stakes in the first film were much higher, so that makes this film not as tension filled as the first. We also see a lot more of the critters, which makes them less scary.I enjoyed the movie anyway, and we get a scene at the beginning which explains how everything started in the first place.

Boring and annoying to the point I almost yanked the cup holder arm off the movie theater chair because of stupid decisions from the main characters, primarily the children.....I think this could have used some subverting of expectations GoT level to make it entertaining.

879,alexandrelebrun-36205,Boring,4,11 August 2021,"In my opinion a movie HAS to be entertaining. It can brings other thing, but first it must be entertaining.For those who already watched A quiet place first movie, you will probably get annoyed by some incoherence between the two part. Especially when at the end of part 1, the woman is attracting as much alien as she can because she is a ""badass"" and found a way to kill them (no spoiler), but beginning part 2 it seem like this wasn't as effective and she isn't a badass at all.Part 1 had a clear storyline, tension and you wondered how things would go.Part 2 is a mix of scenes that taken alone looks good, but mixed together it doesn't make a story and is quite boring.My review may be biased, I fell asleep around the half of it and only briefly woke up every 5 to 10 minutes to get bored over and over.",A Quiet Place Part II

Another big complaint I have with this movie is that it doesn't have an ending it just stops. All the conflict is left unresolved and as I exit the theater I wonder what happened to the characters they are literally just left stranded from each other wtf. It's so easy to tell that they don't give a crap about making a good movie they just want to keep the franchise alive. I will not be buying a ticket to A Quiet Place Part 3 sorry I just can't do it. The best part of the movie was easily the cinematography.In conclusion, the story sucked, the story is unfinished, but at least it looks good right?",A Quiet Place Part II

I was waiting eagerly for this movie to release as its more of a direct continuation to the predecessor. We also get to see some flashback on how all this started. Emily Blunt has played her role very well like she did in the prequel. Cilian Murphy (widely recognized as Tommy Shelby ), did a very good part with his strong acting. The movie did give a huge amount of thrill to the audience in general ;which is quite uncommon in even supernatural horror movies these days.. The climax was a nice resemblance to part 1 but the effect was bigger as it travelled through a broadcast signal. I would strongly recommend you to watch this film after watching the prequel as it pretty much serves as a continuation of it. Hats off to the cast and crew for creating such an interesting sequel . It Was one I definitely enjoyed.",A Quiet Place Part II
889,ethan-09114,Great Sequel,8,4 June 2021,"A Quiet Place Part II followed its predecessor very well. John Krasinski has shown he is a master of suspense and managed to not lose the momentum of the first film. The child actors improved greatly from the first film. Performances were all around incredible, Cillian Murphy was a great addition to the series.Some aspects of the plot felt forced, the typical character doing the dumb thing that no one would ever do.Would without a doubt recommend watching this to anyone who has seen the first, and recommend both to anyone who hasnt seen either.

Ummm...okay? And do they understand English? We've seen no such indication, but they must if the survivors on that island felt it necessary to broadcast the existence of their little community in a really obtuse song-based code that most normal people under extreme stress with other things on their minds (like minute-to-minute survival) would not have the patience or time to think about and figure out.

The whole plot of the movie was that the girl was gonna send her family to a island and take them there to save it. Not only do they not do that all at all, there isn't even a attempt....etc. The whole movie is spent on visiting the island, dramatic monster scene, Baby crying, Dramatic monster scene. It gets too repetitive and does very little to change stuff up and like I said the plot just doesn't connect because at the end you're left off almost exactly the same as the first movie. The girl uses her hearing aid to stun the monsters and then they kill them. WOW. They literally do that throughout the entire movie. With part 2 I was expecting something new, but instead I got the same formula, worse movie. This is more of a mindless movie you watch with your friends to have fun, it does have its scary moments but as a story, this thing is very all over the place. Overrated.",A Quiet Place Part II

I entered with high expectations and for the most part they were met. It still had thrilling and tense scenes and had good acting. It wasn't as good as the first one, but that's my opinion.Some people might have not enjoyed how short this movie was or how little information was given about the aliens, but if you view this movie as a second chapter to a bigger story you can appreciate it. I'm hoping that they make a third and final part to finish this story and end it well.",A Quiet Place Part II

Then it picks up right where it left off in the first one.i think that this one is scarier, there are more jump scares and a little more gore. You see the death angels more often then in the first. There is a little cussing. A kid gets their leg fought in a bear trap and that is very bloody and there is lots of screaming. People get gashes and guns are used. A girl ties a noose around a mans neck, some men look at reagan with unknown intentions... it looks like they might do something inappropriate to her but nothing happens. Overall AMAZING SEQUAL!

903,johnanderson1989,Disappointing for such a lengthy wait for a sequel,5,20 June 2021,"I'd been anticipating watching this for some time, after the first film this looked pretty good, with some unanswered questions and hopefully more drama/action.I have to admit I was sorely disappointed, the whole film felt rushed, lack of any meaningful story, all things seem to just happen too easily, supposed end of the world scenario but items or transport needed is readily available for example (without spoilers).Backstory was pretty meaningless, switching from day 1 to day 400 odd seems just pointless, plenty of days in between to fill the lack of story, but just brushed over really.Acting was good, but given the whole film has about 100-200 words spoken the whole film, I'd imagine it becomes easier.Some decent jump scares in a few places, but given the whole film is so quiet that's bound to happen.Could have been so much more, no doubt a third instalment is on the way too, but I think I won't be anticipating that one so much.I'd only say to watch this if your curious after seeing the first film, but don't go out of your way to see it.A 3 year wait for this seems a lot, given there is no real ""action"" or anything that could really justify 3 years.All in all it just feels like a rehash of the first film, basically leaving us in the same position as last time, with nothing particularly new added.",A Quiet Place Part II
904,contactsmp,Gave up after...,1,1 August 2021,"The moronic son left the protection of the 'bunker' to just wander around aimlessly like a complete pleb knowing the dangers. I was right with the movie right up until that point when the writers clearly said ""what act of total stupidity can we introduce to the plot?"". What do these studios take people for, mindless morons who can't see a constructed act of stupidity when its thrown in their face? Poor writing, no imagination, no creativity. Again, a good movie ruined by the ""why on gods earth is he even thinking about leaving the bunker let alone doing it for NO reason? Plot. Gave up, did not want to reward the makers with the honor of watching the entire film after this typically garbage and unintellectual plot twist.I am aware I am a viewer who cannot stand idiotic actions by a cast just to introduce a dumb plot twist, but writers should know, it's a farce when this happens, and simply says ""well, we ran out of ideas..."" It ruined the movie for me.1 * for pure stupidity and lack of imagination given these people get paid zillions for writing this tripe. Cast were great, the plot was pathetic.",A Quiet Place Part II
905,youarenotgoliath,"It is not often that a sequel can be better than the first, especially when you loved the first film.",10,3 June 2021,"It is rare to get a sequel to live up to the first film but I've seen it done.Titles like Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Aliens, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and so on sometimes depend on the budget or the writing, though often times it is the combination of both that allows the expansion of the world to bleed flawlessly into the pages of a screenplay that allows it to burn into images of a dystopian world that feels larger than life.I felt like this was more of a continuation to the first film but also told in such a new way that felt familiar. The Team up with Cillian Murphy and Millicent Simmonds felt like Joel and Elle from the Last of Us, or Hugh Jackman and Dafne Keen from Logan. It's a pairing that is rarely used in cinema that was refreshing to see, especially in a cinematic universe like this.The movie ends on a hopeful note and to be honest, left me wanting more. I felt it necessary to at least get an epilogue at the end, though the lack of one gives me hope that there could be room for a third installment.It was definitely worth seeing on the big screen and I hope that anyone reading this review enjoys the film as much as I did.",A Quiet Place Part II
906,hailtotheredskins,Hit The Fast Forward,4,25 July 2021,"I was looking forward to the sequel. Within in 20 minutes, I hit the fast forward for a 30 second speed-up but not figuring it a constant theme at that point. I was wrong. I did it several times as scenes were dragged out way too much.The only time I got caught was twice in the train scene and neither were import to the movie (they were more Jaws head popping out of the hole in the boat moments). Because no one could talk, it didn't take a genius to realize you wouldn't miss anything except jump-scares.There's no way a baby wouldn't be a burden and get everyone killed. At no point did the mom tussle with this and she should have (Sophie's Choice). What was life going to be like anyway with these creatures?Why are there creepy people being carefree, at the docks, when aliens are all around? Why didn't they go to the island or any island if they had access to the boats? Of course the aliens show up right when they're being the creepiest.Why were people on the island living carefree, partying and picnicking loudly when all it look was a boat launch for other people or the aliens to arrive? How did the the aliens sail a boat? How did 10 plus aliens fit on the boat? No wonder this wasn't shown.As with any movie with kids, they never listen and only cause trouble. Plus, you know kids starring in a movie never die. The adults were only there to clean up the kids messes. Because of this, the movie lacked a cleverness. The adults were never allowed to figure out a big plan to survive and defeat the vicious monsters. Therefore, the movie lacked sophistication. Horror movies with kids are awful. They ruin it from beginning to end.There was no ending. No understanding of where they came from, how many were here, or where else they were. Where was the military? With absolutely no ending, it's probably set for a 3rd but no doubt it'll be straight to Netflix/Hulu. No wonder John Krasinski or Emily Blunt didn't want any part of this sequel until coaxed with power and money. However, it won't be worth it in the long run.",A Quiet Place Part II

I only gave it a 5/10 as it felt like a TV Episode from a series rather than a film. Some good moments, but script and editing was a little sloppy in places with some scenes not making sense , unbelievable back stories and a lack of attention to details ( the miraculous appearance and disappearance of the indestructible earpiece, a set of keys that open doors without touching them, and many other parts that can not be excused in a film intended for the big screen ).If it was a TV show then I would have given it a slightly higher rate simply because of the two kids in the movie acting their socks off.

Some can be pretty good, albeit with some flaws, and others can be terrible and completely disrespect the quality of the original film. But on rare occasions, a perfect sequel is made; a film so good that it matches or even surpasses the original. The Godfather Part II, The Dark Knight and Shrek 2 were perfect sequels, and A Quiet Place Part II has joined that standard.John Krasinski has written and directed an excellent film. With this sequel, he masterfully expanded the world but kept the story character-focused, ensuring that the audience remained emotionally engaged throughout. It was brilliantly edited (massive credit to the editor, Michael P. Shawver) - the sequences showing the parallel difficulties of the characters were very effective in building suspense and emotion. The acting was sublime. Emily Blunt is a powerhouse and Noah Jupe is awesome, I loved their mother/son scenes together. Cillian Murphy once again proves that he is a gem that excels in every role he's given, but it is Millicent Simmonds who shines the brightest.It was great watching this in the cinema after such a long hiatus. A sequel like this was made to be experienced on the big screen, and I'm so glad Krasinski and Paramount made the decision to wait and not release this film digitally.

Yet, to do the same in a film that supposedly carries a bit more thought it just seems lazy.The son is terrified (showed it's part of his personality when even a baseball pitch freaked him out), eyes wide in every shot. But after getting his foot caught in a bear trap and told to watch a baby that he fears he cannot, he takes off on his own to look out a window with binoculars late at night. Good luck, baby.The daughter is all about the family, but only a day after leaving their burning home, she is leaving the remaining family to help strangers with a radio. Not to mention, she is deaf, so has little idea if her footsteps are making noise or the windows/doors she pushes open may produce a screech or other give-away that will bring the aliens coming.There's a mysterious group of baddies that were apparently horribly burned when they tried to escape by ferry to an island on day one of the attack. For whatever reason, they never attempt to go the island again, even though they have a marina full of boats. Instead, they try to lure outsiders to 'sacrifice to the aliens'? No reason is given. But the 'good guys' take a boat and soon arrive on the island. Seemed easy enough.Their old neighbor wears shoes. The family insists on going barefoot. Doesn't seem to cancel out the sound much and leaves for bloody feet.They inadvertantly bring an alien to the island - nice work. When running from the alien, hiding in a radio station garage, they only close the gararge door halfway. Hard to imagine what happens next.Instead of the daughter putting her hearing-aid to a stereo found in a house on the island (after just showing that she can do that), which would produce a head-splitting frequency for the aliens, they take off in a Mustang (or other classic)Only was rooting for Emily Blunt and the baby.First 30 minutes had me on my toes. After that, it was a snooze-fest.Perhaps the version released in China had a lot of parts clipped, and that's why the movie didn't seem to make much sense.

I was genuinely interested in this movie. As I thought the first film offered something fresh and exciting to the monster/horror genre.But after seeing the sequel I quickly realised it was unnecessary.I also think the writers forgot that suspends outweighs anything. Monster attack after monster attack made for a very boring movie. People doing stupid things, also why are the aliens, fairly stupid considering they've figured out interstellar space travel?I feel like this movie cheapens the first movie somewhat, and makes me very dubious to ever watch another sequel ever again.Dont bother with this film. If you haven't seen the first one, give it a go and move on to something else. You'll get nothing extra from this movie.",A Quiet Place Part II
944,matty006,"Fantastic Sequel, Just not as Effective",7,8 June 2021,"Picking up immediately after the events of the first film, 'A Quiet Place: Part II' follows the Abbott family as they leave their home in pursuit of a new safe haven.John Krasinski took the sci-fi horror scene by storm with the original idea of aliens on earth who can only hunt through sound and that film is amazing. 'A Quiet Place' felt fresh, tense and brilliantly made. Now the sequel is here and opens with a pre-title sequence showing the events of Day 1, when the aliens invaded. This opening scene is a good addition to the film, but does feel like a way for John Krasinski to put his face on screen after his character's death in the first part. After this though, we pick up immediately after the finale of the first film and follow Evelyn (Emily Blunt), Regan (Millicent Simmonds), Marcus (Noah Jupe) and the new born baby as they leave their home. Unfortunately, this opening feels too simple and not starting with a bang as it perhaps should have considering the first film ended with Emily Blunt cocking a gun after seeing a swarm of aliens coming for them on CCTV. One would therefore expect a fight or flight scene but somehow the aliens just aren't there and the family walk out nice and quietly without having to fight anything or run as fast as they can. This may be a movie mistake, or perhaps it can be explained but does add a continuity error of sorts here.After this initial possible error, the film does not hesitate in bringing us the scare factor of the first film with the family tripping a man-made alarm system and from here its full steam ahead. The family meet Emmett (Cillian Murphy), who helps them but has trauma of his own past to deal with and wants nothing to do with them, until young Regan decides to leave and find a way to save the world. Evelyn convinces Emmett to go and find her and from here we get two plot threads playing alongside one another.One plot thread is told more than the other and is definitely the more engaging one. The other is still good, but there isn't much to see that we haven't seen before and so perhaps doesn't have as much of an impact as we have seen similar scenes occur in the first part. Without giving away any spoilers, both of these plot threads have things go wrong when children don't do what they're told and when killer aliens are on the hunt, you really want them to listen to you.Technically the film isn't as good as its predecessors because while the first used sound mixing and editing in such an effective way that it made the film an experience, this sequel tends to use more of a Hollywood blockbuster way of sound mixing with, well, lots of noise and a big score. Simple and effective is what works best with these films and hopefully the inevitable third film (and final part if John Krasinski is to be believed) will go back to that way of film making because while this sequel is still a fantastic entry into the sci-fi horror genre, it's not as effective as it's predecessor.Review Summary:
While still a fantastic film, this sequel doesn't manage to match the uniqueness or quality of the first.",A Quiet Place Part II
945,p-t-watson,What was the point,2,4 July 2021,"I would have expected a sequel to answer some of the questions that I asked of the first movie. Why were the aliens here? What was the purpose of there visit? There is nothing that adds any value over the first movie; which was great and original. The sequel is a regurgitation that is empty and void of all thought. It presents the same problem as a lot of recent movies - good casting but unintelligent and boring story development, good cinematography that makes it seem like it's a high production movie but really all this is, is another 'N*tf**x' escapism peice of cheap garbage that answers no questions reveals nothing and bores the hell out of me. The only reason I can see why this has 7.5 imbd rating at time of writing is that there is very few movies of quality these days. Thanks Covid! (and N*tf**x)",A Quiet Place Part II

949,crazykittieboy,"Reconjuring Halloween II, Krasinski crafts a safe, but entertaining, sequel",8,2 June 2021,"In 1978,John Carpenter crafted a masterpiece of suspense that is widely considered one of the greatest horror films of all time. It also spanned a series of sequels (for better or worse).The first sequel, 1981's Halloween II, took an incredibly safe approach. Simply continue the story of the first one, directly after the first one, into the next day. This added very little to the lore, and by all accounts was an almost completely forgettable experience (though still maintained the same level of suspense as the first) due to the fact that nothing of value was added to the story.When John Carpenter went back to the story, with the 4th installment, he found himself adding more to the lore, but everything quickly fell apart. The sequel the masses wanted could not live up to what the masses envisioned in their heads.All this being said, Halloween II was a masterclass in directing a sequel, and Krasinski shows inspiration from Carpenter's work in his restraint for A Quiet Place Part II. Even though not much of value was added, it made an AWESOME theater experience, because viewers were given an hour and a half tour de force of the best parts of Halloween. This largely ""forgettable"" sequel was the only of the lot to ever capture that same feeling.If you loved Halloween II (1981), then by all accounts you will likely love and appreciate A Quiet Place Part II. It goes nowhere you wouldn't have thought it was already going by the ending of A Quiet Place, it adds absolutely nothing to character development for any of the main cast, it introduces people just to dispose of them quickly and fiercely, and it absolutely will provide entertainment throughout the entire sitting.Just don't come in expecting the deep introspective moments of the first film. They are absolutely missing, and the one scene where it may ""add"" to development of a new character of which I will not spoil, it doesn't work at all.A Quiet Place Part II accepts the first movie as the film it was: A breath of old air that tasted incredibly fresh because we have not had it in so long within the horror genre. It does not try to outdo the first film. It does not try to add to the first film or the lore behind it. It sees the storyline for what it is and heads 120 mph in that direction without taking so much as a breather.It is not A Quiet Place, nor should it be compared to it. Reviewers who claim it is better than the first are missing exactly what made the first so good. Reviewers who are lambasting this installment could use a refresher in filmography, especially horror sequels.Even though Halloween II came nowhere close to offering what the first installment did, it was one of the best horror sequels (IMO) of all time precisely because it understood it couldn't live up to that.Ultimately, Krasinski does the best he can with the remnants of what he had left after the ending of A Quiet Place. Some will groan at the end that we got Halloween II, but the alternative is Halloween IV.Ultimately, it fails to live up to its predecessor, but is more entertaining than any horror sequel in the past few decades. Sometimes, less is more. 8 out of 10.",A Quiet Place Part II

I became more excited knowing that Cillian Murphy would be included. Unfortunately it did not amount to what I had hoped for, and maybe that's why I did not enjoy it as much.The begining of the movie felt like it didn't need to be included considering what we already know from the first film. The middle part of the movie does grab your attention but leaves the ending feeling a bit dull and repetitive.The progression of the story felt forced and a lot of things seemed pointless.

With too many new characters and diverging plot points I feel as if this film set itself up for a bland conclusion, with all the moving parts dulling and cluttering the second act this film led me to boredom. A lot of plotlines are just dropped, finished inconclusively, characters' roles are either overplayed or underplayed. Certain scenes appear out of nowhere and lack soul and purpose.

Hey, I'm pregnant, lets have a child in the middle of an apocalypse were the monsters go by sound. She had a ton of choices to not have that baby but this is when you know that this movie is American. You could never get away with terminating a pregnancy or getting rid of a small child in a movie like this.A deaf character is also pretty dumb since this person will never be able to hear if they make any sound themselves, even with a hearing aid, or if someone is sneaking up on them.Monster is coming? How about standing still? No? After 2 years from the monsters arrived, you haven't figured out that the sound of rain is distracting to the monsters? Or any great amount of sound coming from all directions?The actors are amazing, the visuals are great. But I can't get over the amount of really really bad decisions the characters are doing.

It was a lot like the first movie being very quiet at times . So much so , sound was bleeding into the theatre from another movie that was a bit of a distraction at one point .When you analyze the movie , it comes up short .The beginning is a flashback to when the aliens came , which was cool , but it leaves some boxes unchecked . Wish they actually did more flashbacks , because things are missing , or I'm just confused . Like it appears they had an older son they may have lost , and the baby in the first movie , must have been the 2nd child they had after the aliens came . Then the hope the girl has to make things better ,kinda isn't such a revelation when fully thought thru . Then you have the ending , and that's the real disappointment..

Cillian Murphy is a good addition to the cast.Two ""problems"" I had: It would have been interesting to learn a bit more about those creatures and the people living in this world (I mean, who exactly are these ""boat people""?).And sometimes the situations get a bit repetitive.But nevertheless, this sequel is fun to watch and the end had me at the edge of my seat.If you liked the first part, you will enjoy the sequel, too!",A Quiet Place Part II

Like cutting a cable, and suddenly the guitar amp is battery driven? Come on.. That ruined so much for me. Also. Why was Emmett written in and/or at all staying alive? I mean. When you've lost everything that kept you alive. Why would you continue?.. That was never answered. And guys at the doc. Why hadn't they tried to get to the island? Would only seem logical to also try that when you've tried everything else. I mean. Both adults got their legs cut open in the end, basicly at the same time. And it all ends well because the kids saves them, at the same time in two different locations. It wasn't even a tiny bit exciting because you knew nobody would die..Plot 2/10

If the main cast stayed cooped up their house in wouldn't be much of a movie. I thought it was pretty suspenseful, jumped a few times. The family's friend was pretty good although he was still torn up inside over the loss of his family. I have to agree that the boy does find himself in a bad predicament over exploring the rest of the building they're currently staying at and it just makes him somewhat idiotic and weak but he does redeem himself at the end.

Long drawn out dramatic scenes with 30 seconds of looking into one of the characters' eyes. This can work but at the dramatic peak of the movie and only once. This was done like 5 or more times.

1009,msmorganrosewilliams,Such a great movie!! A few tweaks here and there.,9,24 July 2021,"I love John krasinski's growth in the movie industry. Truly love seeing him on film. Quiet place 2 was a great continuation of the first one. I don't like how some movie put all the focus on the main character and we only see the world through their perspective. John krasinski does a phenomenal job of giving every character enough screen time without overdoing it. I loved how every character had an important role and their own complexities and background. The plot of the movie(s) could turn out good or bad as far as execution. The acting was top tier. The relationships between these characters were written genuinely. I was on the edge of my seat with the suspense building up. I can't imagine how difficult it can be build suspense in a film with drawing it out too long...only thing I didn't like forreal was the fact that you put such a major veteran actor (Djimon Hounsou) into this role and killed him off quickly and in the most unrealistic way. You put your son in your soundproof closet during an attack, take on that hero role and lead the monster away, only to stop, start to deviate from your not-so-important character's semi- developed personality by freaking out about your son and making a whole lot of noice, and get got by the monster..idk..and I would have liked to see a flashback of what happened to emmett's family integrated in the film since he was a pretty important part of the story..also, I liked how the daughter left to go to the island and and emmett came later. I would have like more story time on the crazy people at the dock.",A Quiet Place Part II

1017,rattyjo,I really don't get all the low reviews,8,2 September 2021,"So many of the reviews that are 5 and under say they thought the first movie was crap - got to ask why would you bother with this then? I found it thoroughly entertaining. I would've liked more of the prequel stuff, but I found that to be an excellent opener to the movie. There was more action, more literal ground covered, new characters, lots of peril. The boy getting his ankle snapped in the trap was extreme and his pain seemed so genuine. The scene at the boat dock with the, inevitable, less than helpful survivors was really tense. I genuinely feared for Emmett and what was going to happen to Reagan. When he did the sign for 'dive' to her, echoing the football game at the beginning, it was brilliantly well done. He'd found someone he wanted to save. The characters grew in this movie.A lot of complaints are about ""stupid character decisions"". I always find this amusing. All those reviewers must be so convinced they'd be perfectly capable, even badass, in an apocalyptic scenario. They'd never make poor decisions or take silly risks. Like you're all Spec Ops or something. These are regular people, adapting to an entirely irregular way of surviving. Are kids going to be stupid? Hells yeah, they're stupid now!I don't see what the girl did as stupid. She saw a way to help lots of people, make things safer for her family, like her Dad did. She was selfish, reckless, stubborn and brave. She was human! The mother leaving her children to go to the pharmacy was a necessity. I saw reviews suggesting she just wandered off to the place her child died, fancied a bit of grave visiting for no reason. I wonder how much attention some people are paying to a movie to conclude that. She passed that on the way to the town, like in the first movie they cross the bridge from town to home. She needed to get her badly injured child drugs, and extra oxygen for the baby, chances are a raging sepsis and screaming infant was on the cards otherwise. What else should she do? How up like a good momma and wait for a man to save her?As for the boy wandering the compound, I admit I'm not sure why he would do that, other than to show us the mummified bodies of Emmets family. But it just made for good shouting at the TV - certainly wouldn't make me mark the movie anything under 8. He felt helpless, left alone, he was trying to be better.These movies are not meant to be all slashing, all shooting monster movies. They're about family and survival. With the backdrop of alien invasion and the terror of the almost unkillable creatures. Against horrendous odds. On that note, I also saw reviews asking why it's suddenly so easy to kill the creatures - they've slaughtered most of mankind undefeated. It's made clear in the first movie, something the father was working out - their weakness is that sound the hearing aid makes. Exposed to that they open their armoured heads which allows access to their softer parts - so yes, with that noise amplified and constant, a child could walk up and stab one in the head. That's not a plot hole. Think about how widespread survivors will be, how impossible it is to communicate what they know of the alien - the fact of the noise deterrent, the inability to swim.Both the older children stepped up in the absence of their father. I really hope they round this off as a trilogy. I'd like to see the family reunited and facing a different threat, I'd love to see more of the prequel stuff with Krasinski.",A Quiet Place Part II

1024,elmiragifta,Like the 1st one but way worse,3,13 August 2021,"Let me mention the good things first: cinematography is mind blowing, the acting, the sound effects. I love how we went as silent as they have to be. The first 10 minutes.Now let's start with what went wrong:
The characters are completely unworthy to root for, the kids are a liability. The discovery of the feedback barely makes a difference. The ending was unsatisfying, and an exact copy of the 1st. The monster have no purpose, no plan, neither does the humans. Is the monster so strong they could wipe out humanity? But at the same time they kinda just throw humans around, even during the first attack i feel like a lotta human would've survived that. And then we'd see they can be stop by a metal bar. Then the characters split up, classic. There's feral people that does nothing, barely a threat and we don't get why they don't just join the island people. The safe haven isn't that safe, where's the national guard anyway?. Instead of using the feedback as a sound fortress or something useful, they just did what they did like the 1st one. And for some reason the safe haven people just broadcasts a cryptic song instead of actual info when they have a functioning mic. So many plot holes. Characters like the boy can go from a scaredy cat to a curious one, wondering around with his busted leg, when the script demands he got everyone in trouble for absolutely no good reason, again. I still don't understand why they left the farm in the first place, it doesn't seem as pressing as walking with a baby to nowhere. The mother is barely likeable. Just.... don't waste your time. Every characters made questionable avoidable decisions. Just watch the 1st one again instead of wasting your time with this one.",A Quiet Place Part II

1030,cmoskito,First big surprise of 2021,9,30 May 2021,"I'm glad to say that this movie surprised me. Horror sequels tend to be infamously bad, and never live up to the first one. A quiet place has, however, surpassed the first movie. When they announced A Quiet Place part ii, I rolled my eyes. A Quiet Place was made as a solo film, and generally, making a sequel just because the first made money is a recipe for disaster. However, this may be an exception to prove the rule.John Krasinski's directing is undoubtedly growing, and shouldn't be questioned. The use of an anamorphic lens with 35mm film was expected, but still satisfying to see. In almost every case, Krasinski focuses on characters in both blocking and narrative. The character driven story adds to the suspense, and really makes you feel for the family. Some shots in this movie are breathtaking, especially the juxtaposition shots, like Evelyn on the bridge that represents the family's past, cross cut with Regan and Emmet on a bridge to the family's future, as well as both sequences where there are 2 or 3 different subplots coming together.Performances are incredible, and while Cillian Murphy doesn't quite match Krasinski's performance in the first movie, he gives a convincing performance for a man who has lost all hope in humanity, and it shows on his face when he learns that Regan was right. Emily Blunt kills it, although her character takes a backseat in this movie, while the kids take on more leading roles. And the kids are absolutely the stars of this movie. Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds, both taking on more ""leading"" roles in this movie, absolutely destroy it. Simmonds' quiet bravery as Regan in this movie is inspiring, and I honestly buy that she was able to convince Emmet to join her. Jupe's performance as Marcus may be my favorite role in the movie, as he finally faces his fear in the last few moments of the movie is a beautifully constructed and executed character arc.Once again, the film perfectly captures the terror of its high concept, and executes it well. Some of the same cheap jumpscares exist like in the last movie, but a lot of the scares are a lot better. Some of my favorites are when Regan is on the train, and every time it cuts back to her face, you can see the open train door in the background. Since there's no sound for her, you're always expecting the creature to be in the doorway when it cuts back, and it stretches the tension a perfect amount before the monster actually appears in the doorway.Marco Beltrami's score is once again fantastic, and is one of the only places in the movie that I was able to relax and get off the edge of my seat. That's a testament to both the quality of the score, and the fact that Krasinski keeps the movie tense the entire way through the movie, with next to no breaks, and it doesn't seem like it drags.The movie isn't perfect, though. The largest problem for me is the logic that the kids have. Horror movies always have the ""character does this stupid thing which calls the monster over"" cliche, but this movie takes it to the extreme. Regan leaving alone to go to the island is one of the worst character decisions in a horror movie ever, and she's way too smart for that. She knows she can't hear the monsters, and more importantly can't hear when she accidentally makes noise. I have no idea why she wouldn't at least try to convince someone else is beyond me. Same goes for when Marcus goes upstairs alone, and then falls backwards loudly. Both of these decisions lead to some incredible moments and the most tense parts of the movies, but in the theatre I couldn't stop thinking ""ahhh jesus why would they do that"".There's a huge hole to fill, with Krasinski's Lee dead, and Emmet doesn't quite fill it, although not for lack of trying. He has some good pseudo-father moments to Regan, however this franchise will never top Lee's death in the first movie. The opening sequence (although mostly spoiled by the trailer) is fantastic and one of the best I've seen, but it only reminds me how much better Krasinski was in the first movie, even the Murphy does a decent job.And yes, there are some world-building problems now that we know that the monsters can't swim. It also seems to me like the hearing of the monsters isn't as good as in the first movie. In the first movie, monsters would be on any scream in seconds, but in this movie, Marcus screams for a few minutes before one shows its face, and the monster is on the ceiling? For some reason?Regardless, this is the first surprise success of 2021, and John Krasinski continues to solidify himself as a serious actor/director. Fans of the first film will love this one, maybe even more than the first.",A Quiet Place Part II
1031,myralynortiz,Great sequel to wrap up the first one,8,4 September 2021,"I truly don't see what all the negative reviews were about. Honestly, I thought this was very well done, well acted, and was a great way of tying in the first movie. Most sequels don't even ""take you back"" to the previous movie, so I enjoyed the first bit where it leads into how the monsters arrived there in the first place.And let me just say...not many movies feature a deaf actor. As a hard of hearing person (I wear bilateral over the ear hearing aids), it was great to see diversity in a movie. Moreover, to see this genre of horror/thriller flicks that break the typical mold of gore, handsome jock, and clueless friends who aimlessly attract and invite death to their doorstep. For those that rated low for this movie, perhaps they were expecting something that typical and uncreative. I loved the uniqueness of the plot, the acting, and diversity the film brought.The only thing I didn't understand, and why I took off two stars was the fact that it wasn't explained why the people at the docking area/pier were different. They just were. I didn't understand what made them aggressive and zombie-like. But escaping on the boats and getting to the island were the primary objectives, so I let that kind of slide.Overall, I was impressed and happy with the outcome. I screamed, cried (I couldn't, just COULD NOT stand Marcus being in pain when his leg got caught in the near trap...and the fact that he couldn't scream was just UNBEARABLE...as a mom, this was heart-wrenching), and cheered the characters on when those vicious monsters were finally put to an end.

About 20 minutes into it, is was eager just to leave the theatre. If you have seen AQP1, then you've essentially seen the sequel added in a few more plot holes. A scared boy all pf a sudden gets the courage to explore his surroundings 24 hours after almost getting leg/foot amputated. Feral people trying to rob others when all victims have to do is scream and draw the aliens in closer. An alien is hidden on a boat that they take to a safe island. You mean to tell me that they didnt make noise the whole trip and the aliens was cognizant enough to lay a trap? No thank you. And they left it widee open for AQP2. Please just stop.",A Quiet Place Part II
1040,fbcxxw,Never been this quiet in a movie theatre,9,17 June 2021,A Quiet Place II is just terrific. Incredible suspense and great acting.The silent parts of the film has a way of sucking you into it as well. No one in the cinema made a sound. Not one popcorn were chewed upon during these sequences.

Now, with the second feature and let me say even better than the first has more chills, thrills, new characters, and a star making performance from hero Millicent Simmonds. Even with J. K. only in the feature for about 10 minutes( which if you saw the first you know why)..this is were the rookie writer/ director really becomes a professional and Krasinky is very talented. Even if you thought the first was just Okay you will truly enjoy the excitement from this second outing. Emily Blunt and Cillian Murphy are well played here also...Enjoy!",A Quiet Place Part II

This sequel seems to have been thrown together.. it's so rushed you can barely keep up. Cillian Murphy's character is one minute saying you can't stay and the next he's helping the daughter on her way. Two days later they're in some secluded commune.. the apocalypse style mad people at the harbour who were attacking them.. surely they must have known the monsters can't swim.. they live at a harbour after all.. had they never thought to take a boat out and find an island? All in all it was simply a re hash of the 1st movie without the heart, with the same nail biting situations and the same story lines. We know how to kill the monsters from the 1st movie but the ending of this one they are just killing them again like it's something new? We don't find out what happens to Blunt and her family in the factory.. very rushed and thrown together despite some brilliant acting.",A Quiet Place Part II

A few unnecessary jump scares and illogical decisions of characters (I mean if you're part of the 1% of survivors you should be very smart...) but overall very entertaining, great acting, clear plot that moved at a good pace. Go see it!",A Quiet Place Part II
1063,hfmarian,Pretty dumb,7,12 July 2021,"Ok, so I liked this from an entertaining value. It has a good pace to the plot, things flow well together and the characters are solid for the most part. But there are some strange decisions that made it fall a little flat when it comes to believability. I mean the same problem I had with the first part of this francize was first of all: WHY WOULD ANYONE HAVE A CHILD, WHO IS PRACTICALLY A LIVING ALLARM, IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS!? Despite the fact that they try to make you understand that they thought about it by being ""smart enough"" to create a sound proof crate and all, it still felt unlikely that anyone in that situation would've done that. Also there was the the fact that someone decided to make them walk bear foot, probably to make less noise while walking, but in a post apocalyptic environment full of debris, broken glass, rocks, sharp objects and even traps that could easily hurt you and even kill you from infection later. It's things like these that make me cringe the most, cause, even if you decide to create a situation that might never happen in reality, once you take away the actual survival aspect of it, when characters aren't intelligent enough to at least cover the basis while behaving like pure fictional pawns just to get the plot moving, then the audience will just not care about them, resulting in them disliking the movie.",A Quiet Place Part II
1064,otranto-dra,Incredible movie,10,28 May 2021,Everything about this movie is perfect. Emily and Cillian did incredible work giving Millicent and Noah the stage. They are future stars.,A Quiet Place Part II
1065,EssMoreno,A lot of people have negatively rated this film without really understanding what kids are like,9,6 August 2021,"Not sure why it's getting such bad ratings on here. Theres some saying it's the same film as the first, when it's not, the only thing story wise that's the same is the ending solves the current problem they're facing, except in the second film it's actually a means to an end of the whole alien invasion. There's amazing cinematography at work and honestly the whole crew has done a great job here, including the actors who've all put on great performances.Some have also mentioned there's dumb moves made by the characters, namely the children, just to add to a scare factor when in reality the son makes stupid moves because (you guessed it) he's a kid. It's too easy to say that in the year or so that they're meant to be in this situation that this kid would have matured to the point of thinking like an adult should. The same thing goes for the deaf girl, yes she makes stupid decisions but she means well and she's still a child, she doesn't have the ability to foresee her actions as well as she should. I think as much as these scenes are difficult because we feel they should no better, they're actually honest of what children would be likely to do in difficult situations because they don't have the maturity to know better. If it was a bunch of adults making the same dumb decisions, then potentially I could see what some of these reviews were saying.For me I loved it, it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, stressed about everything that was going on in the film (in the best way) and where it would go next. While I understood what the end goal was, I couldn't foresee exactly what was going to happen in-between and I think that's the sign of a good horror/thriller. Personally I'd put this under thriller. As usual watch the movie and make your own mind up, but if you go in looking to have a good time you'll be happy you went to see this.",A Quiet Place Part II
1066,offshade,Too many weaknesses,5,9 July 2021,"There was not a single person in the whole writing/production/acting team to say, ""wait a minute, you know that a vinyl record can't play in a loop on its own, right?"" And there you have it. This is the level of stupidity and Illogical decisions you have to simply ignore to enjoy the good aspects of the film - some moments of tension and a few very well made action sequences. However, the editing is poor (cutting back and forth to different storylines way too often and too harshly) and there is way too much music (especially compared to the first film, making it a much less quiet film), resulting in softening the tension. Definitely a step down from its predecessor and somewhat disappointing.",A Quiet Place Part II
1067,stephenh82,10/10,10,2 August 2021,"Excellent squeal. In my opinion, it was better than the first as we got to see more of the aliens and how terrifying they are. ( reminds me of the last of us clickers, which I wonder did they get the idea from that )

1070,KuroSawWhat,"More of the same. Competent and interesting, but unsurprising.",7,15 June 2021,"Whatever you thought about A Quiet Place Part 1, you will also think about this film. It is one of the purest examples I have seen of ""more of the same"". They shuffled up the formula just enough to hold your attention, but they are not doing anything new, risky, or innovative. The film is competently directed, interesting, and well-acted, just like before. But it is also very predictable, with overly-telegraphed plot points, and plays out in a very by-the-numbers fashion, just like before. It is another highly polished monster flick that isn't pushing any boundaries, and there is nothing wrong with that. Part 2 is worth a watch.Special note: The trailers before the movie were 25 minutes long. The worst I've ever seen. I was on the verge of leaving the theatre when the film finally began.

1077,JohnRausch,Movies with no ending,2,4 June 2021,"Most movies with sequels have a definitive ending or leave you thinking about what's next. They might not have a sequel, but that's okay, use your imagination. This is a common way to end movies, and it's good to walk out of the theater thinking about what you just saw. You could not see a sequel and still be pleased. Or you might see a sequel that was obviously made only for the money. The Star Wars movies are a good example of movies with good sequels - most of them.The Quiet place movies end as if someone forgot to play the last reel. No ending at all, just ""we ran out of time"", or money or ideas for what's next, etc. Not only that, but QP 2 starts off where QP 1 should have (sorry, we forget to tell you how the bad stuff started in QP 1), then assumes you had seen QP 1, and then moves at a snails pace.Someone dropped the screenplays and didn't pick them up in the right sequence.",A Quiet Place Part II

As the premise stayed the same in PART II, now the characters acted dumber, the actors acted dumber and the jump scares got dumber. Ah yes, and there was a story somewhere - but dumber.The first thing you need in an apocalypse is toilet paper. Yeah, we all know. The second thing is of course comfy shoes, because you will be injured without shoes. And if your feet are injured, you can't move. And if you can't move, you will die soonish. So let the characters stroll in dangerous, unknown territory bare feet. I had to spell it out, because it is so dumb.Next thing you would need to kill things is, I don't know, GUNS and distractions for the monsters!? I know cheap China children's toys, like dancing noisy teddy bears, which you can load with a spring, are hard to come by, because of all the apocalypse thing, but stupid AR15's? Cmon, every American with a T level above zero has like 3 of them.I won't say anything about the island, because that would spoil the fun.

1090,enigma49,Surprisingly bad,1,1 July 2021,"What the hell did I just watch?? I feel sorry for the actors in this movie for having to act out this horrible story on screen. The best part about this was the beginning where they show it all started....but after that it turned into a horrifying, boring mess. It turns out that the premise of the story, that you have to be quiet, is just an excuse to avoid any meaningful dialogues and the development of a meaningful story in general. Emmett is basically the only new, somewhat interesting character being introduced yet we learn almost nothing about him. Why am I supposed to like any of these characters? Who are they?Now the story.... A DEAF girl going on a solo mission in a world where making just one loud noise might kill you? The one great weakness of the aliens is that they can't swim? Really? And why do the survivors feel the need to encrypt their message through a song instead of just sending out a message that goes ""We're on island X - oh and by the way, the monsters can't swim!"". Also how did the bandits never find out about this island? And how did the bandits think their robbery would go when in a world like this the victim can just suicide-scream their way out of their predicament? Why did the survivors not prepare any defenses but instead they're living a surreal 50s suburbia life on their little paradise island? It's bizarre.There are many more flaws I could point out but I think this is all you have to know. Very bad movie.",A Quiet Place Part II

There is more tension to this, I feel.The one thing I would have liked (which is a minor complaint) is that I would have liked to see more about the origins of the creatures - like how they landed in great numbers, why they chose to land on Earth and how did the initial military response go to the attacks and so on. I felt that part of the origin story could've been explored more rather than the limited time they gave to it at the start of the movie. It didn't really explain much other than the fact that it took everyone by surprise.Apart from that minor critique I really enjoyed it. As far as sequels go this was well made. Good casting choices as well. I would love to see more sequels to this one if that is even possible. Ignore the negative reviews and just watch it - it is worth the time.",A Quiet Place Part II

Or just a fresh pair of bandages to replace the tattered messes they have wrapped around their feet?-The creatures are powerful, dangerous, and angry, but they aren't exactly geniuses. Instead of broadcasting a cryptic message by way of a single song repeated endlessly, why not record and broadcast over and over the message: ""ATTENTION: the creatures can't swim! Come join us on South Island!"" (or whatever it's called).Anyway...good acting, interesting story, appropriate mood music, and plenty of jump scare fun. Just don't think too hard about it.",A Quiet Place Part II

Characters make you feel their emotion and Emily Blunt is rock solid as a mom trying to protect her family. Loved seeing my favorite Peaky Blinders actor help steal some scenes as well. Finally something different! No profanity, no nudity, nothing controversial and it is rated super high right now (please take note Hollywood).",A Quiet Place Part II

I think it's essential that movies can be criticized and scrutinized severely by the public. But I can't understand it in this case. Sure, it's not a classic of world cinema by any stretch of the imagination. But... I was impressed...Characters have depth, the acting is very very good, the cinematography is way way beyond expectations (especially in Part II), the story is there... and it's exciting. Some of the storytelling devices John Krasinski used were really complicated to apply. The editing was seamless (except at the climax scene where I really didn't like one thing when they were inter-cutting between storylines, but I don't want to say what so I don't have to tick the Spoilers box).I mean... there's absolutely no philosophy to this movie.

The acting was good, nothing special, but each actor played their character well. The script went nowhere, but there was some good reincorporation in a few scenes. I thought the music was a mess, like you could literally tell when a scare was coming because those were the only scenes without music, the film would have been better without a score because it would have added more tension, but no, some sappy violin song would play whenever the characters were okay, so you would always know when a scary scene would come, which made it less tense in my opinion. Also every character would take such unnecessary risks to the point of not feeling sorry for them because I was thinking in my head the whole time yea what you expect was going to happen if you did something so stupid or pointlessly unnecessary. The movie was still enjoyable and I'll probably see the next one if it ever comes out.",A Quiet Place Part II

Maybe not.. it's hard to tell.. I would hope there is a part 3. Opportunity was wasted on how the story line went as opposed to a rehash of similar events to the first movie.

1121,jonesbrady-48369,Keep the ratings high on this one. John deserves it!!!,10,31 May 2021,"If you love movies, watch this movie!!This movie is unique, incredibly written, incredibly directed, and impeccably written and acted.(Please read this before watching because I will basically force you to watch with this review)John Krasinski's writing is like nothing I have ever seen. I am trying not to explain this movie to much that I give it away but it is seriously something you need to see to believe. He isn't Martin Scorsese. He isn't Quinton Terintino. HE IS JOHN KRASINSKI. He can quit acting for all I care now. When I saw the first movie I thought it was so well written and so well directed but thought maybe it was just one movie and he couldn't do it again. After watching this second movie I can see the true unique artistic style of this writer and directed and can say that we will see a whole different type of cinema if John keeps putting movies to the screen.(Also a big thanks to you John for filming at my home town in Grand Island New York!!Didn't think you would actually put our bridges in the movie as much as you did!!)
The Scene flips in this movie were absolutely impeccable, and perfectly timed. I was at the edge of my seat the entire movie and was literally put in survival mode watching it. I know it isn't ""The Departed"" and it isn't ""Inception"" but this movie is unique, well acted and well written enough to deserve a high rated score. I won't be happy unless this movie is a 8/10 or above. It deserves it.As for the soundtrack, I cannot go on about this Fricking soundtrack. As a man who is in love with music and listens to instrumentals when he works, I can say that when listening to this soundtrack I know it is A Quiet Place. And that is hard to do with movies. There are only a few movie soundtracks when I hear it, that I know that it is a certain movie. And when I hear this one I immediately know that it is A Quiet Place.Marco Beltrami deserves an award.Then there is the acting-
Cillian Murphy is one of the most surprising yet astonishing actors of our time and it is about time he had been put into a renounded movie since inception. He brought me to that point of serious, survival, war-torn instinct almost from the exact moment he hit the screen. He deserves some kind of award for the way he acted in this movie. Although not much words were said, when he said something he said it in the way you would think someone in his position would say it, without any questions.Emily blunt demolished any horrible critics expectations of her acting in this second movie. She was literally on fire in this role and took the ""mama saving her Cubs"" to a whole different level and can't wait to see what she will do in the future.Noah Jupe. All I can say is Noah Jupe, Noah Jupe NOAH JUPE!!! This kid is going to be something. He legitimately added almost any form of trauma, heartache and sympathy that was needed for this movie to be amazing. I mean without this kid in the movie I maybe wouldn't have rated it as high. Whoever casted this kid was absolutely correct in his/her thinking and I send a congrats to you my friend.Millicent Simmonds was almost to perfect. I can't tell if this girl is really deaf or not in real life after watching this movie. The way she tackled this role from the start in both movies really shows that she is here to stay.And as for John KRASINSKI, his acting goes without saying that he has been, is now and always will show up to play. You deserve an award my friend and hope you go far in your career.God Bless and Go Red Sox!!",A Quiet Place Part II

1133,danielecarlesso,Not so quiet anymore,7,27 June 2021,"I'll admit, I personally did not enjoy much the first movie. While I really appreciated the idea of silence, I think that 'A quiet place' was a bit boring and that the plot could be developed in a better way (i.e., why sacrifice yourself when you can just throw an object far away?).The second movie is kind of more-of-the-same, but with more money and more production behind it. This movie felt less independently-made and experimental compared to the first one, and the visuals definitely improved.I really enjoyed the first section of the movie, where we become finally aware of what these monsters are and where they come from. However, after this section we definitely lose John and the movie becomes a little...dull. While the first movie was experimental and very quiet, here we have all the ingredients for a classic blockbuster horror: there are the typical scenes in which you would just want to scream ""what the f°°° are you doing?"" at the characters, the cheap jump scares and the child hero. In addition, most of the movie is predictable. I never felt tension for the characters. There's no way that Emily, the children or whoever else are gonna die. Also on the photography side, the movie is way to bright for the kind of feeling that it wants to transmit.Do not get me wrong, it is a good movie and a fun watch. Emily Blunt did really well and conquer the screen, even though we lost all the amazing chemistry between her and John that was present in the first movie. I enjoyed being in the cinemas to watch it, and I'll probably watch it again in the future (maybe in a couple of years, before the next chapter in the series). However, it is undeniable that this sequel lost some of the charm of the previous movie.",A Quiet Place Part II

1139,j_gibbs_09,Plot Holes and Lazy Writing,4,18 June 2021,"I was very excited to see this movie as it was my first cinema experience post lockdown. The first movie was not perfect but was very enjoyable and well worth a watch.However the second movie was full of way too many issues with the script that were too difficult to ignore. Most of these issues seemed due to lazy writing.WARNING SPOILERSFirst off the overall movie doesn't really ever get fully going, you are constantly wondering what the main premise is going to be. Then next you know the movie is over and you are left feeling confused and hungry for a real story with a proper resolution. It actually almost seems as though there was a lot edited out of the final cut that might have tied some of it together.Now I want to highlight some specific examples that really bothered me. The opening scene has a part where Cillian Murphy's son should have slid into homeplate. However he keeps shouting for him to ""dive"". He then asks what the sign language sign was for this is. I was very confused at why he would use the incorrect terminology here. Then midway through the movie you are given a scene where Cillian Murphy does a sign to the daughter to dive into safety. I literally burst into laughter at this scene due to the realization of the earlier scene. This was some makeshift glued attempt at an ""aha"" moment.Next we have the scene where Emily Blunt tells her son she is going to get ""medicine"" for him. She is then seen grabbing spare oxygen tanks and no medicine. We are then introduced to the idea that the oxygen is almost out and the kids almost die in the airtight chamber. Why would they not emphasis this earlier? Seemed like a massive oversight that left the audience very confused. During this scene we also get to see Cillian Murphys dead wife. This scene does nothing for the plot or character development. Just purely added in for an excuse for the boy to do something stupid and cause the monsters to chase them yet again.Finally the ending. The ending was the cheesiest and lamest scene yet, it was laughable. We have a scene where the two kids are both faced with monsters and they have to now act brave and kill them. They then cut between the two scenes of them killing the monsters with some emotional music playing. The daughter bashes the monster with some steel rod. Then next scene she is pulling the rod out of its ear as if she stabbed it. Such a massive continuity error that clearly was let go due to lazy writing and directing. There is no chance that was not noticed on the final edit.Anyways I have no idea how this movie is getting good reviews, save the time and only watch it if you are bored or want a laugh.",A Quiet Place Part II
1140,brj123184,Why do reviewers think horror movies have to be logical?,7,31 July 2021,"Most of the negative reviews are from individuals incapable of suspending their logic and expect this horror movie to be logical. ARE YOU KIDDING???That's why it's in the horror genre!! They are not normally plausible plots and the reviewers are either incredibly stupid or just egging the others on. I don't watch horror movies. The last one I saw before Quiet 1 was Rosemary's Baby. This movie has a good plot and very good acting, particularly Emily Blunt who is capable of an unlimited array of emotions with facial expressions alone.The cinematography is good as the family battles the monsters with guile and weapons.

1157,cebridgman,Amazing,10,8 June 2021,Not since Terminator 2 has a sequel been better than the original. A Quiet Place 2 is masterfully done and the action is top notch. It's one of those movies you can't stop thinking about even a week after you see it. I'm already planning on going to see it again. This is a must see in the theater because of how much the sound plays a part in the suspense and action. This could very well be the next great movie franchise.,A Quiet Place Part II
1158,alexpn66,"Better than the first, but not flawless",7,29 May 2021,"I'll say it. Part 2 is better than Part 1. It's not often that happens but for A Quiet Place, it's more than true. This isn't a knock on Part 1, although it had its logical holes, this is just praise for the suspense created in Part 2.From start to finish, there is pure tension with very few gaps to relax. The opening sequence is heart-pounding and masterfully shot. Performances all-around were fantastic, and the story has more depth to it than it did in Part 1.It's not perfect. Like Part 1, there are moments you need to suspend belief and just roll with the ride. For the most part, this is easy enough to do but there are some fairly minor plot holes some may find bothersome, such as why Regan (the deaf girl) was able to figure out a fairly easy way to incapacitate the monsters whilst the world's militaries apparently couldn't do the same thing.That's somewhat of a nitpick, I'll admit, but it crossed my mind several times.Overall, this is a wonderfully made sequel and one that sets up a third installment.",A Quiet Place Part II

It knows it is a sequel and it carries the first movie as the golden rule. Having already explored the characters and their inner journey as a character, its main focus is to expand its world and its lore in its very simple permissive and show us the ramifications of the first movie. The delight of this movie is to show us other post-apocalyptic scenarios in which not making a sound is required. To be a sequel it is its own curse, which prevents it from surpass the groundbreaking first movie, which had the privilege to set the rules.",A Quiet Place Part II

The first one was good as a tense horror flick no doubt, it did have some plot holes but it kept you distracted enough to not think about them too much.The sequel doesn't really add much other than to emphasise some of those holes though. It repeats what the first film did very well, the tension is palpable and had me on the edge of my seat more than once, the acting again was top notch even from the newer characters introduced to the story and the creatures were once again terrifying.It does advance the story a little from the first one though, and I did particularly like the fact that the film started directly from the end of the first one, albeit after a flashback to give a little backstory and history.Without giving away any spoilers, there are some moments that seem quite clever, but equally there are a few that seem just plain silly.All in all not a bad film, it has most of the ingredients right.

There's a small prequel in the opening scene, which is such a treat, especially because you don't realize it's the back story at first, and so well done. The tension in this movie gives it an intensity factor of 10! I was biting my knuckles for most of the movie and secretly yelling at the moronic actions of the kids in my head. Some people might argue that the kids' dumb choices could be better written, but I can totally see my kids making the same mistakes. It was jump scare city, but beautifully done. I could predict alot of them, but there were a few that really caught me off guard. I'm not a fan of jump scares, but these were completely appropriate given the character of the movie. This will go down as one of those select few sequels that were better than the first. Great job John and Emily!",A Quiet Place Part II

And if so, why not just go to another country, instead of waiting around to get slaughtered. And these kids in the movie....! Omg!!! They couldn't get any more stupid!!! Picture this... You find yourself in imminent danger. You see one of these things coming in on you. Why not throw a rock or a bottle in some other direction to make a safe getaway. And if these monster are attracted by sound and have no eyes. How is it that they just always seem to find a way through doors, windows, incinerators...etc? Also, are they only attracted to people sounds, because they're have been a few close calls with birds and no monsters around to attack them. IDK.

I guess its easier to make a movie with no dialogue, even easier when you add a deaf character. The alien creatures in the movie are very generic.

It was just muh w/ generic monsters, kind of like 'The Last of Us' mixed w/ 'Pitch Black', but takes itself way too seriously (I got the feeling the director actually thought he was remaking 'The Road' at points).The actors performances were OK, except for Emily Blunt who I thought was pretending to be blind for a while as she was staring so hard and sadly all the time.The monsters were also laughable, I haven't seen a less physically scary entity since the 'Blair Witch' remake. Just humanoid bodies w/ long arms and legs and a head that looked like a Brussel sprout falling apart.Not that scary. Not as much fun as it should of been. Not sure what the point was. I'm seeing lots of good reviews on here, but in the cinema I was in , there were walk outs.The best parts were the beginning that reminded me of the pre-credit 'Dawn of the Dead' remake sequence w/ all the street chaos and the young daughters determination, but a creature feature simply can't survive a rubbishly designed monster, if 'Alien' had this monster it would be 'Xtro'.Don't believe the hype.",A Quiet Place Part II

The movie plays trick with the viewer, it's no expositive and the sensory experience is always there putting you at the edge of the chair with a lot of suspense, action and thrillers elements with pinches of drama (for me) on the right way. The characters talk with the expressions, with the posture and they really seem fragile human and you worry about there life.It's not a perfect movie, some events it's to rush, lot of things a not explained or appropriated worked and has some facilitations is used , some actions are questionable, but for me the goods and more the bad aspects.

1179,DnvrWolf,Excellent sequel featuring some important character development,8,29 May 2021,"This story picks up immediately after the first movie with the surviving members of the Abbott family, mother Evelyn (Emily Blunt), daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds), and son Marcus (Noah Jupe) leaving the farm to seek new shelter. They meet Emmett (Cillian Murphy) an old friend of the family who is willing to help. As you might remember, Regan's assisted hearing device creates an unusual sonic feedback with audio equipment which causes great pain in the blind, sound-seeking aliens ravaging the country-side. Regan and Emmett set out to share this weapon with other groups of survivors while Evelyn seeks medical supplies for Marcus's serious injury.I want to focus on two excitingly wonderful things about this movie:1) This is a very efficient movie, clocking in at only 1 hour and 37 minutes! Finally, an effective, exciting, action-packed movie that just gets to the point and doesn't even need two hours.2) Even with that short run time, this movie succeeds in the one crucial requirement for a movie of this type: the creation, retention, and extension of real, visceral, arm-rest-clenching suspense. The movie sets up three separate storylines, concurrent in time but happening at different locations. As the action intensifies, the movie cuts between these three locations, many times leaving one story unresolved while cutting to one of the others. This creates an enormous about of suspense and maybe even an entertaining form of frustration for the audience. This is the sort of thing that works very well for action, horror, sci-fi movies.The first movie really milked the idea of quiet = survival. That was an interesting gimmick that propelled that movie forward. But the writing seems different in this next movie. Here, the writers strained and stretched the characters to wrap them around this silence premise. I guess that while it worked for the first movie, it's now familiar and clique. There are some moments where the writers too obviously use contrived situations, breaking some established character development, just to make some noise. This is most evident in the character of Marcus. Jupe is a good actor, but can't escape the poor writing for his character in a couple of these key scenes. The writing for Marcus is clunky and inconsistent. Don't worry, Noah, we know it's not your fault.As a balance to that flaw I want to point out one excellent scene where Marcus is angry with Regan while discussing her plan to leave the group. Jupe is a masterful actor, conveying anger on his face and in his gestures as he silently yet furiously signs his emotional responses to his sister. All mixed with obvious fear for her safety. Great stuff.While the material and premise doesn't quite carry the movie as well as it did in the first film, this sequel is only just a notch or two below it. Well worthy of a ticket purchase to enjoy the tantalizing suspense!",A Quiet Place Part II

1181,dnaniloy,"Things are happening, but not quite sure why!",5,23 July 2021,"I am still processing the moral of the 2nd part of A Quiet Place.Why the events that occurred occurred? What was the point of those bandits part? What was the main task the two should have done after reaching the island? Why were the islanders just not telling others to come to their exact location instead of playing that stupid song? Just introduced some new characters who literally had zero impact on the story. To add to these, the children so awfully making those blunders just for the sake of building up thrilling situations made it more painful.A number of ambiguous things left in the first part were expected to be made clear in the second part. It neither adds anything essential to the first part's story, nor explains the backstory of the things that happened in the movie. Instead, some more vague things have been added to the story, like ""the people who are not worth saving (the bandits)"", the story of the island, etc. And if they are planning to unveil them all in another sequel, then I have got to admit that I'm neither ready nor patient enough to take that pain.Overall it was watchable, just for the sake of watching, thanks to the cinematography and acting.

I didn't think it was nearly as great or masterful as people claimed it was. However, I actually think Part 2 was better than the Original.The story is better, the acting is better, the visceral situations and character reactions are IMO more realistic than in the first film. The sequel builds on the original by shifting character motivations on the both the eldest children as opposed to the parents in the previous film. This film is far from being a masterpiece. It is just barely better than the first. It has a LOT of flaws.In the first film, John Krasinski did an excellent job with the sound, and cinematography, but there were serious plot holes that were hard explain way. Like how long it took to find out the Alien's weakness and characters making SUPER unnecessary safety risks. With the second film, Krasinski excelled in the writing/plot and characters but didn't do well enough with the technical aspects. The dialogue is hard to hear, the cinematography is not as compelling as it was in the first, and there's too much to the soundtrack in this film. I would have actually liked for the film to have no soundtrack, and instead rely on the sound design (Hitchcock's ' The Birds' is great example). The ending is perfect! I honestly think the producers should stop at #2 considering there is not much else of the story to explore.Overall this is a good film that builds on the original and manages to thrill, despite its flaws.

I loved the way that the movie told how the world was before the monsters arrived and then led into the next part of the story after the original movie. I'm no critic but I loved the parallel scenes during the action which caused your concern to be doubled for the characters. The actors were all very believable and expressed themselves without the use of words which I believe most be more difficult as an artist. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and will watch this movie again. I look forward to seeing the next chapter in this story. I did want to add that I watched the first Quiet Place movie a few days before watching this movie.

A Quiet Place 2 is just as good as the first one maybe even better, it definitely has a rewatchablity factor. I was up the whole film scared and shaking with emotion. I felt every dramatic screen John Krasinski as the director was trying to make me feel. John wrote and directored this moive just like he did the first one but alone. He did a fantastic job! A Quiet Place 2 has more story, character development and depth to it. The story and characters are more expanded on, even the horror factor is bumped up a little more. I had more JUMP scares that freaked me out and the intensity of the film was great and the build up. One of my favorite characters in the film besides Emily Blunt who was also fantastic, was the boy Noah Jupe who I didn't even remember his character from the first movie, but Noah was a fantastic actor he did such a good job and gave a lot of emotion and depth to his role when he needed to. I felt the pain that he was feeling in the movie as he was feeling it. I also loved Millicent Simmonds, she had a big role in the film that was done so good, she carried the film and the ending was something to behold. At the end of the movie I realized that I had a wonderfully time, and the moive was so good, probably the best of the year at least so far. I would definitely recommend. Please see it in a theater were movies are supposed to be seen. John krasinski did amazing, im still shaking with intensity, and also the score of the film was amazing. It definitely build up the intense moments. I've give this movie an A- cinema score.",A Quiet Place Part II

1208,tommygriffin-69140,Refreshing.,9,28 May 2021,"I just saw this film today and let me just say it was phenomenal. It exceeded all of my expectations. Krasinski builds on the first film perfectly and shows his advancement as a filmmaker. The film is suspenseful from the jump and never lets up. Not a single moment was wasted and the pacing was relentless. The sound effects were also so so great and the score was brilliant once it kicked in. Cillian Murphy is just incredible in this film and continues to be one of the most underrated actors working today. Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, and Noah Jupe all give amazing performances as well. The bar was set very high for Krasinski after A Quiet Place and in my opinion, he surpassed it in every way. It was refreshing to see a great movie like this in the theater again and have an awesome experience with it. Definitely my favorite film of 2021 so far.My score: 94%",A Quiet Place Part II

They can never match the energy of the first.But this is a perfect way to continue the story. I love how they start it off immediately where the last left off (with a little bit of before in there too). You grow to love and connect with the characters even more, thanks to the wonderful actors. You are just as tense as you were the first.I consider this true horror. I'm not a fan of movies that rely on jump scares.

This was a great movie to set the mood once again and remind you why theaters are necessary.The beginning of this film was awesome. Set the mood beautifully for the rest of the film. Created an amazing hook to keep your eyes on the screen. My 5 year old daughter took a tablet and earphones to let me and my wife watch a ""scary"" movie, but she was also wide eyed open during the whole film. Lol.Only reason why this was not a 10 for me, II personally felt like we needed more inside information on the monsters. There was some sort of explanation at the beginning, but it was not clear. Repetition from the first film was also present. Felt like i was watching part 1 at some point, also the length of the movie felt short. Like it had more to give. But sets it up for a part 3 if Krasinski decides to go for it, I would welcome it.These reasons are not a deal breaker at all. Must Watch.",A Quiet Place Part II

I thought this movie would go my senses because of so many people in the trailer as opposed to the first movie but the plot was entertaining from the intro. The DAY 1 intro was gripping to say the least and the film takes you from thereActing was good but the best was EMILY BLUNT again some scenes seemed forced to thrill up the plot but overall I wanted to see this movie again as soon as it finished.,A Quiet Place Part II

1233,adamwolfley,A very formulated forced mess,2,25 June 2021,"Everything in this movie seems so incredibly predictable and sloppy, none of the characters feel believable at all, which is pretty much how I felt for the first movie too. There is no sense of subtle reincorporation within the movie whatsoever(particularly asking the deaf girl how to dive out of the blue) and all of the problems in the first movie are still there. None of the characters are memorable at all, like to the point where I was referring to the main characters by their real life names. Aboslutely nothing happens in any sort of fluid manner and the overall plot of the film is something weve seen in horror films over and over. Every single issue feels incredibly forced and out of the blue to the point where you can PREDICT THE STUPID SHIZNIT that's gonna happen like it's a punchline. The part when Emily Blunt leaves her child alone with the bear trap kid is really dumb, it was so forced to create conflict because conveniently they're running out of air, which is understandable I guess, but absolutely NOTHING was understandable about the the beartrap kid to LEAVE THE NEWBORN ALONE AND START WANDERING AROUND FOR NO REASON??? I guess it was to advance the scary parts of the movie! Also why does the deaf girl go inside the train, what's the purpose, just walk around? I guess the argument is to get supplies, but also, don't you have a set goal to go to and a map to that goal, wouldnt you just rush straight there? Another argument would probably be that walking through the train would be quieter cause its inside, but I HARDLY doubt that walking on metal would be any more quiet that walking on the dirt. There are so many dumb jumpscares in the movie that again feel so forced. There's plenty of stuff in the movie that contradicts with the rules that they established in the movie. The entire scene when they are getting the boat is the worst part of the movie, every part of that scene felt incredibly forced and stupid. They brought in a bunch of new characters who all were essentially fodder, especially the guy who was like ""I GOTTA SAVE MY FAMILY"" and then just dies literally 2 seconds later. It was hilarious. The ending scene was really REALLY stupid, it was supposed to look super serious, but it just felt really dumb watching both of these characters slowly walk up to the spooky monsters and kill them, I dunno, that just felt incredibly cheesy.The overall movie was a complete mess and just built on the even worse mess that is the first movie. The problem also with this movie is that its hard to even watch this as a comedy because its so ridiculously average.2/10.",A Quiet Place Part II
1234,amybrownn,Best Cinema Going...,9,20 June 2021,"I had loved the first part of this probable trilogy, so was fairly excited to see what happened next. My expectations were met and surpassed, with the plot and action scenes as heart-racing and wrenching as ever - if not more than the first! The tying up of Evelyn and Lee's relationship from the events of the first movie was well needed, and it was evident to see that Evelyn struggled throughout the movie in an almost numb-grief even when it wasn't the direct centre of the scene - a credit to Emily Blunt's acting, of course. It was great to see the children stepping up to face on the monster-alien-things, and I was blown away especially by Millicent Simmonds, and really appreciated how she got her own spotlight for a good chunk of the movie to show just how good she is! Cillian Murphy was an amazing addition, however his change in attitude from wanting the Abbot family to leave his compound to willingly helping them (despite the fact they arguably did more harm than good a lot of the time, and disrupted his peace entirely) felt a little quick and underwhelming. I had hoped for more of an in-depth back story to these monsters, too, since Emmett seemed to have military contacts in the Day 1 flashback. The ending has been controversial, as, with another twenty minutes added to a relatively short run-time, the whole movie franchise could have been tied up. Despite this, I am excited for the third part despite rumours John Krasinski will not be heading it!",A Quiet Place Part II

1236,dtdjdcb,missing kid posters??,8,15 July 2021,"At the start of the first movie, ""A Quiet Place"". You can see a bunch of missing people posters, which seems like the invasion was happing slowly. By the posters being there you could tell that the alien was killing person by person then they all just took over. However in the second movie ""A Quite Place 2"" it was showing the invasion how they crash landed on the world and immediately took over the town. Therefore the story's didn't quite add up because why would people put up missing kid posters if they saw the invasion happen and everyone in the town pretty much die. I still loved the movie it just seemed odd.",A Quiet Place Part II

It feels like they had no idea what to have the characters do so they just do random tasks .It doesn't even feel like there is a climax in this movie because it's so underwhelming and ended so fast. They literally have a similar action sequence twice with the same music. As for the monsters ,they literally look like discount demogorgons from stranger things.

1239,marybishop-49382,What an accomplishment with these two films,8,17 July 2021,"I just want to leave a compliment here to John Krasinski. Really really well done both film. Everyone knows how hard it is to deliver a second time and you just did well. It is so good, that I wish it to be series. But don't do it. Keep making these films as long as you feel you have something more to add. I waited sooooo long for the second film, that I was afraid then to watch it. But I was very happy about the result. Suspense and screenwriting skills at the top of the game. It is really simple things like that diving sign the Murphy character learns in the beginning that I knew was gonna come up again. It is small things that show what makes a good writer. Compliment. These are now already two of my all time favorites. <3.",A Quiet Place Part II

Well it's not, because it is a fictional movie xD.The plot is great, straight to the point again and very entertaining, thrilling, full of suspense. I like that it shows how them thriving for survival started, and that it leaves a door to a third part, which I hope there is. Again, no unnecessary sex scenes, this movie proved that those are not needed to make a good film.If you're thinking about watching it, definitely watch part I first and don't listen to the bad reviews.

Which explains why the beginning of the second movie is the way it is.I understand some viewers were expecting more, but if you watch the first movie and then the second within a reasonable timeframe, much of the second movie makes more sense.

Despite being somewhat predictable, I say is a movie worth watching, and one can't say that often about the movies these days sadly, so I guess the bar is pretty low.I was only bothered by a half closed garage door and an unnecessary trip alone from the teen.

I honestly may have missed something but all we saw was an explosion in the sky. Maybe the human crew died and some of these creatures that were being transported like dogs in cages have survived and landed inevitably among people. So obviously we can say anything about their origin which may even not be alien, and none expects them to be organized.

A fun, at times frightening roller coaster ride with a few surprises and an excellent use of sound.I cannot say the same for the sequel. It doesn't offer anything new, and at times, feels like deleted scenes from when they made the original. (Like deleted takes cut into their own film maybe?)It's really a shame, but, it felt rushed, generic, and had way too many moments where characters wandered off alone, putting themselves (and other survivors) in danger for the sake of weak story beats. The phrase, ""Stay right here, I'll be right back."" Rarely ends well in horror movies. Here I think I heard that line at least 4 or 5 times.The sequel weak and lacks the original's strengths in every way.A Quiet Place Part 2 feels more like a money grab and missed opportunity than a full fledged sequel.I'm not sure whose giving it so many glowing reviews, but I miss I would've just rewatched the original and passed on this. :-/Oh well.",A Quiet Place Part II

I would salvage 30 minutes at best.That material could have been incorporated in the first installment, or be used at the beginning of what will now be the third one.I was really looking forward to this and was disappointed. Not a terrible film per se, but as a sequel it seems pretty pointless to me.Not much progression, characters making questionable choices (to say the least), at some level a remake of the first one.The first one was original and fresh, now that we know what to expect I think they should have come up with something better to keep it interesting.",A Quiet Place Part II

it is clearly that the intentions of making the movie was solely to make money.The beginning of the movie was quite entertaining and thrilling, but after that it all collapses. The plot becomes thin and very predictable.The characters were one-dimensional. I did not seriously find anything interesting about them. Such a waste of Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt's talent. Neither did I find the acting done by the children trustworthy.If you don't have anything else to watch for the evening, I guess that A Quiet Place Part II (AQP2) might be an option. Would I recommend it though? No.",A Quiet Place Part II
1259,lelliott7,"Looks good, but the stupidity is overwhelming!",3,14 July 2021,"Ill keep this short.The script for the film and the characters is incredibly stupid.The boy getting his leg destroyed by a bear trap( and screaming uncontrollably), is then miraculously walking around and deciding to go exploring at night, by himself, and leaves his baby brother alone after specifically being told to take care of it. There was no point in him doing this, and then he of course sees a dead body, and jumps off his injuries into some medical equipment making loads of noise. Totally believable. It only gets worse, when we see him losing oxygen extremely quickly....The daughters actions have to be the most idiotic. The fact that shes deaf makes her incredibly vulnerable to making noises. I guess shes a trained ninja with the best sense of touch. They really skip some important details in the movie too. For example, when they are attacked on the docks, she somehow escapes multiple aliens, and hostile humans to find a small boat where she rescues the guy. The highlight of her peak stupidity, has to be near the end of the movie when she uses a hearing aid to stun the nearby monster, uses a small piece of metal to somehow kill it in one blow. Despite being a young girl, and the fact that these aliens are incredibly strong and can take multiple gun shots, yes this girl can use basically a shaft from a mop and kill this thing.Every character has stupid scripts, theres too much to list. Im amazed this movie has the rating it has. I guess its been a long time since people have watched scripts that are worthwhile. Or, maybe everyone has become this stupid haha.",A Quiet Place Part II

pros:
-fast paced sequel that dives into the origin of the apocalypse.characters really started to develop, especially the kids-new characters introduced with lots of enigma and potential to do great things in upcoming sequels(?)
sound design and editing remains great.Cons:
the film lacks the creativity, excitement and most importantly... emotion, that the first movie had. It feels like it's a very long episode out of a television show.-cliché 'filler' movie to potentially extend some of the plot but not actually go anywhere.the movie ends just as the things start to get good. Some say this is a great cliffhanger, or a way to get us to watch the sequels, but this isn't the case I think. The film itself saved the best parts for the final 20 minutes and then it ends.Overall 6/10.

John Krasinski, the screenwriter and director of this film, A Quiet Place Part II, manages one more time to offer emotion, intensity and last but not least, he leaves as a legacy, Lee's imprint on his children, Regan and Marcus, as a promise, that they will do all possible to be like their father. Which they did and did very well.The film A Quiet Place Part II is without a doubt, a step forward, compared to the first film, being pleasantly surprised by the details on the sound, the mix and the transition from Regan's perspective and from outside; the emotion with which each character lived, where, exceptionally, Marcus, which for me, is a fighter by his way of being, by his strength and he tore me with that painful screaming, when .......*no spoiler*____________
Unfortunately, I don't understand the negative reviews, because, no matter how drastic you might be, you just can't say it's a bad movie. It is a film that highlights the feelings of some people in those situations, where, yes, they make mistakes and take bad decisions, and that's because it is natural and human. I can't criticize a movie from this point of view because it doesn't make sense. Philosophically speaking, it is their world, it is their life, it is their decision, where we do not mix the fact that it was written to them and we, those who look at them, we criticize them for the writer's decision. I personally, at that time, throughout it, I live in that film, being with the characters and not with the writer. He is not there and for that, it is totally wrong and unfair to criticize the creation of the film itself, not being appreciated at its true value.""Watch this movie with all your heart, it's well worth it.""

1269,maddenkid07,A sequel that's good,9,2 June 2021,"There isn't many movies that you can say are better or just as good as a quiet place part 2. This movie continues the story of the characters in the original. The downside of sequel horror movies is that the terror of the unknown is gone. However in this movie the terror is there, because you are not fighting with what you don't know, but rather ""sound"", every turn that a someone makes in this film you are wonder which stick snapping will bring the creatures, what step someone makes could be their last. The thing about these movies are that you don't know who will make it out! The movie was written well, and also the Acting was phenomenal. The addition of villain Murphy might have been some of the best casting in a long time. I highly suggest this film!",A Quiet Place Part II
1270,alexey-klimenko,Would be a good movie if not for lazy screenwriting,5,17 July 2021,"I really liked the first movie, even despite some inconsistencies (still do not get how the monsters can't hear characters breathing, walking when they can hear sounds hundreds of feet away).But the sequel is full of idiotic decisions by the main characters. Feels like screenwriter wanted to have some effective scare/action scene and tried to arrange character actions around it without considering logic.Also there is no resolution, the movie feels incomplete and does nothing to leave any satisfaction at the end.Pity, it could have been much more.",A Quiet Place Part II
1271,mariasjo-575-166372,Great movie!!,10,14 September 2021,Great from the beginning to the end. It was exciting all the way through. Great acting. Great story. I will definitely watch it again some day.,A Quiet Place Part II
1272,magginoods,My kinda scary movie,9,19 July 2021,"They could make 4 sequels at this rate and nobody would complain.John Krasinski clearly knows how to use silence, he also knows how to not stuff the movie with the exact same plot that every other monster-horror-flick has. As a result, the characters get to shine without the pace ever suffering. The plot might leaves a lot unexplained, but the execution (particularly the cinematography) is so good that less is just more.Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, and Noah Jupe are all bloody brilliant.",A Quiet Place Part II

1274,rajb1227,"Very good, didn't disappoint",9,29 May 2021,"It's always very hard in this industry to have a sequel be as good or better than the original. I think they did a very good job of trying to overcome that obstacle. Wasn't as good as the original, but they did a tremendous job trying to get there. Definitely awesome, John Krasinski is the man. What an intelligent and funny individual he is, and hes come such a long way since Jim from the office, he's become so much more than Jim. Huge fan of his. Love all of his stuff.",A Quiet Place Part II

1276,dlee098,"A decent movie, but suffers the same problems as the first.",6,30 June 2021,"First, if you haven't watched the first movie, it's basically required to understand what's going on. There are several references that simply won't mean anything without knowing the events of the first.As for the problems, I won't go into details but they are basically the same in round two. Huge plot holes, plot elements that make zero sense when you think about it, characters continually making dumb decisions. It's entertaining enough when watching it but once you put even a little bit of thought into it, it falls apart badly.It's a decent enough watch, but could have been so much better.",A Quiet Place Part II
1277,shawnstone72,Fun film but.......,7,3 September 2021,The film is good for the most part. I'm sure there will be a sequel because the aliens are obviously some kind of soldiers from a superior race. They just run around killing without eating their victims. The issue is the kids. They do the dumbest things. Didn't the parents warn them that other people will be out for themselves and they wouldn't venture out on their own or when given the responsibility of watching the baby to not go looking around in a place your not familiar with. With everything they have seen a dead body makes the boy scream? When the film comes to the end it takes the two kids forever to react and play the high pitched sound that leaves the aliens vulnerable. The ending just makes you yell at the kids.,A Quiet Place Part II
1278,kburbank41,Thought it was great!,10,4 June 2021,"I think it was a fabulously done thriller! It would have been a great thing if Krasinski was in it more, however, the beginning was a good prequel to what happened to start this whole crazy. I really like the ending, because it leaves it open for another sequel.",A Quiet Place Part II
1279,nitsuj-relis,Grows the lore and the characters,8,29 August 2021,"Just to help anyone looking for an opinion, disregard all if the reviews on here saying ""it's the first one again"". The concept is the same. A world in which aliens who hunt based on sound have invaded the world and people must be silent to survive. This movie picks up immediately after the first and continues in the world. The family is doing it's best to survive while also helping other.It's is a worthy sequels that is highly enjoyable. Opinions carry and not everyone enjoys the same stuff, but the fact is that this isn't a rehash of the first movie it's a continuation.... And in my opinion a damn fine one at that.",A Quiet Place Part II

A good introduction, but it got EXTREMELY stupid from there. The characters were dumb, plot was a repeat of the first but worse, and the ending surely left me wanting more due to it happening so abruptly. Don't waste your money on this. Find it on a free website if you really want to watch it.In conclusion: The first part was better, this one was TRASH!",A Quiet Place Part II

And just to address the creatures can't swim thing, if you remember in the 1st one when the mother just had the baby the basement was flooding with about 4feet of water and the creature swam over to the baby's crib and started coming out the water once she picked up the baby . But could have been better and ended just like the 1st movie I would say this has no replay value one and done!",A Quiet Place Part II

I had a lot of critics on part one
But two it's not about critics it's about the cinematography
it's about how you predict what's coming which make the movie so boring
Like the moment the camera where on the girl hair in the train it was clear the a alien would be there
And she try hard to reload the gun which I don't know why it's hard I was sure that the guy will shot him for the back
The moment Emily get out of the hidden place I was clear that the alien will be there but again why why is he waiting for them as the don't listen to any sound
And more over I still don't understand why cilian ask her in the beginning of the movie about the dice signal at a baseball match and really after a couple of years and after all he went through he still remember the sign really.The boat float itself to the island which have people away with two aliens man I am really made
Also in the beginning of the movie.when John was talking to the police man and suddenly an alien appear and destroy a car he didn't even freez for a second to see what's goin on this is inhuman man it's pure act (when u see the alien run)
Still having troubles with the perfect land fields and why no air strike kill the alien or any army with tanks and machine gun taking into account that the girl stab the alien with a bar of metal in his head easy
And why the hell are they walking barefoot why no snicker shoe or running shoe it's quit also

But this movie is stupid really.",A Quiet Place Part II

1298,J309b,Well made but like the first the plot is flawed,2,25 July 2021,"I just cannot understand how this is so highly rated, yes the production quality is high, the cast are good as is the acting, but, a great film no matter who is in it or how they perform, needs a great plot, and this where this franchise totally fails.These creatures are definitely terrifying, savage and robust, but there doesn't seem to be that many of them and they don't seem to hunt in packs as you'd expect if they had managed to wipe out most of humanity.And where are the military? The army, navy and air force? Are we supposed to believe that these creatures wiped it all out? Fighter jets, battle tanks, Apache gunships, battle cruisers, all with fearsome weaponry capable of raining hell on anything that moves, where are they?These creatures respond to sound, so let's say I rock up in a battle tank and sit in the middle of a field, creature comes and I vaporise it instantly, the noise attracts the next creature and that one gets the same good news, the noise again attracts the next and so on.Or you prepare a minefield and lure them in and the same thing will happen.If you're a civilian you all climb let's say, different trees, you all have weapons and/or dynamite. You lure them in with noise and kill them, and the noise of that lures the next one in and so on.If you don't want to make noise then use silenced weapons, but I guess as these creatures destroyed the worlds military these may be hard to come by, and I'm guessing all the billions of military stock pile after the soldiers were all killed were also destroyed by the creatures, right?As if this isn't bad enough, a child managed to find a way to defeat the creatures with a hearing aid, yet the world's science community with superior knowledge and resources at their disposal couldn't find a solution, they must all be dead too then, I suppose?I could go on and on but there are more plot holes than I have time.",A Quiet Place Part II

Not because it is a bad movie full of stupid decisions, but rather because it's the first movie all over again with a character switch.So basically they are using the same success formula the 1st one had to try to make some money by doing it all over again.There is no expansion of the world and everything stays the same while following a stupid family making stupid decisions.",A Quiet Place Part II

The film is so well made, and like the first movie, the sound editing is faultless.The pace of the movie is perfect to build suspense but not too slow that you find is annoying. My only downside is that it wasn't long enough, however I feel this was done intentionally as I can see there being a third instalment.Overall, I'd say this is a great movie and highly recommend it.",A Quiet Place Part II

The events were not exaggerated as it was the case with most of the recent sequels. There was no shortage of excitement and Emily Blunt astonishingly managed to maintain her character whilst developing a sense of responsibility after her husband died in part one. The best part was when Emily left her ring on the headstone of her lost son; symbolizing, in my opinion, that survival needs are far more important than any other sentiments. Can't wait for a third part!",A Quiet Place Part II

1313,tmasterino,A carefully crafted sequel that expands the universe it's predecessor presented us with.,8,29 May 2021,"There is no doubt that ""A Quiet Place Part II"" can go toe-to-toe with it's predecessor. This incredible sequel brings us more action, horror, chaos and drama, introducing new characters, developing more of the characters we know and overall expanding the universe the first film created, all done with subtlety and finess by the masterful John Krasinski.The addition of new characters and new locations provides the drama with more depth. The cast is as flawless as in the last film. Emily Blunt gives one more brilliant performance, being able to portray the most extreme emotions provided by the most extreme situations with realism. Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds do an amazing job portraying the fear and pain their characters endure throughout the film, making the horror seem so much more real. And lastly, Cillian Murphy and Djimon Hounsou provide an extra layer in an already dramatic and emotional story.The horror and suspense are as well thought-out as the first film (if not even better) with insanely creative set pieces and scenarios, filled with tension and fear. The film relies on an incredibly tense atmosphere and well timed, innovative jumpscares that manage to avoid the usual clichés. All this plus the cinematography, sound design and the performances lead to a really, really tense and lasting experience. You will want to experience this in a theater!In conclusion, A Quiet Place Part II is a worthy sequel. It picks up where the last film left us and expands on what it's predecessor built, creating an action-packed, tension-filled, emotional thrill ride you don't want to miss!GO SEE THIS IN A THEATER! YOU WON'T REGRET IT.",A Quiet Place Part II

1321,adamkovac-01625,"Loved the first one, this one's trash",4,8 July 2021,"I really, REALLY loved the novelty of the first movie. The only thing I hated about it was ridiculous decision of having (sic accidental) baby. Universe of Quiet Place seemed to have lots to offer. But the second installment in the series is just a show of ridiculous stupidity and horrible script. Like super horrible script. Barely 5 % of the movie make sense and for most of the time it just creates emotions in you that make you wish main protagonists die. Because if those people survived - there's no way the civilization as we know it would be doomed.I can't help myself but wonder what happened. The first movie beautifully shown ability to communicate without making any noise - as a whole, it was built around sign language, used by people who learned it for many years as they had deaf daughter. And in part 2 their communication is on a level of infantile child that just came out of kindergarten. No thoughts, no meaning, just saying ""it's ok, breathe"" for 80 % of footage.Do I regret watching the movie? No
Would it be in top 30 recommended recent sci-fi movies? No
Actually, I would never recommend watching this movie. There are better scifis, even B class sci-fi such as Skylin3s offer better script that's more believable.I am giving 4 stars simply because of sympathetic actors who played their stupid roles really well. Otherwise - hard pass.",A Quiet Place Part II

1325,loaizamarks,I like Krasinski although this couple films weren't so good,6,26 June 2021,"I really like Krasinski as a director. I really want to see more A Quiet Place movies than I want to see The Conjuring movies. I want him to make more but this saga is not great tho. The noise levels that monsters hear are still very inconsistent.In a world where communication is so important due to the lack of noise and spoken words: WHY WOULD YOU NOT TELL YOUR DUMB KID THAT THE OXYGEN CYLINDER FOR YOUR NEWBORN IS RUNNING OUT?! ISN'T THAT A LITTLE BIT IMPORTANT TO COMMUNICATE?! SHOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT TO YOUR KID SO THAT HE DOESN'T TRY TO WANDER OFF?!That was a really dull plot device. All he had to do was lay down and keep quiet. Why did you make your second kid so stupid, John?Well, first of all, there's strong The Last of Us vibes in how the world looks: the corpses, the aftermath, etc. Expansion.However the crazy boat people had pretty questionable choices that make one wonder how the frick they could survive this long.I like his effort in dealing with the two different stories. It shows capabilty and ambition, which is something you get in sequels: expansion.The fact that the monsters can't swim sort of justifies how people weren't able to see that the monsters don't get close to places (like malls) equipped with instruments that transmit frequencies as low as the girl's hearing device.I like the image of the stupid kid facing the monster with the radio. Sort of tries to make him stand up and grow up.I really like the storytelling and vision Krasinki creates for his movies but his concepts suffer entirely by Krasinski's execution choices.Sure, it was cool to see Emily Blunt's character stand up and kill a monster last time but why nerf her in this sequel?Sure, it is interesting to see the girl try and pull off that by herself. But why make her so clumsy and careless in a world where the script itself wants and implies (since the first movie) that characters have to be smart and careful.Sure, it is cool that a monster raids the island but people know that the monster attacks by hearing. Why isn't anyone just trying to stand still or crouching and keeping it quiet? You would think that people would react as any kid would react in school shooting procedures (popular in the US)Sure, it is cool that Djimon Honsou gets killed so fast but why make him die so silly and clumsy after we see him carefully hiding children and strongly determined to grab a car (that somehow still has gas) to lure the monster. It turns out very silly.I still find it so questionable why Emily and John decided to have a baby in a post apocalyptic world like this. Plot device perhaps. If someone can explain why, please tell me.It bears the same rating for me as the first movie but it's still part of my 2021 list because they are very fun and emotional.",A Quiet Place Part II

Perhaps because this was delayed some people had really high expectations. For me personally those expectations where met.

Picks up literally, exactly where part 1 left off, And from there we continue the journey right up into an excellent, perfectly executed finale that will satisfy even the most rigid and seasoned film critics! ""A Quiet Place 2"" is definitely a new entry into my top 10 horror/thriller sequels of all time, the direction, screenplay, cinematography and script are almost flawless! Not to mention the emotion in this film... it is so genuine you may get lost in a tense moment, and start whispering or holding your breath as to not make a sound! You need to go see this film ASAP...with a group, on a date or even by yourself for some much needed ""You time"" either way, just go see A Quite Place 2"" and enjoy!!!",A Quiet Place Part II
1335,mtveter,A long 85 minutes,2,29 May 2021,After a solid first few minutes it becomes like weird filler where hardly anything happens except set up a third film. The plot holes in this movie also make it a slog. What mechanical items work and don't work after a while make no sense.No spoilers but let's just say this movie liberally borrows things directly from much better movies. It's like they watched Children of Men and at least one Cloverfield and knocked out the script in a weekend.,A Quiet Place Part II

1337,denniskurniagunawan,A sequel that lives up to its predecessor,9,27 May 2021,"A Quiet Place Part II is a stupendous sequel. Krasinski and company masterfully built on the world, story, and themes of the first film, doing right by its characters and their fans. It delivers on suspense and scares with callbacks. Yet it never falls into the footsteps of the first film, happy to tread a new path. Boasting performances that have matured along with its young leads, this fantastic follow-up does so with captivating confidence.I expect more on the background of the monsters, but the movie tread very lightly on this subject. Some questions also still linger regarding basic mechanism of the monsters (What do they eat? Why do they react violently to loud noises? Etc.). Hope these can be answered in the third movie (if there's any).",A Quiet Place Part II

I can't say that I was wrong.The beginning of A Quiet Place II actually surprised me by its quality. It was a very thoughtfully directed, well written, interesting start to this story. But it gets bad...
Suddenly the characters that we knew and remembered for their cleverness, way higher than your randomly dumb horror film main character, become unruly and unaware.Cillian Murphy's character brings nothing but bad dialogs to the thing, with a absolutely unuanced performance.Worst, the original writing from the first film turns into an everlasting formula of-arriving in a new place and finding people, getting attacked by the monsters, running away to do it all over again.Wouldn't recommend it, except for the intro sequence, that has been released for free as a promo material, don't waste your time and money on the rest of it.",A Quiet Place Part II

I see a lot of similarities with her and Millie Bobby Brown via Stranger Things. Perhaps her career may soar as well.Overall, another brilliant movie from Krasinski, intelligent characters, tight script and editing, even though towards the end it relied too much on cross cutting None the less if you enjoyed and entertained by the first chapter, you'll enjoy the second.",A Quiet Place Part II

1346,stevenlauterbach,Solid sequel,7,19 June 2021,Solid movie. Good sequel. I enjoyed it but not as much as the first. Don't quite know what to classify it as. It's not scary enough to be a scary movie. It's not action enough to be an action movie. It's not suspense enough to be a suspense movie. It has a little bit of all 3 things but not enough of any 1 specific thing.,A Quiet Place Part II
1347,acapetrovic-21361,"A great movie, just not a great horror movie",6,30 June 2021,"Let us start with the positives of the movie. The cast did a great job portraying a bunch of hopeless people held together by a positive attitude of Regan. Murphy and Blunt have nothing to prove to the movie world for a while now, and yet again they have captured the essence of their characters, executing them flawlessly. Millicent Simmonds is the breakout star of this movie, and has improved her performance over the first one. The story was sound, but inconsistent (I will get to it later) and has kept my attention throughout. All in all, it is a (somewhat) worthy successor of the first movie.The bad: Bad horror movies rely on 3 key elements.1) Inconsistency in the world building
2) Reliance on the stupidity of their characters to move the plot forward
3) JUMP SCARES!The world of A Quiet Place is pretty straight forward. Do not make a sound or you are dead. This was firmly established in the first movie (apart from the waterfall scene) and fell apart in the second. We have characters openly discussing and whispering out in the world, just 50 meters from the monsters (the train scene), which was a big no-no in the first one. Also, this plot armor device was used during the bear trap scene, where in the previous movie we had a much swifter and wide spread response from the monsters when someone loudly screams.As stated, horror movies rely on at least one of the characters doing something idiotic to push the plot forward, and this movie is no exception. There weren't many scenes like this, most of the movie progressed naturally. But the scene that got me cringing is the one where Marcus leaves the baby alone and goes to the top of the building to.... stare through some binoculars? This scene is so idiotic, that there was no possible positive payoff to be had from it. The scene was only made to create a sub plot where Marcus and the baby are in danger and to create a sense of urgency.A smart and innovative movie as A Quiet Place had no need to resort to cheap scares in order to keep itself terrifying. The silence and the atmospheric unknown of the world around it was enough to keep you at the edge of your seat. The crows, the skeletons, the monsters themselves.... They are not scary. These scenes are only there to catch you off guard, while expecting the brilliance of the first movie.One more thing i need to add. The whole subplot where ""Beyond the sea"" is playing on the radio. Why? Why feel the need to send an encrypted message? Would the monsters figure it out if they have just recorded a voice message stating ""Hey, come join us on the island, there are boats in the pier""? It is a minor thing, but still something that bothered me. It's as if they only wanted to be found by the people intelligent enough to decrypt their message.That would be my take on the movie. I liked it, but it falls short of the original. The introduction of ""Bad Horror takes"" makes me a little afraid to think in which direction is the franchise going.I guess time will tell.",A Quiet Place Part II

I want to see him direct something totally different because i think he has a great eye as a director. It helps to have one of the best actresses on earth as your wife and partner but the vision is all him.

But recently I've been getting pretty bored with the horror movies coming out. It's all so repetitive and I haven't seen anything recent that I've loved. But this? Omg.. I went to see the first movie but didn't have high hopes because the movie was PG-13 so usually not so intense and of course because thrillers just aren't much interesting anymore. I was surprised at how much I loved it though! It was a new concept and it did keep me on the edge of my seat which is hard because of how desensitized I am to horror films. What I loved most about it is that you actually end up really loving the characters themselves and you're invested in seeing their journey. I was so excited when John Announced that there would be a part 2! He did not disappoint! It's even more suspenseful than the first movie and the ending is emotional. Just a masterpiece! John killed it and Emily is so beautiful! The actors are *chefs kiss*. I HIGHLY recommend these movies. You won't regret watching them.

1387,severten,Only for the faint hearted,3,26 May 2021,"It seems this movie went to the lord of the rings school of making things interesting, dragging it out and making it boring. It took so long to do anything that I momentarily stopped paying attention several times.The plot, there was no plot, it seems that they went so far with the ""show don't tell"" thing that you don't know what anyone's doing until they've done it, so there is nothing to look forward to you're just watching people walk around and hide from monsters the entire movie.The only people that will find this movie interesting is those that get scared whenever the traffic lights turn green, because this movie is so predictable with it's moments of tension that if I didn't know it was supposed to be a horror movie I wouldn't have guessed.I spent the whole movie, waiting for a main character to die only to be disappointed when none of them do.Then you have to consider the plot holes; you would think that the radio fellas would play something useful over the radio, rather than the most obscure ""riddle"" for no reason what-so-ever. It reminds me of the ""Airplane!"" gag where they don't turn the runway lights on because ""that's exactly what they'll be expecting us to do."" That's a joke because it's ironic, I don't see how this kind of ironic humour has a place in a dead serious horror movie.If the aliens can't swim then how did they leave the Americas? (unless there were multiple attacks) and if it's only America that's in an apocalypse then why doesn't anyone do something about it.The setting of the movie also doesn't make much sense to me, someone has a slim portable phone with a modern ring tone however everything in the film is from the 90s or earlier making it seem like it should be set in the past but I don't think it is.The characters make stupid decisions and rather than making me get interested it just makes me wish they would die sooner.The movie only has two things going for it, jump scares and tension. I wasn't scared by the jump scares and I didn't care about the characters or see any point in their survival so the tension was wasted and I personally found it non-existent. (Though to be fair that is me).I can understand if you take things way too seriously maybe you'll find this movie interesting but otherwise it's kind of slow and boring.",A Quiet Place Part II

1400,nigeltse,A Suspenseful and Worthy Sequel to the Original,9,31 May 2021,"I had my reservations with Part II because the oroginal Quiet Place had already set the bar high. To my surprise the sequel delivered an equal level of suspenseful scenes to the first. You could argue the plot line ran a bit on the shallow side. But as I specialise in watching 90 minute films I believe the writers packed just the right amount of story in the time frame they had to work with. The film surpassed expectations in creating new and exciting scenes that seemed fresh as the story line started immediately from the end of the prequel. My parents, who are usually picky with movies, even found great enjoyment from the film.",A Quiet Place Part II

I loved the fact that it jumped back to day 1, found that really interesting (without spoiling anything) I had hoped to see more of the flashbacks in this film but it was still fantastic all the same. Slightly shorter than I hoped it would be but only because I was enjoying it so much! Definitely worth the wait!!",A Quiet Place Part II
1403,emmatello,Incredible Throughout,10,2 June 2021,Never have I given a film 10/10 but I can't even pinpoint one negative about this film. If you loved the first film you are in for an absolute treat with the second. The story line and acting were sublime and I can honestly say I would happily watch this film over and over again as every moment kept me on the edge of my seat wanting more. There are jump scares throughout but again these were pin pointed perfectly to not be too much. They connect and carry the film on perfectly from the first film. The story line unlike many horrors was not predictable all the way through - another reason to love it. I urge any horror fan to see this film!,A Quiet Place Part II
1404,olliemtrujillo,Really good sequel.,10,23 June 2021,"The opening sequence of this movie is honestly one of the best I've ever seen. The Suspense and adrenaline that certain scenes provide keep you at the edge of your seat. The Jump-scares are very well executed, they don't feel cheap at all. The family theme is still there, the cinematography is really fitting, the score is very original, and the performances are TOP-NOTCH.This is exactly what I wanted out of a horror-movie sequel.",A Quiet Place Part II

The cinematography is quite solid, it's not amazing but it's done professionally. The ending is a bit open ended but it's pretty interesting and the monsters interact with the world and characters in interesting ways. SPOILERS FROM HERE ON: The way the father and his daughter get to the sanctuary is a bit of a stretch with them hearing over the sea on the radio and the girl somehow guessed they need to get to the radio station and find it on an island because the monsters can't swim. SPOILERS END HERE: overall the movie obviously had effort put into it and was made by people who cared, the acting, cinematography, etc is all competent.",A Quiet Place Part II

I found myself thinking through out the whole movie, use it, use it, use the secret weapon. The story is all wrong, they could have gone a different path liberating from town to town and explored the looters and evil survivors angle further. This could have been a great time to bring back the father too, to lead them. Also The hidden message in the radio transmission why hidden? So the aliens don't know what it is? Why don't just broadcast words? We weren't told the aliens understood the language, they seem very primitive and very basic and savage.",A Quiet Place Part II

Probably the first time in my life when I allowed myself to start scrolling facebook while in cinema. Wasted money on a ticket.",A Quiet Place Part II
1412,e-20395,Survivors...,10,13 June 2021,"The film takes place as a continuation of the events described in the first part. Evelyn, Regan, and Marcus explore an abandoned city and meet Emmett (Cillian Murphy), who defends them from an attacking monster. The four then go to the shelter to help the other survivors. They soon learn that there are other creatures besides the monsters...The sequel, if anything, does not make sense to watch without the first film. But whatever happens in the final with the heroes, in 'A Quiet place 2' they appear again in the original composition. Surprisingly, it turned out to be quite a strong sequel. The dynamic of action and narrative is created through parallel editing. In the beginning-between the present and the past, then-by dividing the characters into two pairs: mother and son, daughter and suddenly appeared neighbor.Krasinski repeats the maneuvering that he miraculously managed in the original - a decent screamer here, a screamer there, the unnerving chirping of the eared monsters-which were given a little more attention here and this is only a plus, the director's favorite parallel editing and ringing silence, once Regan gets a hearing aid... and we all stare at the big screen with bated breath. Believe me, the general turmoil and rhythm do not spoil the picture at all, then the main trouble of this continuation lies in intimate conversations. The only thing missing is a proudly fluttering whole American flag, honestly. There are minor technical blunders, without them apparently nowhere.The finale of the second part of ""A Quiet Place"", as well as the first original film, is open. So, the third part is just around the corner, it all depends on the fees of the sequel. I've heard that Krasinski has a lot of ideas for a direct sequel, as long as everything turns out interesting and logical. Fingers crossed!",A Quiet Place Part II
1413,x-02686,Don't make any noise! Monsters are different...,10,13 June 2021,"Becoming one of the most sought-after Hollywood directors of our time, Michael Bay decided to organize his own production company Platinum dunes, which since its inception has been releasing reinterpretations of classic horror films like ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""on the big screens. Having accumulated enough influence and experience in a given field, Bay decided that it was time to invest in original projects that could present the audience with something new, unpredictable and extremely intense. And one of the most promising and promising films of the company, following the farewell to the abundance of remakes, was ""A Quiet Place"" from John Krasinki, a popular American actor of TV series, who felt that it was time to diversify his work and give the audience something fresh and really extraordinary. Having come up with a couple of co-authors with the concept of a laconic horror with an ever-increasing level of suspense, Krasinski made it clear to the producers, led by Michael Bay, that he needed absolutely ridiculous money to implement his plans by modern standards. And since the script was really intriguing, and Emily Blunt agreed to play one of the leading roles, the Platinum dunes executives had little doubt that this idea would be a winning one, and in the end, the film, which cost investors only $ 17 million, collected more than 300 at the box office. It is quite natural that such a great success could not go unnoticed, ""A Quiet Place"" was loved not only by the audience, but also by critics, who nominated the film for a number of prestigious awards. And since the story told by Krasinki actually ended in half a word, its sequel was inevitable and finally appeared at the box office three years after the release of the original. I have been interested in sharks since I was a child, and as I grew up, my interest in marine wildlife was not lost, and I watched quite a few documentaries. And shark movies have always attracted me. For me personally, one of my favorite shark movies is ""The Deep Blue Sea"" directed by Renie Harling, in this film the plot was connected with experimental sharks, which puts it a little in a separate row compared to other shark films, but that's why the film was even more interesting.Unfortunately, there are not many good shark movies coming out at the moment, and for the most part, all of these movies are a poor imitation of shark movies, but you can still watch these films in order to give your assessment and compare them with other films.This movie 'Great White' or 'The Mouth of the Ocean' was shot together with an Australian film studio, so, on the one hand, it gave the film a positive assessment, because, firstly, this is Australia, which is known for its beautiful landscapes and wildlife, and in Australia they know how to make films about wild animals and about predator attacks, so for this already the film can be given a positive assessment, but, alas, this is not enough.The plot of the film is quite simple and banal (I do not argue that now it is not easy to come up with something new and interesting, so you have to go already on the cliche), a group of tourists goes to a coral island, which is completely deserted, for new and vivid impressions, but their plane crashes right in the middle of the ocean, and they have to survive on a lifeboat. Everything is very banal and simple (once again), I will even say that I have already seen all this, especially in those documentaries that were presented as feature films, in which people also had to survive in the middle of the ocean and find ways to survive against sharks. But I will still say that in films of this genre, the first priority is the behavior of people and what people are capable of at the moment of danger, their strengths and negative sides always manifest themselves (especially negative character traits). Also, a small plus can be attributed to the good acting of some actors, as well as 'In the Mouth of the Ocean' - a secondary banal thriller about shark attacks and about survival in conditions of absolute danger and hopelessness.",A Quiet Place Part II
1414,p-16412,Features of silence,10,13 June 2021,"The Abbott family continues to fight for life in complete silence. Following the deadly threat they face in their own home, they will experience the horrors of the outside world. They are forced to venture into the unknown, where they quickly discover that the creatures that hunt the sound are not the only enemies outside the safe sandy path.The film takes place as a continuation of the events described in the first part. At the beginning of the film, the background story of the beginning of the attack on people by unknown monsters is told.More than 400 days have passed since the beginning of the attack of unknown blind and especially hearing aliens-the survivors are getting used to living under the new rules 'in a world without sounds'. Evelyn, her infant child, Regan, and Marcus explore an abandoned city. Meeting with a lone survivor Emmett who lives in an abandoned factory building in a factory furnace - a new 'round' 'walking in torment' in this strange and terrifying post-apocalyptic world. An idyllic song from the only working radio station forces them to go on a journey where, in addition to the' understandable ' monsters, 'other people'survive with your own intentions. And the' idyllic paradise of safety ' here can also be destroyed.A Quiet Place 2 (Part II) is an American science fiction horror film directed by John Krasinski. Starring: Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, Noah Jupe and Cillian Murphy, who has a great and strong work here. Polly Morgan's cinematography is the best thing about this film, along with her acting work. The first film-exceeded all imaginable and unthinkable expectations, and turned out to be an impressive and unforgettable spectacle. The second film further enhances the impression of the entire series and gives the most real and necessary drive, adrenaline and suspense. And the finale of the film, clearly says that before us opens the continuation of this exciting thriller. Directed and scripted by John Krasinski-presents us with a big and strong director, who gets along- 'a beautiful symbiosis of Spielberg and Bay'. Despite the closeness and asceticism of the story, this is a large-scale canvas that raises large and complex themes of family and loyalty.",A Quiet Place Part II
1415,f-65788,Apocalypse. But not yet John the Theologian,10,13 June 2021,"Scenario The action of the second part takes place immediately after the events of the first film. After Evelyn manages to shoot the monster, she and her children leave the farm and come to an abandoned factory, where they immediately fall into the trap of their friend from Emmet's past. And although they manage to get rid of another monster, Evelyn's son Marcus accidentally steps on a trap, which introduces new problems, because they need medicine to treat the wound. The situation is complicated by the fact that Regan calculates the location of the radio station, where the recording of the song comes from, which the heroes regard as a sign from the survivors. The girl, despite her mother's insistence, decides to move alone in search of other survivors, and Evelyn persuades Emmett to go after her. Thus, the family is divided, but Evelyn, who remained at the factory with Marcus and the baby, and Regan and Emmett are forced to face a deadly danger in the face of not only monsters, but also other people who are ready to go to any inhumane act for the sake of survival.The result of ""A Quiet Place 2"" fully met expectations and, most importantly, did not change the canons laid down in the first film. In fact, both the first and second parts are perceived as a single film, simply divided into two parts. More fully, it is possible that the audience is waiting for the third part, and therefore, it can be quite a worthy franchise, which will become a future classic on a par with"" Alien ""or""Predator"". Therefore, for those who have not seen it yet, I recommend viewing it.",A Quiet Place Part II
1416,krymnf,It's the same movie as part I,4,16 June 2021,"Hardly anything new happens.No character development, no plot development, the movie ends in exactly the same way as the first one. Lots of plot holes, the deaf girl goes on a solo mission to save the world and the mum would rather stay in a tank with the new born and send the man that can't speak sign language to risk his life to fetch her daughter, why did the boy go wandering around alone after everybody had left him (only to discover a dead body that literally leads to a dead-end unexplained story line), a group of vigilantes live on a boat and use a little girl to capture other survivors (also an unexplained story line that ends immediately after it began), why did the two men on the island take the deaf girl on the suicide mission. I only gave it 4 stars because the tense parts were interesting, but I didn't care for the characters, the story line was slow and boring. Can't believe the other scores here and that there is a part III in the works? Let me guess, part III will end using the hearing aid and an amplifaction device.",A Quiet Place Part II

Typically movies like these get drawn out into sequels with like a ""uprising/rebellion"" since the first movie had already established their weakness to sound. We didn't need a whole sequel to tell us the same thing we already know. Now when John does make this ""rebellion/save the earth movie"" you can just skip the second part because it doesn't establish anything new. It took 3 years to make a sequel that ends up being a complete cash grab with zero substance. They don't establish a reason why the aliens came, no variants of these aliens, no higher life firm that controls them. Absolutely nothing.

Replace all the alien creatures with dinosaurs and you've got yourself Jurassic Park.At least they give an explanation in Jurassic Park, with Quiet Place 2 you see some meteor and than within 5 minutes of them seeing this meteor still in the sky they're getting attacked by the dinosaurs, I'm sorry aliens.Apparently they can't swim and are rendered useless by hearing aids. Somehow the military is nowhere to be found.Seriously they can't swim? You know how many Navy ships would just be off the coast sending in helicopters or planes?

Part 2 show another weakness which I won't reveal now. It is still tense and I didn't feel bored at all. I wouldn't say much better than the first one, probably the same rating 8/10. You don't really need to know how they ended up on earth. May be that is the third part to reveal. Emily is cool and this version VS the version from Tom Cruise movie.

If the rest of the movie was a prequel that followed the Abbots on their way through the world that was now deemed on lack of noise, I would have been way more intrigued.Of course, there were good things about the movie, all be it bad decisions that are in every horror/thriller to drive the plot. The jump scares were pretty good, even if they were a bit predictable, and while some of the plot wasn't perfect it was understandable.It would've been more interesting as a prequel, however, and the opening sequence was my favorite part. The sudden change in tone, the way everyone was reacting and the monsters in the background as Lee and Regan ran was very enjoyable to watch.",A Quiet Place Part II

1452,broedymacri,Honest Review: A Severely Overrated Title,3,27 July 2021,"I didn't like the first, I found it gimmicky, predictable, uninspiring and boring. The cinematic/technical aspects and the acting were great, I am talking about the plot and characterisation. The whole 'stay quiet or the antagonist will kill you' is an overused trope, and combining that with a post apocalyptic monster setting is just bleh.This sequel was worse in my opinion. The monsters looked like boring versions of demigorgons (from stranger things) and were everywhere in this film. I get that it's cool to show the monster now and then, but it was just too much CGI.The characters were dumb and their motives/decisions were nonsensical. Some aspects of the film were just incredibly unrealistic as well, similar to the first film. I get that it's unrealistic anyway, as theres monsters coming from a spaceship in the sky, but just because the genre is science fiction doesn't mean logic should be disbanded (take a look at Alien). This isn't INCREDIBLY important, but it is frustrating to the viewer and detracts from the tension which this film needed to focus on. The environment and it's characters need to be believable in order to draw the viewer in and create that tension.Overall, my main issue is that the film didn't bring anything new and served as a typical mass-appealing monster flick. The fact that it was so similar to the first, especially in its ending, supports this. Nothing against people who enjoy that kind of film, but if you're expecting something else you will be disappointed. I didn't have high expectations but I still found myself incredibly bored throughout it.Reference to some horror films I've enjoyed: 10 Cloverfield Lane, The VVitch, Alien, Cujo, Hereditary, Babadook, and many more.",A Quiet Place Part II
1453,robtulba,An Illogical and Absurd Recapitulation,2,27 July 2021,"There was virtually nothing novel or worthwhile in this film. We all know the basics. The creatures are out and about, the people try to be as quiet as possible, but inevitably fail. Then they must attempt to dodge or kill the creatures when they come. Nothing about this dynamic changes whatsoever in the second installment of the film. The film suffers from two cardinal flaws: it's absurd and it gives no backstory.There is absolutely no logic or common sense whatsoever in the plot of these films. Why don't drones or aircraft equipped with enormously more destructive firepower than that of a shotgun (which is sufficient to kill them) target these creatures? They don't appear to be equipped with wings. They also, thankfully, won't see them coming. Why don't nuclear submarines or battleships target them from the sea? They can't swim. Why not blast loud music and lure them all to a foundry? Why not use noise-making toys or fireworks to evade them? Throw toy or firework that way, and escape this way. Also, how do these creatures hear the most miniscule sound from long distances away but can't hear their victim breathing a few feet away in the same room? A moment's thought makes the entire plot and premise of these films utterly absurd. But, let's move on to the next flaw.It also fails to give everybody what they want to know: Where do these creatures come from? What do they want? They kill all of the humans and then what? And does earth successfully get rid of them?All of these nagging questions go unanswered. Thus, this film is sadly a complete and utter waste of time. You just get more people dodging the creatures. You can safely watch the first film and get everything you get in the second film with the exception of the addition of a few extra characters and one new location. The lack of backstory on the creatures and the insane lack of logic or common sense in the plot makes this a waste of time. Pure and simple.",A Quiet Place Part II

1455,matthewpiggott-03213,"I'll say this was pretty good, but not too loudly.",7,1 August 2021,"Was very excited to see this film after the triumph that was the first 'A Quiet Place' and in many respects this movie did not disappoint. The blind creatures are still terrifying and thoroughly entertaining as they were in the first movie and I find John krasinski to be a director with a lot of potential.The cinematography is at times breathtaking in this movie, some oil the shots are so memorable and really capture the beauty of what a post apocalyptic landscape could look like. I also think the movie does well to build tension and create a sense of urgency that at times can have you beyond the edge of your seat. In saying that I think some of the character growth could have been handled better, especially Emily Blunts character Evelyn, whose character was never really given the chance to develop in the absence of her now deceased husband. Some of the writing was a little off and as you get closer to the end it can feel like some aspects were forced but you are probably better suited suspending some belief for a movie like this.Cillian Murphy and Millicent Simmonds really stand out as actors which is no surprise as they are the characters whose character arcs are properly tended to. Two very believable performances and not surprisingly great chemistry.The soundtrack is great and really adds to the tension building perfectly. Handled by Marco Beltrami so its little wonder. The special effects are also good, nothing jarring or too unbelievable.All in all it was a very fun movie and I do recommend. Thrilling sci fi's that capture the imagination are few and far between at the moment and it was a joy to go through the rollercoaster.67/100.",A Quiet Place Part II

Not only are they idiots but they are also weak and poorly evolved.Normally an animal that lacks one sense is highly developped in other senses. These monsters are blind and they almost cannot smell (they cannot even locate someone who is full of hormones, sweating, bleeding and released internal fluids while giving birth).

1475,bvost,Do NOT read this before seeing the film,6,30 May 2021,"I have a couple of problems with A Quiet Place 2 (AQP2) but the start is not one of them. It introduces you nicely to Lee's brother Emmett (Cillian Murphy) and his family. We don't get introduced to his family so there's no reaction when we next meet a beardy Emmett because his family are all dead, it's just ""Yeah? Oh well, lots of people died"". Emmett seems to be an artist because his hideout is covered with drawings of his kids but that artistic bent doesn't get used at all in service of the story. We know that Evelyn (Emily Blunt) and the kids have gone to where Emmett's hiding because of his beacon but it's not clear if they know it's Emmett or someone else. Emmett also seems intent on taking out his sister-in-law and the family with his sniper rifle when first we see him again but doesn't question how they manage to defeat an alien...Anyway, then the story moves on and they all end up splitting up - Emmett and Regan (Millicent Simmonds) go off to find a radio station that plays Bobby Darin on repeat (one wonders why it isn't a simple repeating message giving the aliens' weakness but no, it has to be a 'clue'), Evelyn needs to go get medical supplies for her baby and son, who are left in Emmett's hiding place. This is fine but it feels like it's there to triple down on the danger more than as an agreed-upon course of action. Oh yeah, and since Emmett met up with Evelyn and family again, he's been warning them that a) the other survivors are all horrible and b) that they could only stay the night and would have to go the next day (see a). Obviously, this means that said almost feral survivors have to show up and they do so in a trap manoeuvre that even a six-year-old could see coming. Anyway... Regan and Emmett escape and make their way to the radio station but, of course, manage to bring one of the aliens with them - that has stayed quiet and hidden in order to fool the puny humans and only emerge at 'plot marks the spot' in comparison with every other alien in the franchise so far! This was probably my biggest issue with the film but then the actual climax is pretty stretched out too. You know how irritating it is in quiz shows like The Great British Bake Off when they say ""The person going home is..."" and then wait interminably? Well, the end of AQP2 is worse. I just wanted to shout ""Come on, hurry up!"" at the screen...It's still mostly tense fun and the creature design is amazing but I'd have to only give it 3/5.",A Quiet Place Part II

Cast is, once again, amazing. Emily Blunt is just superb. Millicent Simmonds (Regan) is mesmerising...stunning performance. Noah Jupe (Marcus) just grows into this role & is superb at portraying his fears. Add in an incredibly intense Cillian Murphy & the recipe is complete. Krasinski's direction is brilliant too. He's gonna be a star behind the camera as well as in front.I took an eternity to watch the first one. Had zero interest. After eventually being coerced into watching it I sat there, open mouther for 90 mins. Instantly became one of my favourite movies. As with all sequels, this one suffers from the ""lack of originality"", only in such that you know what the enemy can do & their vulnerabilities. However, Krasinski cleverly uses flashbacks to fill the back story & still manages to create that intensity & drama from the first one.If you enjoyed the first one, this is a must watch.

When the words Day 1 appear on the screen, I knew we were in for a treat and John Krasinski did not disappoint.One of the best opening chapters to a movie I've seen and it set the movie up beautifully.With the big question from the first movie answered, the next question is where does the story go from here? To answer that without giving away anything, understand that this is not a sequel closing the story but an addition to what will surely be a franchise, almost like a movie length tv show if you will.The kids in this movie nail their performance as they did in the first and Cillian Murphy is added to the cast and teams up nicely with Millicent Simmonds giving their time on screen together a real The Last Of Us vibe.To get the most out of this movie, watch the first one again.

The main characters - the family walk barefoot to keep quiet but Emmett (Cillian Murphy) is totally ok walking in steel toe work boots. They walk barefoot to keep quiet watching for leaves and twigs but miss the wire or bear trap laying quite in the open. Emmett and Regan risk everything to get to the island and save the humanity. But once they get there they take a comfortable rest for a day even though Evelyn with son and the baby is left behind. Even in the last scene when Regan is in the studio room already while Emmet being attacked she just stays there and watches it for a while before actually doing the deed. And that's not even mentioning Emmet's struggle to communicate with Regan when they sit next to a desk with pens and paper (he's illiterate and he cannot write?) or he is making a special effort to enunciate for her to see him talking to her turning sideways few scenes later and her apparently getting it quite ok.I guess John Krasinski should better stick to acting rather than directing.

If these aliens came from another part of outer space, don't you think they would find a better way to annihilate the human race, maybe with a deadly pandemic? Why are the aliens spending so much time and effort in killing humans that make noise? If they cannot stand noise, are they also killing off noisy chirping birds, croaking bullfrogs, barking dogs, cats that are screaming during mating season, crickets and what not? This movie doesn't make a whole lot of sense. If John Krasinski sacrificed his life for his family, how come I don't see him being killed, I saw the cop shooting the creature, but I did not see what happened to John Krasinski. Also, how come the guy that was with the bare foot family have boots on? If he had boots on, why couldn't the family have shoes on, instead of having dirty tip toeing feet?

Very disappointed.,4,24 July 2021,"I most definitely will not be watching A Quiet Place 2 for a second time, even though I blew $20 to buy it as soon as it was released for streaming. There were times at about 2/3 of the way through the movie that I thought about turning it off. I love Emily Blunt. My disappointment has nothing to do with her performance. And Cillian Murphy's performance was outstanding, especially when you watch him as Mr. Mellowman in ""Sunshine."" Anyway, one of the big sticking points for me was this: the ending of the first movie was all about the Family figuring out how to kill the aliens, and that John K's death was not in vain. Lo and behold, it just ain't so in the sequel. The Family needs the Alien-Ear-Killer Noise AND a shotgun blast. I'm totally bummed. RT, Stratham, NH.",A Quiet Place Part II

It was an extension of the first one. I also see people saying that the first one was bad and that this one is even worse. Why did you want to see this one if you didn't even like the first one? Than you probably didn't even give it a chance. I thought the movie was very thrilling. The first movie was different, this one had far more action in it. But I liked both of them equally. I saw it in theaters and was on the edge of my seat the whole movie. The acting was good, there were some nice details and it was very exciting. And yes, some characters did some stupid things, but those were things that fit the characters. If you have any empathy, you can imagine how the characters would feel and why they acted the way they did. I also really liked it that they gave an insight on how it had all begun.",A Quiet Place Part II

1503,lbirds-794-594487,Really nothing new added to the 1st episode,4,12 October 2021,"The only new element in this movie is the short flashback at the very beginning: this is just a quick opportunity to show the viewer the family and who will be the main character of this episode, acted by Cillian Murphy.This flashback ain't helpful at all, because here the viewer does not come to known nothing newer than the previous episode, only one star ship tearing the sky (maybe from outer space) and landing really far from the town, where the flashback takes place. In just seconds the first alien shows itself up! I agree, these monsters have quite long paws, but from the star ship crash site it takes only a bunch of seconds to burst in the town.Besides this, the plot is linear and straightforward, just like the previous movie, and it adds nothing new. The screenplay describes the current events of the family, adding a new main character.Every now and then the viewer attends the never-ending spree of the aliens to slash and kill people, when they make noise and are detected: there is no necessity of food or conquering purposes by the alien. Just non-sense killing, in addition without blood.One more element in this movie are the endless inconsistencies of the plot. People acting/reacting who-knows-why, such as the mute/deaf girl whispering comprehensible words to his brother (wasn't she mute, then?!), and much, much more like this.I do really not suggest this film to anybody.",A Quiet Place Part II

1512,erikmolnar-1,I saw this movie already the first time,5,7 June 2021,"Rather than grow the story, they just went in a straight line and rehashed the same story on a slightly bigger scale. The film makers ignore the fact that the aliens are intelligent and organized enough for interstellar travel, but appear to have no organization, no agenda, and very little intelligence now that they have reached earth. They just seem to be wandering killing machines. I'm not even sure if they feed on people. I didn't see that in this film and I can't remember if they did in the first. So do they just walk around and listen for things to kill? What are they going to do once everyone is dead? Also, they can't swim, but chose to land on a planet that is 75% water? Maybe they should have prepared better.Makes me think they are soldiers for a superior race of beings that we have not seen yet. Maybe in the next film.

A bunch of people who can't be quiet doing stupid things. There is no story. The acting is ok. Most of the sign language isn't subtitled. There's no reason behind what they're doing and basically this movie is overtime for a basketball game that was the first one. Just 5 extra minutes of the same old stuff. It's clearly a money grab. The ending seems like they ran out of money. This movie was horrible. I found myself hating the son. He did everything possible to try and get his family killed. Screaming and losing his mind like a 6 month old. I feel like the director was trying to make people mad. This movie deserves 0 stars. Waste of time and money.,A Quiet Place Part II

1516,iamhomercles,Great cinema experience but paper thin plot,4,7 June 2021,"First the positives this is a great film to watch at the cinema on a massive screen with atmospheric sound but that is about it. It suffers from the classic creature feature problem that once you have seen the monsters it simply isn't enough to keep showing them doing the same stuff over and over for 90minutes, especially when the people continue to make the same dumb mistakes. It also seemed that it was much less of a quiet place than in the first film, everyone is talking and generally making way more noise throughout. They were also behaving inconsistently especially the boy, why did he go sneaking around on a busted foot leaving the baby all alone for no reason? The radio station just looping a cryptic song to bring more survivors to the island made no sense, and the people there were living totally care free just a short distance off shore. Nobody looking out for random boats etc? The savages in the docks also made no sense. They were so close to the island to see and hear the activity, and had plenty of means to travel there but had not?

John Krasinski is completely awesome as a director and has a very bright future in Hollywood. Emily is not as critical this time around but still gives a fantastic performance.The real highlight of the movie is seeing Millicent Simmonds completely carry this movie. What a joy to watch and a future this young actress has. Hollywood needs to build franchise after franchise with her as a main character.

Unfortunately that's only 10 minutes of the movie. Hopefully John does not go the way of M Knight. But a quiet Place two is akin to M knight's The Happening or The Village.

1537,redtavi,Got the suspense right. Could have been longer.,9,12 June 2021,Usually you know the hero will win and the movie will end good and that's spoils some tense moments in American movies. THAT'S NOT THE CASE HERE. You feel like a genuine fear for every character.I simply can't remember when i was this invested in a story. In this movie you have the same feeling as watching the second or third season of Game of Thrones. Coming back from the first movie you know the screenwriter has the balls to kill anyone anytime he wants. Especially near the end there were some scenes when i actually prayed for the movie to not end on a cliffhanger/bad scenario. It did not disappoint. My only bad thing to say about this movie is that even if overall the pacing is amazing it has some scenes that feel a bit rushed compared to the overall tension. (I'm specially talking about the scene in the port which felt like a blockbuster Jason Statham movie rather than the slow masterpiece it is for the rest of the movie.,A Quiet Place Part II

He literally repeated the same ""fear"" face over and over again for reason and with no reason. I assume he practiced it for the movie and decided to use it as much as possible.The plot, the dialogs are incredibly disconnected and not leading to anything.The CGI is good and the aliens look real.If you are patient enough and will sit till the end of the movie...nothing will happen.

I don't know how any of them have survived this long, the adults don't seem competent enough to keep themselves alive, let alone keeping the kids alive. And we're supposed to accept that the son character is totally fine after having his leg caught in a bear trap. I don't think they even gave him any medical care, and frankly I'm disappointed he didn't lose at least his foot. I guess we're supposed to just ignore that infection is a thing.

Because big bad monsters come if you make a sound. For the viewer there is nothing interesting about these monsters though they are just grey men with elongated limbs and a monster head. They are not creepy, there is no mystery around their origin that you would care about, they are just a gimmick to add suspense.The first movie was slightly better as the main focus was on the characters and their relationships. Also you saw less of the monsters so your mind could add some ideas around these things, which worked a lot better.This movie now shoves the monsters in your face every 2 minuets, replays the same character relationships but less compelling and this time there isn't even a real story.

1561,vuksastef,"From 60 to 0 in 2 minutes, massive letdown",1,19 June 2021,"I am really tired of movies where the whole plot revolves around characters reacting to stupid things done by children. This movie is full of other tropes aswell.It begins very well setting up the environment, but when it fast-forwards to the end of movie 1 it just becomes a basic teen horror with no depth, the rest of the movie just doesn't know what to do (they were better off just staying at the same farm, but ok, movie reasons)Movie has the exact same ending as the first one and is a shameless setup for a sequel. We don't learn anything other than that the aliens can't swim (which is already kinda obvious from their weird body). The ending is at least unpredictable, but stupidly unpredictableHumans show 0 cooperation, rather broadcasting a song on the radio than advice/news, possibly the least believable end of humanity kind of narrative aroundThe island people AND the dock people are just blatantly stupid, island people seem like a brainwashed cult and have 0 defense and the dock villains were stupid enough to not try going for the nearby islands, it just felt wrong when they landed on the island after the docksThe mom is completely wasted in the movie, just cries all the time while her kids get into trouble, mom and baby are just there to guilt trip the male lead to go after the deaf girl (last of us vibes attempted but failed)Most of the plot revolves around the deaf girl as she has, ironically, the most dialogue in the movie; her little mission just brings many more deaths, as soon as I saw it was going to be one of those kid-makes-up-dumb-plan-goes-missing, I gave up on it and honestly it is a massive letdown.In conclusion, the movie has no plot or believable characters, the children run around doing stuff no apocalypse survivor would ever do, the ending is just horrible and while it seems to want a sequel, it did not develop the universe at all! After the first 10 minutes I was just looking at my phone eating nachos.For actually good movies of this type look at 10 Cloverfield lane and Bird box...",A Quiet Place Part II
1562,jtschepella,Why would you use music?,7,28 July 2021,"The movie had a really strong start which actually spooked me at moments, which the first one failed to do. But then the last scene from the first movie where you can see all the creatures coming is completely ignored. But the part that really made no sense is how the people on the island use a song as a clue to show people where they are. This makes no sense. They could just tell people where they are, or if they don't want to do that, at least tell people that the creatures can't swim. Overall, not bad.",A Quiet Place Part II
