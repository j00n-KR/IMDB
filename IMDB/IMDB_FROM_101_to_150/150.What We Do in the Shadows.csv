0,MartinHafer,"Weird, wacky and fun!",9,31 December 2015,"A few months ago, thanks in part to a Kickstarter campaign, What We Do in the Shadows arrived in film festivals all over the world...and audiences were stunned! Why? Because it's one weird, very weird movie! The film is a marvelous mockumentary that makes fun of the current reality television fad. In many ways, it's like an MTV series like ""The Real World"" or ""Jersey Shore""....meets ""Twilight""!! Somehow, a film crew gained access to a strange home where four vampires lived. And, it's in tiny Wellington, New Zealand of all places! According to the film, this unlikely place is actually a hotbed of vampires, werewolves, zombies and more...and these four undead guys are allowing some humans to come into their previously hidden lives. The residents of this home are a motley and mostly lovable group of loser vampires ranging from the rather likable Viago to the incredibly scary and Nosferatu-like Petyr and you follow them through the course of their evenings over a period of many months.While this idea is crazy and a bit silly, the joke could have worn thin very quickly--and it probably would have with lesser filmmakers and actors. Instead, the film maintains a wonderful tongue-in-cheek mood throughout and constantly delivers laughs...and, oddly, a lot of charm (well, that is when the guys aren't feeding off Wellingtonians). It also really helps that you like these folks! The bottom line is that this film is completely unique and fun...and if you see it with your friends, they won't believe what they're watching! And, they'll thank you for suggesting it.By the way, I happened to have actually been in Wellington last September and I don't recall having seen any zombies, witches, werewolves or vampires. Of course, I didn't happen to be there at night....",What We Do in the Shadows
1,Leofwine_draca,Not really that funny,4,12 November 2017,"Your enjoyment of WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS, a Kiwi vampire comedy, really depends on how funny you find the characters. Me, I didn't laugh once, and found the funniest this got was the odd sense of mild amusement at best. Essentially this mockumentary takes the successful format of THE OFFICE - a constant yet unseen cameraman shooting a documentary, with awkward asides and glances at the lens - and mixes it with a vampire spoof in which centuries-old vampires strive to cope with the issues of everyday life. Horror fans will be delighted to see that the main vampires are all based on cinematic legend - Bela Lugosi and Gary Oldman's Draculas are here, and the best of the bunch is a version of Nosferatu - but the actors give performances which feel forced, and I found the whole thing more than a little cumbersome.",What We Do in the Shadows
2,SnoopyStyle,fun unusual mockumentary,8,25 December 2015,"Every few years in New Zealand, a secret society holds The Unholy Masquerade. A film crew is allowed into the lives of some vampires who are part of the secret society of supernatural beings such as witches, zombies and werewolves. Viago (Taika Waititi), Nazi vampire Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), Vladislav (Jemaine Clement) and ancient Petyr live together in a house in Wellington struggling with everyday vampire drama. Jackie is Deacon's human familiar who is frustrated with the lack of upward mobility.This is a great concept, a funny group and terrific deadpan humor. It's a brilliant entry into the mockumentary genre. It's too warped of an idea for Christopher Guest to come up with. This comic group isn't always the funniest for me but this movie hits all the vampire tropes on the head. It also works as a horror spoof. It's loads of fun.",What We Do in the Shadows
3,Horst_In_Translation,A somewhat different vampire movie,6,27 November 2014,"And actually a funny one. I have not seen ""Vampires Suck"", but judging from the reviews it must have been pretty underwhelming. This one certainly is not. It was written and directed by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi. Both play main characters as well. Clement scored 7 Emmy nominations for ""Flight of the Conchords"", while Waititi is an Academy Award nominee from the short film categories. So, even if I was not familiar with either (maybe just me as the theater was packed), both of them have already a respectable body of work and are probably sort of famous in their home New Zealand. This is also where the movie takes place by the way.While I liked Petyr and his traditional Nosferatu looks, my favorite character here is Vladislav (played by Clement, who looks a bit like Rory Cochrane from ""CSI: Miami""), but actually everybody had their moments. The first half of the movie ( i.e. the introduction to the world of the 4 vampires) is the highlight. Afterward, it goes slightly south, but still remains good for the most part. One funny part was when they were talking about the sofa and blood on it when they say it is red anyway. Well, it has become red by now. The talking about housekeeping was nice too. Or the guy who is immediately liked by the vampires and werewolves as well, even serves as a bridge between them later on, almost like a male Bella Swan. Or when one werewolf is trolled by a vampire and runs for the ball the vampire throws. There's a lot to laugh in here. You can enjoy this movie too if you liked Twilight, just like I did. It's packed with many interesting vampire references that go way beyond the garlic, sunlight and blood-thirsting. For example did you know vampires have to be asked inside before they can enter a stranger's house? The dramatic parts did not really entertain me that much, such as when they were chasing their newest victim. Actually everything about him, I found fairly forgettable. The girl who wanted to be turned into a vampire was okay (another Twilight reference) and the only scene I really did not like was when they showed the old man who pretty much wasted his life being a servant and never got turned by his masters. It was a bit sad and I could have done without it.The final party scene was solid, but being considered the film's big highlight near the end, I was slightly disappointed. I wish the whole film could have been as funny and entertaining as the first 30 minutes. Nonetheless, this film is a refreshing take on the vampire genre and I recommend giving it a chance. Finally, if this got you interested into watching a more serious quality vampire movie, let me recommend you the Swedish ""Låt den rätte komma in"" from 2008.",What We Do in the Shadows
4,Prismark10,Love at first bite,6,4 November 2017,"Directors Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clement also star in this low budget mockumentary of a group of vampires sharing a house in modern day New Zealand.They argue about housework, they have a slave who do various tasks for them including getting victims round for dinner and some blood.The vampires hit the town at night to go to nightclubs to maybe find victims for blood, but they really are the oldest rockers in town ill suited to the 21st century.They also fall foul of other mutants such as a pack of werewolves that they can smell from a mile off.Waititi & Clement have fun picking apart the vampire conventions, checking for daylight the first thing to do when they wake up in the evening, make sure the blood of the victims do not get everywhere when the victims are attacked, even hypnotism and flying.Things take a turn when a victim called Nick becomes a vampire. He invites a human friend to stay with them. Nick also boasts to strangers that he is a vampire which leads to Petyr, the oldest vampire to being killed.For vampire Viago it is also a sad love story who followed his true love but got posted elsewhere.The film is a good combination of absurdness, humour and horror which can be bloody. However the comedy is rather one note.",What We Do in the Shadows
5,kosmasp,Could this be real?,10,23 December 2014,"Let me start with: I don't like ""reality TV"" at all. And there is a reason you have to put """", because it is anything but real. And while this isn't real either (obviously), it is so much more fun than anything and feels more like what good reality TV could be ... if there where Vampires that is.The basics are clear. As is the fourth wall that is practically not existent, because we are in the middle of it all. Does it always make sense? Of course not, that is the nature of shows like that. How did the camera get in there beforehand? But at least the camera (or the guy holding it) get recognized a lot. The group of people behind this are popular, maybe not worldwide, before this movie came out, but at least ""at home"". And it shows, because of the chemistry they have. This is very well written and acted. Comedy timing is essential and in this case awesome.",What We Do in the Shadows
6,classicsoncall,"""When you are a vampire, you become very sexy.""",7,9 March 2020,"I've watched and reviewed a little over two dozen vampire flicks here on IMDb, and as a testament to how well received this one is by vampire fans, the only other movies that rate higher are ""Nosferatu"" and ""Let the Right One In"". Speaking of which, the character Petyr (Ben Fransham) in this one is a pretty straight knockoff of Nosferatu from the 1922 silent film. To call it a parody might be somewhat of a misnomer, the picture skewers everything from vampires to zombies, werewolves and anything remotely resembling the undead, and does it in hilarious fashion. The thing is, the picture doesn't feel like it's trying to be a comedy, but the zany situations and clever writing make you laugh even if you don't want to. There's also a fair amount of sleight of hand going on, as with Vladislav's (Jemaine Clement) horrific depiction of his archnemesis, The Beast. And then, when we finally meet The Beast (Elena Stejko), you have to kick yourself for falling for the set up. It's all cleverly done and quite entertaining, so even if you're not a vampire fan, this one might get you to change your mind.",What We Do in the Shadows
7,jboothmillard,What We Do in the Shadows,7,21 July 2019,"I didn't hear about this film until I saw that there was an American television series spawned from it, I was only going to start watching it after the original film from New Zealand. Basically, a documentary crew, protected by wearing crucifixes, follow the daily (after)life of four vampire flatmates living in Wellington. Viago (Taika Waititi, also writing and directing, directed Thor: Ragnarok) is a 379-year-old dandy from the 18th century; Vladislav (Jemaine Clement, also writing and directing, starred in Men Black 3) is a 862-year-old known as ""Vladislav the Poker""; Deacon (Jonny Brugh) is a 183-year-old former Nazi, and Petyr (Ben Fransham) is an 8,000-year-old, who resembles Count Orlok. The group of vampires live their everyday lives in the flat, still influenced by the cultures from their own times, but occasionally go out at night to town and hang out. Jackie (Jackie van Beek) is a human who cleans up the blood spilt from draining in the flat, she also lures victims for the vampires, her master Deacon has promised vampirehood to Jackie for doing so. One night, Jackie brings a couple Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) and Josephine (Chelsie Preston Crayford) as victims, but Nick is not fully drained and becomes a vampire himself. Nick brings in new cultural colour to the group. He also brings his friend Stu (Stu Rutherford), an IT guy who introduces the modern information technology to the group. Stu becomes a good friend to them, and because he is Nick's best friend, the group form a pact not to eat him. Besides inviting Stu into the group, Nick is quite irresponsible of his newly gained vampirehood, including showing complete strangers his abilities. One day, a vampire hunter (Brad Harding) comes to the flat and enters the basement, Petyr easily kills him, but he dies of sunlight. The group are also visited by two police officers, but they are hypnotised so as not to see anything out of the ordinary, meaning they cannot see the blood spill and dead bodies. The group blames Nick for this and banishes him from the flat. But then the Unholy Masquerade comes, this happens once a year, where New Zealand's undead community comes and mingles together. Viago and Deacon go there and find that Jackie has been turned by Nick, Stu is also there. Soon the masquerade guests find out that Stu is human, and they get eager to eat him. On the way, the group are confronted by their nemesis, a group of werewolves, this turns into a fight. As a result, Stu is turned into a werewolf himself, but in the end, the vampires and werewolves form a friendship. Also starring Rhys Darby as Anton the werewolf, Elena Stejko as Pauline (The Beast), Jason Hoyte as Julian, Karen O'Leary as Policewoman, and Mike Minogue as Policeman. This is a really clever mockumentary, it uses all the conventions, stereotypical and mythological, we have to expect in vampire movies to its advantage, making for some fantastic and often gory jokes, and the characters are all really likeable, a smart and enjoyable horror comedy. Very good!",What We Do in the Shadows
8,BA_Harrison,Destined for cult status.,8,4 January 2016,"What We Do In The Shadows, a horror 'mockumentary' that follows a group of vampire flatmates in New Zealand as they go about their night-to-night activities, both ghoulish and mundane, does for vampires what Spinal Tap did for Heavy Metal bands: it puts its eccentric characters at the centre of some extremely outré situations, yet still shows them as real people that the viewer can identify with and care about. As with Rob Reiner's celebrated 'rockumentary', the wonderfully realised collection of likable characters, the delightfully droll sense of humour and plenty of highly quotable dialogue ensure that the film is destined for cult status.The cast are uniformly excellent, their deadpan delivery of some very silly dialogue making for some seriously funny moments (although my favourite character, Petyr, an 8000-year-old Nosferatu-style vampire, managed to make me laugh without uttering a word, his confused expressions enough to tickle my funny-bone). Writer/directors Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi keep the pace brisk enough and the action varied enough to make certain that their central joke never wears thin, the silliness including a female familiar who is fed up with cleaning up blood and providing virgins, a newbie vampire who brags about his newfound status, a human who is welcomed into the group, a pack of irascible werewolves, and an annual masquerade party where the vamps get to let off some steam.",What We Do in the Shadows
9,Coventry,The 2nd vampire mockumentary,7,1 December 2015,"I certainly don't intend to bash or talk too negatively about ""What we do in the Shadows"", but to all those die-hard fans who claim that it's a super-original, refreshing and inventive horror comedy I would just like to state clear that the exact same idea and concept had already been done before, namely in the sadly unknown but definitely worthwhile Belgian sleeper hit ""Vampires"" (Vincent Lanoo – 2010). In that film, which was basically a spoof/homage towards the legendary Belgian cult classic ""Man Bites Dog"", a TV crew gets the assignment of following around a family of vampires and shoot a documentary about their lives, habits and routines. ""What we do in the Shadows"" is identical, in fact, except that the action takes place in New Zealand instead of Belgium and that the vampires are not related to each other but house mates that originate from different historic eras. Viago is nearly 320 years old, Deacon almost 200 and Vladislav over 800. They share a little student flat in the center of Wellington and encounter daily issues, like whose turn is it for doing the dishes or who spilled human blood all over the floor. Oh, there's also an 8000-year-old Nosferatu look-alike named Petyr living in the attic! Most of the comic situations are related to the gigantic generational differences between them, especially when they reluctantly ""welcome"" the brand new vampire Nick in their midst. Nick doesn't really bother to keep his vampirism secret, but he does introduce the rest of them to interesting new technologies (like sunset videos on You Tube) and provides them access to hipster nightclubs. The humor in ""What we do in the Shadows"" is subdued and dry. Very, very dry In fact, the film works best as a pitch-black satire of the recent trend of ""polished"" vampire movie franchises and TV-series like the ""Twilight Saga"" or ""True Blood"". The vampires here are not stylish or attractive – quite the contrary - and there's absolutely nothing sensual about being bitten in the neck; especially when the victim's artery paints the entire room blood red. Definitely not all gags or puns are equally successful, but some ideas are extremely inventive and even downright brilliant, notably the nightly confrontation with the werewolf pack and all sequences involving Petyr. Recommended, but – please – make an effort to also check out the aforementioned Belgian pathfinder flick ""Vampires"".",What We Do in the Shadows
10,Scarecrow-88,What We Do in the Shadows,7,27 February 2016,"A documentary crew follows vampires (who are flatmates in a New Zealand city) during their nightly routines, capturing them as they awaken, hunt for human food, attempt to get in clubs, opening up about themselves in interview segments, how they react to werewolves, their messy situations during bloody feedings, prepare for an ""unholy masquerade"", befriend an IT computer analyst (human) they bond with while the one that introduced him to them (recently turned) becomes a major nuisance, and contend with the dangers of their undead secret getting out where it shouldn't. Clever, witty, with a sense of humor; this fun little gem turns both the vampire genre and found footage genre on their head.Two of the most popular horror subgenres merging in a fine synchronicity with some amusing observations caught on camera: (a) how the vampires deal with two cops who answer a call about disturbances, (b) a human young man that was supposed to only be food for the vampires to feed from being kept alive by the oldest vampire of the flat really often wearing out his welcome due to his big mouth, telling practically anyone who would listen of his status as a bloodsucker, (c) how protecting a human becomes increasingly difficult, especially at a party room full of vampires just ready to go into a blood-drinking frenzy, (d) how flying around might be cool but it could lead to being seen by the wrong onlookers, (e) how a patient human slave has been waiting for her master to turn her, cleaning up the bloody messes, ironing their clothes, mowing their lawn, even dutifully selecting humans to be lunch for the vampires (!), (f) being introduced to the internet, a vampire's forlorn desire to being romantically tied to a woman he followed to New Zealand, eventually winning her 96 year old heart (!), (g) how being around werewolves when the full moon emerges in the sky is not a good situation for even vampires (or camera operators with the vampires!), and (h) the awful results of a vampire eating chips which has quite the back alley vomit.A documentary about vampires, their habits and behavior night to night, and conveying their unique, distinct personalities, particularly when talking to the camera (and, essentially, us, the viewing audience), offers some insight into where they came from, what they expect, and the positives and negatives for having eternal life but being restricted by the limits that come with the ""undead lifestyle"". The passive, inert Stu, the welcomed human among the vampires (who speak candidly and nonchalantly about their killing humans for the blood they need to satiate their appetite), is quite a sight among the more chatty, vocal vampires who never fail to embellish or distance themselves from the camera and what it entails. The special effects are good when depended upon (Nick's inability to conceal his newfound vampirism, and his taking flight; an actual ""batfight"" between Nick and rival Deacon (who thinks Nick is ""stealing his style"", and the luring of an actual vampire hunter to their domain results in the sunlight death of one of their own; the vampires being everywhere in their flat as Nick tries to escape them before being turned by Max Schreck-lookalike, Petyr; Viago's always hitting the main artery causing bloody messes), but it is the cast that makes this a real treat. Petyr, whose appearance is modeled after Schreck (from Nosferatur) or Reggie Nalder (of Salem's Lot), is genuinely scary, but how the film even gets humor out of him, in just the way he differs in personality to the others (he stays mostly in his basement, and when Viago attempts to talk with him, he gets a shriek), those who made this film deserve kudos. Vlad's diminished power due to a romantic split that left him damaged is certainly amusing when he tries to render others under a spell, failing miserably. But it is how the film is shot as a document of these unique characters that gives this a significant charm.",What We Do in the Shadows
11,Hey_Sweden,"""I think we drink virgin blood because it sounds cool.""",7,11 October 2020,"Meet Viago (Taika Waititi), Vladislav (Jemaine Clement), Deacon (Jonny Brugh), and the Nosferatu-like Petyr (Ben Fransham). They're four hip, happening New Zealanders who just happen to be centuries-old vampires (and flatmates). A documentary crew films their activities, and their problems of living in modern-day NZ are sometimes universal, ex. delegating chores. Others are just plain amusing: they can't go into nightclubs unless they're invited in, of course. Some problems arise when the dorky Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) is bitten by Petyr, and can't adjust to the vampire lifestyle as well as the others have.Done in the style of a ""mockumentary"", complete with personal testimonials given by the principals, this vampire comedy is like many movies in the comedy genre. It doesn't always work very well, but the gags & jokes that DO land are quite funny. In any event, the movie is put over nicely by its very engaging cast. Deacon and Nick were this viewers' favourite characters. We also see other individuals who are part of the vampires' little world, such as their ""familiar"", family woman Jackie (Jackie van Beek), who must clean up after kills and procure victims. Another very amusing character is the soft-spoken Stu (Stu Rutherford), Nicks' human friend. His extremely under-stated reactions to the madness around him are a hoot.Among the highlights are the altercations that the vampires have with other beasts, especially a pack of werewolves led by Anton (Rhys Darby). For once, we see a movie where men who are werewolves actually take off their clothes before they transform so the clothes don't get torn to shreds! Waititi and Clement also wrote and directed the film, and they get the look and feel of a ""mockumentary"" just right. They also know just how to send their viewers away with a smile.Followed by a TV series.Seven out of 10.",What We Do in the Shadows
12,CinemaSerf,Some fun Kiwi nocturnal shenanigans....,6,8 June 2020,"I'm always wary of films with posters that say ""Hilarious"" or ""Laugh out Loud"" - they are usually about as optimistic as a water diviner in the Gobi - but this is actually quite a funny, well maybe more quirky, take on the vampire story. Here, our three ""Viago"" (Taika Waititi), ""Vladislav"" (Jermaine Clement) & ""Deacon"" (Jonny Brugh) really are fish out of water as they try to cope with 21st Century life in Wellington - with all the humdrum stuff it throws at them. Clad in their Napoleonic-era uniforms, they have to come to terms with bills, vegetarian society and the fact that folks just aren't that scared of the teeth anymore. There is a chemistry between the three men and the humour is at times quite witty and earthy, though the joke wears a bit thin quite quickly - and when the three lads' search for eternal fulfilment accidentally causes ""Nick"" (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) to join their number it all just starts to get too much for our weary band of immortals. It's shot in a pseudo-documentary fashion - probably because it had no budget - and that actually helps create a feeling of sympathy for our hapless boys. Though fairly gory, there is no menace whatsoever and in the end it felt like the cinematic equivalent of eating a mint - it worked for a while then dissolved away to leave not a lot. Definitely worth a watch, though - a sign of things to come from Waititi.",What We Do in the Shadows

16,morrison-dylan-fan,"""Say hello to the night, Lost in the shadows, Say hello to the night, Lost in the loneliness.""",9,2 November 2017,"Whilst sadly getting no Trick or Treaters,I started looking for a Horror movie to watch to mark Halloween. Reading praise for the title from a number of IMDbers over the years,I was pleased to see the BBC screening the movie,which led to me finding out what they do in the shadows.The plot:Preparing to attend the yearly masquerade ball of witches,vampires and zombies, vampires Viago, Vladislav, Deacon, and Petyr and the 8,000 year old Count Orlok allow a documentary crew to come in and film them over the lead-up to the ball. Letting the film crew shoot all their daily routines, Deacon gets his human servant Jackie to bring two random in for them to feed on.Draining the woman, the gang chase after the man,but are stopped in their tracks,when Orlok appears,and appears to have the man all for himself. The next night, Viago, Petyr, Vladislav and Deacon discover that instead of killing him,Orlok has turned the man into a new member of the gang.View on the film:Put together from 125 hours edited down to 90 minutes (!) the outline co-writers/co-directors/co-stars Jemaine Clement & Taika Waititi works incredibly well,thanks to the (largely improvised) gags being based around the building of the friendship between all of the vampires and the fall-out from their trip to the masquerade ball. Basing each vampire off specific vamps from famous films,Clement and Waititi bring out superb character comedy in the awkward differences each vamp shares,from the classical romantic Viago,to the modern day pretty boy Nick. Bringing the life of the vamps to a light in a Found Footage format,the directors do occasionally break the rule of the genre with unnatural camera positions,but make up for it by the dashing tracking shots stabbing the flick with an urgency of each punch-line being caught in the moment. Keeping the budget low,Clement and Waititi cleverly use CGI effects sparingly in order to sink their fangs into the relationships,with smoothly handled CGI transformations matching the transformations taking place within the gang. Entering as outsiders, Stu Rutherford (who was originally hired to work on the CGI!) and Cori Gonzalez-Macuer give great dead- pan performances as Stu and Nick,whilst Waititi and Vladislav hilariously layer on the Gothic flamboyance as Vladislav and Viago,who get lost in the shadows.",What We Do in the Shadows
17,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Absolutely fun and enjoyable vampire effort,10,22 March 2016,"Asked to follow a group of vampires, a group of filmmakers seeing how they live together in a small flat capture their attempt to train a new recruit into their ranks at the house who turns their lives upside down as they try to survive in the modern-day age.This one was a rather enjoyable and incredibly funny horror comedy. One of the better elements here is the fact that this one manages to be a rather enjoyable and hilarious satire on reality shows with how this one presents the main group here. The fact that they're still decidedly old-school style vampires of the classical mold, with the aristocratic and debonair types still obsessed with the style from their death- year which conflicts wildly with the way they live as the more modern society with these issues. Their struggles to come to grips with those issues, finally forcing a human friend to help them out with the jump into the new technological age and how they're able to get the different societies able to come to terms with the modern-day world which is all sorts of hilarious. That greatly compliments the other strong aspects of this one in the fact that there's a lot of really great laughs at the expense of the group as there's a lot of fun to be had poking fun at vampire culture with the odd-couple dynamic at play with all of the humorous work here. There's the fact that all the different ways for them to fly around the apartment building dealing with their human-like squabbling, their constant ability of using their powers to perform menial everyday tasks and making sure the camera crew captures them at the middle of their inherent goofiness all making for an utterly uproarious time with the sight-gags and visual humor becoming such a fun time in this one. It still doesn't forget it's about vampires, as there's quite a bit here regarding their rather obvious powers bringing the attacks on the humans they find out in the clubs, the different encounters with the bullies and the big encounter in the society dance which is fun with all the different creatures coming together into a really enjoyable time which is all the more fun with the action-packed sequence afterward of the gang encounters werewolves in the woods. There's really only one part of this that it tends to peter out a tad with the finale that doesn't really make much sense in just wrapping up with an anti-climatic sense of conclusion which builds to a rather satisfying sense of action but just ends up finishing because it ran out of time and needed to finish rather than let them play out as expected. It's all that holds this one back.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",What We Do in the Shadows

19,christopher-underwood,Not hilarious but very likable.,7,12 November 2014,"Before setting out to see a preview of this film I glanced at the host of enthusiastic reviews on this site and then noticed that most of them were 'reviewed' by folks who had reviewed nothing else. This made me suspicious and I felt that the film would be a sad and silly mess. Not so! The movie is nowhere near as funny as suggested or intended but the look of it is stunning. set design and costume stars should win awards, almost ever scene looks fantastic with decrepit, stained interiors, literally dripping with blood and crazy costumes that help maintain the right feel for what is essentially a vampire flat share. The mockumentary format works well initially and there are quite brilliant sequences as each creature gives his back story and this is illustrated with a fantastic array of old prints, paintings and vampiric illustrations. However as the film progresses, the format shows its limitations and things become just a little static. The introduction of werewolf creatures is helpful and provide the best exterior sequences and I just wish I liked the whole thing more. A lot of love and care and enthusiasm has clearly gone into this but it didn't quite seem to have enough edge. For all the projectile blood vomiting and killing this remained a nice film about vampiric creatures managing to live as best they can. Maybe thats enough.",What We Do in the Shadows

They went too far with the reality TV documentary style and after one hour and a half of following silly people around who are just incidentally vampires or werewolves or whatever, I was just praying for it to just end.Some jokes were funny, but certainly not laughing out loud stuff. The acting was OK, given the plot, but really, it was a total bore. Add to this the overwhelmingly positive reviews that made me expect something so much better and it all resulted in a terrible disappointment.",What We Do in the Shadows
21,namashi_1,Such Fun!,10,3 September 2015,"'What We Do in the Shadows' is one of the most original films to have come out recently. Its a terrific Mockumentary/Horror-Comedy, that left me in splits. Its beautifully innovative & amazingly entertaining.'What We Do in the Shadows' Synopsis: Viago, Deacon, and Vladislav are vampires who are finding that modern life has them struggling with the mundane - like paying rent, keeping up with the chore wheel, trying to get into nightclubs, and overcoming flatmate conflicts.'What We Do in the Shadows' takes Indie Cinema ahead, with pride. This is a film that needs to be watched & enjoyed. For its innovation & sincerity, this critical darling deserves some real respect. I had ball & also had my share of envy, as such an ingenious Script is rare to find.Taika Waititi & Jemaine Clement's Screenplay is first-class. Its an extremely well-done Screenplay, that is high on novelty & laughs. Watching Vampires go at it with Werewolves, has never been so much fun! Waititi & Clement's Direction, on the other-hand, feels realistic. Cinematography & Editing are perfect.Performance-Wise: Waititi & Clement are brilliant actors too! They enact the vampires with a heart, with such zeal & effortlessness, its hard not to be awed by them. Jonathan Brugh is first-rate. Ben Fransham is superb.

22,KineticSeoul,Bloody fun and amusing time,8,16 January 2017,"This is a very amusing mockumentary style movie that focuses in on a few vampires that act like brothers. And their dynamics with one another when it comes to doing choirs, when new comers get involved and how they go about dealing with humans. I didn't particularly find this to be hilarious, but I got a few laughs out of it and it was very amusing to sit through. Maybe it's because the actors played their parts so well to the point it just came off very natural. Maybe it's their personalities in real life, but the interactions came off amusing and natural. It really did seem like it's how the actors in this would act like if they were vampires. The executions when it comes to the vampire elements onto screen is very cleverly done. It's like they thought up a lot of fun and creative ideas when it comes to the vampire myths and mashed it all together into a mockumentary. But the thing is, it all works together fluently and it all fits together. To describe this mockumentary, it's like a mix of ""The Office"", ""Borat"" and ""Napoleon Dynamite"" when it comes to the dynamics and vibe of it all. It start to slightly drag an hour in but overall it was a bloody good time.8/10",What We Do in the Shadows
23,Hellmant,Both horrendously grotesque and brilliantly hilarious!,9,1 May 2015,"'WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A mockumentary about four centuries-old vampires, living in a flat together and trying to adapt to modern life (in New Zealand). It was written and directed by Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement (of 'FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS' fame). Waititi and Clement also star in the movie; along with Jonathan Brugh, Ben Fransham, Cori Gonzalez- Macuer, Stu Rutherford and Rhys Darby. It's both horrendously grotesque and brilliantly hilarious!Viago (Waititi), Vladislav (Clement), Deacon (Brugh) and Petyr (Fransham) are four vampires, who have been around for centuries, that all share a flat together; in Wellington. They've decided to allow a film crew to film them, for a documentary, and have promised not to kill any of them. They go out clubbing at night, to hunt down humans for food (and party), and stay in their flat during the day (to avoid the deadly sunlight). Viago narrates the documentary and explains how the four vampires have attempted to adapt to modern life. The movie is a very dark comedy; the vampires do kill innocent humans (for food) and make others be their slaves (while promising to turn them into vampires, one day). It's gory and pretty true to most vampire mythology. I was really impressed with how the filmmakers were able to do this, while still making an extremely funny movie (it's hilarious)! The mockumentary format is perfect for delivering the jokes with; and the acting and directing are brilliant. I look forward to seeing more from Waititi and Clement, in the future.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/vvaTQ0fcFUQ",What We Do in the Shadows
24,Buddy-51,Clever vampire parody,7,13 September 2015,"Ever wonder how vampires always manage to look so spiffy and dapper in their appearance and attire even though they can't see themselves in a mirror? This and many similarly pressing ghoul-related questions are addressed in ""What We Do in the Shadows,"" a macabre mockumentary about four roommates (Ben Fransham, Jemaine Clement, Taika Waititi, Jonathan Brugh), sharing a home in New Zealand, who just happen to be bloodsucking creatures-of-the-night. Eventually, they're joined by Nick (Cori-Gonzalez Maceur), an unsuspecting victim who comes over for ""dinner"" one night, then pals around with them after his transformation, and Stu (Stu Rutherford), Nick's human friend whose genuine likability keeps the foursome from turning him into one of them.Written and directed by Clement and Waititi, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" is a fitfully amusing parody of all the conceits and tropes of a genre that has become a mainstay of popular culture in recent years - and that's putting it mildly. Some of those works have even been satirical in nature, but ""Shadows"" ups the ante by setting its spoofery in the context of one of those slice-of-life documentaries so dear to the hearts of reality-TV aficionados everywhere.Like ""The Addams Family"" and ""The Munsters,"" ""Shadows"" derives much of its humor from the domestication of our own bogeymen and fears, as well as the incongruity of a bunch of centuries-old (in one case, millenia-old) undead creatures living and relating in the modern world. Yet, while the humor is decidedly dark in nature - there is no stinting on graphic bloodletting being performed on innocent victims - it's also very clever, even though the movie does hit a point of diminishing returns after awhile, perhaps inevitably, given its somewhat self-restricting one-joke premise. Ultimately, though, it's an original and fun celebration of male camaraderie and bonding - even in its most outlandish form.",What We Do in the Shadows
25,cherold,mildly amusing,5,2 November 2017,"I watched this for about half an hour. A mockumentary about vampire roommates is a cute idea, mixing the day-to-day challenges of shared living with vampire challenges like finding victims, and it was all kind of amusing. But I wouldn't go so far as to call it funny, and the fact that I wasn't actually laughing or feeling interested hinted to me that this wasn't the movie for me.It's very low-key humor. It's so low-key that even the moments that might feel horrific instead just seem bland. In theory, this is a dark comedy, but it never felt that dark or that funny. To be fair, I don't like some mockumentaries that other people love. While I loved Spinal Tap, I never understood the appeal of Waiting for Guffman. So if you just love all the mockumentaries, you might like this better than I did.",What We Do in the Shadows
26,FeastMode,my notes,8,25 June 2019,"Very funny throughout. very different and unique. very clever and entertaining, especially if you are familiar with vampires. also a well made movie with good directing, which is surprising for a documentary style movie (3 viewings)",What We Do in the Shadows
27,Pjtaylor-96-138044,All about Stu.,8,6 February 2019,"'What We Do In The Shadows (2014)' is pretty much the best 'mockumentary' I've seen, especially in terms of its 'documentary' aesthetic. From the subtle camera-light illuminating the characters to the expert use of story-telling stock-photos to a brilliant black-and-white 'recreation', this film feels like a 'real' documentary right the way through. This is contrary to most movies of the kind, which usually lose their way in the second act or break the illusion with impossible shots that should reveal the camera-men but don't. It's also the main reason, I feel, why the experience works so well. Everything just feels so 'real' and the satire is certainly on-point. The piece pokes fun at all types of vampire and their tropes, using its five core bloodsuckers to take specific aim at archetypes seen within 'Nosfetstu (1922)', 'Dracula (1931)', 'Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992)', 'Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994)' and 'Twilight (2008)'. Of course, it also jabs at various clichés from across the myriad of movies that make use of the wider vampire mythos. On top of all this, it pokes fun at both typical 'flat-mate' youth-culture and documentaries at large, so it has quite a lot to sink its teeth into. Thankfully, it hits a deep vein. It's remarkably funny on numerous occasions. Even when it isn't 'laugh-out-loud', its satire is more than clever enough to be appreciated. It paints a believable portrait of modern-day vampires in a way that works even if you haven't seen a horror movie before - though, obviously the experience is infinitely enhanced if you have. It's performances are actually quite subtle; they're remarkably restrained and wonderfully wholistic considering that they consist of mainly improvised material. The same can be said of the entire affair, I suppose, as it tells a cohesive, if ever-so-slightly 'skit'-based story. The special-effects are also remarkably good. They're consistently convincing and incredibly imaginative. On the whole, this is a very entertaining feature with a unique central conceit that's executed in a charming and suitably low-key way. It's smart, funny and generally likeable. 8/10",What We Do in the Shadows
28,bowmanblue,Just like Twilight (only joking... thankfully),8,8 May 2015,"A film about vampires. My first thought – oh... another one – great. Add the fact that it's a 'mockumentary' i.e. a spoof documentary filmed in a 'fly-on-the-wall' kind of fashion. My first thought – oh, another one – great.Yes, there is truly nothing original about 'What We Do in the Shadows' – a spoof documentary, charting the lives of four ancient vampires, currently flat-sharing in modern day New Zealand. Perhaps the generally lack of originality was what made me watch it with such low expectations. In any case... I was more than pleasantly surprised.It was actually really good. In short... it was funny. It takes a lot for a 'comedy' film to actually make me laugh and this one pulled it off. Yes, there's absolutely nothing 'idea-wise' that we haven't seen before, but with a sharp, satirical script, that doesn't matter. It's just such a daft, fun film that anyone who has a love of the horror/vampire genre will definitely enjoy it. You do need to know a little bit in general about vampire films. Naturally, there are more than a few jokes based on the general Dracula legend that might go over your head if you haven't seen the film or read the book.Yes, most of the vampires are pretty stereotypical (for undead blood-suckers) and you should recognise their 'types' among the genre. But, as I say, it's simply the comedy that saves this film from potentially being just mediocre.If you enjoy your horror/vampire yarns, relax your brain and put this one. It really is simply amusing. Special credit to the wonderful scenes with the swearwolves... sorry WERE wolves. Classic.",What We Do in the Shadows
29,dromasca,I survived the night,6,18 January 2020,"I love comedies in general and parodies in particular, but I'm not a big fan of vampires movies. But what about the parody of a vampires movie? I chose to watch 'What We Do in the Shadows', mainly because the film is written and directed by Taika Waititi - one of the hottest names on the movie market today, the author of 'Jojo Rabbit' - here alongside Jemaine Clement. The two also play two of the roles within the vampire quartet who spend a portion of eternity in a haunted house in the city of Wellington of our days. In fact better said the Wellington of our nights, because the active life of the vampires begins, as we all know, at nightfall, when they can go out without fear to lure and hunt their victims and meet with others creatures of darkness, for example with werewolves. I am not sorry about the time invested, I survived in one piece and with no bites the experience, and also without becoming a vampire or a fan of vampire movies.The format used by the filmmakers is that of a parody of documentary films, a format sometimes called 'mockumentary'. A film crew (whose protection is provided by contract) is sent to film kind of a 'reality show' that presents 'around the clock' the after-death adventures of the New Zealand's vampire inhabitants. As in any movie or TV show of the genre, there are alternated live footage (most filmed at night, some even in the dark) with biographical notes and off-action comments of the vampire protagonists. The formula, once understood by the spectators, allows for the continuous unfolding of jokes and orgy drunkenness with blood, of the comic and horror sequences, sometimes interleaved, other times combined. A considerable dose of ketchup and other red liquids finds plenty usage throughout the film.The schema works very well. The effect I think depends on the viewers' adherence to the parodied genre and the familiarity with the comic characters transferred into the vampire space. I believe that fans of the genre will find many familiar references, and for them the jokes will more easily reach their targets. Viewers who know the team of actors and directors will find familiar characters in new situations. For the less initiated viewers - myself among them - the result is partial. I smiled pretty much all the time and laughed moderately at many moments, but I didn't roll on the floor with laughs, as at the most successful comedies. Something in the style with which Taika Waititi addresses elements of popular culture is also felt in this film. He does not avoid the kitsch, I can even say that he is looking for it, but under his guidance parody loses any nuances of vulgarity. Unlike in 'Jojo Rabbit', in 'What We Do in the Shadows' fun is more important than the message. And that's OK. A recent news item names the New Zealand director as the author of a future series in the 'Star Wars' cycle. Now I have become curious!",What We Do in the Shadows

It is a ridiculously fun, original comedy film as we follow a group of vampires in a documentary style, getting to see what a regular week is like for them. It does this mockumentary take in a way that is fresh and not in any way repetitive or similar to other ones, we feel like these vampires are really people, while also being in hysterics. My only genuine complaint about this movie is that it was too short. Running at just under ninety minutes, I was a little underwhelmed at how abruptly it finished, I felt it could have gone further, more could have happened. The cast is absolutely phenomenal, with everyone having an effortless comedic presence, great chemistry and owning their roles individually. Taika Waititi, Jemaine Clement and Jonathan Brugh shine in their respective roles, and the back and forth between them is so good that it is hard to tell what bits are improvised and what are scripted. Pure hilarity from beginning to end. A complete riot, What We do in the Shadows is great fun, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy.

A hysterical take on the found-footage genre, this Kiwi contribution perfectly captures the idiosyncratic drawbacks and benefits to being undead - and having roommates.

34,nairtejas,"For What You Expect, It Is Totally Unfunny. ♦ 0%",1,26 February 2015,"I love the team behind this film for having made me laugh with their quirky ideas in TV shows and other films. Flight of the Conchords' two-season TV show was immensely enjoyable. But, in here, all I could see was first person conversations that are everything but funny.Narrating their life and death stories are four wannabe vampires who take pride in their ages and useless powers. While one would expect the film to advance to a laugh ride, it goes nowhere. They occupy a dull mansion and invite virgin friends of friends to victimize them; how convenient! Now I am all yes for not having a proper storyline, but there is no humor in even the farthest corners of the dialogs. I may have chuckled once or twice, but they were due to slapstick, which also starts to decline after the first twenty minutes.The makers fail to understand that a promising premise cannot single-handedly drive a good show; it's got to have traction. There is nothing much else to talk about this film that is basically a bad and cringe-worthy execution.BOTTOM LINE: If it is streaks of laughter that you are expecting to do while watching this indie satire show, then I'll suggest you better wait till the time they start selling the DVDs for free, if that ever happens.

I would say it is an interview with the vampires in the Kiwi style. The film follows a group of vampires living in an old mansion and their everyday routine, including how they manage to get blood and confrontation with other mutants are documented.Definitely a wonderful comedy, but feels like a mix of 'Dark Shadows' and 'Addams Family'. The title implies the nightlife of these creatures, especially adapting the modern way of lifestyle. So their exploration begins here for their video document. Being different is how much struggle is what the film focused. Threats from various quarters and getting over from every disastrous event is revealed.Quite an interesting vampire film with the awesome characters and of course the entire film was shot in the dark time. It is not a cliché, but just a spoof of the typical vampire theme. Cleverly written screenplay and direction with the well supported performances. Looks like many people had loved it, I'm slightly on the different side that I enjoyed watching it but did not like much. Because I have seen better film in the similar concept.

36,sol-,Shadows and Fog,7,2 April 2016,"Four twenty-first century New Zealand vampires are interviewed by a documentary crew in this horror mockumentary written, directed by and starring Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi. Much of the film was reportedly improvised with over 100 hours of footage shot. As such, the film is highly uneven with some sequences dragging; the ""swear-wolves"" in particular are far less interesting than the vampire protagonists. Most of the film clicks into place nicely though, and while scattered gags misfire, there are far more hits than misses. At the film's funniest, two police officers visit the vampires' den (dilapidated house) and (without checking) accept that a bloodied corpse on a dirty floor is a drunk friend who has passed out, instructing the vampires to at least place a pillow under his head! Clement also has a great deadpan moment as he casually announces that he must have hit a main artery after his attempt to drain a woman's blood turns messy. Humour aside, the film is thoughtfully assembled with archive footage gloriously spliced into the mix, as well as some faux newspaper headlines. There is also much to like in how comically anachronistic the vampires (wearing period costumes for the most part) are, using Skype to stay in contact and repeatedly failing to get into local nightclubs since they need to be ""invited in"". There are also some fun references to 'The Lost Boys' and vampire lore in general, including vampires' ability to hypnotise and get people to look at them, which for our not-so-skilled nosferatus involves physically knocking on their doors!",What We Do in the Shadows

38,tomgillespie2002,The funniest film I've seen in a long time,8,14 April 2015,"To anyone who believes the both the mockumentary and vampire genres have been done to death and have nothing else to offer need look no further than What We Do in the Shadows, the blood-sucking comedy from Kiwi duo Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Concords) and Taika Waititi (Eagle Vs. Shark (2007)). While lampooning the recent Twlight- inspired vampire craze has been done already with the dreadful Vampires Suck (2010), What We Do... manages to be both hilarious and endlessly creative with its take on the genre, managing to deliver some genuine (and surprising) scares along the way.Uber-tidy vampire Viago (Waititi) resides in his decaying mansion with his fellow fang-bearers, Vladislav (Clement), a torture-and- seduction type who was dubbed Vlad the Poker in his heyday, the slobbish Deacon (Jonathan Brugh) who is deluded about his own physical attractiveness, and Nosferatu-lookalike Petyr (Ben Fransham), an 8000-year old who doesn't take too kindly at being awoken from his coffin. They bicker about washing the dishes, go to clubs but can't get in without the bouncers extending them an invitation, and occasionally exchange insults with the local pack of werewolves, led by the polite Anton (Rhys Darby), who reminds his fellow wolves that they're ""werewolves, not swearwolves!"" Their routine life is shaken by the freshly-turned Nick (Cori Gonzalez- Macuer) and his human friend Stu (Stu Rutherford).Some scenes border on genius - the set-piece involving a terrified and still-human Nick being led to believe he's eating maggots (""I stole that from The Lost Boys,"") and chased around the dark and endless mansion by the teleporting and shape-shifting trio achieves more excitement and frights than any full-blooded horror can hope to muster. It mocks and homages the genre, answering questions such as what would vampires search for on the internet? Virgins and sun- rises, obviously. As the blabbermouth Nick inadvertently sets a vampire hunter on their trails and the lovable Stu shows the housemates the delights of modern technology, the film becomes a sweet portrayal of friendship and learning to embrace, or in this case, tolerate diversity.

40,leonblackwood,You have to have a warped sense of humour to enjoy it! 6/10,6,12 July 2015,"Review: I found this film quite funny at the beginning but it gets a bit ridiculous after a while. The storyline is quite original and the different characters brought different flavours to this somewhat weird and wonderful film. Its based around three vampires who live together as roommates. They have to deal with day to day life whilst getting various victims to come to there house so they can feed. One of there victims introduces them to modern life and they end up going to night clubs and exploring the Internet. The whole concept is very well put together and at such a cheap budget, they really did do a good job. It does get a big silly after a while but you have to take it with a pinch of salt because your really not supposed to take it seriously. The fact that they are blood sucking vampires who take to a very normal Nick, who doesn't really say that much through the film, made me laugh along with the servant who is dying to become a vampire. Anyway, it's a light hearted comedy about a friendship and brotherhood which has a unique, vampire twist. Watchable!Round-Up: Were do I start with this film? I recognised Jemaine Clement from MIB3, Dinner For Schmucks and Muppets Most Wanted but I haven't seen the other actors before. The film was also written and directed me Jemaine who has a extremely weird sense of humour, which I saw in Tongan Ninja. The main vampire Taika Waititi, had a brief role in the Green Lantern but this has to be his real shot at fame. He also wrote and directed this movie so you have to give him credit for that. Anyway, I doubt that there will ever be a film like this, made again so it's worth a watch for its originality and warped humour.Budget: $1.6million Worldwide Gross: $7millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies about 3 roommates, who happen to be vampires, who are shown modern day life after turning a young 20 year old into a vampire. 6/10",What We Do in the Shadows
41,TheMovieDiorama,What We Do In The Shadows highlights the quirky comedic wit of Taika Waititi.,7,24 February 2018,"A man who has rocketed to mainstream fame with 'Thor: Ragnarok', however I find his previous lesser known work to be more enthralling and creatively unique. A faux documentary of a small group of vampires who share a house together. We view their nightly lives but also welcoming a new younger member to the vampiric clan. Have you ever wondered what vampires get up to except sleeping in coffins and drinking the blood of a virgin? Well, this film explores that in the best way possible: comedically. There's nothing funny about a vampire...but a vampire residing in New Zealand? That's a whole different story. It's impossible not to admire the type of eccentric humour that is put into Waititi's films. Quick, sharp and full of wit, the dialogue remains intelligent throughout without having to resort to slapstick. Burst veins causing blood to spray, bat fights, werewolf clans and even the hierarchal structure of master and familiar. Traditional vampiric routines with a hint of edgy fun. Also liked the reference to other vampire films like 'The Lost Boys' and the horrifically terrible 'Twilight'. Did I laugh all the way through? No. Is it as funny as everyone claims it to be? Definitely not. Though the creativity in every scene makes the flick scarily entertaining. Waititi, Clement and Brugh have fang-tastic on screen chemistry. The costume design was authentic, heck even the visual effects were pretty decent considering the low budget. A nice short runtime results in a consistent pace that moves along rapidly. I would've liked to have seen more of a plot offered to keep me enthralled, but I appreciate the direction Waititi and Clement took. A fun intriguing look into the life of a vampire with plenty of comedic wit, albeit slightly overrated. Atleast I laughed at this, shows that I have more life than a vampire!",What We Do in the Shadows
42,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The best mockumentary in years,8,5 January 2016,"For years, Christopher Guest (""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Best in Show"") was the creator and sole proprietor of mockumentaries, but New Zealanders Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement (""Flight of the Concords"") have left their mark on the genre with ""What We Do in the Shadows,"" a feature-length version of their 2005 short film that centers of three vampires who live in Wellington as flatmates.Viago (Waititi), Deacon (Jonny Brugh) and Vladislav (Clement) are all vampires born various centuries ago who found their way to an old house in New Zealand where they live with the Nosferatu-esque vampire Petyr (Ben Fransham) in the basement. They deal with typical roommate issues like who isn't pulling their weight cleaning blood off the dishes and helping each other figure out what to wear to the bars at night because they can't see themselves in a mirror.This down-to-earth, contemporary portrayal of vampires makes ""Shadows"" one of the better and most original riffs on a sub-genre that over the last 10 years has been sucked dry, pun intended. The characters are just dudes who happen to like frilly Gothic shirts and need blood to survive, and life can be as awkward for them as it is for humans, just in (very) different ways.This conceit really drives the success of the film and provides a focus for the actors' improvisation. Waititi, Brugh and Clement all create distinctive characters whose personalities extend beyond their vampire characteristics. They are all somehow relatable despite being larger than life and totally peculiar. The story deals in both real-world realms like Wellington nightclubs and imagined ones such as the secret subcultures of vampires and other classical creatures, including werewolves. Simultaneously, it caters to fans of these sub-genres and to fans of contemporary comedy. It's a smooth blend that works surprisingly well, though the plot isn't nearly as compelling as waiting for whatever clever bit might come next.Equally well-incorporated are the use of practical and visual effects. Waititi and Clement employ both judiciously and effectively and it earns the film its horror stripes alongside the more immediately apparent comedic ones.""Shadows"" does dip into silly B-movie habits that it shouldn't feel compelled to resort to, but the wit, talent and clever dialogue keeps it elevated from similar low- budget horror comedy efforts.~Steven CThanks for reading!

43,Vartiainen,"One joke, but a funny one",7,14 February 2017,"What We Do in the Shadows is a mockumentary, made exactly in the style of all those reality-TV documentaries that fill the day-time television. The ones that follow the lives of ordinary people, are filled with people talking on couches or in cars, don't really contain anything of substance and are just pointless projects to blow money on. Except that in this case we follow a household of vampires living in New Zealand. Oh, they still argue about dishes and cleaning, but they also have conversations about laying down newspapers before drinking from someone because it's such a pain to get blood out of the cushions, and lots more.And to be completely honest, that's about it. That's the one joke the film has. But it's a really funny one. All the different vampire clichés are examined and mocked through our main characters from the young rascal of the group, Deacon, who's only 183 years old, to good old Petyr, who's over 8000 years old and lives in a stone coffin in the basement. The film also contains some other mythological creatures and shamelessly makes fun of them as well.To be fair, the one joke starts to grow a bit stale towards the end. I think that the film makers purposefully wanted to end the film without anything too major happening, because that's how all those ""real"" documentaries end, but it also means that there's not much of a story arc in the film. But, I was still chuckling at the joke even in the very end, so it didn't outlive its welcome. But it was a near thing.Still, the film is very much worth a watch if this is your kind of humour, which you should be able to surmise from what I've told you. If the idea is amusing to you, you're going to enjoy this film a lot.",What We Do in the Shadows
44,jtindahouse,Good characters but needed more of a story,6,3 December 2015,"Jemaine Clement has a very unique sense of humour. If you've seen 'Flight of the Conchords' you'll know that his is a brand of comedy that is not for everyone, but if it is for you you'll absolutely love it. It's an incredibly dry type of humour which is why I wasn't surprised to hear he was doing a vampire movie. It sounded right up his alley. And he nailed the humour, he really did. The only problem was he never bothered to accompany it with a story and so the film just feels like 80 minutes of improvised vampire jokes. I read that he and co-writer/director Taika Waititi wrote a script but never actually showed it to the cast and just let them improvise almost the entire thing and adjusted the script accordingly. For me they needed to take a leaf out of Larry David's comedy series 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' where everything is improvised but still with very strict guidelines of information that needs to be included to further the story. It works for him and I see no reason why it couldn't have worked here. Improvising everything including the story is just madness and it is sadly what holds this film back from being a truly great New Zealand comedy.",What We Do in the Shadows
45,jamesrupert2014,Biting comedy,8,11 September 2017,"A clever 'mockumentary' that follows the travails of four vampires sharing a house in modern Wellington NZ, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" tags many of the tropes associated with the vampire myth as the foursome struggle to get along and get enough to drink. The film is largely a 'big in-joke' and aficionados of the genre will recognise each of bloodsuckers from movies/books but even if vampires are not your cup of blood, it is still pretty funny. Some of the jokes and sight-gags work better than others but the best parts are brilliant: especially the interactions with the vampires' immortal enemies, the werewolves. Be forewarned: at times the movie is a bit crude (even the werewolves are swear-wolves at times) and gruesome (four guys who drink blood sharing a house, what do you think the kitchen looks like?).

Lo and behold, not long after, it was screened on TV. My mate said that he thought it was really funny and I have to totally agree.
Four vampires, raging from 8000 to a mere 183 years old, house share in Wellington, New Zealand and this comical mockumentary follows their hilarious night time exploits. We also get werewolves and zombies thrown into the melting pot, as well as a human character called Stu. I was very impressed by everything, the wit is spot on, the acting is sufficiently good, some pretty decent effects and gore, etc. So many horror comedies fail in my opinion but this one is a winner.",What We Do in the Shadows

I was hoping for better. It seems like it's constantly right on the verge of doing something really hilarious, but can't quite flip the switch. The landscape is ripe for this kind of a satire, too, with so much empty romanticism hovering around the fantasy genre. Most of the fun comes from picking apart the hallmarks of the bloodsucker game, exposing them for the lame parlor tricks and absurd handicaps they really are. Mystically swapping a plate of noodles for worms, for example, to the mild annoyance of the victim. Failing to enter a nightclub because the bouncer doesn't explicitly invite them in. In most films, these would be appetizers for the main entree, but in this case there's no second course. This would've made for a brilliant skit on a sketch comedy show, but it just doesn't have the depth for its own feature-length. Even a very short one.",What We Do in the Shadows
49,estebangonzalez10,The best comedy of 2014,8,19 March 2015,"""I go for a look which I call dead but delicious.""Just when you thought there couldn't be another fresh spin out of the overplayed vampire genre, there comes along a small New Zealand mockumentary that manages to feel original and hilarious at the same time. A parody of vampire movies isn't simple to make, just ask the directors of Vampire Sucks, but in What We Do in the Shadows Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi manage to direct a funny and engaging film about vampires. Clement and Waititi are known for the TV series Flight of the Conchords which Clement has starred in and helped create, while Waititi has directed a couple of episodes. These New Zealand directors also write and star in this film which was mostly improvised (they had over 120 hours of footage which was later edited to under 85 minutes). This is perhaps one of the funniest mockumentaries I've seen since Borat and many have compared it to This is Spinal Tap (but I'm ashamed to admit that I haven't seen it yet). It is very witty and it plays around many of the vampire genre conventions, but it does so with a fantastic sense of humor giving each one of the vampires a distinct personality. It also centers on the day to day domestic life these vampires lead as they live together in a flat and are given specific chores in the home. So in a way it almost plays out as a sort of spoof of The Real World as well considering they have arguments about someone not doing the dishes, or are always giving each other advice as to what to wear for the night, or even making sure they clean up the mess they leave behind from their victims. It's about friendship and learning to live with each other. I was a huge fan of Only Lovers Left Alive which was another engaging vampire film that took a unique spin on the genre, but this is much lighter and is played entirely for laughs. I had a great time and laughed throughout the film.One of the best things about this vampire mockumentary is that they decided to have these four vampires living together in a flat despite being completely different from each other and coming from different backgrounds. There is Viago (Taika Waititi) who is over 300 years old and who came to New Zealand to pursue a love interest, Vladislav (Jemaine Clement) who was once a powerful vampire from the Middle Ages who lost most of his powers to someone he calls the Beast, Deacon (Jonathan Brugh) who is the youngest of the group and who refuses to wash the dishes saying that vampires shouldn't have to, and then there is Petyr (Ben Fransham), a vampire over 8000 years old that looks like Nosferatu. The film centers on these vampires following their every day routines while they are being filmed by a documentary crew. There are several instances where they talk to the camera explaining who they are. While we follow these characters they run in to some other creatures like werewolves, zombies, and even witches, which makes for some funny scenes with quotable lines. Cori Gonzalez-Macuer and Stuart Rutherford also play supporting roles in this film but I don't want to get into too much detail because it is more fun if you simply enjoy the wackiness of everything unfolding before the screen.Mockumentaries and vampire films aren't perhaps something most audiences would be interested in considering they have been overdone in recent years, but the combination of these two genres make for a very entertaining and funny movie. What could've very easily been a one punch joke and lost most of its steam during the first 10 minutes ends up stretching out very well and the jokes continue to feel fresh and inventive. In other hands this could've simply worked as a short film, but Waititi and Clement manage to keep the humor coming throughout the entire 80 minutes. It is a perfectly executed film with many memorable scenes. There is even a scene that seems to be parodying the hall way scene in Inception so there are a lot of different funny things going on in this movie which mostly involve parodying vampire genre conventions. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",What We Do in the Shadows
50,NateWatchesCoolMovies,instant classic,10,4 December 2016,"I don't remember laughing as hard at a film in years as I did at What We Do In The Shadows the other night. It's pure comedic bliss from front to back, and makes the often tedious chore of making an audience laugh seem effortless. It's part horror comedy, part mockumentary with a dash of buddy camaraderie and and depth of wit and character all it's own, thanks to New Zealand filmmaker Taika Watiti, who is fast becoming one of my favorite new voices in the independent field. A master at finding the humour in little moments and dry subtlety, his cameras spend a couple hours documenting pratfalls, squabbles and zany encounters with quartet of vampires living in Wellington, New Zealand, each one simultaneously a different caricature of bloodsuckers from previous lore, as well as a completely unique, hilarious individual. Jermaine Clement is the closest thing you'll find to a household name amongst the cast as Vladislav, a Dracula esque, baroque vamp. Jonny Brugh is Viago, the musically inclined, Ann Rice incarnation, and Ben Fransham, plays Peter, a spooky eight thousand year old Nosferatu clone. It's Watiti himself who steals the show though, as Deacon, a dandy of a Germanic royal who gets all the best lines and relishes them with adorable deadpan delivery every chance he gets. The film comes nowhere near the classification of horror, and in fact these four resemble a bumbling, lovable frat house, their vampiric nature treated lightly as they cavort about their everyday life like rambunctious nocturnal teddy bears. They navigate household chores, nightlife, inter species relations (there's a few priceless encounters with a rival pack of werewolves), pesky humans, and have a ball the whole time through. What makes the film so special is the goldmine of comic skill and talent that both director and cast have tapped into. The relationships are unforced, full of idiosyncratic nonsense and always feel utterly organic. For a group of undead fellows, they truly are the life of the party. The documentary style never feels intrusive or irritating, seamlessly taking refuge behind the forceful and side splitting antics which take center stage for the entire film. Comedy is the hardest genre to produce fruitful results in, with horror a close second. What it takes to make you laugh can often be a rare gift, wielded by few and far between, those writers, directors and actors who have that elusive midas touch on our funnybones, combining just the right elements of script, improv and intuition to get us laughing ourselves silly. This one achieves that and then some.",What We Do in the Shadows

52,jfgibson73,New Zealand Mockumentary Delivers,8,3 October 2015,"This movie felt like a feature length episode of The Office with a little bit more artsy sets. Taking place in Wellington, it focuses on three vampires sharing a home, biting throats, and hitting clubs. Since they are all hundreds of years old, much of the best comedy comes when they get a new roommate. Having just become a vampire, the character Nick wants all the attention of a reality TV star, causing friction with the conservative elders. We get one of the better lines of the movie when Nick's carelessness results in one of the vampires being ""burnt to a sizzle,"" and he is put on trial. There is some haggling as to just how long his indefinite banishment from the house will last, and his sad departure feels like we're watching the first season of Real World. Besides Nick, the other great side plot involves a group of werewolves. Neither group is especially hardcore, and the two gangs get into frequent confrontations, not unlike the milquetoast showdown in Swingers. It uses hand-held cameras and lots of improvised dialog, two techniques that seem to put a lot of people off. Personally, I enjoy the delivery and timing of the performers enough that I expect I'll be willing to watch it back again and again, indefinitely.",What We Do in the Shadows
53,alansabljakovic-39044,Best vampire movie ever,9,19 October 2019,Best comedy of 21st century for sure. Almost all the jokes landed so well and it was hillarious. I love Waititi's humour and can't wait for Jojo Rabbit.,What We Do in the Shadows
54,Seraphion,"Entertaining, even with some dry humour",7,4 February 2015,"The movie tells the daily lifeerrunlife of flatmate vampires Viago, Vladislav, Deacon and Petyr in New Zealand. Viago is the 16th century vampire, aristocratic and bossy often times. Vladislav is the medieval vampire, a noble vampire but also the most ruthless killer of them. Deacon is the youngest changed vampire from the World War II era, often acting out living like a bum in the flat. The last of them, Petyr, is the oldest of them, aging about 8000 years old. They live their everyday lives n the flat, still influenced by the cultures from their own times. The trio Viago, Vladislav and Deacon sometimes go out to the town and hang out. Deacon has a human familiar Jackie who does most of the blood cleaning related housework in the flat. She also lure in victims for the vampires. Deacon has promised vampirehood to Jackie but hasn't turned her yet. One night Jackie brings a couple Nick and Josephine as victims. Nick gets his blood drained by Petyr but he also turns him into a vampire. And then there were four. Nick brings in new cultural color to the group. Soon He brings his friend Stu, an IT guy, to the group. Stu introduces the modern information technology to the group and becomes a good friend to them. For this, and because he's Nick's best friend, the group form a pact not to eat Stu. Besides inviting Stu into the group, Nick is quite irresponsible of his newly gained vampirehood. He has been carelessly telling just about anybody that he's a vampire, even showing some of his abilities to complete human strangers. One day, a vampire hunter comes to the flat's basement, Petyr's lair. Petyr easily kills the hunter but he dies of sunlight. The group blames Nick for this and banishes him from the flat. Alas, the night for the Unholy Masquerade comes. The masquerade is the once a year night where New Zealand's undead community comes and mingles together. Vladislav doesn't go for knowing his nemesis is the event's guest of honor. Viago and Deacon go there and find that Jackie has been turned by Nick. They also bring Stu there, still human. Soon the masquerade guests find out that Stu is human and they get eager to eat him. The group manages to get Stu out safely but on their way home they meet their nemesis werewolf pack who are transforming since it's a full moon night. They eventually attack Stu and mangle his body. But it turns out that the attack turns Stu into a werewolf and that make the vampires and the werewolfs to be friends.The story is quite nice in overall. Focusing on the age old human fascination about the pseudo-immortal undead of vampires, the movie presents a very light mood about what used to be a strictly horror plot base. It nicely imagines the daily, or should I say nightly, consequences of a vampire's life of staying alive in the modern world. This is done by incorporating contemporary culture and customs such as flat sharing, hang outs, and the social internet critically into the story as plot defining elements, even though weaker ones.But the story also did justice to connect older vampire movies and the general myths about vampires by staying true to the main attributes of the vampires. Minus the garlic thing, this movie incorporates plot defining myths about the vampiric abilities, blood drinking, 'let me in' catch, silver, and the crucifix effect. What's good is that the movie doesn't add any more imbalanced super powers to the vampires. No offense to all of you Twilight Saga fanatics, but for me a vampire based story is already maximum without having to have superhero powers. When I see vampire movies, I really want to see vampires, not blood sucking X-Men wannabes. For that, I think that this movie, and Only Lovers Left Alive (2013), are great example of vampire movies that aren't predominantly horror but still also have the frightening side of vampires.Though they often feel dry, the humor nicely incorporates the vampire myths into it. I kind of like how they put in the silver, the 'let me in' catch and the hypnosis into the story. A funny surprise even comes in a post-credits scene for this. Yet again I feel that although most of the jokes are interesting, they don't really crack big laughs from me.For me the acting overall is not very good. I see a lot of overacting here and there by the three main characters, and 'under-acting' by the rest of the cast. But then again, I think that this movie's real interesting point is not the acting or the comedy, but instead the story and how the story mixes everyday modern life with the vampire condition.For me What We do In the Shadows (2014) feels like it deserves a humble 7 out of 10 score and a recommendation to go and see in the cinemas. It's mild and very entertaining. After the wave of Twilight Saga, I think this movie can put back the older vampire myths into the general understanding consensus.",What We Do in the Shadows
55,invisibleunicornninja,Funny as hell.,8,1 March 2018,"This movie is pretty funny, which is the main thing that its got going for it. I greatly enjoyed it. If you are planning to watch it, don't forget to stay around until the very end to see the end-credits scene. The rest of this review is going to be broken up into parts so that you can see where I stand on each element of it. Effects - The effects were pretty bad for the most part, though I did think that the flying looked decent. There is a scene with werewolves, and the costumes are terrible. However, the smart decision to keep them out-of-focus and in the dark for as long as possible was made and it didn't take away from the scene to much when the camera focused long enough to show the audience the embarrassing suits. Cinematography - This movie gets a bit of a pass as its style is that of a mockumentary. There are a few scenes where the cameraman moves a bit faster than he should to get lots of different angles. You could say that there are more than one cameramen (which there are) but they would've been visible in the other shots. It took me out of the movie a bit since the only way to achieve the effect they got is by having the cameraman move around between takes to film a scene in real time from multiple angles. If the cameramen were a bit more visible, the documentary-style presentation would've been a bit more believable. Ignoring that, its actually shot and put together very well (ignoring the bad CGI).Audio - There are some bits where characters are cleaning their shirts and you can hear the sound of something brushing a mike, implying that the vampires have mikes. The audio quality is pretty good throughout the whole movie, but where is seems to be coming form is a bit inconsistent. At no point can you see mikes on the characters, and there's never any mention of them. Its a bit odd. Not the worst thing ever, but it kinda bugged me. Comedy - Comedy is a bit subjective. Everyone finds different things funny. I though that this was a funny movie. I liked the situations, I thought the punchlines were well-delivered. Overall I was laughing throughout the whole thing. The Plot - There is a plot. Its not the greatest plot, sure, but it is coherent. Its a bit loose and simple, but it works well in a movie heavily reliant on gags. The plot is mostly just the life of a few characters over what seems to be the course of about a year. Its funny and entertaining and isn't trying to be something that its not. The Characters - Not all the characters have as much development as they could've had in this short movie, but the performances are good and they all play off of each other making the jokes work. This was not my favorite movie of all time, but I enjoyed it and would recommend it. This is a movie worth watching. Though its short, you're sure to enjoy the time it takes to watch - provided that this is the type of humor you enjoy. If not, I don't know what to tell you.",What We Do in the Shadows
56,brando647,Hilarious Mockumentary on the New Zealand Undead Scene,9,14 March 2016,"Who doesn't live a good mockumentary? Plenty of people, I suppose, but I'm not here on their behalf and I enjoy them. WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS comes from Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement and is presented as a sort of undead version of MTV's ""The Real World"". A team of documentarians, wearing crucifixes and given the solemn promise that none of them would be eaten, enters the New Zealand flat of four vampires to give perspective on their day-to-day lives, culminating in an annual gathering of the local undead chapters (including witches and zombies) to celebrate the Unholy Masquerade. As the film opens, we are introduced to its subjects: Viago (Waititi), Vladislav (Clement), Deacon (Jonny Brugh), and Petyr (Ben Fransham) a group of friendly vampires whose lives span multiple centuries. We join them as they handle chore distribution, engage in the local Wellington nightlife, feed on the unsuspecting populace, and harass the local werewolves. They appear to have a pretty good handle on things until one of their intended meals escapes and returns months later to reveal that, thanks to an overzealous Petyr, he's been turned into a vampire. Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) forms an uneasy friendship with the flatmates, primarily because his human friend Stu (Stu Rutherford) is a pretty cool guy, but he's having a hard time grasping the subtleties of being undead and his boisterous nature brings a world of trouble for this group of bloodsuckers who are just trying to live peaceful lives as ancient vampires in a modern world.Personally, I found this movie to be loads of fun and have enormous replay value. I've seen it a few times now and I laugh just as hard each time. I'll admit, I get some extra enjoyment from the film because a few of my friends are in to vampire LARPing (live-action roleplay) and I can't help but think of them every time. WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS has fun with all of the classic vampire clichés we've come to expect since the time of Dracula. We've grown so accustomed to vampires (in movies, anyhow) being cool, sexy, and flawless but this movie gives us a much more flawed, realistic approach. Why should vampirism automatically make someone supernaturally cool? Viago is a nineteenth-century dandy with an effeminate nature and a frustration over how his flatmates can't be bothered to lay towels down when draining their victims on his furniture. With the exception of Petyr (a traditional Nosferatu living in the basement), Vlad is the eldest vampire and obviously based more on the Dracula lore. He once prided himself on his shape-shifting abilities but he's been out of practice since a humiliating defeat at the hands of his arch-nemesis long ago. And then Deacon, while not as old as Vlad or (I believe) as young as Viago, seems to the have the more modern sensibilities. He's an unabashed slob, failing to complete his chores and often shoveling them off onto his poor familiar Jackie (Jackie van Beek) while dragging her along with promises of immortality.From everything I've seen and read from behind the scenes, most of WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS was improvised by the cast with a skeletal script just to give the story some structure. As much as I enjoy the films of Judd Apatow and his circle, compare them to what was accomplished here. This film is riotously funny from the opening moments with Viago's alarm going off at 6PM with hardly a moment over the entire 90 minutes that let's up the pace. And it was mostly accomplished on-set, in front of the cameras, with the cast riffing off one another. I love that. I love that the effects are cheap but charmingly so. When these guys fly, it's clumsy. Not necessarily because the characters can't control their flight but because the actors are lifted on wires and it's hard to control and they roll with it. Viago and Deacon get into a heated argument in the flat meeting at the beginning of the movie and launch into the air to get in each other's faces; just watch how sloppy Viago's landing is when he returns to his seat. It's little bits like that that give me added enjoyment. WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is one of the funniest movies of 2015 and I wish it had gotten more attention so we could ensure these guys return for more of their off-kilter brand of humor. Big recommend from me.",What We Do in the Shadows
57,begob,Nice one,7,6 January 2015,"A bit gentle in the first half, when the vampires might as well be a gang of goths. The funniest bits were the fight over the dishes and the werewolf hassle. After that the vampire powers kick off and it's consistently good with lovable characters. The fight scenes reminded me of the karate in Team America, and the scenes with the police made me crack up.Pity the slave doesn't have a bigger part - maybe an extended interview broken up through the narrative. Reminded me of a Catherine Tate character (airport arrivals in a Burke). Plus I'd love a scene where social welfare call around to interrogate them about their income - incompetence with money is always good for laughs (though terribly sad, of course).Love the Balkan brass - homage to Bulgarian Chicks?

58,bkrauser-81-311064,Dracula: Kiwi Comedy Style,8,1 June 2015,"Vampires, like most Gothic horror monsters have gotten a very infamous reputation. A reputation which has lasted over a millennia. They have been pegged as evil, blood-thirsty villains; soiling the innocence of all who become victim to their blood-lust. What's worse is within the last two decades their standing has changed to much more humiliating status; that of the romantic lead. Yes, we can all agree Twilight (2008) was a blight on the world but you can't deny the YA series' made an impact. Plus there were the better received True Blood (2008-2014) and Vampire Diaries (2009-now) which, for better or for worse, reformed Dracula's personal image. Between misanthropic movie monster and hunky boyfriend of the undead, is there maybe a better, more sympathetic portrayal out there for the besieged blood- sucker?What We Do in the Shadows involves the semi-normal life of four vampires who have made New Zealand their new home. In-between feedings, Viago (Waititi), Vladislav (Clement), Deacon (Brough) and Petyr (Fransham) have to deal with the common trials of being flatmates. Such trials include dividing up the chores via chore wheel, juggling their active social lives and avoiding run- ins with vampire slayers, local werewolves and a mysterious creature known only as ""The Beast"". Their biggest obstacle is modernizing to the 21st century, a task that is helped by new friends who tip the balance of their creepy, decrepit home.Co-written by half of Flight of the Conchords and given a mockumentary style, What We Do in the Shadows is the funniest movie you're likely to see this year. It's bolstered by goofy, self-deprecating performances and cheap yet seamless special-effects. Special mention should be given to Waititi's fussy performance as an Interview with a Vampire (1994) knock-off with an Eastern European accent. He becomes the center and voice of reason amid a growing group of rowdy undead friends and despite having the straight-man role, his nit-picking most often had me at medium giggle. The belly laughs however came from Clements's Vlad, designed to look like Dracula circa 1992. His one-liners showed a depth of skill when it comes to improvisation which hasn't seen a screen near me since Flight of the Conchords (2007-2009) ended its run on HBO. As far as mockumentary, What We Do in the Shadows matches This is Spinal Tap (1984) and Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999) chuckle by chuckle, perhaps more so.Along with being incredibly rich territory for situation-comedy, What We Do in the Shadows brings up some grounded if unconsidered questions about living with eternity. We all get older so we naturally struggle to keep up with the ""next big thing,"" so what happens when a three-hundred-year-old man attempts to enter Wellington's most popular club dressed like an 18th century dandy? What happens the first time they use a cellphone or a computer? These aren't the chiseled, pristine vampires of Twilight; no these guys can't even use a mirror and are forced to draw each other to conceive what they look like. There's no way these guys have the sensibilities to make it in today's world. At least not without a lot of help and hilarity.As with all movies that adapt the mockumentary format, there are some drawbacks. There's some pretty cheap production design here and due to the subject matter most scenes are shot at night (duh!). This kind of budget is not helped by a flat aspect ratio and single-setup, point-and-shoot-type camera work. Thankfully there are enough consistently funny gags that keep the film light on its feet even if the supposed documentary crew are not.What We Do in the Shadows may not help vampires reclaim the staple horror movie villain image we grew up with and took for granted. I personally yearn for Nosferatu to jump out of the shadows and give the floozies of True Blood a run for their money. I suppose all things must go through reinvention and renewal. Modernizing overall is a positive force is it not? If for no other reason than we get fun little experiments like this Kiwi comedy classic.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",What We Do in the Shadows

It adapts the mockumentary style of This Is Spinal Tap, one that now feels like it belongs on TV with The Office and Modern Family, but it breaks the bounds of the small screen with supernatural moments and entertaining wire tricks. The backbone is the humour, the way it approaches these dark things in such a blase way with its endearing network of characters. Sometimes it does get a little too silly or a payoff is predictable, but it's coming so thick and fast that it's briskly redeemed. It's the eye for storytelling and eventual thoughtful heart, where it discusses life, love and death, that boost it above being a typical midnight comedy. One of the funniest and most rewarding films of the year that shows how vampires aren't finished yet.8/10",What We Do in the Shadows

63,punishmentpark,A peculiar one.,7,15 November 2015,"This is a peculiar one, the second one I saw in a recent TV Halloween marathon, and one I've been curious for for a while. The concept is a mix of two familiar elements: vampires and mockumentary. I don't think it's ever been done before, but more important is the question whether or not it works?Well, it did, actually. Taika Watiti (one the two directors) plays a very particular, rather sensitive character that somehow got a little on my nerves. The rest of the characters were pretty cool, though, and coming up with a new member and confrontations with the werewolves were some nice additions. Maybe a thorough storyline is a little absent - as it simply seems to be one long string of incidents - but that didn't bother me much.The gore and special effects were very neatly done, even if they took a backseat to the comedic elements.A good 7 out of 10.",What We Do in the Shadows
64,pyrocitor,"Vampires, not tramp-ires",9,8 January 2017,"In search of the final nail in the coffin of the sordid cultural relevance of Edward and Bella? Look no further than the supremely delightful What We Do in the Shadows. Here, newbie vampire Nick drunkenly parades himself through the streets of Wellington, braying ""I AM TWILIGHT"" as a pick up line, only to be greeted with blank looks of vague derision. It's pristine satire - gently but insistently raucous, and playing more off of Nick's incredulous 'Isn't this cool anymore' expression than the gag itself. And the best bit? It's only one of a nearly nonstop smorgasbord of sneakily clever, deliciously quotable gags the film offers. If Shaun of the Dead's 'rom-zom-com' infused the zombie horror genre with a much- needed surge of frantic humour and schlubby humanity, What We Do in the Shadows blends vampires, who have already been subjected to oodles of daft action and risible romance, with The Office's mockumentary deadpan and a thoroughly New Zealand 'no bullsh*t' ethos, to similarly sterling effect. Co-director/stars Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi may thrive in 'chortle-funny' rather than the deep belly-laugh kind, but the chortles come so incessantly and raucously, they provide just as much of an ab workout. When you finally acclimatize to the spry wordplay, (""we are werewolves, not swear-wolves!""), lovingly integrated pokes at other vampire lore (including the bad etiquette of attending a vampire costume ball dressed as Blade, despite the fact that apparently ""Vampires love Wesley Snipes!""), and faux-historical interludes (apparently Naziism was just as controversial within vampire circles), you think you might find rest. But it's only moments before you're blindsided again by interludes involving a pair of impossibly stupid police officers, or laughs as unobtrusive as a cutaway to Waititi playing a mournful trumpet. The film is nonstop, evidencing a breezy, cheerful humour that is too earnest not to love. It helps that Waititi and Clement wear their hearts on their sleeves, with an uncanny ability to tease out the silliness in vampire lore while still committing to the emotion at the heart of it. There's an undercurrent of deep, anachronistic loneliness imbued in the film's leading trio of bloodsuckers, which somehow makes their interludes of squabbling over the (five years) overdue dishes, or forlornly learning how to use Facebook all the funnier in their sweetness. Similarly, in this realm of immortal horror monsters, death comes fast, furious, and with unapologetic bluntness, and the cheerful interjections of staggering bloodiness that sprinkle throughout the film (sometimes quite inconveniently getting all over the furniture), or omnipresent threat of the documentary crew getting devoured, keep the fun appropriately gruesome throughout. In terms of cohesiveness, there's no question that the film is unapologetically episodic, like a prolonged sitcom episode or beefed up SNL sketch, but Waititi and Clement keep things nimble enough to keep the joke from wearing thin, before calling it quits with a chipper non-climax that's so nonchalant, it's only retroactively that it feels like it delivers the loose resolution you'd hope for. And, honestly, material this hilarious earns all of the clumsy non-sequiturs it can muster. Still, the film's ruthless silliness and sweetness consolidate into the perfect cocktail (presumably a blood-tini) in the hands of the effortlessly funny cast. As the ageless, effete dandy and tentative moral compass of the group, Waititi himself is massively adorable, pairing bug-eyed cheeriness with a cartoon Dr. Strangelove accent to tremendous effect. Similarly, Clement commits his post-Concords star power perfectly towards the enormous presence of his larger-than-life, crestfallenly ineffectual Vlad the Impaler. Jonny Brugh's scene-chewing rock star arrogance is all the funnier once paired with the clueless boorishness of Cori Gonzalez-Macuer or the indignantly neurotic Jackie van Beek as scene partners. Finally, Stuart Rutherford redefines the potential of the comedic deadpan as impossibly unflappably software analyst (and very human) Stu,* while Rhys Darby (don't call him Murray) is as reliably hilarious as ever, cameoing as an exasperated werewolf. Thoroughly sweet, disarmingly sad, cheerfully bloody, and infectiously watchable, What We Do in the Shadows proves one of a preciously slim caste of horror spoofs with genuine wings. While it's inevitably prime material to be gobbled up by Flight of the Conchords converts, it's also accessibly goofy enough to stand alone as one of the most unobtrusively funny sleeper hit comedies of the past several years. Just be cautious not to falsely publicize the film amidst the lingering forces of Twihards, or risk incurring Clement and Waititi intoning that these are vampires, not tramp-ires.

It rides on the great actors, but also on a wonderful script and an ingenious mix of wobbly ""porno camera"" and perfectly placed special effects.

71,one9eighty,We drink virgin blood because it sounds cool.,7,5 October 2020,"Released in 2014, this comedy horror film is fly-on-the-wall mockumentary following the exploits of 4 modern day vampires living together as flatmates in the New Zealand town of Wellington. It was released fairly 'under the radar' but went on to receive lots of world-wide praise for how original and funny it is.Brief Summary:
Four vampires living in New Zealand going about their day-to-day life.Detailed Summary:
Viago, Deacon, Vladislav and Petyr are vampiric housemates who live together in New Zealand. They live fairly normal and mundane lives, doing chores, paying rent, and occasionally going out to nightclubs. One night, one of their meals is not killed properly and is turned into a vampire too. Nick, a modern twenty-something year old, is irresponsible of his new vampiric powers and goes as far as inviting his human friend into the arrangement, a bit of a no-no in the world of the undead. As events develop the vampire friends have to deal with their life while working with the new circumstances that have arisen.Film Stuff:
Directed, written, and starring Jermaine Clement and Taika Waititi this 2014 film is more a labour of love and art, rather than a piece of work that was meant to be a blockbuster smash. Made with a budget of around $1.6 million this 86 minute film went on to gross $7 million at the global box office, so it's not necessarily just a bit of a laugh, some serious work went into this to make it a success. The concept of the film was developed using a short film in 2005 (""What we do in the Shadows: Interviews with some Vampires"") as a litmus test. Music in this film comes from Plan 9, with Russian rock band Leningrad providing a song for the trailer and the end credits. The success of the film led to various spin-off TV series; in New Zealand ""Wellington Paranormal"", and TV series with the films title in the USA and UK. With some excellent, low-budget effects, fun make-up and costumes this is film really has a unique look and feel.Cast:
At the top of the billing are Jemaine Clement and Taiki Waititi as Vladislav ""The Poker"" (based on Gary Oldman's performance in ""Bram Stokers Dracula"", and Viago ""The Dandy"" (based on Louis de Pointe du Lac from ""Interview with a Vampire"" - both are hilarious in their respective roles. They really lead the cast well and drive the film forward smartly. The bad boy of the group is Deacon (Jonny Brugh) who plays a great role as the ex-Nazi vampire experiment (based on David from ""The Lost Boys""). Ben Fransham plays the dark horse of the group, Petyr (based on Count Orlok from ""Nosferatu""), a character that is hundred of years old and easily the old man of the group and therefor the least human of the group. Nick and Stu (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer and Stu Rutherford) are the newcomers to the nest and do well (Nick being reminiscent of Edward from ""Twilight""). Rhys Darby pops up leading a pack of Werewolves, he is good light relief to the seriousness of the Vampire chronicles. There are also plenty of other great performances in the film from other Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies and even the living humans too.Wrap-up
I enjoyed this original mockumentary film and had a good laugh throughout. It is not a lengthy film and combined with some good editing this film never feels like it is dragging. There is a fun look and feel to the film which I really enjoyed. The effects were wobbly and shaky and worked well - lots of fake blood plenty of high wire flying. At times, the humour is laugh out loud ridiculous, while other times it is absolutely sterile deadpan; both of which suit the film really well. The film does not take itself too seriously at all and provides some good nostalgia to fans of vampire and supernatural films. Expect to see references to ""Nosferatu"", ""The Lost Boys"", ""Twilight"", ""Dracula"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Blade"", ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", and so many more horror and supernatural staples of film. I read a review describing this film as the ""Spinal Tap"" of the vampire documentary films and that is quite an apt description. It is ""The Office"" meets ""Flight of the Conchords"" meets ""Being Human"" and most importantly, it is a damn fine film.Go into this with no expectations and you will be delights. It is probably not a family film despite its 15-rating due to the graphic nature of some of the horror - even though it is hilarious. Fresh, funny, strange but entertaining, this film is sure to be cult film for many years to come.",What We Do in the Shadows
72,meddlecore,Hilarious With Lot's Of Great Gimmicks,7,4 October 2015,"What We Do In The Shadows is a downright hilarious Kiwi mockumentary horror-comedy about 4 vampires- Deacon, Vlad, Viago & Peter- who are flatting together after having immigrated to New Zealand.The life of a Kiwi Vampire consists of getting invited into bars, feasting on locals (preferably virgins), taking on human slaves (familiars) to do your bidding, going to masquerade balls (with other vampires, witches & zombies), and- of course- getting into street fights with the local gang of werewolves.Deacon is sort of the unofficial leader of the group. He keeps everyone in line and drags everyone out to different events. His still pangs for the love of his life- Katharine- whom he came to New Zealand for, only to find she was taken and happy. Seeing how happy she was, he decided not to turn her and let her live her life. She's now 90, but he still digs her.Viago- played by director Taika Waititi- is the youngest of the four. A rebel of sorts. He has a familiar named Jackie who does everything for the guys. She expects to be turned as repayment for her loyalty- but Viago keeps putting it off.Vlad- played by director Jemaine Clement- is the most infamous of the group. Renown in legend for his torturous ways (which he has since grown out of). His ex-girlfriend- The Beast- is his nemesis.Peter is the oldest of the group. They can't control him, so they keep him locked in a room in the basement. Unlike the others- who have retained their human images- Peter is rocking the traditional Nosferatu look. He enjoys turning people. He even turned Viago.At one point, the guys get Jackie to round them up some virgins for a dinner party: ""I think we virgin drink blood because...it sounds cool."" - Viago ""If you were going to enjoy a sandwich. You will just enjoy it more if you know no one has f*cked it."" - VladThe loyal servant that she is, Jackie lures her childhood sweetheart Nick, and an old school chum, over for a ""dinner party"" at the den.But before the guys can feast on Nick, he manages to escape- only to be caught by Peter, who turns him.Newly turned Nick keeps pissing everyone off, as he won't stop flying around the neighbours and telling everybody he's a vampire.While out doing this, he accidentally reveals himself to a vampire hunter- who follows them home and kills Peter (before being slain himself).For this transgression, Nick gets banished from the den...but his best human friend Stu is still allowed to stick around, because all the guys like him (and have collectively agreed not to kill him).More trouble arises when Nick brings Stu to the annual Vampire, Witch & Zombie masquerade ball. All the other attendees can sense his humanness and want to feast on him. Forcing the group of guys to flee.On their way home, they happen upon a local pack of PC werewolves who are trying to chain themselves to trees before they turn during the full moon. However, a full scale battle breaks out, during which the werewolves seize Stu from the guys.The werewolves don't eat Stu though. They turn him- out of spite for the vampire counterparts. But Stu acts as a conciliatory force, and bridges the gap between the werewolves and vampires- rendering them friends in the end (even if there is still some tension there).It's great to see the Kiwi's keeping their mockumentary tradition- established by Peter Jackson with Forgotten Silver- alive. This film is absolutely hilarious. It's chock full of clever gimmicks, great special effects (on a budget) and just the right amount of gore (nothing too over the top). There are some great quotes in there too (like noted above).What We Do In The Shadows premiered at TIFF last year and deservingly took home the Midnight Madness prize (as the fan favourite Midnight Madness screening).

After searching for the title of the program I found it to be a US program made from the original film of the same name made in New Zealand.Sitting watching the film again the dry dark humour appealed.Basically a TV documentary crew are documenting the life of a group of vampires who live together and their lives, loves, victims and friends.Gets pretty surreal at times with the vampires trying to live in modern day social, like trying to get ready to go out on the town.Personally I just loved the whole idea and found this very original film to be a scream and am now watching the TV series.Bloody in places (they are vampires) swearing but definitely dry, dark and funny.Rating 8 out of 10",What We Do in the Shadows

79,anselmdaniel,Excellent comedic mockumentary,8,25 April 2020,"This review contains spoilers.What We Do in the Shadows is a mockumentary comedy movie that premiered in 2014. The movie is directed and written by Jemaine Clement, Taika Waititi. The movie stars Taika Waititi, Jemaine Clement, Jonathan Brugh, and Ben Fransham. The is about a documentary crew that follows four vampires inside of a house. The movie follows the four vampires as they have nightly adventures in Wellington, New Zealand.What We Do in the Shadows is an excellent comedy movie. The movie is similar to other mockumentaries such as The Office which follows the characters around. The vampire characters of Viago, Vladislav, Deacon, and Petyr are incredibly hilarious as they have many misadventures across Wellington. The movie does incredibly well in making the audience care about these characters and the events that occur to them. The movie does not have much a plot much like other mockumentaries and instead has the audience become invested in the characters to tell the story.The characters are easily the best part of this movie. The side characters and main characters are all played well by the actors and actresses and they have great moments. One of the characters, Nick, is inadvertently turned into a vampire and becomes a character the audience can use to follow how the vampires undergo their rituals. This moment is incredibly funny as Nick has to explore vampirism. In addition, the usage of the vampire powers is played to great comedic effect as the movie plays up the ignorance of humans.The primary problem with the movie is that overall it does meander. There is no grand story arc in this movie. The movie feels more like an elevated television show however this is not a detractment if the audience knows what they want. The trailers for this movie were not misleading and never hinted at a large story. The movie is a simple story focusing on the vampiric characters.I would recommend 'What We Do in the Shadows'.

I have enough to do them myself. But it is that the actors are very bad and the effects, better nor we speak, can not be worse.

82,Horror-yo,Pretty darn good The Office meets Vampires,8,22 February 2017,"I think it's all there in the title. Lots of people are going way overboard with overwhelmed appreciation, most likely they didn't expect this to be any good really and got surprised, so this is definitely not a masterpiece but it's really very solid throughout.I've heard the criticism ""lack of plot"". This is clearly one of the strong points, if anything, of the film. There's lots of content, but not much story at all, so the film does superbly well at pace, and one thing it definitely nails which was tough was not being boring about an hour in. Lots of films are funny as a narrative written down on paper, and lots of fun during the first half an hour, but then becomes immensely silly and untenable as a full length film. This doesn't do that. At all. At no point does one feel he just 'gets it' and wants to move on to something else, it keeps it funny and interesting til the end.Humor wise, it's actually pretty funny. It avoids being the graphic horror kind, you can actually laugh if you don't like horror at all so it's not being self-indulgent or a generic homer (or a cultural homer, people completely uninitiated to Oceanic/kiwi culture, who just speak English, can get it just fine).The characters are good, and pretty darn well acted out. You'd really think the actors were East-European, but none of that.Funniest scene for me was the cops under the spell inspecting the premises.One last thing: in many specific places, with particular quotes or in general as a global metaphor, the film does well, subtly, at recognizing and establishing this world of vampires and werewolves etc...isn't all that different from the world of us humans in many respects.7.5 or sympathy 8/10.",What We Do in the Shadows
83,TheSquiss,Vampire mocumentary that is less funny than intended. Spinal Tap this is not!,4,3 December 2014,"From the team behind the hugely successful Flight of the Conchords and the fabulous indie hit, Eagle Vs Shark, What We Do in the Shadows is a comedy horror mockumentary with 'hilarious' stamped all the way through it.Except it isn't. Hilarious, that is.Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi write, direct, produce and perform in this spoof documentary about a group of vampire flatmates trying to deal with life in modern times and each other's annoying traits. Being immortal and hundreds of years old does not iron out the problems of who takes care of which chores in any given week. Nor, it appears, does being several centuries old help one iota when it comes to deciding what to wear to the nightclub.There is plenty to like on display: the costumes are fabulously camp, there are references aplenty to the great vampires of film and literature, the sets are fun and there are one or two lovely, practical effects that splatter blood, but nothing too horrific or likely to raise the pulse.There are even a couple of surprising, and very welcome digital effects thrown in. What We Do in the Shadows feels cheap and it's a surprise when the budget allows for something extra.But it isn't enough. The performances are adequate but it all feels a little too much like college kids playing at drama. Forget pastiche, this is weak parody and there is little skill in it here. Clement, as Vladislav, is amusingly gauche in his 'god's gift to women' act, but Waititi, as Viago, appears to have bought his performance, or at least his grin, from Danny John-Jules' Red Dwarf jumble sale. In terms of performances, the greatest joy comes from the deadpan, detachment of Stu (Stuart Rutherford) and Ben Fransham's Petyr, the bastard son of Nosferatu, whose dialogue would probably fit on the back of his fangs.Alas, there is a distinct lack of strong female roles on display here, with the women reduced to comedy fodder bit parts. When they appear, they are amusing, but perhaps What We Do in the Shadows could have benefited from a matriarchal touch.For years Christopher Guest has delighted audiences with mockumentaries like Best in Show, A Mighty Wind and the peerless This is Spinal Tap, and my guess is this this is what Clement and Waititi were aiming for. The trouble is, where Guest played it straight, they work too damn hard at eking out laughs at every turn. Heck, this is nowhere near as funny as Anvil: The Story of Anvil, and that wasn't even a spoof! Whilst not a flop by any means, What We Do in the Shadows was clearly far more amusing to make than it was to watch and the final, post-credit, line is sadly prophetic, and not for the reason they intend.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",What We Do in the Shadows
84,RevRonster,"Great, great, great comedy!",10,11 August 2015,"Very simple but extremely creative sums up ""What We Do in the Shadows"" pretty well. That and extremely funny! In the wrong hands, this film could have been a complete mess but with it being written, directed and starring Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi and having an incredible cast right there with them, the film proved to be a wickedly entertaining feature with tons of laughs throughout the entire run. Everything about this film was awesome to me. The costumes looked great, the makeup was cool, the sets looked excellent, the jokes are top notch stuff, the characters are fun and the acting is fantastic! There was nothing about this film that didn't work for me and it made for a film with a very high replay value.",What We Do in the Shadows

None of the ideas are truly original and it does run low on ideas towards the end, but it's still a fun and fresh take on vampires.",What We Do in the Shadows

Awesome!!,8,24 February 2015,"When I read the logline I thought it was going to be a serious movie, but when I saw the poster I realized it was a comedy. All the reviews on the posters said it was hilarious and they were so rightA New Zealand film crew films a documentary about a group of vampires who live in a flat together. Each vampire takes on a popular stereotype of the vampire (like Pete the oldest of the group who looks like Nestratu), but mostly they all fell under Eastern European Archetype.The movie mocked the day to day life of these old country style vampires attempting to live in the modern world, going out to parties, trying to find ladies (mostly to kill). The simpleness of their lives was absolutely hysterical.It's been a long time since I've seen the classic style of the vampire on the big screen. Though it was done for laughs if you're a horror purist you'll get a kick out of watching these guys be stylish when you can't see yourself in the mirror, or the day to day task being of a modern day familiar. And I hear it was a Kickstarter founded film. Equally as funny as Flight of the Concords, and one of the best mockumentaries I've seen.",What We Do in the Shadows

88,ArchonCinemaReviews,They're just some wild and craaaazy guys,8,13 February 2015,"Armed with crosses, a documentary crew follows the lives of three bachelor roommates in What We Do in the Shadows.Viago, Deacon and Vladislav are just normal guys trying to enjoy life, you know: going to the club, bringing ladies home, dealing with roommate issues and of course, staying out of the sunlight. Oh yeah, did we mention What We Do in the Shadows is a vampire movie? Before you stop listening at 'vampire' – you really should hear this film out! Mockumentary styled What We Do in the Shadows is a perfect combination of dry observational humor, a smart screenplay and an original idea. The plot of the film is following the lives of these three wild and crazy guys but it is the way writers Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi approach the movie that distinguishes itself as exceptionally hilarious.Having caught my attention awhile back when I first heard of the film – I knew it was a must watch for me when What We Do in the Shadows became slated for US distribution. What We Do in the Shadows is too funny for its own good. You know when something funny happens and then you go to explain it and the joke falls flat? That's what happens if you try to describe What We Do in the Shadows – it's one of those films that needs to be experienced to be appreciated completely. Everything about it should be foolishly absurd to the point of being off-putting – but somehow everything about it works.The jokes are constant and refreshingly smart, with not a crude joke in sight. The awareness of the genre and satire of classical vampire culture and society in general is top notch. The star of the film was easily the character portrayed by Taika Waititi –without whom the film probably would have been a bit too dry. If you like The Office and similarly irreverent humor, then What We Do in the Shadows is probably for you.Please check out our WEBSITE for all the REVIEWS of recent releases!",What We Do in the Shadows

90,avik-basu1889,Rock n' Roll Mockumentary with Vampires !!!!,9,3 March 2015,"This mockumentary has got Spinal Tap written all over it and in a good way. The film shows us the lifestyle of a few vampires who share a flat and it shows us how they lead their nocturnal lives and how they survive. The characters are all very sweet and likable, even though kill and drink human blood to survive. The film and the directors love these characters and that love permeates through the film in each scene. The vampires come off as naive, adorable and sometimes arrogant (like rockstars) individuals who struggle to cope with changing times of the dynamic human society. The film also has enough blood and gore for the fans who like their vampire films to be gruesome.The acting from all parties involved is brilliant. The direction and screenplay is good. The film has the typical dry, quirky British humour (although it is from New Zealand) that I like and it is a thousand times better than most loud,raunchy American comedies that get released nowadays. The storyline is simple, but the brilliance of the writing and the screenplay keeps the viewer engaged throughout the film.The film might not go up to 11, but it is still ""bloody"" great (the pun was intended).",What We Do in the Shadows
91,david-meldrum,A sign of great things to come ... flawed but funny,7,29 March 2019,"I'm late to this party, and seeing it for the first time in 2019 it's easy to see the seeds of what led Taika Waititito get the Marvel gig (and execute it so brilliantly). Amongst all (sub) genres, comedy-horror is one of the hardest to get right; the film needs to be both a proper comedy and also a proper horror movie to really work, and take both genres at face-value. Shaun Of The Dead executes this near flawlessly; What We Do In The Shadows does well, but not quite enough for me. The documentary format - whilst a good joke - means it leans more on the comedy, and hence isn't really horror enough. The horror elements play almost as Hammer at its worst, which may or may not be intentional, but distracts from the nuanced performances. Some of the gags are brilliant - the verbal comedy, the physical, the nods to other films and especially the good natured, self aware fun with the rules and tropes of vampirism. Occasionally it hints towards bigger themes - homophobia, for instance. That would be a good fit; vampire stories are almost always about sex or sexuality in some way. The 'coming out' scene is inspired; the scenes of bullying in the street both funny and moving. But the theme never quite takes the theme far enough; it feels like one of a bunch of ideas thrown at the wall until something sticks. The film lacks an ultimate emotional punch for which it strives, and I'm left with the feeling that the newly-launching spin-off TV series might be the best format for this. It's good, of course, and has much re-watch value and quotability ... but the director had better ahead of him.",What We Do in the Shadows
92,peefyn,"Vampires, ""the new guy"", sharing a flat and coming to terms with change.",7,20 May 2015,"I love how everyone, not only the main characters, are so naive and clumsy. It's the same with Flight of the Conchords (the TV-show). People blindly accept almost everything being said to them, and even in extreme situations they react with confusion or awkwardness. I think this is what makes the Clement's comedy work, but it required that the audience is willing to accept these unrealistic responses to the crazy scenarios.The movie plays around with tropes from the vampire setting, and puts it up against the ""living together""-situation which was also used in Flight of the Conchords. This combination is really odd, but they make it work. The storyline is something like: ""A new, young guy becomes part of the group, which leads to complications"" - but that's all these guys need to make a funny movie.If anything, the movie could have had a bit more on the line for these characters, if only for the potential for more comedy. There is also a (kind of) serious moment where one character reflects on immortality, and it worked well enough that the movie could have had more of this without losing its comedic charm.Oh, and Stu seems like a great guy,",What We Do in the Shadows

It is so refreshing to see a movie of this type that simply refuses to take itself seriously. I think I so enjoyed this because I had not seen any trailer, advertisements, or hype about this movie. Face it, most movies whose trailer runs for, oh, six months or so, usually wind up not being worth a dime. In fact, the best parts of the movie are usually found in the trailer.""What We Do in the Shadows"" is a story about very old vampires trying to adapt to the new day. When it opens, the household is about to have some sort of meeting. I was expecting something weird...and you find out they are meeting because one of them will not do his only assigned household chore, i.e. washing the dishes. They have this intense meeting that ends with all of them levitating and hissing at one another! One has his own familiar to do his dirty work. She longs for the world of the vampire, but keeps getting put off by her master. She provides victims, which they turn one into a vampire and he cannot keep his mouth shut, so everybody knows what's going on. And their rivalry with a local pack of werewolves damn near put me over the edge.I cannot say enough good things about this movie. There is comedy galore, a ""beast,"" and the script was well written and very well acted. Kudos to these guys. I enjoyed everything about this one and highly recommend it for viewing.The movie is rated ""R"" for violence and some language. Enjoy yourself!",What We Do in the Shadows

This 83' quasi-improvised mockumentary has pretty much the same cheesy flavor as one of the videos from a ""Flight of the Conchords"" episode, though it lacks the sweetness and wit (and Brett!) of the show itself. On the plus side, co-w/d Taika Waititi has kind of an Andy Kaufman vibe going on, and the opening scenes have a sprinkling of pretty good deadpan gags—the ""fletmites"" have a house meeting to discuss why nobody's done the dishes for five years; primping in the mirror before a night of clubbing is clearly not an option, but various workarounds are available I can't speak for the rest—after a long sequence of mirthless hummina-hummina improv (7,000-year-old Petyr turns a new guy who doesn't seem to be working out), I felt like I'd seen all that Vladislav, Viago, Deacon and Petyr had to offer. Jaded film critics who've seen too many ""serious"" vampire movies (I'm talking about you, Anthony Lane of The New Yorker!) seem to have gone way overboard for this one. ****.5, bumped up to ***** for the tacky ""archival"" graphics; looks like they went with the first hits they got on Google Images every time.",What We Do in the Shadows

100,Donatien3,Wonderful Vampire Mockumentary,10,17 February 2018,"""What We Do in the Shadows"" is a fantastic New Zealand vampire mockumentary, no surprise considering Taika Waititi (""Thor Ragnarok"" director) and ""Flight of the Conchords'"" Jermaine Clement are involved.""...Shadows"" is about a vampire sharehouse in Wellington, New Zealand - Viago (Waititi), Vladislav (Clement), Deacon (Jonny Brugh) and the 800-year-old Petyr (Ben Fransham) - filmed for a documentary. Their relatively cosy existence is interrupted when 20-year-old Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) is turned into a vampire and moves into the sharehouse, visited by his human best friend Stu (Stu Rutherford). Stu is such a likeable guy that the vampires - despite their hunger - refuse to eat him.The highlight of the movie is the dry New Zealand humour (similar to Conchords') contrasting the fantastical vampiric lore, with Stu - who works with Geodatabases - teaching the vampires about computers and mobiles. Other highlights are the werewolves, with Rhys Darby playing the alpha male Anton, and the clueless local police.Arguably the best vampire comedy since Leslie Nielsen's ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"", ""...Shadows"" is a welcome contrast from the wave of more serious vampire-themed TV series and movies.With Waititi gaining recognition after ""Thor Ragnarok"", hopefully curious fans will check out ""...Shadows"". It's well worth it. The good news is an American TV series is planned, so hopefully it does the movie justice.",What We Do in the Shadows
101,troyputland,Just a brilliant documentary-comedy.,9,9 November 2015,"f you like Flight of the Conchords then you'll love What We Do in the Shadows. It's a parody documentary that follows the lives of a group of vampires living in Wellington, New Zealand. They each get to tell their story, including their illustrious backgrounds, hitting the city streets, trying to get in to nightclubs, who should do the dishes and confrontations with Wolves. Every character has different background, from Ben Fransham's Nosferatu and Jemaine Clement's goth, to Twilight-esque Deacon and newcomer (and general conflict maker) Nick. This is funny, even when it's not trying to be. Dryer than your everyday comedy, but never decreasing in momentum. FotC's regular Rhys Darby is an absolute scene stealer. A comedy following the lives of the werewolves should be next on their list.",What We Do in the Shadows
102,Rendanlovell,Crazy Unique.,8,25 April 2015,"What We Do In The Shadows is one of the best films to be released in 2015. Although there has only been two or three good films this year, I believe, even by the end of the year this will stand tall. This film has caused a stir in our zombie crazed society. Not since Twilight has a vampire film been so popular. (The only difference is Twilight sucked hard) Like 'District 9' it's filmed as a documentary or, more appropriately, mockumentary. The best part of this film is it makes the most of this style. Unlike 'District 9' which was pretty inconsistent with this highly controversial style.While it's not ""One of the flat-out funniest films in ages!"" it does have some really hilarious moments. That is 'What We Do In The Shadows' greatest strength and most crippling downfall. The film is only memorable in it's moments. Not as a whole. It feels like a cluster of great skits that have been thrown into a feature length film. Sure this approach works with television shows such as 'Saturday Night Live', but not really as a movie.That aside this is a really fun film. As I explained earlier, the moments make this film what it is. From Werewolves swearing then quickly retorting by saying, ""We are Werewolves, not Swearwolves."" to vampires fighting on the ceiling. It's chalk full of memorable (and quotable) scenes and lines. While it may not have the hilarious one liners that films like 'Anchorman' possess, it does a great job of being new. It embraces all of the Vampire ""stereotypes"" and puts them to funny use. We see some burnt to a crisp when exposed to daylight, fights between two as bats, and a handful of great lines remarking on their age. It brings Vampires into the modern world with such grace and reality it feels utterly real. This is in large part due to it's documentary style. We see camera men slaughtered by creatures and all forefront characters getting face time via interviews.With such a small film like this, usually the special effects are sub par. And for the most part you give them leeway for the budget they are working with. This is not the case with 'What We Do In The Shadows'. The effects have a Chris Nolan feel to them. Opting to go practical or CG. And it works so incredibly well. There is no point in the film were one will be taken out by an awful effect.

However, What We Do In The Shadows does suffer from some relatively tedious parts, mainly the beginning, which seems to drag on and on without giving us much to work with.Though a very great film, What We Do In The Shadows isn't quite as perfect as I was led to believe.

104,dommercaldi,A Decent Comedy If Just A Little Repetitive,7,4 May 2020,"Pros:
1. The comedy, when it lands, is of laugh-out-loud quality: ""I think of it like this: if you were going to eat a sandwich, you would just enjoy it more if you knew no one had fucked it.""
2. The set and costume design are fantastic and really help to seal the vampiric gothic feel.
3. The gore and practical effects look really good and are proof that a big budget isn't necessary to pull that kind of thing off.
4. Taika Waititi (Viago), Jemaine Clement (Vladislav), and Jonny Brugh (Deacon) give great comedic performances.
5. Jemaine Clement, Jonny Brugh, and Taika Waititi have tremendous chemistry with each other, and it is unequivocally the engine behind the film.
6. The score not only matches the gothic theme of the movie, but it also helps to breathe a little life into the film to prevent it from becoming stale.Cons:
1. At times, the comedy feels a little forced and inappropriate.
2. The film, especially during the second half, starts to drag and it feels a little repetitive.",What We Do in the Shadows

107,noahgibbobaker,Fantastic in the moment.,7,2 November 2020,"So i've been a kiwi for a long time now, since I was born. And I somehow hadn't seen what we do in the shadows until a few days ago. I am very familiar with Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement so I knew what to expect, I got exactly what I was expecting and that's not a bad thing.What we do in the shadows is so clever and so funny. I think the fantastic performances hold this movie together. Taika Waititi, Jemaine Clement and Jonny Brugh give some of my favourite comedic performances ever. All of the line delivery is phenomenal, the physical comedy works brilliantly as well.Most of the gags work for me, but unfortunately a couple of fantastic gags were overused a bit. The gag with the police officers not noticing what's directly in front of them was hilarious the first time, but by the third time it didn't really land. The gag about characters pointing out the documentary crew was also very funny the first couple times but was also used a little too often for my taste.The cinematography and editing were used to great comedic effect and made for some historical gags, documentary style really helped with this. What we do in the shadows is one of my favourite mockumentary, but I don't think I'll be watching it all that often. It's fun in the moment but it's not challenging in any way. I really enjoyed my experience but it doesn't give much to think about when the film is over. I still recommend that you watch it. You can watch it by yourself, I did, but it would be a hilarious group experience.",What We Do in the Shadows
108,TheRedDeath30,Surprisingly Good,7,16 August 2015,"Comedy is very subjective. You could probably make the same statement about most genres, but comedy more than anything can be a very personal experience and what one viewer finds hilarious is often considered to be ""stupid"" by another. Because of that, I usually take reviews of comedy films with a grain of salt. Even when the positive reviews came from many of my favorite horror sites, I was still skeptical that I would actually enjoy the movie, especially because I've never been the biggest fan of foreign humor (meaning not American).I went into the movie carrying that skepticism and was idling away checking my Twitter account for the first several minutes of the movie. Something happened, though, about 30 minutes into the movie. I found myself engaged by excellent writing and clever characters. The movie revolves around four roommates, who essentially represent different archetypes of vampire. One guy is effeminate and fancy, reminding me of Anne Rice's vampires. The ""newest"" of the four is the most daring in their minds but still hilariously outdated. The two who remain are almost perfect caricatures of Dracula and Nosferatu. Jermaine Clement as the Dracula character is the centerpiece, pulling a charming riff on the Oldman interpretation. The makeup on the Nosferatu clone is very good for a low budget and they do some clever things by playing with the twist of Petyr being the eldest of them and sort of the last step in evolution.There are plenty of in-jokes for vampire fans, with twists and references to classic vampire movies. What really makes the movie work, though, is that the characters are good. The creepy vamp in the basement makes a new protégé, who becomes the fifth wheel in this gang. He introduces them to his ""bestie"" (a human), who the group suddenly grow to like more than the noob vamp.The situations this creates drive the humor, for the most part, but the emotions it brings out in the characters really cements this as a well acted and written movie, as well. To sound horribly cliché, I found myself liking them and caring about the resolution of the movie. We're even introduced to a group of guys who seems like they could be a pack of rugby fans, but are revealed to be monster of their own, which creates a funny rivalry that the movie uses to good advantage.Overall, I was much more impressed by this movie than I thought I would be. The characters are fun, the movie makes some good jokes that any vampire fan will enjoy and the director, also, adds to interesting flourishes and visual touches that combine to make this movie stand out among the pack in this year's indie horror films.",What We Do in the Shadows

Jermaine Clement and Taika Waititi (who is now one of the hottest directors in Hollywood) are both excellent at what they do, inventing absurd vehicles for their unorthodox comedies. I can appreciate this film for more than the laughs it gave me (my mum was laughing pretty much constantly), and I can see that, even if I personally didn't find it hilarious, that it does have merits. Vampires are an ideal subject for satire (particularly given the oversaturation of the genre at the start of the decade), and every aspect is lampooned at some point in the film. A storyline is not totally present per se, but the mockumentary format does its bit to merit the film.

113,CleveMan66,"""What We Do in the Shadows"" is like a great amusement park ride that you'll want to relive again and again!",8,14 March 2015,"Great comedy can come from the most unlikely of places, both in terms of location and subject matter. How about vampires? Are they funny? They can be. They've been fodder for many big-screen comedies over the years. How about a vampire comedy from, oh say, New Zealand? Believe it or not, that's the combination you get in ""What We Do in the Shadows"" (NR, 1:26) – and, as the movie's poster makes clear, it is hilarious! This is a mockumentary about four vampires living together in the suburbs of Wellington, New Zealand. They've invited a film crew (promising not to eat them) into their house to document the vampires' daily lives (actually, nightly lives) and their preparations for the annual Unholy Masquerade ball. The vampires have a variety of backgrounds and personalities. The one who addresses the camera most is Viago (Taika Waititi, who also co-wrote and co-directed the film). He was ""a bit of a dandy"" before he became a vampire three centuries ago and now basically acts as the group's housemother, calling a meeting to discuss chores, for example. Vladislav (Jemaine Clement, the other half of the film's writing-directing team) is the ladies vamp of the group and, back in the day, was much feared for his habit of ""poking people"" (a winking homage to the real-life Vlad the Impaler, who was the inspiration for the legendary Dracula character). The group's youngest member is Deacon (Jonathan Brugh). He's less than two centuries old and he's the most impetuous of the four. Oh, and he used to be a Nazi. The fourth blood sucker is 8,000 year-old Petyr (Ben Fransham). He's the oldest of the group (looking like the vampire in the classic silent film ""Nosferatu"") – and he's also the crankiest. He usually just stays in his closet. Most nights, the three youngsters of the group go out to clubs looking for victims (and sometimes harassing the local werewolves), but sometimes they have a dinner party – a phrase that takes on a whole new meaning in this case. Deacon has a human servant named Jackie (Jackie Van Beek) who helps out the housemates by doing everything from cleaning up blood that has been spilled in their house, to helping them get new victims. Deacon has promised Jackie that, after a certain period of service, he'll make her a vampire. One day Jackie brings a couple old acquaintances, named Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) and Katherine (Ethel Robinson) to the house for one of those dinner parties. After playing it cool for a while, and then briefly toying with their guests, they attack. They suck Katherine's blood, but Petyr gets a hold of Nick and turns him into a vampire. Nick ends up moving in to the house. The guys teach him about being a vampire (important things like – don't tell everyone that you're a vampire!) and he helps them get up to date on modern technology (including cell phones, the internet and Skype). Nick starts bringing his best friend, Stu (Stuart Rutherford) around to the house. That's usually a big no-no amongst the children of the night, but Stu takes it all in stride, and they all really like him, so they decide that it's cool. But that's not the end of the story. This situation comes to a head (along with a long-standing feud between Vlad and a rival vampire whom he calls ""The Beast"") at The Unholy Masquerade. All that, along with a few zombies and other ""predeceased"" creatures thrown into the mix (not to mention a pivotal encounter with that pack of werewolves) and the movie has an ending that is to die for. A lot of the comedy in ""What We Do in the Shadows"" comes from the juxtaposition of the vampires' politeness and their brutality, as well as the matter-of-fact way that they talk about their lifestyle and nefarious nocturnal activities. A good example would be Jackie driving in her car, casually discussing the merits of eternal life as a vampire, or Nick talking about the ups and downs of being a vampire and ending with ""It sucks."" Whether the comedy makes you laugh out loud or you simply find it quietly amusing is a matter of individual personality, but most people seem to agree that, no matter how you define it, this movie is very funny – and very clever. It goes to show that filmmakers don't need millions of dollars, big-name stars and an elaborate story to make a quality film. A great concept, properly fleshed out (no pun intended) and a few creative and talented actors will do. This movie is like a great amusement park ride. It's scary, fun and unique – and as soon as the ride is over, you want to get right back in line and enjoy it all over again. ""A-""",What We Do in the Shadows
114,blakiepeterson,A Hilarious Mockumentary,8,13 July 2015,"I tend to gravitate toward the Zucker/Zucker mindset when it comes to comedy — as a kid raised on ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"", there's nothing better than a series of sight and sound gags that have more to do with a randomly placed guffaw than sly plot pushing. So the dry comedy subgenre doesn't usually do it for me, unless we're talking ""Arrested Development"" or anything Christopher Guest related — then I'll completely zone out and bathe in the wonder of the straight-faced one-liner delivery. Because in some ways, a well- crafted, deliciously complicated scenario akin to something you'd find in a particularly good episode of ""The Office"" can be just as potent as a quick belly laugh a la ""Scary Movie"".Mockumentary ""What We Do in the Shadows"" has much more in common with ""Best in Show"" than it does with ""Young Frankenstein"", its lightly sarcastic demeanor interlacing with the fixtures of the macabre with comedic radiance. Such results would hardly be a possibility without Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement (of ""Flight of the Conchords"" fame), who co-direct and co-write with such witty adeptness that the broad premise of the film never feels broad because the tones and textures of the movie itself convince and thoroughly delight.The ""We"" in the title refers to a group of vampires being followed around by a camera crew. Occupying the same bungalow (or to be more scientific, den) for years, we are introduced to Viago (Waititi), Vladislav (Clement), Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), and Petyr (Ben Fransham). Viago, aged 379, is the ""father"" of the house, demanding his roommates attend group meetings to discuss things like the kitchen sink problem (no one has washed the dishes for five years), while he, in the meantime, mopes around about his long-lost love; Vladislav, at 800, used to be a hypnotic sexual demon in the same vein as Dracula, but has since lost his magic touch; Deacon is the young, wild one of the group (he's a spry 183) who first got his immortal kicks as a Nazi vampire, while the ancient Petyr (8,000) intimidates everyone as the household's Nosferatu. We also meet Jackie (Jackie Van Beek), the group's human servant who hopes her handiwork will lead to her turning, and Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer), a twenty-something who was supposed to be a meal but ends up becoming a member of the household after Petyr inadvertently transforms him.I can write as much as I want about ""What We Do in the Shadows"", but never will I be able to capture the rhythm, the attitude, the genius of its humor. The ensemble is made up of skilled comedic performers, and the writing is endlessly clever (we can start with the vampirical hatred of the local werewolf pack or the annual get-together the undead throw to celebrate their undeadness, for starters). I found myself as quick to laugh as I was ready to sit in awe regarding the successful audacity of everyone involved. No one, no one, would decide that the best subjects of a mockumentary would be a group of self-serious vampires, and yet here we have one, a hilarious gem, no less, as sharp as the wooden stakes the focuses of the film so greatly fear. Clement and Waititi have outdone themselves. A find.",What We Do in the Shadows

116,MickeyTheConstant,"Fun, zany and original",7,4 January 2020,I watched the TV series before the movie which I absolutely loved. The movie is not as good as the tv show but still a great watch. The characters are fun and I just loved the craziness of vampires and werewolves living kind of ordinary lives in modern society. Some laugh out loud moments. A good watch.,What We Do in the Shadows
117,Tehmeh,"Actually funny, not Hollywood-ish pretend-funny.",9,30 July 2016,"I watched this for the second time last night. I remembered it being alright, but on my second viewing I caught a lot of funny jokes I missed before....and that's what I love about ""What We Do in the Shadows"". It isn't forcing a joke on you. It doesn't rub it in your face. The way the humor is presented is almost natural, and it's ultimately what Hollywood comedies aren't - genuinely funny. So while you may miss some funny things when you watch it the first time, you're still entertained in a way that's rare for comedy movies nowadays. There is a charm to it. I usually dread these kind of fake documentaries, and I don't care for vampires (especially modern takes of them), but my cynicism was soon put to rest. Yes, there's a film crew following and documenting the lives of vampires, and it sounds horrible when simply stated like that, but it's much better than I thought it could be.Jermaine Clement was great, and the main reason I got this film in the first place. But Taika Waititi (co-director, along with Clement), Jonny Brugh and Cori Gonzales-Macuer were very good too. From the side characters Stu Rutherford hilariously seems to play himself, Jackie van Beek is a frustrated slave and Ben Fransham plays a really old vampire, straight from a horror story. Rhys Darby is a likable presence as the werewolf pack leader. All the actors are good, and they mostly play it straight, bordering on deadpan. It was the right decision as far as comedic style goes.What I didn't expect from a movie like this was special effects. This isn't a CGI-fest or effect-heavy like a blockbuster nowadays is, but most of the effects are really good and seamless. There were couple of scenes where I actually started laughing at the effects, because their quality caught me off-guard.If you like funny and weird soundtracks, there's plenty to like in this one. Most of the music is somewhat traditional, almost from another age we have forgot, and it fits perfectly to the tone of the movie. There's also a short, clumsy band act that's complimenting the same weird tone. It's not treated as a joke, on the contrary it's played very straight - but the humor comes in context with everything else.I have something negative to say as well, though it's just nitpicking at this point. The latter half of the film isn't quite as funny, and the narrative took a direction I didn't care that much about. It's still good, but some of the magic is gone. And while I complimented the natural flow of comedy, some of the jokes - especially during the latter half - come off as forced. They stick out like sore thumb, but thankfully they're the exception instead of the rule. That's it, I don't think I have more complaints. ""What We Do in the Shadows"" is great. And the more you compare it to modern mainstream comedies, the better it gets. If you're tired of lazy, forced corporate products like the Ghostbusters reboot, Adam Sandler&Kevin James productions, Seth McFarlane flicks or your average frat boy comedies and chick flicks, you'll probably like this one. There wasn't a committee of suits and marketing people behind this one, and it shows. Hollywood, take note before you drown under your own feces.",What We Do in the Shadows
118,deastman_uk,Won't survive the light of day,7,20 August 2014,"The mockumentary has not really had a good recent workout, due to the Fear of Looking Shallow. Why mock, when we can celebrate? In this case, what is apparently being mocked doesn't even exist. But this vampire flatmates genre flick certainly has the dial turned up to.. well not quite 11 but pretty high.What is fresh here is the humorous eye that laughs at the fallacies of the Hollywood vampire myth as well as the bro culture that the film is actually about. I loved the flatmates helping each other dress up for a night out because ""they can't use mirrors, so don't know what they look like"". They can only hang out in certain clubs, due to having to be invited in.Probably the peak of the humour involves the werewolves being a dumb Iron John self help group - ""Werewolves don't swear!"" - who seem to be in continual crises. Even the pathos about death is more or less pitch perfect.This has the strength to be a cult, but if it shames the torrent of vampire crap and angst hangers-on (yes Being Human, I'm looking at you) that gets churned out at a truly scary rate - so much the better.",What We Do in the Shadows
119,quinimdb,What We Do in the Shadows,7,13 November 2016,"What is missing from a lot of comedies these days is visual comedy. The YouTube channel ""Every Frame A Painting"" did a video on Edgar Wright perfectly explaining this, and using this as a reason why Edgar Wright is the smartest comedy director currently out there. Basically, thanks in no small part to Judd Apatow, most of the comedies of the past 10 years have basically been mostly comedic improv on screen, and even if it is scripted that is an accurate description of what it feels like. And even when they do improv the actors aren't skilled enough to portray the unique, hilarious characters in films such as ""Best in Show"" and ""This is Spinal Tap"". This is where ""What We Do in the Shadows"" comes in.This film combines some hilarious visual comedy elements similar to Edgar Wright, while also including the mockumentary improv style of Christopher Guest, and while filmmakers Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clements don't quite reach the heights of those two directors, they craft an original, very funny comedy.The film gets right into it. For the first 6 minutes basically everything is a joke, and it's pretty hilarious, but I was immediately skeptical about how long they could go with this premise while still being funny. The answer is: surprisingly long, even if it begins to feel one note towards the end of the film.For those unfamiliar with the premise, there is a group of vampires that meet in a flat in New Zealand, hang out, go to clubs, and casually live their lives as vampires.The film is basically filled with clever moments playing into vampire lore, and hilarious lines (that I will not spoil). The film is It's also surprisingly heartfelt. It's actually about the value of friendship, and finding people who accept who you are. There isn't really much more to say. It's funny and clever and by the end of the film they've pretty much milked all that they could out of the premise and then some. It's definitely one of the better comedies I've seen recently. Hilarious cast of characters, great performances, and surprisingly great visual effects, mostly done practically.",What We Do in the Shadows
120,rprince-832-6294,If the show Being Human were on MTV,8,17 February 2015,"-What We Do In The Shadows (2015) movie review: -What We Do In The Shadows is a comedy in the shape of a documentary about three friends, Viago, Deacon, and Vladislav, who are struggling through everyday life, because they are vampires.-A comedy that is about a documentary crew following vampires doing average vampire things, but completely seriously as if it were real? Yeah I'm all about that.-The story was great, and the fact that nothing is treated like it is a new thing for the audience was so smart. Things just happen and move on casually, like freak sunlight accidents.-The pace was mostly good, but I did feel like it had a slow wrap-up.-The acting was great. I don't know any of the actors, but they all did a convincingly good job.-The characters were really likable and funny, but also serious. Like introducing themselves as 600 years old, but being completely chill about it. Or having fights by flying.-I did not really care much for the music, but it was fittingly weird.-So more about this film that I just loved was that it was set in a world where everything that would be a big deal to anybody is just casual and treated so for the cameras in the film. They go to a party with zombies or make fun of werewolves. Or have trouble getting dressed because they can't see themselves in mirrors.-The films effects are also realistic and surprisingly not cheesy.-It does not have a rating, but I would say it would be a heavy PG-13 or light R. There's 2 F-words and some other mild language. There is some violence, but some of it is blurred. There is some suggestive material also, but either blurred or just not shown.-What We Do In The Shadows is a great example of how to make a satirical comedy so entertaining and original. It is like if the show Being Human were on MTV. Best way I can think to describe it. And that said, What We Do In The Shadows is totally worth checking out!

It has got nice special effects, used mostly for humorous purposes, and the actors speak English with a funny east-European accent, something ""Vampires"" missed (well, I guess, since they spoke French and all vampires seemed native...). So, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" is definitely not 100% original, but it contains more physical humour, more goofiness and overall more laughs than the 2010 release.

126,MattBirk,Best Comedy of 2015,9,20 March 2015,"Even though I really dislike the fount footage genre, What We Do in the Shadows proves there are still a few useful ideas yet to be discovered in the subgenre. The movie has been praised as one of the best comedies of the year by many critics, and it certainly lives up to that title. Shadows is a breath of fresh air in the comedy/horror department. Though I can certainly see some people having a problem with the deadpan humor, a lot of the comedy comes from the cultural differences from the extremely old vampires (some dating back to the Medieval Times) as they struggle to keep up with current times. Basically the movie will mostly likely be a bust for you if you are someone who doesn't find the general idea of a bunch of vampires struggling to fit into today's society funny. But it totally worked for me and I loved how they were stuck in the past (decor, clothing style, appliances, etc) and needed a new member to bring them up to speed. But that new member unfortunately is the weakest point of Shadows, Nick is by far the least interesting character and/or aspect of the movie. He is the one character who is there to advance the story so he's more or less necessary, which is bittersweet. But outside of that complaint, Shadows is a blast and one of the years best so far. The writers/actors really utilize the flying aspect the vampires possess and create some solid humor with it. They poke fun at just about every single vampire trope you can think of, not having a shadow, virgins, flying, vampire hunters, and many more. Not to mention the numerous jokes about todays current vampire movies, there are a few but they're pretty funny! So if you are someone (like me) who is sick of todays growing trend of vulgar and gross-out comedies, What We Do in the Shadows is just what we've been waiting for!",What We Do in the Shadows

The use of horror monster ""rules"" from genre lore fits with the comedy incredibly well, and that is a testament to the film's writing.

128,mbhgkmsgg,A fun Halloween film,7,31 October 2020,"I remember when this movie came out and everyone was raving about it. Since then, I had completely forgotten about it unit today, when an email from HBO recommended it as part of their Halloween offering. Those memories of everyone saying how great it was and the fact that it is a Taika Waititi project made me eager to watch it.To be completely honest with you, I'm a little disappointed. That is probably due to my expectations, but nonetheless, I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.
First of all, is it funny? At times, sure. I wasn't howling with laughter at every joke but certainly, some of them landed. By far, the best and funniest thing about this entire film is the setting. Having four vampires of varying ages living together as flatmates is rather funny on its own. Unfortunately, I felt that that side was explored very little. Instead, the movie tries to introduce new characters and find comedy in their reactions to this whole ordeal. I would've been completely fine with watching the four main characters living their lives as vampire flatmates for the entire 86 minutes that this film runs for. They were by far the best and funniest characters in the film.As it is Halloween, I probably ended up enjoying this film more than I would've, say in July. And as a Halloween film, it works great. Obviously, there are vampires in it, but there are also werewolves and zombies, be it in very minor roles. The werewolves were in fact one the best parts of this movie.The mockumentary style and mostly funny jokes make this film a worthwhile watch. And of course, as with all comedies, you might end up enjoying this far more than I did, depending on your sense of humour.

130,nzswanny,Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement prove to us that New Zealand makes great movies,10,23 April 2016,"New Zealand makes a great movie...again. So far, I've only found 2 bad New Zealand movies. I think it's time we start making bad movies, New Zealand! But then again, we've made some terrible TV shows, so I guess that makes up for it...but anyway! This is a great mockumentary film that provides and guarantees great laugh-out-loud moments that will probably make you burst out on your couch laughing. This film is so good, it can be accepted as a Hollywood film set in New Zealand. This movie is great, and it is very hard not to like it. I'll keep this review short, however I will still describe a bit about how great this gem of a movie is, but I will also discuss about the flaws in the film. Let's get started on my review now, shall we?Taika Waiti has made some great movies provided, especially ones more for New Zealand viewers. However, he right now delivers a vampire comedy/mockumentary...that's set in New Zealand. It sounds bad, but believe me, it's not. This film is about three vampires called Viago, Deacon and Vladislav who are all hundreds of years old, trying to cope in real life as a normal figure. Unfortunately, that doesn't work when they're bloodsucking vampires with a thirst of blood! A documentary film crew makes a documentary about their life and how they live and adapt as vampires in the outside world and learn to cope with humans, werewolves, a wannabe vampire and paying their rent! That sounds like a great movie, doesn't it? Because, well, if it doesn't sound good, then I recommend you don't go watch it, because this is a more love-it-or-you-hate-it movie. Here's why.Although this is a great film, and I really, REALLY like it, werewolf fans may be a bit offended, because sometimes the werewolves are teased and made fun of in parts of the movie. That can be easily ignored, but still, it may offend sensitive viewers that are fans of werewolf movies. I, myself, do prefer werewolves than vampires, but the jokes didn't really bug me that much, so I'm pretty sure you'd be able to cope with them if I could. Although this didn't do great at the box office, it did go great on the review side, which is probably why they are now making a What We Do In The Shadows 2. Let's hope they don't insult werewolves in What We Do In The Shadows 2, am I right, werewolf fans?Also, let's talk about the violence in this film. This film is quite gory for a comedy. Even if most of the gory violence is done in an over the top comical matter, it may disgust some people that are eating popcorn in the film. I have seen way gorier, but if you go watching this, planning a film with barely any gore (like most New Zealand films) then you will most likely be disappointed, because this film is quite gory. But do take in mind that the violence is hilarious, too! The bit when the vampires mess up and hit the jugular is hilariously bloody, and it's a good laugh, that even if it's the goriest part in the film, it's really, really funny. If you can cope with a ton of blood spraying everywhere, I think you'll be fine and will enjoy the movie as much as I did.Okay, so I guess the review wasn't as short as I was planning, but it's still good enough to be called a review (I hope). I hope you now know whether this is your kind of movie or not, because it's definitely my kind of movie. It's fine if it's not your type, but even if it isn't, you may enjoy it anyway if you can cope with a bit of blood. This proves that New Zealand makes great films, and I do have to say, I was surprised that the rating on IMDb was lower than 8/10. Overall, I'd rate this a 8.3/10, and it also definitely deserves to be in the IMDb Top 250! 8.3/10!",What We Do in the Shadows

What We Do In the Shadows, directed by Jemaine Clement (of Flight of the Conchords fame) and Taika Waititi, is one of the latter.I am a fan of Flight of the Conchords, the musical comedy duo, so it is fortunate from my perspective that the emphasis is very much on comedy rather than horror. Taking extraordinary things and putting them in a mundane context is a standard comedic method, and mockumentary is a style that harks right back to This Is Spinal Tap, so there is precedent here.Possibly too much precedent: some jokes I found to have been done before in other vampire comedies such as Dracula: Dead and Loving It and the more humorous parts of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Still, there was plenty of originality to keep me entertained. Clement & Waititi's last film together, Eagle Vs. Shark, was a bit too 'quirky' for my taste, but What We Do had more than enough to laugh at as far as I am concerned.Each of the 5 central vampires gets their own sub-plot, which is wrapped up comfortably in a display of admirable screen writing balance, and there are some special effects tricks that are even more impressive for the way they slip by practically unnoticed. The downbeat nature of the film, deriving comedy from stripping away the atmosphere and style to expose the ridiculousness underlying it, is very much in Jemaine Clement's wheel-house, and he even gets a bit of musical fun in, although it is a far cry from Flight of the Conchords' witty parodies and catchy tunes.All in all, I laughed out loud plenty of times, and what more can you ask of a comedy?",What We Do in the Shadows

I only got interested after finding out that one of the leads played Tamatoa in ""Moana"" and another directed an Avengers film. There is solid star power in this little movie which lifts it above the ordinary, but everything about it is extremely well done, from story and acting to special effects. Whether or not you find it laugh out loud funny depends on how much you like its ""Flight of the Conchords"" style bro comedy, but I've always believed that at the heart of the best comedy is good theater, and this is eminently watchable as such.Where horror parody usually falls down is by not really understanding what it's purporting to be making fun of. WWDITS makes intelligent references to ""Nosferatu,"" ""Lost Boys"" and Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dracula"" (and I'm sure the makers knew WWDITS' English cousin ""Being Human"" backwards and forwards) but it genuinely has the texture and atmosphere of a Gothic horror piece. The existential absurdity of the vampire's life is confronted in a way most other vampire stories are too busy or shallow to even touch. It also uses the aesthetics of low budget horror in a craftful way that I'd thought had been forgotten decades ago.I have no hope that the new TV series based on this property will retain the charms of the original. Although Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi are involved as directors and writers, they will definitely be missed in front of the camera.",What We Do in the Shadows

135,Criticalstaff,A nice quirky comedy,7,2 June 2020,"What a lovely film. It is based on a very simple premise: it is mockumentary on modern time's vampires that are living as roommates in New Zealand.
It is very funny and is the perfect example of character comedy. Each vampire being a trope that the film is laughing and commenting on.
You get what the film is going to be in the first five minutes. The rest of the runtime is a series of vignettes, of different encounters that the vampire group has, but there is no story to speak of. It is simply a straight ""what if"" scenario. Yet it works and it is enjoyable and interesting because the film treats the comedy with a straight face. It is a very deadpan sense of humor. Shall I say humour.The movie's jokes are nearly entirely devoted to the vampires being eternal beings full of magic and otherworldly powers being bogged down by mundane and trivial problem like roommates forgetting to do the dishes and not getting into nightclubs.The quality and charm of the movie then comes from its style. The comedy is served brilliantly by the sets and costumes and camera work. It feels cheap and homemade, that is precisely the point, and it gives the film a freshness and authenticity. There are many clever tricks when there is magic or supernatural elements involved. The movie did not need to have these special effects, but it does and it elevates the movie. The jokes being paper thin, you need
something more to keep you engaged past the movies introductory scenes.It feels part thesis-film part inside joke between friends. It is very reminiscent of the Belgian gem Man Bites Dog but with better production value and with a reverence to vampire movies.

I'm not sure when was the last time I saw a better comedic performance in a Hackneywood film ... a LONG time ago. Speaking of Hackneywood, this film further corroborates that Hackneywood & France now make the worst films in the world. Hackneywood's formula of preachy PC BS has become so rigor(mortis)ous that most of its films stink & even its best films have a bit of a stench to them.

However the actual endearing quality of the characters only truly cones across in the movie. The three main vampires are truly the heart and soul of this movie. Each one has a very unique personality and there are some instant classic quotes such as the werewolves and not swearwolves scene and the spaghetti scene. The lead vampire does an amazing job as the lead and you can't forget about stu. Parts of it very dark comedy and the excessive gore causes a mix of disgust and comedy. It is a truly unique movie that may be polarizing but if quirky comedy is your thing, then you'll love it.",What We Do in the Shadows

Of course what people find funny is subjective but personally the mix of self depreciation, trying to be cool and mockumenary format hit harder than any overly positive Hollywood comedy. It feels like the film has so much heart, everyone seems to be having so much fun and that's something I adore about smaller productions like these. This is my favourite film and I highly recommend it to everyone!",What We Do in the Shadows

142,Mikelikesnotlikes,A fine showcase of undisguised Kiwi humour.,7,6 April 2017,"If you don't 'get' Kiwi humour, you won't like this film. Kiwi humour is as unique as Aussie humour; not the same, but close enough for us to appreciate the differences. Other nationalities may be too (up themselves) I mean sophisticated, or find the jokes too low-brow, juvenile or too culturally specific. Each to his own I guess. I like Kiwi films. Just check out Bad Taste, Hunt for the Wilderpeople or Black Sheep. I tend to watch these films with an incredulous expression of WTF interposed between cracking up. Some of the jokes do fall flat but the undertone is usually enough to keep you engaged.The make-up is particularly good in WWDITS. The characters are well acted and the post-production crew did a great job of cutting 120 hours of improvised footage into this movie. Apparently, to maintain a documentary feel, no one had access to the script until they actually performed a take. Stu had no idea he was such a big part of the action.I don't want to call this film a guilty pleasure, because I did enjoy What We Do In The Shadows and I don't feel (very) guilty.

144,Krackoon,Do you like basketti?,8,28 July 2015,"Okay, so maybe it's not a true horror film, but I'll rate it, anyway.Seems like the newest, hottest trend is the horror/comedy mix - It's been around for a long time, but it's really starting to catch fire again. 'What We Do in the Shadows' is one of the funniest comedies I've seen in the last two years. I've read a lot of reviews from people claiming it's not 'laugh out loud funny,' but I can recall laughing my ass off throughout the entire film - and when it comes to comedies, I can probably name ten I've seen in my lifetime, that accomplished that. Needless to say, it's not my favorite genre, thanks to mostly recycled garbage, fart humor. Although, I am ashamed to admit, I love the 'Jackass' series.Random Ramblings of a Madman: Jemaine Clement, Taika Waititi are really onto something - but I almost hope it doesn't go any further, because even though I consider it 'laugh out loud funny,' I'd be shocked if they're able to accomplish this for another film or two.

145,michael-3204,Interview with Wellington Vampires,6,23 January 2016,"There are a lot of targets in this amusing meta-mockumentary about of group of vampires trying to make it in modern Wellington: vampire myths and movies, documentaries and other mockumentaries. Writers/directors Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi wisely keep the focus tight and mine the mundane (a vampire chore wheel, the tensions of sharing a flat with others) for humor as much as they explore the more absurd elements of the premise, like how to get into a nightclub when you have to be invited in, tricky relationship management with familiars, and run-ins with a rival gang of werewolves. If the best mockumentaries explore the social, cultural and political milieu of its subjects, this one has to make those things up out of pop culture depictions, so it isn't always as sharp and wickedly funny as the great examples of the genre. It is, however, very well-constructed, thoughtful and mostly funny, even with a few dry stretches. And it's nice to see New Zealand as something other than Middle Earth for a change.",What We Do in the Shadows
146,kieranbattams,Fangtastically Hysterical!,8,28 February 2015,"What we do in the Shadows is a film i heard about a while ago, I saw the trailer and knew it had a great deal of potential but was a film that I knew had to be seen to decide whether I could truly see it as a great comedy. Going into the film it is best to know as little as possible because it is such a surprise and such a pleasure to watch that nothing can be spoiled.The plot follows a group of vampires who share a flat and have a documentary crew follow them around as they try to adjust to everyday life despite being undead creatures of the night. The premise is one that we have seen, the oddball or group of oddballs are taken from one scenario to the other and have to adjust to a different lifestyle, but to tackle this in a mockumentary format with mythical creatures we have all heard of before is something completely new and it works better than most recent comedies have. There are some truly side-splitting scenes that had me laughing out loud. There is something genuinely hysterical about seeing these vampires do household chores and attempt to get into nightclubs which really makes me want to see more comedy like this. I found the circle of shame particarly funny.There are also a fair few twists and turns along the way, we get zombies and werewolves.. and these twists turn this from an ordinary mockumentary into something very special indeed. There are scenes where the comedy may run dry or it will go on for a little too long, but in the end this film pays off and it is nothing short of fun and is incredibly enjoyable. Some people may not ""get"" the style of comedy used which is fine, but for me it was original and the funniest film for a while. Definitely worth a watch, especially if you're wondering what vampires get up to when you're sleeping.",What We Do in the Shadows
147,stroggos,Nails the mockumentary genre - hilarious,9,27 March 2017,"WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is a fake documentary following a group of vampires who have a shared living arrangement in a worn-down mansion in New Zealand. One of the new members brings a human into their group, which causes all sorts of troubles. An adventure filled with magic, werewolves and vampires ensues.WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is one of the funniest movies I've seen since quite a while. The characters are plain hilarious, and each one is unique and also relatable. The characters are essentially just hyper-clichéd stereotypes, such as the German pedantic vampire with a penchant for organizing his friends' lives, or the sex crazed vampire master with a craving for torture. Yet, despite being such stereotypes, each character is quite believable—in part achieved through the great (and hilarious) performances.The movie exudes a sense of play and joy. It certainly doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's also not too silly to be dumb. A comedy like this falls or rises with the wittiness of its jokes and in this one, all the jokes are spot on. Definitely worth watching!",What We Do in the Shadows

149,maxastree,Stylish indie film eschews plot in favor of plotlessness,6,10 November 2014,"This is a great looking film, with typically sharp Wellington VFX and sumptuous, gritty goth set design, the film is obviously an attraction for local New Zealand (and Wellington) viewers, in the sense that it shows its cast in familiar locations for partying Wellingtonians, and the camera is focused on Wellington actors Waititi and Clement for about 90 percent of the screen time.What We Do in the Shadows is also a mixed genre film, something the film industry tends to reject, but can be done brilliantly with indie film, and frankly, the film never feels cheap or compromised, often using a kind of there-in-the-moment live camera feel, and improvised lines throughout.However, this film has limitations, and its ultimately a bit of a disappointment. The movie shows the lives of four overdressed vampires, intimately sharing their crazy lives and tribulations etc, but there's really no plot, and certainly nothing resembling a satisfying ending sequence. Clearly, there's plot points that a proper story development could pick out as suitable material for a third act here, for instance, when an archaic Nosferatu-lookalike vampire downstairs gets attacked by vampire hunters, but the event just passes as 'part of the story', as are plot threads about gang friction between vampires and werewolves, or some bathetic humor about Clements ex-girlfriend being a torment of some sort. Basically, this is a film where the characters are defined, then the acting is improvised; as a result the audience gives its time, but after a stylish opening, gets no substantial ending in return.""Shadows"" is basically a series of comedy sketches about flatting life for teens, and I would rather see some comedy with a bit of scope or depth - Waititi comes across on screen as clean cut, fruity and lightweight, but never hilarious. I get the feeling he was more focused on the quality of his images, and the character dynamics than the actual gags, much less the story. Oh well.",What We Do in the Shadows

152,Kingkitsch,"""Bat fight!""",8,7 August 2015,"I almost passed this sly gem by since vampires haven't been interesting since ""Twilight"" ruined the genre for adults and drained the life out of the genre. Still, having read good things about WWDITS, I gave it a chance and discovered a terrific mockumentary of the travails of being undead in this day and age. This is the worthy successor to Roman Polanski's ""Fearless Vampire Killers"" (1967), the only vampire spoof that ever really worked...until now.Certainly the mockumentary is by now a cliché of its own, with ""Spinal Tap"" still winner and champion. WWDITS doesn't claim to challenge that epic, instead, it takes a charming and old-fashioned approach to simply having a ""protected"" film crew (they all wear crucifixes) follow the daily/nightly routine of four undead and watch them interact, as well as give solo interviews. Viago, Deacon, Vladislav, and Peytr have lived (sort of) through the ages, yet can't quite get the ability to function in a world that has passed them by. Each is trapped in the era in which they died and were transformed. Watching them forced to take on a fifth member of the clan, who started as dinner, is where the real fun starts. Nick, the new guy, is annoying and not dealing well with his transition. His comeuppance is that his human friend, Stu, becomes beloved of the other vampires. They like him better than Nick, which brings its own tension to the table. Jokes are thrown at the viewer fast and furious. Not all of them work, but most do. Very well done sets, costumes, and well placed special effects do wonderful work supporting some stellar performances here. Of note is Taika Waititi as Viago, looking like the picture of Hammer vampire elegance. Also, Jemaine Clement as Vladislav, who brings Dracula realness to the party. These two actors, known best for ""Flight of the Conchords"" wrote and directed this fast-moving slapstick look at the ultimate misfits. Not only are all the well known tropes about vampires trotted out and skewered, but affectionate nods to other cinematic bloodsuckers are generously provided. Most notable is the ball/party sequence near the end, which is a real tribute to Polanski, even though they don't have the gorgeous late Sharon Tate to work with. Bloody, funny, silly (the Procession of Shame gets the prize here), and worth a look if you think the Undead don't have problems. It's your turn to do the dishes.",What We Do in the Shadows

New Zealand has made it again with my last year's favorite Housebound and now What We Do In The Shadows is my new favorite and best horror/comedy film of 2015!! Not only all the characters here are absolutely hilarious but the mockumentary concept of this film is just brilliant. Think the mixed of Behind The Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon and a bit of Cabin In The Woods and you will get this vampire twisted-genre film that pokes fun at several vampire references and will make you laugh like crazy from start till finish. There are some SCARY make-up and jump scares here but overall the film is more of a comedy so don't go in expecting any of that kind like Housebound as well as the GORES. While the plot may not seem to be fully developed enough but as long as it can crack you up all the way through with several laugh-out-loud moments, plus making fun of the genre you love, that's just all it takes for me for a successful horror/comedy film >>A<<",What We Do in the Shadows

Written and directed by Jemaine Clement (the larger looming but no less adorable half of the 'Conchords') and Taika Waititi (who breathed new life into the 'Thor' franchise directing 'Thor: Ragnarok'), this film combines our seemingly immortal fascination with vampire lore with the deft and unprepossessing comic sensibilities of New Zealand, all packaged in the satirical style of a mockumentary. Karen O'Leary and Mike Minogue stand out as the affable and mildly paternalistic police constables. Rhys Darby (Murray, the band manager from 'Conchords') is hilarious as the leader of a wolf pack that is more wolf support group. The movie spun off two television series; 'Wellington Paranormal' in New Zealand and an American version of 'Shadows' . Both equally as funny.",What We Do in the Shadows
158,MackMonMay87,It's Impossible to Kill the Comedy At Stake in This Vampire Romp,8,21 November 2018,"The mid-00s saw the rise of reality-TV style comedies, chiefly with the popularity of the British and American versions of ""The Office"", which involved humor based around awkward situations, misunderstandings, and petty social drama rather than the more plot-driven style of a traditional sitcom. ""What We Do in The Shadows"" by New Zealand-based director Taika Waititi answers the absurd question of what if that dynamic and style was applied to vampires and the world of the supernatural?Full disclosure: I'm not the biggest fan of horror in general (with some exceptions), and certainly not a fan of vampires. The vampire concept, its romanticization, and how seriously the vampire sub-genre takes itself has always made it a ripe target for satire and comedy, with Leslie Nielsen and Mel Brooks doing a great job of mocking it in ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"". Waititi's project takes that same satirical spirit and plants it in the modern aesthetic, with plenty of hand-held camerawork and confessional cam scenes that you've seen on your favorite garbage reality shows.It's expertly executed, and after close to a decade of vomit-inducing Twilight sequels and vampire fetishizing, sorely needed. ""What We Do.."" shows vampires from what's arguably the most realistic viewpoint ever seen on film, with daily (nightly?) routines filled with their own unique mundane frustrations and challenges, as well as social complications like who to convert to a vampire, and who to simply prey upon. You can tell watching it that the crew improvised a great deal, and the whole production has an organic, natural energy to it filled with fun.
""What We Do"" doesn't completely stilt itself on gags, goofiness, and satire though. It has surprisingly well-done special effects and gore scenes, and also draws effective portraits of all the characters, and develops them in their own silly, petty, and sometimes surprisingly endearing ways.I think Taiki Waititi struck gold with this concept and applying such a pedestrian mood to what's supposed to be terrifying. It's not perfect, and towards the end of the second act of the film, at least on my first viewing, it began to drag and stretch a little, with the concept starting to wear thin in places. Luckily, there's enough of a story arc to bring you back in, and it wraps up neatly before it feels stale. Overall, even if you don't have the contempt and fatigue from vampires I do, even if you love them in fact, I would recommend ""What We Do.."" Because copies, homages, inspiration, and blatant rip-offs are so common in the film industry, one of the only things I'm worried about is other filmmakers, especially Hollywood-types, borrowing the concept from this production and trying to pass it off as clever and original, since no major Hollywood stars feature in ""What We Do..."" and it might not have as high of a profile. Or even worse, a remake. Now the thought of that is truly terrifying.",What We Do in the Shadows

160,InMyHonestOpinion,A Vampire tale you will not soon forget,7,31 January 2015,"Some people love documentaries, some people despise them, myself I'm somewhat in the middle, of course the subject has to interest me somewhat for me to even take a look at. Mockumentaries on the other hand I love (when done well) When it comes to mockumentaries, anything and everything goes, there are no real rules, as long as it's somewhat believable, interesting and makes us laugh usually a mockumentary is well received. Give anything some interesting characters and a reality storyline and it's usually enough to make us want to watch. I personally had never heard of ""What we do in the shadows"" until a friend asked me my thoughts, after watching the trailer I had the film in no time ready to watch. Viago, Deacon, Petyr and Vladislav are four housemates who rent a property in New Zealand, they have lived together for a very long time and know all there is to know about each other, the guys have one thing in common; they are all vampires and each of them is between 100 and 300 years old, never aging from the time they were originally turned. The film follows three of the group as they go about their daily business from their eating habits to their cleaning habits even introducing us at one point to their enemies. Along the way they meet Nick who is turned and decide they need to show him their world and how to survive it on a day to day basis. What we do in the shadows is a laugh a minute, literally. Line after line of jokes, wit and humour never end. Being a mockumentary film the character development is quite strong, you do actually end up feeling sorry and getting involved in each of their lives and the journey they undertake. I personally thought the characters were fantastic, each had their quirks and quips which made them stand out for their own reasons. Starring Jemaine Clement (Eagle Vs Shark, Flight of the Conchords) as Vladislav. Taika Waititi (Eagle vs Shark, Boy) as Viago. Jonathan Brugh (How to meet girls from a distance) as Deacon. Ben Fransham (30 Days of Night, The Ferryman) as Petyr and Cori Gonzalez-Macuer (Eagle vs Shark) as Nick. The guys were brilliant, funny and captivating, never taking themselves too seriously but seriously enough to engage you in their mishaps and adventures. The film is based around a short film made by the same people in 2006, being a mockumentary the camera work is pretty much hand held camera work, but it works well in its style and you never feel you're missing anything. The directors, writers and actors who all worked together have done an outstanding job in making some good fun lighthearted entertainment. Not really one for the younger kids and the teens won't really get all the hidden jokes throughout but I think mums and dads who have a slightly warped sense of humour will love it.",What We Do in the Shadows

I wasn't expecting to, but I found myself recommending it to everyone who would listen. Now it's your turn.If you enjoy Eddie Izzard monologues, then imagine one come to life. In this film you'll get to see how vampires do the vacuuming, how vampires eat chips and why vampires put newspaper down when entertaining a guest.All the cast look like they are having great fun, and I loved Rhys Darby as a very responsible werewolf, making sure all the members of his pack are wearing stretchy pants on the night of the full moon.Deducting one point for lack of originality, but other than that I can't fault this.

To sum it up, absence of talent can be really amusing, but in this case it's just awful and painfully unbearable.

I must say, after seeing Tracks, The Rover, Charlie's Country, 52 Tuesdays and Predestination (and, to a lesser extent, These Final Hours and Underground: The Julian Assange Story), the Aussie's really began to amaze me. It took them long enough: the brilliant Mary and Max is a 2009 feature (no I didn't forget Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby, which I found quite dull). At the same time the Aussie's make a comeback, New-Zealand starts to throw off its Peter Jackson-shackles and brought Jane Campion back on stage: Top of the Lake blew me away. And now Housebound and What We Do in the Shadows are some of the best horror movies of 2014!

166,organicsocial,This Disembowels Twilight Series And Leaves It Bleeding For Dead!,10,7 August 2015,"Pure genius is rare and that's what this film is. The concept is pretty freaky and every damn indie film maker in this internet age should feel jealous of the people behind this mockumentary for not coming up with as original and as hilarious satire. I think this film has its rightful place in the annuls of good vampire fiction and is far better than any of that pretentious teenage vampire drama that youngsters found so enticing about a year or two back. Who says vampire fiction is over? Jaimine and Taika who are the writers, directors and play two of the main characters of the movie show us that vampire fiction can be reinvented in ways you probably can't imagine. What We Do In The Shadows simply expands this genre in a funny and modern way and sorry Mel Brooks, these lads from New Zealand have done it better than Dracula: Dead and Loving it. Quite surely, this is a time where more dreams can come true than before. I am glad that this film got crowdfunded so that it could get wider screenings in US but a lot of the world would probably still miss it. However, I will recommend it to those I know and would hope for a possible sequel. This is cult movie gold. You have made a fan today.",What We Do in the Shadows

""What We Do in the Shadows"" is a diamond in the rough. It's a truly fun film to watch. It relentlessly pokes fun at the Hollywood clichés about vampires, films like the ""Twilight"" series, and clichés throughout the horror genre.A BIG tip of the hat to Jemaine Clement and Brett McKenzie for making such a great film. I really loved the soundtrack. It fits the film perfectly.This is a great movie to watch when you want a good laugh at something that's off the beaten path from the usual comedy flick.

168,punishable-by-death,Unrelentingly funny,9,13 September 2014,"I wasn't sure about this one, I cannot remember anything about Flight of the Concords (sp?) and comedy is a sticky thing for me. I find that I laugh out loud more often during dramas, horror, thrillers etc than comedies. I thought GRAND BUDAPEST, ZERO THEOREM and THE DOUBLE were hilarious. But this surprised me... a lot.Blade, Twilight, Werewolves, Zombies, they all make an appearance. The plot is actually quite funny in itself... it isn't meaty by any means, but it is also a joke: as the documentary team follows three vampires 'flatting' together: one who is very... camp, shall we say, another who is self-described as being hot... because he is a vampire, of course, and another who seems like a satirical-take on your stereotypical long-hair/metal-head. Oh, and an 8,000 year old friend who doesn't seem to possess the skills of communication.They begin to talk the crew through how they try to socialise, which leads to some amusing scenes of vampires trying to have a nightlife. Then they talk the crew through how they capture/seduce people in order to drink their blood. More funny scenes follow, leading to one of these victims escaping from the flat. Of course he doesn't die, he becomes the new vamp in the gang. But.. He's young, he's stupid, he is not even over a hundred years old! When he introduces his human friend to his vampire friends, you just know its not gonna go well. I won't go any further, but from here the plot delves the movie into comedic chaos. I was missing jokes because I was laughing at the ones previous! There are no immature fart jokes here, there aren't any jokes that make you cringe in their lame delivery.... Even though they are throwing a lot of crud at the wall, most of it sticks. It is also filled with comedic variety. Physical humour, plain old slapstick, facial expressions/body language (especially that camp vampire who always leads the doco crew around, his facial expressions and eye-movements when following the cameras cracked me up every time), and obviously sarcasm and satire are underlying themes.This thing felt that it was running on all cylinders for the entire movie. It also manages to feel effortless; there was no sense of them trying too hard for laughs - the mockumentary setting helped the film in this sense, despite the plot being thin. But, the wide range of comedy used, from slapstick to satire and everything in between, is probably the biggest reason why this movie does not feel forced.I walked out of this movie in pain from laughter. After only 87 minutes! The entire place was in stitches for the entire movie, and I saw people from all ages as I walked out, all with giant grins, talking about this or that scene. I'm chuckling as I am writing this as its stimulating my memory and I am seeing it in my head.www.epilepticmoondancer.net",What We Do in the Shadows

I'm assuming this will be a cult classic as more and more people tap in to the odd yet effective humour of this soon to be vampire favourite. I won't spoil the ending but it's brilliant. The writing is very good and doesn't force the wit as some films tend to do. It allows the audience to absorb the subtle undertones of it's dry absurdity. The mockumentary shows the alternative universe of a motley crew of vampires doing their best to cope with everyday life in the 21st Century.Sure it's campy as heck, even silly at times yet it's a fun romp. Both unique and refreshing.I get the impression everyone involved in the making of this film is having a blast and that levity (pardon the pun) translates beautifully on screen.Well done!",What We Do in the Shadows
173,KieranSaosila,Hilarious Throughout,8,25 June 2021,"This completely subverted my expectations. After getting tastes of Taika Waititi's sense of humour sprinkled throughout Thor Ragnarok and JoJo Rabbit, this to me feels like the definitive Taika film and it's absolutely hilarious. The deadpan humour, relatable gags and performances themselves just blend to form a great comedy. The runtime could be a little tighter in my opinion as there is no intent, it's kind of just aimlessly wandering from joke after joke. Regardless it's near enough hilarious throughout if you enjoy this kind of humour.",What We Do in the Shadows

175,doofuspoofus,Love vampires? Then this will be hilarious to you,8,27 July 2015,"First I have to say the trailer for this film was put together nicely. It really high-lighted some of the funny parts but definitely not all. I love vampires and I love vampire movies so it was easy to see them poking fun at other films like Nosferatu, Interview with the vampire, and of course The lost boys. This film is definitely in the spirit of such films as Shaun of the dead and Dylan Dog but these guys picked up on what seems to be a new style of filming; the documentary type style.I thought it worked really great for this film and even made it funnier. The three main actors were fantastic and perfect for their parts, Stuart was a bit of a side character and I thought maybe the actor playing him was too old. It seemed weird the young kid they turned into a vampire would be friends with him. Also I thought the actor that played the young kid was a little bland at times. Not as present and into the roles as the others were.My main complaint is I wasn't too crazy about the set. The house looked way too old which I know is what they were going for but it looked more like the run down house from Fight Club than a sophisticated vampire pad. To end on a good note this movie was unexpectedly laugh out loud funny to me and any other fan of vampire films.",What We Do in the Shadows
176,ilikeweirdstuffs,It works. Kinda.,5,25 March 2019,"The concept is a fun one but leaves too much open. Nonetheless its a fun idea. Sadly the only fun thing i saw in the entire film before i had to stop watching it. The setting is too brutal to be ""realistic"". So much so that it calls the entire concept into question and makes jokes that would otherwise have worked fall flat. Its a great idea and the effort is visible but the acting is too much ""wink wink nudge nudge"" and tge atmosphere too uncomfortable.
It's not bad and all its parts are basically functional but it's too mundane for a horror spoof and too gruesome for a lighthearted comedy.In short: A lot of very good parts, decent acting, great concepts and ideas, and good humour are ruined by a dissonant and unimmersive tone",What We Do in the Shadows
177,timlittle,Werewolves not Swearwolves,10,5 November 2015,"This was something I stumbled across almost by accident and is one of the funniest films I have seen for years.The documentary style combines with absurd, macabre humour and brilliant comic acting performances to produce what I suspect will become a cult classic along the lines of Withnail & I and Spinal Tap.The story of a small group of vampires 'flatting' in the Wellington area of New Zealand, their back histories spoken to camera, and the lead up to the Unholy Masquerade result in some truly hilarious set- pieces and complications such as who is responsible for doing the dishes and how best to be 'invited' into the hottest nightclubs in the city on a night out. A couple of the cast members are known through their performances in 'The Flight of the Concords' but others were, to me at least, unknowns and all turn in masterful performances without exception.The music score is integral to the movie and used in a similar way to, say Pulp Fiction, in setting the scenes and adding polish. There are lines of dialogue that will become, if they're not already, classics to those in the know.This really is a laugh out loud, ludicrous movie. Hugely original and, I suspect, the result of a lot of hard work edited down to a marvellous feast of black comedy.",What We Do in the Shadows

It has a very clever script and all the actors do a great job at being straight- faced. I laughed out loud on many occasions because of its really well done gags on the vampire genre. This is a little gem and will be picked up by many. I hate vampire movies but this is a breath of fresh air from writers/directors Jemaine Clement, Taika Waititi. I think Hollywood will be calling on them because this is comic genius at work. Without doubt the best movie, for me, that New Zealand has produced.

This however succeeds with it's serious documentary style footage of what it's like to be a vampire.Twice while watching this, I started laughing out loud so much that I even had to pause the movie on one occasion.

At the film's outset, we meet Viago, a fastidious vampire who introduces his fellow flatmates to discuss the challenges of their shared ""living"" arrangements. Among their issues is the fact that Deacon hasn't done the bloody dishes for five years. Much of the film's humour is understated and deals with the more mundane aspects of vampire life. Although there is little in the way of plot, the documentary format serves as ample basis for the many satirical gags that pay homage to almost every theme in the vampire genre (Klaus Ming March 2015).",What We Do in the Shadows

185,victuki,Fun and fangs,8,15 December 2014,"""The Unholy Masquerade"" is a secret cult event, full of vampires, werewolves and other supernatural creatures that takes place in New Zealand. Only a few days before that, some vampires open the gates of their home for a documentary crew to follow their lives. Viago (Taika Waititi), Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), Petyr (Ben Fransham) and Vladislav (Jemaine Clement) are those vampires, and we shall see how they struggle with issues like being flatmates, doing the house chores and cope with modern day lifestyle; all of this is an overwhelming, funny and bloody adventure. Jemaine Clement is a well-known comedian from New Zealand, co-creator of ""Flight of the Concords"" (2007-2009), and also known as the villain ""Boris the Animal"" in the film ""Men in Black 3"" (Barry Sonnenfeld, 2012). He and Taika Waititi, seen as Ryan Reynolds pal in ""Green Lantern"" (Martin Campbell, 2011) direct this amazing and funny mockumentary. It is a fresh take on vampires, werewolves and else, who are out of time and out of place, misfits that are actually more human than those seen on more ""serious"" incarnations. However, there is a possible hiccup here, and it is its that New Zealand scent, that mysterious something the country and culture still has. Once you get immersed into it, there is no way back, you love it. That happens with the humor as well, and I recommend you to watch this and then have your word about it. It might not be a mainstream comedy, but it is funny to dead (or living dead).",What We Do in the Shadows

Stu was a great side character and I read that Stu is an actually IT on the set of the movie that didn't realize that his screen time was going to be in the final cut, which makes his character all the better.
I feel bad for Peter though, he didn't have to go out like that.

188,realmuthaf,Is this supposed to be funny?,2,18 January 2018,"So I reluctantly decided to watch this film, that had oh such good ratings from critics and audiences alike. What did I see?Well, level of production inferior to some of YouTube videos nowadays, for starters. Everything looks dirt-cheap with laughable effects and poor camera work. I read that the budget was 1.6 million dollars, yet it looks 1.59 million dollars cheaper.But it's not just about the looks, right? It's a comedy, after all, it's the writing that matters! Well unfortunately the jokes here are pure sh*t mostly. It's all dirt-cheap puns about how werewolves act like dogs, so they smell and run after sticks. Or how these guys are vampires, so they can't wear silver necklases as it burns, and they bite people. Oh wow, my belly just hurts so much from all the laughter. There's also some unnecessary vulgarity, which doesn't really help anything.The only reasons this was not a 1/10 are that were like 2 moderately amusing gags, and the whole thing lasts less than an hour and a half, so while it is a tedious bore, it's not as long as it could've been. I heard about this movie after its director and writer Taika Waititi (or whatever) was praised for ""bringing his charm and wit"" to Thor Ragnarok, which I'm yet to watch. Well if Thor Ragnarok has the same level of humor as this than it's likely also borderline unwatchable trash.After the credits one of the characters says something along the lines of ""You will forget the contents of this movie"".

This movie is not a technical marvel, however the make-up is very good. If you're looking for eye-popping cinematography, a moving score or Oscar-worthy acting, you won't find it here. The star of this film is the writing. It carries every scene, much like Christopher Guest's ""This is Spinal Tap,"" ""Best in Show"" and ""A Mighty Wind."" One such example was the thumping coffin lid - brilliant. Another was the May-December romance at the end.

The different personalities of all the flatmates drive some fantastic situation comedy. Basically these guys are all stunted at a maturity level somewhere in their 20's and they are vampires, and the jokes just play with that. ""The Beast"" is a running joke with a great payoff, won't spoil it but it was unexpected for me. This is the kind of movie where the low budget works in its favor, buckets of obviously fake blood and stiff costumes just make everything funnier. Definitely recommended.",What We Do in the Shadows
192,IanAJohnson,This film was hilarious and unique.,7,2 March 2015,"What We Do in the Shadows is a low-budget, horror comedy about a small group of vampires that live in an apartment together in modern day New Zealand. The plot focuses on how these vampires adapt to a new vampire joining their group. The four initial vampires consist of Deacon, Petyr, Viago and Vladislav. Each of these vampires come from drastically different backgrounds and range from a couple hundred to a several thousand years old. This variety in backgrounds allows the characters to be very unique and it makes their interactions funny and interesting. This movie has one goal and one goal, only: the make you laugh. The plot is not very deep and can sometimes lack flow, but the jokes are consistently funny so you really don't care. The film is shot like a documentary. Characters will occasionally talk to the camera similar to Modern family or the Office. The quick cuts and explanatory dialogue allows fantastic comedic timing. The special effects are low budget but are most of the time done very well. Some of the camera tricks are very impressive and make the scenes feel quite real. The flying effects are quite poor, though. It is obvious that the actors are just suspended by wires. This might seem like a negative, but the way it is portrayed on screen makes it quite hilarious. There are a couple of brief action scenes which are done well enough. The chases can get quite shaky, though. This is a rated R film, but the graphic material was handled very well. There are a few f-words, but they are rare enough and used to appropriate places most of the time. The blood is so over-the-top and silly that it didn't bother me at all. If there is anything that would be extremely graphic, it is blurred out. I wasn't expecting much when entering the theater, but I left thoroughly entertained. If you want to laugh and if don't care that the plot is somewhat irrelevant then you will have a blast.",What We Do in the Shadows

I didn't laugh once, not even a giggle. 95% of it is filmed inside a dark house which just adds to the dreariness of it all. It's slow and I can't see it going into cinema release in the states.

The jokes where brilliant and more importantly, they were frequent and consistently brilliant. I loved the interaction of the main characters with each other and the supporting characters.Each of the main vampires had their moments and were all equally funny. The movie even had werewolves and they were also hilarious. I was also surprised by the special effects which were really well done.At one point it did feel like the jokes were getting old, but just as I had finished that thought, the movie changes and ends brilliantly. Even though there isn't much of a story, it doesn't really matter for this movie. Just watching some of the hilarious chaos that ensues in their everyday life is enough.There are not many movies that make me actually laugh out loud, but this one did on several occasions (usually comedies, even great ones, just keep me grinning through out).

199,film316-125-427677,An Interview With A Vampire,10,13 March 2015,"Documentaries are a difficult format because they will always, always be criticized, in some format or way someone will find fault with them. That's why it's always better and more fun to make a mockumentary, and this is where we find What We Do In The Shadows, a spoof documentary about a set of vampires in New Zeland who are flat sharing, so I suppose the reel question is will this have me howling From Dusk Till Dawn or will it just feature Lost Boys?It's an obvious statement to make but vampires have been around a LONG time in cinema, and we have seen many different interpretations of them from Nosferuatu, to the Bram Stoker's Dracula and now modern age of Twilight. They are probably the 3 hall marks of Vampire films, but there are so many more; 30 Days Of Night, Underworld, Daybrakers and Blade are just a few of the movies that people quickly forget that still have vampires as a main feature, and in the past if we are honest with ourselves all we have ever really seen is spoof films of other Vampire movies, The Fearless Vampire Hunters and Darcula Dead And Loving It are two that leap instantly to mind, but that's where What We Do In The Shadows is strongest, because it's not a spoof of another movie, it is it's own film that makes jokes about vampires as a whole and not just one plot strand.The principle of having a film crew follow vampires around is funny all on it's own but once you start mixing in well thought out characters, jokes that have pace and a story that develops perfectly you get a movie which all on its own can stand up and be counted as classic. The movie is written and directed by Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement.Jemaine is one half of The Flight Of The Concords and Taika is a man who wrote many of the episodes for them as well as chunks of The Inbetweeners. I think that sort of inner madness and logic that is clear in The Flight Of The Concords TV show spills over into What We Do In The Shadows, there are so many off beat unpredictable moments that you can't help but laugh at them all.It's true I could pull out sections of the film and highlight them as funny but what would be the point in that? However I will give you a small measure of how clever the film is, there is a sequence in which the trio are preparing to go out on the town, however because they have no reflections they have to sketch each other so they can see what outfits work and don't. It's that sort of clever overlooked humour which is imbedded into What We Do In The Shadows.What We Do In The Shadows is a witty, clever, funny comedy which is far superior to most of the main stream trash we have to suffer in cinemas.",What We Do in the Shadows

It's so smart, the plot and storyline are simple but clever, it makes you want to know more about the characters and their lives (wait, they're undead, so it's supposedly 'deaths'). Each character gives more life to the story, their relationship is lovely. It actually portrays the basic basic things in life, but because it's another world, it becomes interesting. However, also thumbs up to the execution and packaging of the idea, it won't be as interesting if it's not done well. The documentary style, the dialogue, the whole of it is just nice to be followed.

203,skyminster,New Zealand's comedy masterpiece,9,23 May 2016,"Co-written by Jermaine Clement and Taika Waititi, this is one of the better comedies I've seen; or at least the best mockumentary I've seen. What is the biggest achievement for this film, though, is probably that it isn't far off Tongan Ninja when it comes to how funny it is.It's all bloody ridiculous (in a very literal sense, and yes, I did use this joke in my tweet last night). The fact that they're vampires with a lust for blood in New Zealand symbolises exactly what is ridiculous about the film, as it's a very nonchalant atmosphere in a little overshadowed country (what overshadows it? Tonga), and they're there as blood sucking vampires trying not to get their sofas messy when they feed on their prey and having flat meetings and such.It's like if Flight of the Conchords was set in a vampire mansion in Wellington — and who doesn't want that? I know I want much more of it, because it is bloody funny. From the ghost cup to the beast and to the reason behind drinking virgin blood, it's full of gags, while its nonchalant (yes, I'm using that word again) humour comes to life when blood explodes everywhere and ol' Viago's (Taika Waititi) getting all distressed about it. I mean, I don't know why I even tried to review this film. It's just really, really stupid; but it's really, really great at the same time. See, that's all I needed to say.Well, I guess I'll say more. The writing and the concepts aren't the only things good about the film. Everything else is also bloody brilliant. The casting, for one, is perfect. Jermaine Clement is about as funny as he usually is, and he along with Jonathan Burgh and Cori Gonzales-Macuer symbolise that unbothered approach the film takes – but horrifically sadistic at the same time — blood and guts are always a nice addition, of course. The documentary style also works well for it, as if it was any other way I don't think it would work.In conclusion, What We Do In the Shadows is an odd film, but a very funny, very well written and probably very memorable film, and one of the best comedies I've seen. Although it might not be quite as quotable as the glorious Tongan Ninja, and the feeling when someone is being preyed on by vampires and you're in hysterics does get a little weird, if there's anything New Zealand should be proud of, it is this.",What We Do in the Shadows

205,Absalom1991,A Perfect Film,10,15 August 2015,"I won't belabor it. Others have traced the plot.SImply, this film perfectly fulfills its premises and accomplishes brilliantly what has seemed, over the years, to have become impossible: a loving send-up of the vampire/horror genre with invention, wit, and intelligence with genuine, creative novelty.Performances are lovely and as an ensemble piece the actors seamlessly present a fictive world and community that are both drearily contemporary and timeless. I would go out of my way to see any of the three lead actors in other roles. They are wonderful.The screenplay is hilariously clever. Cinematography and editing keep to the mock-documentary premise while aping horror conventions and at times providing genuinely creepy touches. Set design is smartly tawdry and special effects judiciously convey a professional gloss while remaining aligned to the low-end, indy feel of the work.Every element of the film is in place.

206,minorxml,Goes right to where it should be,10,24 May 2015,"Ah mockumentairies. This one really is great taking a group of old style vampires living together in a flat.

Well of course at the flat meeting where they are talking about those classic things like who takes out the trash or who has to do the dishes. They have a friend who brings them visitors to feed upon as after all a vampire needs to drink blood. And one day one of those ends up to be turned himself. With his modern insights their life changes and they get more contacts with the outside world. Yet equally this causes danger to the secrecy of it all. I won't tell more as you really should see this movie. But it is great fun for those who have seen movies and read books with the old vampire archetypes.

Vampires are an old favorite of mine and it was great being able to laugh at the day-to-day lives of five vampires. I loved how Deacon was so casual about how Petyr turned him into a vampire, to the point where they had been living together for who knows how long. I also loved Vladislav's backstory - not about his ex, but about how badass he used to be. Viago was of course just a goofball. This film had me laughing throughout, I would definitely recommend it.",What We Do in the Shadows

209,theSachaHall,A Wickedly Entertaining And Bitingly Clever Trip To The Long White...Vampire,9,17 November 2014,"Don your crucifix and come take a hilariously unholy trip to Wellington, New Zealand where you will meet four of the most dysfunctional yet intriguing beings of the undead. There's Viago (Taika Waititi) who, at 379 years old, still struggles to get out of his coffin when woken by his alarm at 6:00; Vlad (Jermaine Clement), an 862 year old hypersexual incubus who has a soft spot for torture and debauchery; Petyr (Ben Fransham), Count Orlok's long lost 8000 year old brother, and Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), the rebellious bad boy and baby of the family at 183. That isuntil Petyr accidentally bites local hipster Nick (Cori Gonzalez- Macuer).Written and directed by Clement (FLIGHT OF THE CONCORDS) and Waititi (GREEN LANTERN), WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is a wickedly entertaining and bitingly clever mockumentary about the pleasures and pitfalls of vampires living together in a modern world. Each scene is a testament to their wit and demands your attention such as the flatmate meeting between Viago, Vlad and Deacon in which the latter is confronted about not pulling his weight when it comes to washing dishes. After Vlad exclaims that Deacon has 'not washed the dishes for five years', Viago concurs 'that it is unacceptable to have so many bloody dishes all over the bench' just as the scene cuts to an image of an over-flowing sink piled high with bloody crockery. Equally funny is the scene in which the vampires get dressed up for a night on the town and reflect upon their personal styles from Viago not knowing what he looks like due to their lack of a reflection to Vlad deadpanning directly to the camera of his 'dead but delicious' look.The pace at which the pop-culture vampire barbs and homages flow is counter-balanced nicely by the plot's simplicity and minimalist special effects (the bat scene is well done). Likewise, there is a nice juxtaposition between the rich and stylised costuming settings that are somehow hauntingly delicate and the childlike whimsy of the characters within the frame. Even their clichéd supernatural friends (werewolves, zombies) and Vlad's ex- girlfriend a.k.a the beast are uncomplicated characters with amusing one-liners. With just the right balance of comedy and horror, this is a bloody fantastic film figuratively and literally and definitely worth watching. You may even have to see it twice to make up for the moments you missed whilst laughing too hard.You can catch me at my handle and at The Hollywood News.",What We Do in the Shadows

The movie is filed with brilliant homages and references to vampire films such as 'The Lost Boys', 'Twilight' and 'Let The Right One In'.The directorial style is very similar to the hit TV show 'The Office' as it is able to create humour in the realism and personal interviews and monologues. This method also allows it to be genuinely scary at times such as when we meet the housemate inspired by 'Nosferatu'.

215,jeffdrollins,"Good, but never reaches its full potential",7,10 February 2015,"There's a filthy, lived in authenticity to the afterlives of the vampires who serve as the subjects of What We Do in the Shadows, the New Zealand comedy-horror mockumentary from writers-directors Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement. If you're at all familiar with these names then you've had your ear to the ground of the irreverent indie comedy circuit of the past decade. Clement is one half of the popular HBO musical- comedy duo Flight of the Conchords and Waititi has enjoyed critical success with his films Boy and Eagle VS Shark, the latter of which Clement co-starred in. Their unique comedic voices seem like a perfect fit to bring a strange project like What We Do in the Shadows to a niche audience but breaking through to the mainstream may prove difficult.What We Do in the Shadows introduces its simple premise at the start: a documentary crew has been granted access to film the lives of four New Zealand-based vampires in the months leading up to the annual Unholy Masquerade Ball. Waititi stars as the group's defacto leader, the delightful dandy, Viago. He shares a house with Vladislav (Clement) – a centuries old count in the vein of Dracula, Deacon – a relatively young vampire and self-described ""wild card"" of the group, and Petry – an 8,000 year old abomination that pays homage to Nosferatu's Count Orlok with his grotesque appearance and preference to hiss and growl rather than deliver dead-pan observations on his night-to-night lifestyle. Viago, Vlad, and Deacon are fun to hang out with, especially when there's a squabble over chores (dishes gone unwashed for five years), but it's Petyr who steals every scene simply by sitting there looking hideous and out of place.A monkey wrench is thrown into the gears when a potential victim, Nick (played by Cori Gonzalez-Macuer), is instead turned vampire by Petyr and moves in with the group. There's a general dislike for the newcomer by our undead heroes and the film uses that as its principle plot thread. But there's much more to What We Do in the Shadows including a subplot about Deacon's female servant who longs for eternal life, Viago's long lost love of his youth, Vladislav's cuckolding at the hands of his greatest nemesis referred to only as ""The Beast"" and the added confusion of Nick's best friend Stu, a human the entire gang likes a whole lot more than Nick. Throw into this a rival group of werewolves and the Undead Masquerade Ball we've been teased and you'd think, ""this sounds like one hell of a movie!"" That's what I thought going in, but there are myriad issues with the whole of What We Do in the Shadows.The numerous subplots in this film tend to unfold in a linear fashion which immediately made me wish I was watching a television series based on this very movie where self-contained episodes could explore these interesting ideas more thoroughly. That the entire cast of characters is so interesting actually works against the overall plot of the film which ultimately becomes less interesting and unsatisfying just for taking us away from what we want to see in an effort to usher the film along. In short, I want to get to know more of these characters and the movie just won't allow it.Of course, the biggest issue with What We Do in the Shadows has more to do with unfulfilled promise. There are some incredible sight gags (vampires fighting in mid-flight, over the top gore that recalls Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and a lot of hilarious make-up and character designs), but most of the traditional setup and punchline jokes fall flat. There aren't any groaners here but I didn't find myself belly laughing at a single joke in this film and, for a comedy, that's disappointing. Often times I find myself nodding and thinking, ""Oh, I can see why that's funny,"" but that doesn't really count as being legitimately funny; there are more echoes of comedy in What We Do in the Shadows than actual comedy.Still, with its imaginative visuals and fascinating characters, What We Do in the Shadows is certainly worth visiting, if only to see it firsthand and wonder what might have been. I'm not accusing anyone involved with this film of incompetence or lack of ability; just the opposite, in fact. What We Do in the Shadows is a hair under 90 minutes long, the perfect length for your standard comedy. But there's nothing standard about this film and it may have benefited from padding its run- time so as to more fully flesh out these characters and the world they inhabit. Better yet, as mentioned before, I'd have loved to watch this film unfold over several 20-minute episodes on cable. There's no use being angry at Clement and Waiti for the missed potential of What We Do in the Shadows. After all, they're only human.",What We Do in the Shadows

The satire found throughout was well executed, and it felt that no stone was left unturned in its analysis of the vampire mythos.Being a mockumentary, everything was done right and explained, and a feeling of realism emanated as the movie progressed.

The actors try their best at deadpan comedy, but the timing and absurdity just isn't there. The film is a series of long, boring jokes where you can see the punch line coming from a mile away, falling flat when it finally and mercifully arrives. Then the film starts setting up for the next joke and it you start checking your wristwatch to see how much is left before the credits start rolling.The project is an interesting idea, just not executed very well. Forgive the pun, but I don't think they really sunk their teeth into the topic. The bit about not being to use a mirror was promising, but it went on too long and never went past the obvious jokes. The most obvious logical questions never get asked: why aren't all those victims noticed? what do they do for money? how can they go centuries without updating their wardrobe or learning anything from the modern world? The overall pacing and direction struck me as aimless and flabby, maybe not a surprise for what is an exercise in improvisation, but just shows how difficult that medium can be to perform well. Finally, I also thought the explicit gore, while infrequent, really disrupted the comedic tone. Someone else noted that this might have been an effort better limited to a short film rather than a feature length project and I'd agree. A one-joke premise not all that well done to start with and stretched far past the breaking point.",What We Do in the Shadows
227,minch007,masterpiece of kiwi humor,9,2 January 2015,"no-one does dry, self-deprecating ironic humour like the kiwis. Its a unique blend of taking oneself too seriously, trying to be cool in very awkward, self-conscious way (because its not cool to try to be cool)resulting in apparently accidental absurdity known as ""being a dick"". A vampire mockumentary is a brilliant vehicle for this kind of humour, as vampires are supposed to have an undead, hypnotic kind of glamour which can easily be camped up without seeming to do so deliberately. The scenes where the vamps are trying to decide what to wear for a night on the town without being able to see their own reflection is a perfect example of this. This comic ethos also explains why mortal Stu is so popular with the vamps...he's very cool because he's not trying to be cool at all to the point of having no personality. Ironically he's a total nerd.Flight of the Conchords' Jemaine Clement (as Vladislav the Poker)and Rhys Darby (as the leader of the werewolves) steal every scene they're in. Rhys' attempts to prepare the werewolves for their monthly transformation without losing their trousers whilst facing off with the jeering vampires results in side splitting chaos.

It's funny, but the jokes don't barrel you over repeatedly, they give you enough time to have your laugh over one joke before going to the next. There's a fair amount of drama and action, but its important to the plot, and builds up interesting tension before the climax. Everything in this movie is very well strung together, beautifully acted out, and I fell in love with most all of the characters before the movie even came to the halfway point. The ONLY negative side I could ever give to this movie was that it felt so short, and I was left wishing it could last just a little longer, even if the movie already is 90 minutes. But they added in everything they could, it was all that was needed to impress and I can heartily say that anyone who hasn't seen this movie is missing out on a lot of fun.Movie warnings: It contains gore, mild/moderate horror themes, sexual innuendos, blurred-out nudity, violence, and plenty of cursing, so this movie is probably not for children.

The humor ranges from crass, bloody and black to simple puns, hysterical visuals and the very odd and very awkward situation. The acting is spot on and inventive.

I felt myself giggling at almost every scene, while there is one point in the middle of the film it feels like the jokes are getting a bit old and repetitive but it quickly bounces back with more fresh humour.Some people say that the mockumentary format does not work I believe that the mockumentary cinematography style of this film adds to the originality and flare of this film, which makes it even more interesting.I thoroughly recommend this film as it is one of the most original and funny comedy films I have seen since the Grand Budapest Hotel.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/",What We Do in the Shadows

I haven't seen such a fantastic comedy film that's been done in documentary style since Surfs Up! We follow the lives of four Romanian vampires, Viago, Vladislav, Deacon and Petyr sharing a flat together in the Te Amo suburb of Wellington, New Zealand. They take great joy in showing us around their flat, revealing how they became vampires and occasionally sharing their arguments with their flatmates in front of the camera crew about who's turn it is to do the dishes. The three who can function much like humans, (Petyr is more of a monster of the night) go out every night to nightclubs and parties usually bringing home victims to feast upon. We see that there are more than a few pockets of vampires living within the community, such as two young girls who look 10 and 12 but are really over 100, who come out every evening to ""prey on perverts,"" by luring them to their doom. Nick an 18 year old is amongst those chosen to become the trio's victims one night, however just as he figures out what's going on, he tries to escape and ends up being bitten by Petyr, making him a vampire who then follows Viago, Vladislav and Deacon on their nightly activities. Nick finds being a vampire far TOO comfortable, going off flying, or partying or levitating or changing into a bat. The other three soon take interest in his human friend, Stu holding back their desire to bite him. The film plays out exactly like a vlog or documentary but it's FAR from the cheesiness of the found footage genre. There are Interviews, back stories, unexpected events, little cards saying 2 months later as ""filming had to be postponed after Nick was bitten."" There is also a sense of realism, if there were vampires out there they make it as real or convincing as possible.There is another community full of werewolves who are all geeky, clean, polite and travel in a pack, that usually get into gang fights with the vampires who cat cal' them-""Why don't you go home and lick your balls!"" To which the werewolves respond, pointing at the full moon, ""Not tonight please, do you know what time it is?!"" The special effects are ASTOUNDING. They are not too over budget or under budget, and most of the time the scene they are required in is hidden by darkness. The blood looks as real as it should, but it's funny-gory not horror gory. The greatest were one of the vampires turning into a bat and the transformation of the werewolves from men to beasts. Speaking of Beasts, it is hilarious for such a brooding, dark gentleman like Vladislav who constantly lies in his bed in a state of fear and loathing, talking about a creature he has encountered in his after life, ""I have seen the Beast,"" who later is revealed to be his ex-girlfriend Pauline. There is also some humour between Deacon and his servant, a human named Jackie who is in charge of bringing in new victims because it could reward her with immortality. Deacon constantly promises that he will bite her, but she is still left a human cleaning blood off the floor. This is a film that shows the true nature of vampires (keeping in mind in this Universe they are real) NOT the sparkling idiots of Twilight. These vampires seem like the old counts. Genuinely dark and badass. I loved this film and it's characters and i swear you will laugh so hard your fangs will fall out!",What We Do in the Shadows
239,cameron_straughan,"The chore wheel, trying to get past bouncers, and improving household safety - life is tough for vampires",6,11 July 2015,"What comes to mind when you hear the words ""New Zealand""? If you are thrilled by the overstated, perhaps director Peter Jackson springs to mind; he is rather popular. But fans of the understated may well favour Flying Nun Records, The Chills, Split Enz or New Zealand's greatest comic export - Flight of the Conchords.Fans of Flight of the Conchords will rejoice at the arrival of What We Do in the Shadows, an awkwardly named but highly acclaimed horror comedy / mockumentary. Flight of the Conchords cast an absurd, often surreal look at the day-to-day activities of two flat-sharing New Zealanders trying to make it in New York's music scene; the deliberate misspelling of ""Conchords"" suggests that each chord is part of an absurd musical con. What We Do in the Shadows casts a similar eye on the daily mundanities of misfit vampires sharing a flat. The film stars Jemaine Clement and Rhys Darby. The omission of fellow Conchord Bret McKenzie (now an Academy Award winning composer) is somewhat alleviated by the addition of Taika Waititi, who wrote and directed some Conchords episodes. Recent interviews with Clement suggest a Conchords reunion is more likely than Peter Jackson directing a sequel to his Meet the Feebles - a twisted take on the Muppets. Apparently, a Flight of the Conchords reunion tour, featuring new material, is a possibility for late 2015. The Holy Grail for die-hard fans - the Flight of the Conchords movie musical - is still being discussed.Despite the tired mockumentary structure, What We Do in the Shadows succeeds via comic DNA inherited from the Conchords. Shared traits include juxtaposition of the mundane with the fantastic; droll, deadpan delivery; and a genuine affection for naive, somewhat innocent outsiders and eccentrics trying to make it in an alien environment. The latter may stem from the perception of New Zealanders - as satirized on the Conchords - as isolated, struggling for significance and behind the times. Of course, New Zealand really is isolated, which probably explains why Clement and Waititi's humour usually revolves around outsiders trying to assimilate into a new environment. However, their shared affection for outsiders may also be attributed to their part-Maori upbringing, affording them unique perspectives on the land and the people around them.In Shadows, the eccentric outsiders are flatmates Viago, Deacon, and Vladislav - three vampires trying to make it in the modern metropolis of Wellington, New Zealand. They face a variety of seemingly insurmountable hurdles including paying rent, adhering to the chore wheel, trying to get past bouncers, and improving household safety. Lesser trials and tribulations include being immortal, feasting on human blood and battling fashion-challenged werewolves. Further trouble arises when flatmate Petyr, the old-school Nosferatu of the group, turns unreliable hipster Nick into a vampire; it's up to the guys to show him how to be a proper vampire, while not attracting attention to their existence. Nick's human friend, Stu, challenges the vampire's world view; in a key scene, they decide not all humans are bad (only 98% of us are no good) and fight to protect him from other bloodsuckers.The film has been met with almost unanimous critical praise, and it's not difficult to see why. It's the quiet, understated moments that really shine - and there are many of them. Clement, in particular, is in fine form; his slow, careful approach - favouring silence over ostentation - combined with his smooth, deadpan Transylvanian delivery kept me chuckling. On the other hand, some attempts to build up to more elaborate comic payoffs fell into cliché and obviousness; for example, a costume ball for the living dead didn't live up to its potential. To some degree, these minor concerns are due to the over-familiar mockumentary format. A few minor quibbles aside, this is a must-see for fans of quirky comedy and, needless to say, for fans of Flight of the Conchords ... ""It's business. It's business time.""",What We Do in the Shadows

If you liked either of those then you will definitely enjoy this. It's definitely quirky! There is some great dialogue backed up by some nice visual touches as well. My only complaint is that it's slightly too long to keep the humour level high, it probably could have been trimmed by 10 minutes to make the whole thing tighter. However, I really enjoyed it despite my minor niggle above. It might have been better on the small screen but who am I to argue with the ""New Zealand Documentary Board""?

248,niqstar,A Matter of Humor,5,13 January 2015,"The first minutes reminded me a lot of American Zombie, a not-so-recent zombie mockumentary, there is also the 2010 Belgian vampire mockumentary called Vampires, so the entire concept didn't seem as new to me as it apparently did to others. In fact the whole formula seemed a little superimposed, it adds up to ""here are three guys that live together AND they are vampires"". Many jokes are taken from roommate/college-night-out situations and translated to vampires, with only a handful of laughing out loud moments in the entire movie. However, after a clumsy start, it became progressively interesting to see how they handled and presented certain occult myths - sadly we never get far beyond pop culture occultism. The production value is in no way detrimental to the comedic quality of the movie and the acting is all around quite solid. In the end it is, as often the case with comedy, a matter of taste. I certainly hope you are able to get more laughs out of this than me. Give this movie a go if you are interested in vampires/occultism and if the humor resonates with your taste you'll have a blast.",What We Do in the Shadows
249,Anj-Avraam,Sanguinous hijinks,4,1 June 2016,"This upbeat and fairly risible mockumentary follows a group of vampire bachelors as they attempt to cope with the pressures of modern day living. Set in Wellington, New Zealand - which apparently has quite a thriving undead scene - the film's main subjects are vampires from different eras who have been housemates for a long time and whose shared taste for blood has kept their friendship alive, even if they do have slightly different ways of seeing the world.The dynamic between the group shifts when Petyr, the eldest of the housemates (played by Ben Fransham) turns one of their intended victims into a vampire. With a lot to learn and new urges and powers to gain control of, this new friend (who I've kept anonymous to mitigate the spoiler), is reluctantly taken in, and with him, a link to the present day mindset and the advantages that up-to-date technology can offer.The film succeeds in showing that each of the characters has their own personality. Vladislav (Jemaine Clement) is supposedly an evil tyrant who used to enjoy 'poking' his victims, but he's actually shy and introspective, which kind of works pretty well; Petyr is thousands of years old and is more the classic, Nosferatu-type vampire - he doesn't speak but his presence is fearsome; Deacon (Jonny Brugh) is complex, slightly insecure, a bit of a user, a bit of a manic depressive - which makes his character surprisingly believable. Jackie (played by Jackie Van Beek) is his disgruntled familiar, who must obey her vampire master's every command, hoping one day to receive the reward of eternal life through being bitten. Then there's Viago (Taika Waititi), a more reserved and fussy if not slightly staid vampire who nevertheless embraces the experience of being followed around by the documentary crew.One of the great things about this film is that it manages to have quite a unique take on the undead lifestyle. The werewolf pack for example: their dialogue and interaction - both amongst themselves and with the vampires - is fantastic. They are portrayed in a refreshing new way, as are the zombies.I would call What We Do in the Shadows a black comedy rendered in the style of a documentary or reality show. All the tropes of the genre are firmly in place, including repetitive cut-aways to ancient-looking etchings and paintings. This actually helps the film to progress its narrative and it keeps the audience rooted in the parody mindset, so I would say it works well.I actually rated most of the actors, considering most of them were new faces to me. Stu Rutherford plays himself and is totally believable. On the other hand, I found Taika Waititi's acting a bit forced in a couple of places. I'm not knocking his work ethic, obviously. He and Jemaine Clement not only acted in but wrote and directed What We Do in the Shadows.All things considered, this is an amusing, easygoing film that, if you're into the theme, is most definitely worth a watch; there are genuine laugh-out-loud moments and it's different enough to be worth an hour and a half of any film buff's time.I just fail to see how it's been scored over 7 by the community, because I like to take all things into consideration when I review a film, and try and let the facts speak for themselves. There are things that knock it down from having that kind of score, I reckon. Fairly obvious things. There's believability: for example, Viago is over 700 years old but apparently still hasn't worked out how to feed properly - I mean, this doesn't make him funnier as a character, to me; maybe it's meant to but the way it's done it seems more like a goof. Then there's the soundtrack, which is pretty dismal. Then I wonder, am I going to recall scenes of this film for years to come, am I going to quote it to my friends? At the time of writing, the IMDb score for this film is [7.6]. That's exactly the same score An American Werewolf In London currently has: exactly [7.6]. So... What We Do in the Shadows is exactly as good a film as An American Werewolf In London, is it? Not in my opinion - in fact a much stronger, more succinct phrase springs to mind (but I will try to restrain myself, like when you have that shameful urge to eat your best friend).In my system, What We Do in the Shadows gets [4.4].",What We Do in the Shadows

Its not a horror film or anything the title might suggest. Waititi once said in an interview at the festival de Cannes, that they just tried to make it as funny as possible. And the amazing thing is that it doesn't feel like some one is trying to hard to be funny. Its a very well balanced firework of subtle gags. It captures you from the start.

An outrageously surreal contrast between the normal streets of Wellington, New Zealand, and the very atypical selection of undead –– including Werewolves, Zombies and Vampires, oh my! The film crew follows the lives of Viago (Taika Waititi), Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), and Vladislav (Jemaine Clement) as they look for their necks victim. Their comedic timing, and performances will leave you in stitches. The camera work is emblematic of the genre, and although some may find it distracting, it rings true in this context. The duration only adds to the overall positive experience of this society- relevant satiric comedy. Almost like an inside-out horror production, it has an abundance of comedy with horror relief, so to speak.

So the mere fact that this film feels fresh and leaves me wanting more is more than a poke, yes there is more than a poke, in the right direction. Great performances by all, apparently a lot of it is improvised but the script is well versed in vampire lore and flatting mannerism, nicely produced and well paced. New Zealand seems to have a talent for comedy horror. Peter Jackson's Brain Dead is perhaps the pinnacle and this from Taika Waititi and Jermane Clement is close on it heels.

If you liked Tucker and Dale Fight Evil (or you you like the trailer and the kiwi humor/accent), check it out. It gave the vampires individual personalities, one of whom was quite sweet-hearted.

This movie is truly hilarious, a unique humour that needs to be watched. It is about a group of vampires who live together in Wellington, New Zealand, who have a documentary crew follow them around showing us the inner workings of the lives of vampires, unlike Interview with a Vampire (which i reviewed last month) it is hilarious. The Mockumentary shows the conflict and relationship between the Vampires, who range in age dramatically, and humans in the 21st century. These vampire flatmates are trying to overcome those everyday struggles of being immortal, and feasting on human blood. The age old problem of no matter how much suncream you may think could work, sunlight is a bit of an issue. The movie features them living life both as vampires and flatmates, trying to get into nightclubs, keeping up with the chore wheel and getting along all the time. The comedic execution in they movie is fantastic, with movies like this they can either way, but the cast did it so well. It honestly had me laughing throughout.

They are both very talented and Taika Waititi is one of my favourite directors, all the movies directed by him have his unique childlike feature which is fun to watch and uplifting. This movie is no different, the plot is kind of nonsense but in a cute way. The movie doesn't have a deep meaning to reflect upon, you could simply lay back and enjoy the movie. Its mockumentary style makes the vampires so relatable as if they were real and were your neighbour next door. This should attribute to the amazing actors, especially Taika Waititi, making vampires so believable. When he is interviewed in the movie, he acts awkwardly just like a normal person, who isn't used to the spotlight. The characters are all goofy and they act stupidly but you won't get annoyed. Some comedies try too hard to make you laugh and end up the character are being ridiculously stupid and unlikeable, but this isn't the case, their character's goofiness is so believable that you find their stupidity quite adorable.

These vampires are not mysterious, luxurious and dripping with sexiness. They have real emotions, weaknesses and quirks. It's got the low budget feel to it - the hand held camera, the poor lighting, the rundown sets - but the special effects are really well done. That makes the whole thing look pretty realistic. And it is packed with some pretty unexpected laughs. The film had me grinning the entire time and also had lots of laugh out loud moments, and I am not someone who is easily amused. It's not just the jokes that are funny, but maybe you will notice some weird detail in the background that will make you crack up.

The premise of vampire flatmates is absurd, but it works great, because the movie takes its characters just serious enough for the audience to be somewhat emotionally invested in them. The chemistry between the actors is also great. But of course, the biggest strength of the movie is, that it delivers laughs on a very consistent level. Seriously, there was probably a joke every minute, that made me laugh so hard, I cried.

From the awkward, tooth-baring grins of the first introductory shots, to the panicking werewolves trying to find the right tree or the combination for a padlock before the moon is up, this indy gem had me paying attention and chuckling the whole time. Yes, vampires are overdone. So what? This was a vampire movie we really haven't seen before, and that alone makes it special. Add in the quality of the humor and the decent visual effects, and it becomes more than special - it becomes (drum roll, please) A CANDIDATE FOR CULT CLASSIC STATUS. ""Bat fight! Bat fight!"" actually made me laugh out loud.If you're a fan of comedy, see this movie. If you're a fan of vampires, see this movie. If you're bored and want something unique, see this movie.

285,sukrit-kumar,My All-time Favourite Vampire Movie,10,4 May 2021,"Have you ever felt like an underdog, as if you live in the city, but no one knows who you are or how you live your life? Big city dwellers revel in their anonymity. That's what allows Viago, Deacon and Vlad to lead their arboreal lives, entertaining each other and hunting the next meal at a nightclub.The attention to detail is evident in the script and storytelling. As far as cinematography is concerned, you wouldn't be able to tell that this is a 2014 movie -- it seems at least a decade older. Most of the outdoor shots are in the dark, so there's a cooped-up feel to the movie. That's probably how the tech-oblivious 400 year old protagonists feel, too, sheltered in the shadows, concealing their secrets behind closed doors. It's a lonely life, a boring existence. That is, until rowdy but NZ-civil werewolves come a-howlin'.",What We Do in the Shadows

Almost immediately, we re-watched it twice with friends and I re-watched it once by myself. Now that doesn't happen often...At the moment that I write this review, the score is 7,6.

Don't trust the high ratings. Don't be fooled by praising reviews. This is a horrible movie. You won't laugh a single time in this ""comedy"" if you have at least some sense of humour.

Not being a fan of the horror genre, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was the other way around. In fact, I don't think it qualifies as a horror film on any level really, except for a couple of predictable jump scares.15 minutes in and I was thoroughly enjoying myself.The set design, costumes and imagery throughout this film are fantastic. The attention to detail and the sly nods to the whole genre in general is a treat.Unfortunately, the joke wears a bit thin after a while. The introduction of the werewolves was a nice break, but otherwise there is just too little material that has been stretched too far over the run time.In summary: a great idea, well executed for the most part, but a film that could possibly have benefited from being far more concise so as to not dilute the impact of the general concept.I want to rate it higher than 6, but 7 seems too generous.

293,hitesdru-162-442611,Bloody Good Fun,10,17 November 2014,"Though gouts of blood shoot from necks at times, this ""mockumentary"" is hilarious. The premise is that a documentary is being made on vampires and a group of flatmates agree gingerly to be the subjects of the film. Gingerly because there is always that pull to dine on humans and the filmmakers will be following them closely. It doesn't take long before the vampire roomies start bickering and nitpicking. They preen in front of the camera, trying to one-up each other as supreme vampire. They stalk their prey, sometimes very ineptly, competing for attention and time and again, making boastful statements that are merely wishful thinking. Jemaine Clement co-directs & stars with Taika Waititi. Clement uses the same sensibilities as he evinced in TVs ""Flight of the Conchords"". His character, though, is full of studly bravado, which hides an underlying insecurity that he works hard to keep from you. Waititi plays it gently and slightly effeminate, a foppish gentleman concerned with clothing & hair. Jonathon Brugh is the third roomie, a thin-skinned guy always taking offense and grating on others. The fourth is somewhat shy & retiring, as you'll discover yourselves.The vampire jokes come hot & heavy throughout the film. If you've seen some of the scores of vampire movies from the past, you'll delight in getting the inside jokes. However, you don't have to be an expert on bloodsuckers to enjoy watching this movie because it's bloody good fun.",What We Do in the Shadows

Comedies are always such an up in the air type of thing. I will say that I enjoyed it and wish I wouldn't have waited so long to watch it.I liked the generic look of the make up and costumes, I thought it just made it funnier and worked better for the movie than them trying to take a serious approach to the monsters. It is after all a comedy and not a horror film. I didn't expect much as far as the special effects go and they were terrible.

They're just so long, so I usually avoid them, try to watch 20 minutes TV shows, sometimes 45 minute, but movies, ugh, they're, like, 2 hours, I hate them. So I saw this movie on tumblr, I saw a bunch of gifs and though it was kind of funny and cute, so I googled it, found it in here and saw that there was only one hour and twenty-five minutes, and I thought that that was a good time for a movie. And you know, I didn't see the time pass, it was so fast, and I really wish it was longer, or that it had a sequel. The documentary style is what makes it so good I guess, the suddenly realization in the middle of the movie that there is a camera man there. I mean, the characters are so funny, the actors play their roles so well, the vampires are so different and even Petyr, an eight thousand years old vampire, is kind of cute. I truly love this movie, and I guess people just don't give it enough credit for being a comedy, even though it's really well made, and being different from those stupid parody movies of vampires with nonsense jokes.

What I got instead was this odd little mockumentary about vampires going about their daily (nightly?) lives while trying to sustain their existence surreptitiously. The film does suffer from some uneven pacing issues as well as dry humor that may not appeal to everyone, but I found the film ultimately enjoyable despite the fact that there may have been New Zealand-specific jokes and/or references lost on me.

They showed us how the gap of birth of being vampire can influence to their behavior, how if they're fight and suddenly flew up to the ceiling, how they really couldn't ate human foods and soon.

If you enjoy horror and the macabre, but are also tired of the weird pop- culture argument between the Gothic vs sparkly vampires, then you will really enjoy this. It takes the mockumentary genre to a different extreme where vampires room together in the real world and try to make connections and friends just as we all do. It shows the daily struggle of four vampire friends who have found themselves rooming in a flat together and their daily activities. They also have the familiar werewolf enemies, done in their own amazing mocking way. The best part is that, although this movie is clearly a comedy mocking the vampire movies which have come before, it doesn't lack story, and still pays particular attention to the makeup and effects. It reminds me of Shaun of the Dead in that way.Recommended for any fan of vampires, comedies, and fringe-movies.This one really thinks outside the coffin.",What We Do in the Shadows
303,mikeg-952-204749,Sometimes the scariest thing about being a vampire is doing the dishes,9,29 April 2014,"This fly-on-the-wall mockumentary is a refreshingly silly take on a genre that desperately needed sending up - vampires. If you thought vampire movies had reached saturation point, think again, because What We Do In The Shadows manages to lend it a thankfully comical bent. Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clement lead a solid cast of Kiwi actors playing a small group of inept but lovable bloodsuckers living in a flat together in Wellington. When a freshly turned convert starts bragging about his newfound vampire status while out clubbing, things start going wrong for the troupe, who until then had only to contend with minor problems like what to wear on a night out when your wardrobe is 400 years out of fashion, and how to go clubbing when nobody will invite you in the door. Vampire gags come thick and fast and there's enough of a solid plot to keep the movie entertaining. It even gets a little bit tense in places when the flatmates start to fall out over the new convert's bad behaviour. All in this is a very funny film, with more than a few classic one-liners. A great date movie to check whether your lover-to-be can handle a little dark humour. Highly recommended.",What We Do in the Shadows

I was finally able to watch the film, and it mesmerized from start to finish. They need to be able to give it more then 10 stars.I could not believe how fast the time went. The cast seems to work together as though they are all part of the same organism, and I was amazed and totally impressed that the film was almost completely improvised. Usually movies have highs and lows, but this one was a constant 10 on the Richter scale. The incredibly talented Kiwi cast also brought us Flight of the Conchords, Eagle Vs Shark and Boy. I kept hoping Stu would get turned so we could see him adjusting to being a vegetarian vampire, but alas the werewolves got him. Everyone loves a good BBQ, but poor Petyr! (Ben Fransham 30 Days of Night (2007) and Heavenly Creatures (1994)) The only thing I would have done differently was make it possible to a vampire to revert to any age they had already been so Viago and Katherine didn't look so odd lol. This was the BEST mockumentary I have ever seen, and i have crossed every body part hoping they do a sequel! My top quotes: Deacon: I think we drink virgin blood because it sounds cool. Vladislav: I think of it like this. If you are going to eat a sandwich, you would just enjoy it more if you knew no one had f*cked it. Vladislav: We're vampires, we don't put down towels.

This one, on the other hand is original and refreshing plus add to that THE HUMOR. I was constantly smiling while watching it, because the mocking part had been done really good.

For example the vampires are learning about the internet and social media. Vladislav is taught how to poke people on Facebook, ""Yes do it, let's poke her""! There's another scene where they have a house meeting to discuss chores and cleanliness. Viago comments on how he puts down towels and newspaper when killing his victims to not ruin the furniture. He expects the others to do the same.All of the actors have really done a great job getting into character; especially Taika Waititi as Viago and Jermaine Clement as Vladislav.For me the biggest problem with the movie is that there really is not much of a plot.

I honestly did not have a clue what to expect, but my god, i am so glad i watched it. This film is absolutely brilliant and the comedic genius behind the film is just so incredible. This film is a 'mock- umentary' which follows the life of 4 vampires and how they get along in their flatting situation. Vladislav, one of the main characters is perfectly portrayed by Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords, The BFG), all of his lines are expressed in such a tone that you cant help but fall in love with his wit and personality. Viago, portrayed by Taika Waititi (dir. Thor:Ragnarok), is again, expressed and acted in such a way that the comedic brilliance of the entire script just flows. This ingenious movie is one of my favorites and i 100% would recommend to anyone who has a good sense of humour, however, if you do not 'get' this movie, then I feel as though you may be reading in to it too much. Just watch and enjoy the film at face value and don't try and search for a deeper meaning, otherwise you will end up with nothing, apart from struggle.

From the awkward, but sympathetic 1700-century vampire Viago, to the desperately misplaced non-dead computer geek Stu that befriends the vampires, the characters all in their own way suck you into the world of old fashioned vampires in a modern New Zealand. The characters are so cleverly created and acted out that one and a half hour is far from enough time. This comedy/mockumentary really cries for someone to pick it up and carry it on as TV-series.",What We Do in the Shadows

I didn't realise it was a mockumentary until I began watching. I thought the story line was great and upon watching a second time I noticed a lot of other jokes I didn't get the first time around. It has to be the funniest film I've seen in ages! There is a bit of awkward humour like The Office so if u like that then u will probably enjoy this. Keep in mind it's not serious- it's about vampire flatmates being followed by cameras to see their day to day life. I think the less someone knows about this film the better it is.On a side note, I wish people would stop attacking others for liking films they don't in their reviews.

To me, unfortunately, it was the latter.The concept seems to be ""a day in the life of a few suburban vampires in Wellington, New Zealand"". It was kind of fun to see places I know on the movie screen, but that wore off pretty quickly. It's shot in the style of a bad B grade movie, which is really what it is... maybe it's C grade. The camera work probably came out just how they wanted it, in the style of one light on top of a camera. Visually it's not a great movie.The movie lacks a number of things... a plot, interesting characters, and interesting things happening. It was the worst movie I've seen this decade.If you love vampire movies, love bad B grade movies, and you know Wellington, you might enjoy this film.

The rich horror detail, extra blood and glorious darkness just add to the laughs. The ""historical"" and ancient vampire perspective just made it better. I am generally squeamish and have difficulty dealing with horror and suffering but this movie had just enough funny to get me through. Perhaps the familiar faces of Jemaine Clement and Rhys Darby helped me through.

I loved all three of the main characters and their interactions with Stu. I was laughing the whole way through this film which is continuously funny. I actually found some of the scenes to be quite frightening, especially when the vampires are chasing one of their victims through their home! This scene was one of my favourites. I don't think it needed to be a mockumentary though. Sometimes the shots were purposefully too long which felt unnecessary and just slowed the pace of the film. Some of the jolty, hand-held camera shots could be a bit annoying too. Otherwise, I loved it and definitely recommend it!

337,andrew-252-304196,Looking at vampires through new eyes,8,26 June 2014,"Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement seem to understand misfits. Waititi explored them in his first two films, Eagle vs Shark and Boy, and Clement's partnership with Bret McKenzie as Flight of the Conchords was an object lesson in not fitting in. Their early works were loved both here and abroad. Between them, Waititi and Clement have been nominated at the Grammys, the Emmys and the Oscars, hardly a pedigree to be sniffed at. I guess the domestic appeal of this is born of New Zealand being a strange little country down the bottom of the world, whose national bird doesn't fly, who dared stand up to the Americans and say ""No Nukes"", and which has been the backdrop for some of the hugest blockbusters of recent years. We're proud of our strangeness. The international appeal is perhaps due in part to the same thing, our unique individuality. I guess, coming from a pair of inveterate misfits, What We Do in the Shadows, an exploration of vampires who live among humans, but are intrinsically not living humans themselves, is a natural growth of themes already explored. As this film explores vampire tropes with fresh eyes, it gives, as well, a poignant look at the value of exploring past beliefs, hurts, losses and prejudices anew and seeing what can grow. As each of us age, it becomes easier to get stuck in our ways, how much more so for vampires whose age is counted not in decades but centuries. For Viago, Vladislav, Deacon, and Petyr there are many challenges. Viago faces the classic immortal's dilemma; his beloved growing old without him. Vladislav has a beast from the past which could rear its head again. Deacon faces the challenge of meeting a new generation and realising his own youth is slipping away. Petyr is growing ever more ancient, and is working to create a legacy. From these challenges come a fresh look at relationships between old enemies, at the cost of indiscretion, at unfulfilled promises and at the need to sometimes sacrifice your own desires out of genuine affection for another. This is a quirky film, slightly disjointed in places. But it delights in its lo-fi quirk right from the very 1970's looking ""New Zealand Documentary Board"" credit at the beginning. There's plenty of laughs to be had. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, it might be hard for some to follow, but there's entertainment to be found here for all. And now to the reviewer's bias. My grandmother, with whom I attended the Wellington première. Ethel Robinson assured me leading up to the movie that hers would be a very small part. It was, but it was a very necessary component part. And she filled it admirably, as did each of the performers in this piece. From the puzzled police, the frustrated familiar, the affable alpha-wolf, all the way to the venerable vampires themselves, no-one seemed out of place in this gentle comedy. Though it is about the undead, you can feel the warm heart beating below the surface of What we do in the Shadows, a film which will leave you thinking about vampires, and maybe about the world too, in a new way.",What We Do in the Shadows

With Low expectations prior to watching on a recommendation from a co-worker this film was an awesome surprise. Has been one of my favorites from the past few years. The idea for the film being about Vampires who live among us and them being filmed for a documentary was brilliant. The diary sessions aren't over done and really add to the characters. The comedy never lets up and allot is missed on the first watch. No worries though, You'll definitely watch it again and again.

This one is beyond amazing. Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi are still impressing with their work. The distinct characters of the vampires are hilarious. Many have been saying that it is mundane and lacks a thickened plot , however I saw that such an unfamiliar thing to document , such as vampires , doing such mundane activities is what added to this work. The elements of a documentary are very well done , and the ""historical"" pictures showing the vampires lives are amazing. From Viago , to Nick , to Peter , each character had me laughing and not wanting to end this whole experience.

Definitely a movie that gets funnier and funnier the more times you watch it. Just brilliant and witty and sweet and silly. But, you know, with vampires. With New Zealand accents. Another plus, this movie is short—about an hour and a half, I think. With the norm moving towards 3+ hours, it was a delight to not spend the entire evening in the theater.

In 'what we do in the shadows, although the actors are not well known, the production seems to be low budget, the result is excellent in my opinion mainly because of intelligent dialogs and brilliant ideas.

As I was watching it, it built me an interest on how vampires could live in this modern-day world, and this movie really fed my curious imagination. The jokes are really planted well on every line and the punchlines are really hilarious, and the best part is that each actor was able to carry his in- movie character. This is not a comedy movie of obvious physical pranks or any lame stupid lines of jokes. When you watch this movie, you're gonna laugh really good.

Jemaine Clement, Jonny Brugh, and Taika Waititi play vampires and Rhys Darby plays a werewolf and they all are so good.

We both enjoyed this film equally.From the opening scene to the closing credits, it is laugh out loud funny. It pokes fun at every part of the vampire mythology without resorting to simply being a parody of other movies.The film simply follows the life (if I can call it that) of four vampires of various ages sharing a run down flat in Wellington, New Zealand. It hilariously showcases the disadvantages of being a vampire from trying to see how you look when you have no reflection to attempting to get a bouncer to actually invite you in to a nightclub. Regrading the criticisms of the film quality, it is totally in keeping with the mockumentary style but should not be confused with the quality of the special effects. While there are no shots of super villains smashing up cities or firefights in deep space, the special effects are good enough to make you forget that they are special effects.",What We Do in the Shadows
356,dragongirlchina,Great movie for a Friday night with popcorn and some friends.,9,17 May 2017,"Not a spoiler:So basically, the movie is a mockumentary (a mock documentary) about a bunch of vampires living in an old house. The movie just follows them around exploring the town during the night and what vampires (and the undead) generally do during their spare time. They do interact with the camera (in terms of breaking the 4th wall), however it doesn't ruin the movie (I found) in any way.If you are expecting great cinematography then you're going to be disappointed, the entire movie is just humour, the effects are basic, but the story line is what makes this movie worth watching.It's a movie you'd watch with some good friends on a late night with some snacks just to have a good time. Slight spoilers below: ----- ------ ---- Spoilers ----- ------ ----The movie generally is humorous, and even the new young characters introduced don't remove any of that, especially since the old vampires suddenly have all these new views of the world (cellphones, Skype etc).We get brief glimpses/introductions about other undead creatures (zombies, werewolves etc). Though they aren't the main focus, but do add a little to the movie.I do feel we could've seen some more of Peter (<3), but generally this is a movie just meant to be enjoyed, not critiqued for not being the next Kill Bill or Charlie's Angels.",What We Do in the Shadows

It puts a rambling twist on the modern world with those usual fantasies, old legends, reality show culture and pure ignorance. Every line of the script with it's words and improvisation, is carefully sifted through the masterminds behind it and made to be pure gold.A simple line of letters can not even begin to describe this masterpiece as the picture has a punch after a punch as the seconds fly by.Words of suggestion: If you are looking for some comedy to rest from your long day, this is not for you. If you are looking for something to spike all the funny-cells in your brain, look no further.A true and utter diamond of the industry that faces no boundaries from time nor century.

359,lydiaskog,Good to watch with friends,7,14 September 2018,"Summary: 
This movie is a mockumentary movie about a group of 4 vampires called Deacon, Viago, Petyr and Vladislav. They are flatmates in New Zealand and they invite a documentary crew to film their daily activities that are very similar to our lives but with a vampire twist, like bringing people home from nightclubs to suck their blood, or going to undead festivals.. What I like: 
This is one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen. Normally I never laugh at movies, I just get amused, but this one I was laughing every few minutes, it's exactly my type of humour. 
The funniest moments only work with the expert delivery by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi who star in the movie as Viago and Vladislav as well as writing and directing it. If you told most of the jokes to someone they probably wouldn't get it but with the awkward pauses and absurdity that you see and hear in the movie, it makes you laugh every time.What I dislike:
The way that the story is structured it just seems like a series of skits with some connection in the story and personally I prefer stories with more of a plot. I would have also prefered if we got to see more of what the 4 main vampires lives where like in other time periods",What We Do in the Shadows

I do have a few problems with this movie concerning some small pacing or plot convenience problems but it is never anything that can take away your enjoyment of the film.

I am in love with each character, yes vampires, even these boys are sexy.SPOILER ALERT BEGINS HERE: I was sad to see Peter die.

The casting, acting, cinematography were perfect, and most importantly the dialogues were super funny, and I found them to be uniquely creative. The mockumentary style editing and cutting between scenes is very cleverly done, and I heard waititi and the crew took almost 14 months (waititi mentioned it in some interview but I'm not entirely sure whether its 14) to edit the movie.There may be some scenes showing a lot of blood, but they are also made hilarious.
